Lambda Diagrams are a graphical notation for closed lambda terms,
in which abstractions (lambdas) are represented by horizontal lines,
variables by vertical lines emanating down from their binding lambda,
and applications by horizontal links connecting the leftmost variables.
In the alternative style, applications link the nearest deepest variables,
for a more stylistic, if less uniform, look.
<p>

The following table shows diagrams of identity, the booleans, some standard combinators,
some Church numerals, the predecessor function on Church numerals, and Omega.

<table>

</tbody></table>
Curiously, the alternative Omega diagram somewhat resembles an (upside-down) Omega.
</p><p>
And here, on a larger scale, is a prime number sieve (alternative style): </p><p>
<img src="https://tromp.github.io/img/cl/primes.alt.gif">
</p><p>
which reduces to an infinite list of booleans that starts out as
</p><p>
<img src="https://tromp.github.io/img/cl/primebits.gif">

</p><h2>Dimensions and complexity</h2>

In terms of pixels, a diagram's width is one less than 4 times the number of variables
(vertical lines),
and its height is one more than twice the maximum number of nested abstractions and applications
(one less for alternaitve diagrams with multiple variables).
<p>
The size of the binary encoding of a term is closely related to
the graphical complexity: it is exactly twice the number of lines
plus the number of (4-way) intersections.

</p><h2>Reduction</h2>

Beta-reduction on lambda diagrams can be shown in several steps, as demonstrated in this reduction
from Y=λf.(λx.x x)(λx.f(x x)) to λf.(λx.f(x x))(λx.f(x x))

<table>
<tbody><tr><td>initial term</td><td><img src="https://tromp.github.io/img/cl/Y.gif"></td></tr>
<tr><td>show application of abstraction</td><td><img src="https://tromp.github.io/img/cl/Y0.gif"></td></tr>
<tr><td>show bound variables and argument</td><td><img src="https://tromp.github.io/img/cl/Y1.gif"></td></tr>
<tr><td>expand function body</td><td><img src="https://tromp.github.io/img/cl/Y2.gif"></td></tr>
<tr><td>to make room for substitution</td><td><img src="https://tromp.github.io/img/cl/Y3.gif"></td></tr>
<tr><td>substitute argument for variables</td><td><img src="https://tromp.github.io/img/cl/Y4.gif"></td></tr>
<tr><td>final term</td><td><img src="https://tromp.github.io/img/cl/Y5.gif"></td></tr>
</tbody></table>

In the third frame, we show only the part of bound variables below abstractions, e.g. when
applying <img src="https://tromp.github.io/img/cl/applied.gif">, the function body x(λy.x) shows as <img src="https://tromp.github.io/img/cl/bound.gif">.

<h2>Diagrams In Motion</h2>

Paul Brauner has produced some awesome <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLi8_XqluS5xc7GL-bgVrxpA2Uww6nK0gV">videos</a> of beta reductions, produced with this <a href="https://github.com/polux/lambda-diagrams">software</a>.

<a href="http://dkeenan.com/">Dave Keenan</a> has a comprehensive online paper
<a href="http://dkeenan.com/Lambda/">To Dissect a Mockingbird:
A Graphical Notation for the Lambda Calculus with Animated Reduction</a>,
which partly inspired this page.
<p>
In his <a href="http://bntr.planet.ee/lambda/work/visual_lambda.pdf">Master thesis</a>, Viktor Massalõgin discusses 4 existing graphical notations before introducing his own "bubble" notation. Figure 3 on page 10 shows 4 depictions of the fixpoint combinator (which differs from Y above in one beta reduction), while the bubble form is in Figure 5 on page 13.

        <p>Published on: 2020-10-04</p>
        
<p>Dual licensing with GPL is the idea that if I own a certain piece of GPL code, I can also relicense it as a proprietary library. This is how Oracle licenses Java and how QT licenses QT.</p>
<h2>I - All rights for me but not for thee</h2>
<p>But my general feeling is that there is some stigma associated with this practice, to quote <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html#ReleaseUnderGPLAndNF">gnu.org</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To release a nonfree program is always ethically tainted, but legally there is no obstacle to your doing this. If you are the copyright holder for the code, you can release it under various different non-exclusive licenses at various times.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The "ethically tainted" doesn't resonate with me, I think this licensing model should be encouraged.</p>
<p>I will admit I am kind of biased on this because I work on a for-profit GPL-license project. But it strikes me as silly that this business model is shunned by the open-source community in favor of licensing under MIT/BSD.</p>
<p>Dual licensing is a way in which the "owner" of the code ends up in an advantageous position compared to other users.</p>
<p>That is to say, a user must abide by the strict rules of the GPL license:</p>
<ul>
<li>Release all modifications.</li>
<li>Potentially (depending on the specifics of the GPL license) have to release other projects that are used "in relation" to the library.</li>
<li>Not ship the code under a different license.</li>
</ul>
<p>The "owner" of the code abides by none of these and can thus benefit in ways that the users can't.</p>
<p>In the open-source utopia, where resources are aplenty for everyone, everything is open source and nothing is for sale, so dual-licensing doesn't fit that particular utopia. But we live in the real world, where money makes things a bit more complicated, and in the long term, dual-licensing might be better than equal-rights open licenses.</p>
<p>Well, developers have to eat.</p>
<p>Even worst, good software is made by good developers, developers which can get six-figure salaries designing skinner boxes. On the contingency that those developers aren't ideal altruists, they have to get way-above-subsistence salaries to work on useful open source projects instead of skinner boxes.</p>
<p>So if dual-licensing provides a middle ground for that which is better than the current situation where a lot of good software is proprietary, what's the harm?</p>
<p>Some would say it's a middle ground that will hamper the development of truly free software. But who release said truly free software anyway?</p>
<h2>II - Who release fully-free projects</h2>
<p>When it comes to license like MIT and BSD, that impose no restrictions upon usage, where the "owner" doesn't exist, it's interesting to look at who release projects under those licenses:</p>
<p>a) Students or hobbyists, people creating software for fun, notoriety, and experience.</p>
<p>b) Very large companies (Facebook, Google, Amazon, Uber) or government &amp; donation founded organizations (Universities, Public Research centers, software foundations such as GNU, Apache, and LSF)</p>
<p>The first group is one I don't wish to dismiss, I think a lot of important programs stem from here. But their end goal is not to work for free for their whole life. Usually, they moonlight for their open-source projects and work a paid gig to earn money. A small minority can be funded by donations, but it's a small minority.</p>
<p>The project I use for allowing comments on this website (<a href="https://github.com/umputun/remark42">remark42</a>), has 2.3k stars on GitHub and <a href="https://www.patreon.com/remark42/posts">earns 9$/month from donations</a>. The <a href="https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb">project I work on</a> has 2.9k stars on Github and an operating budget of <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/04/16/mindsdb-raises-3-million-for-open-source-automated-machine-learning/">a few million</a> dollars.</p>
<p>You can certainly get to a point where you are funded by donations, but the reality is that it's not a good enough incentive. Doubly so since the developers working on these projects are usually the "creme de la creme", releasing and maintaining truly useful software usually requires expertise only a small fraction of engineers have.</p>
<p>The second group, the corporation and government-funded teams can only exist because of the scale.</p>
<p>Why can Facebook develop PyTorch?</p>
<ul>
<li>Because Facebook hires so many ML engineers that in the cost-benefit analysis it's cheaper to have your internal framework be popular enough such that you can get already-trained people from day 1. The &lt; 100 people working full time on PyTorch save months of training for every single one of the thousands of ML people facebook hires, since it can hire people that already know PyTorch.</li>
<li>Because Facebook doesn't dominate by having better ML models, it dominates by having thousands of times more data than anyone else. It's in facebook's interest to keep research open since it's objective is not to get ahead, but just to stay even, or at least not fall significantly behind.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why can Nvidia assign engineers to dozens of open source ML and game-engine projects?</p>
<ul>
<li>Because Nvidia makes hundreds of billions each year selling GPUs. The little work they put into those libraries to make sure it works ideally with their GPUs is insignificant to the revenue they get from those markets.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why can Google develop TensorFlow?</p>
<ul>
<li>For about the same reasons as Facebook.</li>
<li>Because they can make a lot more money from selling/renting TensorFlow optimized hardware.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that's on the happier side of the spectrum. On the "shadier" end of the scale, one could argue projects like Flutter and Angular might be worth their investment because they make spyware-free browsers like Firefox send-class citizens in the war for the web, not to mention easier integration into internet-monopolizing schemas like AMP.</p>
<p>You've also got, I will admit, projects that seem to be open source purely for flexing. To my knowledge, Yandex might have well never released Clickhouse and the column-store database landscape would have been set back 10+ years for it. Why did they do it? Maybe just because few dozens of people working on it wanted to showcase how good they are.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, this is not a reliable model</p>
<h2>III - Profit motives</h2>
<p>So would it not be nice for open source if one can bring profit motives into the whole thing?</p>
<p>Even better, profit from the people that don't support or contribute to open source, but not from those that do.</p>
<p>It seems to me like double-licensing with GPL achieves just that. One can release a project and charge large companies for using it, at the risk of breaking the license if they don't pay. Even if a lot of them will use the software illegally, as is the case now, the threat of lawsuits will end up deterring some or most heavy-users from doing so.</p>
<p>On the other hand, people using the project in an open-source project of their own have nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>The only problem that remains here is the fact that you can't chain GPL projects. That is to say, one can't use GPL code in their own double-licensed GPL code, but there are workarounds for that (e.g. isolating the GPL dependency and open-sourcing the changes to that alone). Still, this seems like the kind of problem that could be fixed by an off-shoot of the GPL meant for just this use-case.</p>
<p>This model keeps all the advantages of GPL, in that it incentives your users to open-source their product. It doesn't force them to do so, like a purely-GPL licensed software might, but it's not like GPL is working as intended, outside of a few cases where enough money was at stake to sue (e.g. TiVo), violations of the GPL go unpunished.</p>
<p>Currently, a company that wants to include GPL into their project has two options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the code in such a way that GPL won't force you to open source the rest of your code.</li>
<li>Use the code and break the license.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the wording of GPL is not that clear, it could often be argued that companies go for alternative nr 2. After all, who will ever know?</p>
<p>But what if the "pay the maintainer a small sum" option was available. Wouldn't the liability afraid giants look towards this much more favorably than either of the other 2 options? Wouldn't this, in the long run, give an edge to open source projects which don't have to worry about these fees ?</p>
<hr>
<p>Thus I think I come in squarely on the side of open-source companies dual-licensing GPL on their product[s]. A model that already exists and often enough has great success (see MariaDB and Aerospike).</p>
<p>It's a nice compromise for moving towards a more open world, without having to live in Stallman's utopia. It's an amazingly pragmatic solution and anyone who reads this blog knows I'm a fan of those.</p>

October 4, 2020 | https://www.phplift.net/is-the-life-of-a-programmer-lonely/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.phplift.net/is-the-life-of-a-programmer-lonely/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It is a fact that almost every job in the world has some stereotypes. Based on the lifestyles of a few, people start attaching specific attributes to a particular occupation and those associated with that specific job. For example, there is a myth that doctors are always rich and that pursuing a medical field is one’s road to financial stability. While doctors do make good money, it is not entirely true. But because we are presumptuous people, it is easier for us to assume things.</p>
<p>Just as there are certain stereotypes for doctors, there are certain qualities that are attached to programmers too. One of the most famous attributes that are believed to be in programmers is loneliness. It is usually said that a programmer does not have a life, and that’s why they are more likely to end up alone, isolated, and cut off from the world. But is it true? Let’s dig deep into it.</p>
<h2>The Association:</h2>
<p>The primary reason for the association of loneliness with the programmers is their dense life – where from waking up early in the morning to eventually going to sleep – coding is heavily influential. Tied up with loneliness, other attributes used to define a programmer’s life are no love life, anxiety, lack of genuine friends, and lack of socializing skills.</p>
<!-- phpgang custom -->
<p>When the question in the title was thrown at programmers on Quora, most responses provided the same reason for being lonely: introvertedness. Many said to have a good love life, and they also said to have pulled off a pretty good schedule where they could give time to coding yet be left with ample time to rejoice with their respective families. Not only that, but they also wrote to have spared enough time to read and study too.</p>
<p>However, many did agree that they did not lead happening lives. They can’t afford to have spontaneous plans or leave for an unplanned road trip that will have a severe impact on their job. As a programmer with a regular 9 to 5 job, you are supposed to work 8 hours a day, five days a week, all while ensuring a good moral character along with an aptitude for striving for bigger and better in terms of career and finance.</p>
<p>So, in juggling your career and finances as a programmer, sometimes introvertedness does become a choice.</p>
<h2>Does the Claim Stand True?</h2>
<p>While many programmers deny suffering from chronic loneliness due to their dense work schedule, many passionate programmers do not have ties with anyone other than their beloved family members. Undoubtedly, the nature of a programmer’s work-life demands undivided attention, but it is not entirely the kind of work they do. The field of programming is not saturated. The growing IT and AI industries are inspiring many to pursue their careers in the established and demanding fields of programming.</p>
<p>Being a mere programmer is not all it takes to build a sustainable future; a programmer has to stand out from the crowd of hundreds of thousands. Many passionate programmers give decades of their lives to refining their skills so that they are eventually able to build their empire, make a promising future for themselves and those associated with them.</p>
<p>In between the contractions and rarefactions of life and for the pursuit of a sustainable future, many programmers give up on the relations that they could have built, trips that they could have gone to, and, more importantly, the time that they could have spared for themselves.</p>
<h2>How to Deal with Programmers?</h2>
<p>Because of their quiet, grim, and gloomy demeanour, programmers are termed as weird. Such labelling is just the result of our rushed judgment. If you have a programmer friend, know that they do not necessarily have to be good at socializing and therefore, to get them out of their zombified stature, here are a few things you can do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do not expect holistic reactions from them.</li>
<li>Talk to them about their work-life</li>
<li>Discuss their goals and achievements</li>
<li>Share your interactions with programmers, if you have had any.</li>
<li>Make sure they don’t feel left out in a party or a gathering.</li>
<li>If they don’t want to attend a gathering, respect their decision.</li>
<li>Try persuading them to push their boundaries slowly and gradually.</li>
<li>Take them a place where they are least uncomfortable.</li>
</ol>
<p>Mentioned above are some of the ways you can deal with your programmer pals and buddies and help them enjoy things other than coding. Remember, a good programmer will do the coding by working hard, but a happy programmer will do the coding by heart.</p>

    <p>RSS: </p> <p><a href="https://reyammer.io/blog/index.xml"><img src="https://reyammer.io/rss.png" width="23px"></a></p>

  <p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/reyammer/status/1311338230139232258" target="_blank">news is out</a>: I left France, I'm no longer a professor at EURECOM, I joined the Malware Research Team at CISCO Talos, and I moved to beautiful Vienna. Big change :-)</p>
<p>I have been a professor for a bit more than three years, but I have had contrasting feelings about the "prof job" for a long time (even before finishing my PhD), it took me a couple of years to realize that I would eventually have needed to move on, and it took even more (mental) effort to actually make the call and leave. Despite being <em>very</em> excited for what's next, oh boy, this was tough :-) But independently of the concrete next step, it was time to move on. Even if Talos realizes the mistake and kicks me out next week, I'm still confident that moving on was the right call.</p>
<p>Especially when it comes to take big decisions, I tend to obsess about trying to stay rational, and I spent years collecting notes on the various pros/cons. Many of these thoughts often started surfacing as "feeling something is not right", without consciously understanding what was going on. But by keep thinking and writing notes down, patterns of thoughts started to emerge and I was eventually able to pinpoint some more defined thoughts on what kept me on the current job and what pushed me to change. Once these reasons were clear, it was much easier to take the decision.</p>
<p>This is a very long blog post, and I don't expect more than a very few people to actually read it. I wrote it mostly for selfish reasons: before changing to a new life, I wanted to wrap up all these notes in something more structured. I can't be certain I took a good decision, but systematizing these thoughts allowed me to move on with enough confidence to know I'm likely making a step forward.</p>
<p>With that being said, I know that someone may be actually interested in hearing these thoughts and my experience. When I was a PhD student and I needed to take the notorious academia vs. industry decision, I would have paid big bucks to read more thoughts on the various pros/cons. One of the stupidest things you can do is to take big decisions based on what other people do and think, but reading about other people's thought process has helped me a lot. It is time I do my part.</p>
<p>The target audience for this post is, other than myself, PhD students / postdocs that are about to decide what to do next and junior profs that somehow feel that "something is wrong". I also expect some senior academics and industry people to read this post, but I guess they will find themselves skipping directly to the academic rant part and mostly agree with much I have to say :-) Anyways, I tried to stay away from the "very known things" (e.g., 👀-level BS when writing proposals, generally "more limited" immediate impact of your work, different compensation level, etc.), and I tried to focus on thoughts I have not seen much discussed around (at least not in this depth).</p>
<p>So, if you feel clueless and you want to hear more from an equivalently clueless random dude on the Internet, here we are :-) If you think this is <em>the</em> blog post that will make everything clear, I have a bad news for you: it's all about tradeoffs and in my opinion there is no clear-cut winner. And, unfortunately, the problem with tradeoffs and balancing many aspects is that figuring out which one to weigh more is yet another very personal decision in its own way. So, you will not find any answer in this post and you will eventually need to figure this thing out on your own, but I hope this will help you forming your own opinion.</p>
<p>This post is organized in three parts:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#part-1-the-good-mdash-what-pushed-me-to-keep-the-job">Part 1: The Good — What pushed me to keep the job</a></li>
<li><a href="#part-2-the-bad-mdash-what-pushed-me-to-leave-the-job">Part 2: The Bad — What pushed me to leave the job</a></li>
<li><a href="#part-3-the-bye-bye-mdash-the-decision-to-leave">Part 3: The Bye Bye — The decision to leave</a></li>

<h2 id="part-1-the-good-mdash-what-pushed-me-to-keep-the-job">Part 1: The Good — What pushed me to keep the job</h2>
<p>Before I discuss why I left, I want to touch on what pushed me to keep the job. I want to make sure it's a balanced post despite the upcoming mega rant, so that my overall opinion is more closely reflected. And I really don't want to discourage anyone to take this path, I still think it is a great one.</p>
<p>Note that some of my "reasons to stay" are good, but some are bad. Also note that many of these refer to my personal situation at EURECOM, working in the field of systems security, and not all these points can be generalized to all universities. As they say, your mileage may vary.</p>
<h3 id="its-a-very-good-job">It's a very good job</h3>
<p>The first pros is... 🥁: "it's a very good job". At first, I was shocked to find out that it's an actual job. When I joined this prof thingy I thought that this would be a "job" (note the double quotes). But, while it's true that you don't have a direct boss that tells you what to do, at the end of the day you need to deliver, and you actually work very hard: If your PhD students are in trouble or you teaching sucks, you will run into problems. This doesn't necessarily mean "they kick out", but if you value being a professional (and I do), failing at your core tasks will make you feel bad, even without additional pressure from your superior, and even if you have tenure.</p>
<p>And now that we got this "it's an actual job" out of the way, I can tell you: it's a very good one. There is <em>a lot</em> of freedom in what you do and how you structure your time. Research-wise I felt very free (but you eventually work on what your students like to work on — as it should be), and the department values the right things (I've heard some BS in other schools where, in the context of systems security research, they pressure you to "publish more journal papers..." 🤦‍♂️). I really like teaching and mentoring, and there were many opportunities to do so. They let me create and teach my own class on mobile security, <a href="https://mobisec.reyammer.io/" target="_blank">MOBISEC</a>, and the teaching load is overall very low (1 or 1.5 classes per year). I love playing CTFs and I was even <em>encouraged</em> to spend time and push for NOPS, the EURECOM CTF team (after winning <a href="https://ctftime.org/event/647" target="_blank">HXP CTF 2018</a> and after being referred to as "<a href="https://youtu.be/j0taw78tCYs?t=968" target="_blank">probably a top team</a>" we are mostly enjoying our eternal and well-deserved glory).</p>
<p>The environment is extremely relaxed, informal, and friendly. You are surrounded by top-skilled colleagues and humans, from MS students to profs. I felt in a family from day 1. Last very good point: since in France positions come with tenure, there were not even problems in terms of pre-tenure stress, a real luxury. And on this aspect, EURECOM delivered: I never felt any sort of pressure (but: I did work my ass off... so if you stop doing anything, bad things may happen :-)).</p>
<p>[BTW, EURECOM is frantically trying to replace me, you should apply :-)]</p>
<h3 id="you-are-surrounded-by-students">You are surrounded by students</h3>
<p>When I took my decision to remain in academia, my top reason was for teaching and mentorship. Probably the best perk of the job is that you are surrounded by people eager to learn, from MS to PhD students to postdocs. It is extremely fulfilling and rewarding. Working with my students has been the highlight of my time at EURECOM, from traditional teaching, to suffering through the various rejections, to celebrating defeats of Reviewer #2, to cluelessly getting CTF-close in many stego CTF challenges. I feel very lucky that during these years we found enough interesting ideas that we enjoyed working on together, and that my next job will allow me to keep advising them until they graduate. As a prof, I believe the net output of my work is to see students becoming independent researchers, not the actual papers — I can't wait to see the bright careers I'm sure they will have :-)</p>
<h3 id="i-have-deep-respect-for-the-role-of-profs-in-society-and-it-felt-great-to-be-one">I have deep respect for the role of "profs" in society, and it felt great to be one</h3>
<p>I somehow have a profound admiration for the role that professors have in society and that had in my life. For their hard work, knowledge, passion, patience, and ultimately their service to the community. I'm referring to all teachers and mentors (from elementary schools to universities), who spend their life helping others, while at the same time often being asked to do many useless things and being massively underpaid. I admire and deeply respect these efforts: my most sincere thank you to all past, present, and future profs!</p>
<p>And, to be frank, it felt great to be one. I have been in love with the idea of being a prof for many years. In part, I think it is because some of the people who impacted me the most are professors, and I wanted to do my part in helping others. And after all the uncertainties that one has during a PhD, I think I was even more in love with the idea of having finally found my place in society. [Narrator: LOL, this clueless dude did not find his place. [Answer to narrator: But I've surely found it <em>now</em>!!1!]]</p>
<p>Overcoming all these positive emotions and feelings attached to this job was likely the biggest challenge I faced in coming to terms with the several problems and cons I did have during these three years. As mentioned, I have no intention to give up on this teaching/mentoring thing (taking the time for this long blog post is part of this!), but it will surely not be the same thing. I'm very grateful I had a chance to try this job out. Thanks to all who made it possible, from family to advisors, colleagues, and students ❤️. I owe you big time.</p>
<p>[Of course, being a prof does not necessarily make you a smart or great person. Some profs I know are some of the dumbest people I have ever met (by far) and they would not survive one day in the real world. And some profs I know are the most asshole, selfish, egomaniac, and delusional humans I have ever heard of (Are you pushing your students to stay in the lab …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of the little things I don’t like about Twitter, or social media in general, is how it demands you to constantly create new content to keep people’s attention.</p><p>I understand the value of creating new tweets or instagram posts, sharing ephemeral updates that entertain and engage for a short while and keep your presence fresh in the minds of your audience. That’s how discovery-based social media works.</p><p>But I’ll be the first to admit that I’m a fan of things that you can do once, but reap the benefits of again and again, preferably growing over time.</p><p>And hence I prefer intent-driven search, because if I can show up for a relevant search and satisfy the searcher’s query well enough with my content, I can reap the benefits of that content today, tomorrow, and into the future.&nbsp;</p><p>I’ve read in theory about SEO for long enough, without ever having practiced it strategically in the long term. One of the growth pillars for DelightChat is based on SEO, so I might as well move on from theory and get started with real world learnings.</p><p>My personal blog <a href="https://www.preetamnath.com/blog" target="_blank">Preetamnath.com</a> is the first such long-term experiment.&nbsp;</p><p>I started publishing regularly on June 4, exact 4 months ago. Back then, my blog was to get 50 impressions/day on search results. Today, the average is at 1000/day. That’s a solid 20x jump.</p><figure id="w-node-8f3ea7c3f7d8-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5f79561d425f076bba77e965_search%20traffic%20on%20preetamnath%20console.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Clicks have gone up from 3/day to 30/day, which is a 10x jump. Looks like clicks didn’t grow as well as impressions, perhaps there’s a layer of optimisation that I could look into over there.<br></p><p>I first noticed that my blog was showing up for “micro saas”, “shopify app ideas” and related long term keywords. Back then I hadn’t thought too deeply about it. But I did end up making a page called <a href="https://www.preetamnath.com/habit-tracker-app" target="_blank">Habit Tracker App</a> as an experiment, which I published on August 2 (little over 2 months ago).</p><p>Since then, my habit tracker landing page has garnered 4,700+ impressions and 239 clicks directly from Google Search. This is completely on autopilot, I’ve never updated the page since I first posted.</p><figure id="w-node-d230c6cb7bbb-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5f79567f6493631e80a0a6e1_habit%20tracker%20search%20organic%20traffic.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption><em>June 4-Oct 3 data.

It shouldn’t have taken me this long, but today I’m doubling down on that keyword by creating a dedicated page called Micro SaaS.&nbsp;<br></p><p>For my page, I did basic research around</p><ul role="list"><li>Which search terms related to “Micro SaaS” is my blog already ranking.</li><li>What are the suggested keywords and questions that I see when I type “Micro SaaS” on Google.</li><li>What are the related search phrase suggestions I see from Keywords Everywhere.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Imposter syndrome is something that I have been battling with my entire life. Often times I get the feeling that whatever success &nbsp;I have acquired over the years might have just been luck or maybe things worked out because I partnered with the right people who did all the work while I reaped the fruits. </p><p>This feeling started all the way back in school when I scored the highest marks in an exam which everybody else struggled with. </p><p>At the time I was convinced that the only reason this happened was because I was lucky enough to have studied that one question in the syllabus which nobody thought would appear in the exam but ended up appearing. </p><p>But here’s the thing, because I felt like a fraud I ended up studying harder for the next exam with the fear of being exposed as someone who just got lucky in the last one. So is this feeling really a bad thing?</p><h3>‍<br>‍<strong>Why does imposter syndrome occur?</strong><br></h3><p>From my personal experience, I can say that imposter syndrome mainly occurs in people who have self taught themselves the skill that they are currently using to make a living. </p><p>In my case it is software development. I was not particularly good at it in college even though I was studying computer science. I was just an average student if not below average.</p><p>After I left college I started working in early stage startups where there is no structure or someone to teach you stuff. The only option is to do your own research and learn things yourself. Google and Stack overflow were my only true friends.</p><p>Because I never really went through a “standard program” I always have this self doubt and I never know if the way I am doing things is the right way or not and the fact that there is no defined right way of doing things in software does not make this any easier.<br></p><h3><strong>How do you use this as a strength</strong><br></h3><p>My co-founder and I built a business that <a href="https://www.preetamnath.com/blog/grow-shopify-micro-saas-to-25k-mrr-in-14-months" target="_blank">we grew to $25k MRR</a>. Because of my imposter syndrome I have convinced myself that most of it was luck. We were in the right place at the right time. <br></p><p>The fact that we did 2 months of research on the market and product, spent a lot of time figuring out where we would get distribution from even before writing a single line of code seemed to have conveniently slipped my mind. The reason we even did all of this in the first place was our fear of not being good enough.<br></p><p>We have now started a <a href="https://www.delightchat.io/" target="_blank">new venture</a> and hired a team. Now because of the fact that we had a successful venture in the past, I am now under immense pressure to make this new one a success otherwise I might get exposed as a “fraud” or someone who “just got lucky”. <br></p><p>Because I have no other option but to make this a success I am going to work hard once again just like I did in my last venture. I would like to think that this imposter syndrome has turned into a strength. It is a feature and not a bug.<br></p><h3><strong>Closing notes</strong><br></h3><p>Some amount of self doubt is healthy and it keeps you on your toes. It also prevents you from letting your previous success go to your head and always be open for new learnings.<br></p><p>It enables you to be open to the suggestions given by your teammates which you might otherwise ignore just because they are less experienced than you if you had no self doubt at all. <br></p><p>Having said that, it is also not right to doubt yourself to an extent where it starts impacting you in a negative way. For instance, what if your teammates catch wind of your immense self doubt and they start losing faith in you? This is also not something you can afford.<br></p><p>One must have a healthy balance of self doubt and faith in yourself that you are moving in the right direction.</p><p>‍</p></div></div>]]>

<p>As the reading time estimate crept over 30 minutes, without any end in sight, I was starting to feel like a bit of a blowhard.</p>



<p>The draft I’d originally intended to inaugurate this blog is still sitting there. Maybe I will condense and finish it (eventually), but I think it makes more sense to write <s>briefly</s> less long-windedly about what I mean. Instead of trying to exhaust the subject matter, I’m going to offer a perspective, and present a more intuitive argument for it.</p>



<p>So, more briefly, I’d like to ask you to think, for a moment, about what makes humans <em>ethically</em> important. There are two parts to this question, hidden just under the surface. The first asks you to consider why humans are ethical <em>agents</em>. What makes it possible for them to do, want, or experience things that could fall under the umbrella of ethics? The second (no particular order) asks you to consider why humans are ethical <em>patients</em>. How is it that what happens to them, what is wanted of them, or what is experienced about them might also be part of an ethical problem? (This agent/patient distinction I inherit from Coeckelbergh, whose book, <em>Growing Moral Relations</em>, is worth your time.)</p>



<p>I will add before you start: ethics has been defined in a few different ways, over the millennia. I consider a few definitions interesting. </p>



<p>Charles Taylor, for instance, describes ethics as pertaining not just to moral choices and obligations between people, but questions like “what is the good life?” and “what is good?”. His more expansive account, following Aristotle, moves closer to the Greek root, which refers to one’s <em>character</em>, and can be read to have a slant towards something resembling <em>virtue ethics</em>. Using Taylor, we could ask questions like “what is it good to love?” and not just “what is the right way to act?” </p>



<p>Conversely, followers of Nietzsche contrast <em>ethics</em> with <em>morality</em>, arguing that morality is about passing judgment on what people (or living beings) are and do, whereas ethics can be about <em>affirming</em> life as intrinsically self-justifying. From a (post-) Nietzschean point of view, life’s capacity to want, struggle, and change, <em>is, from the very beginning, what is good</em> (maybe not in those words). Living well means trying to overcome the need to judge, and instead to explore and express what it is to be alive, for all its intensities and tragedies. Nietzsche is often read to be asking his readers to abandon compassion, or to think only of themselves and never of the common good, but I don’t think that is exactly the case. Nietzsche is asking us to live in pursuit of what is good, but not to define it as the enemy of the bad, rather, to live <em>for its own sake, come what may</em>, and to do what is good, <em>defined in itself</em>, rather than as a reaction.</p>



<p>I don’t know Coeckelbergh’s position on ethics broadly, but he considers morality to be embedded in social relationships themselves. Rather than what is right or wrong to do to a <em>patient</em> being about its properties (whether it has consciousness, for instance) and defined in absolute terms, morality is about what relationships exist between an agent and a patient, and what kinds of relationships are good to have, knowing what the agent and patient already are to each other. Do I already mostly act like it’s a person? I should probably treat it like one. Coeckelbergh is interesting in that he tries to legitimate ideas that have, until recently, not had much hearing in the community of western philosophers, although citing him as a source for them over others might, fairly, be challenged. For instance, he would consider our dependence on our ecology grounds to entertain an obligation towards it. I haven’t finished his book yet, so I’m not aware of the extent of the advice he gives for considering problems in these relationships, but it seems fair to say that he doesn’t believe there’s a system of absolute rules out there, or that we should try to find final answers to ethical problems. Relationships are particular, and they evolve. We shouldn’t seek to use the fact that we don’t get hard answers for our convenience; instead, we should consider relationships, for their lumpiness, their particularity, their uncertainty, and live them as best we can.</p>



<p>All of these viewpoints are very different from our ordinary patterns of ethical thought. We are used to thinking that <em>individuals</em>, or sometimes <em>social groups</em> (such as nations) have <em>rights</em> that must be guaranteed to them, but everything else goes. Sometimes, referencing Isaiah Berlin, we might say we believe that this obligation is <em>negative</em> (there are some things that people are fundamentally allowed to do, and our only obligation is to stop people who try to mess with that), or it is <em>positive</em> (there are some things that people should fundamentally be allowed to do, and we need to do our best to make that possible for them). Maybe, for whatever definition of the good, we are utilitarians, who think that we should do the most good for the most people, whatever means that could entail. Perhaps we take the <em>view from afar</em>, and ask “if I had the choice of all reasonably possible societies, which would I like to be born into, knowing that I might be anyone?” Perhaps we see ethics as different versions of the trolley problem, and find reasons, based on our moral intuitions, about what choices we should make when push comes to shove. Some of us, unfashionably, believe in immortal souls and divine law, against which we must not sin, or that her majesty inherits the right to judge from God, and that the highest good is obedience to an Earthly law. A scientist, being familiar with Hume, might read his argument that we cannot derive statements about what <em>ought to be</em> from statements about what <em>is</em>, and see cause to be an anti-realist. Maybe <em>ought</em> statements only express our personal preferences, derived from what we’ve been either (or both) biologically or socially conditioned to think is pleasing. Scientists might say this implies some sort of <em>relativism</em>, or that it’s best to follow whatever is the <em>conventional</em> way to think about ethics (although, if we’re not in the business of assuming the world is already a pretty just place to be in, that last one may not be safe). </p>



<p>So, knowing what you know about what humans are made of, and how they relate to one another, to society, or to other beings, what makes them ethical agents, and what does it mean that they are? What about patients? I think it’s probably a bad idea to try to find an answer too quickly. It might be better to think through what kinds of approaches are better, and what facts could be relevant to the question. For instance, maybe the way people want things matters, as it is defined in terms of elaborations on what’s generated by the default mode network. Maybe there can’t be exactly one right answer, or maybe there must be, or maybe it’s impossible to know. How would you argue that?</p>



<h2>Why it Matters </h2>



<p>I don’t fully agree with Taylor, but, in <em>Sources of the Self</em>, he makes a good case for why we shouldn’t be self-serving, and why we already care about ethics. He says ethics are about what we <em>want to be</em>, how we identify ourselves. This is always done in terms of social groups we identify <em>with</em>. “I am a professional, so I should…” Identity gives us community, people who share something about us (a way of life, perhaps), or maybe it contrasts us against a community (we can identify ourselves as rebels). We rarely, if ever, identify with just one thing, and it’s no use to try to come up with a completely original identity, if it’s possible to do it meaningfully at all, because it doesn’t tell us much about what we’re trying to be, given we’re the only one who would know or care that we’re being it. Identity is critically important to us in interpreting our place in the world, and what we are trying to do with it. So, says he, without identity, we would struggle to come to grips with life. It is a good thing, then, that you and I already have some ideas about <em>who we are</em>, or if we’re struggling to figure that out, generally already acknowledge that it <em>is</em> an important thing to get down. Taylor says that, since it’s all about coming to grips with life, we escape Hume’s is/ought problem, because we don’t have to set up an ethics from scratch. Ethics are already there from the beginning, and have some known properties, so we can argue about them by contrasting them. “Given these two frameworks, which one of them provides the richer set of tools for figuring out how to live a good life?” To Taylor, ethics are certainly <em>real</em>, but not in the sense that they’re an object embedded in a reality perfectly detached from us, rather, they come <em>from</em> the fact that we are social creatures, and relate <em>to</em> how we are trying to live in society. They aren’t just individual, or perfectly culturally relative (as there are no perfectly incommensurable cultures, which share none of the same moral ideas and cannot communicate with each other), but they aren’t exactly objective and final either.</p>



<p>I like Taylor, for how he grounds consciousness of <em>ethics</em> in <em>social consciousness</em>, and I like how good he is at striking down the (usually unanswerable) “why should I care about ethics?” question. I share Coeckelbergh’s complaint that he considers only one kind of relation (between the individual and the community), and I would also gripe that his ethics are unusually centred on the <em>self</em>, for a subject that tends to ask us to think beyond ourselves. But then, that is why the argument against selfishness works so well. It’s difficult to get through to somebody who only thinks of themself unless that’s the place you’re starting from. </p>



<p>Taylor’s other issues, which I will not go too in-depth on here, are first, that he frames the source of ethics as appearing in the fact that one is an <em>ind…</em></p></div></section></main></div></div>

  <p>The internet is pretty cool; right now I’m watching some Harvard lectures on advanced algorithms. This one’s about sorting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>- Me</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What’s an algorithm?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>- Mom and Dad</p>

<p>I’m hanging out with my parents for the week. Anytime I’m home I try to spend a little time giving my parents a better sense of what I do. Neither have much background in science or engineering, but they always indulge me and ask to hear about what I’m working on.</p>

<p>Clearly explaining complicated things to people who don’t have a background is an invaluable skill. Anytime there’s a chance to practice, take advantage of it.</p>

<p>We ended up on the topic of algorithms, so I decided to play a game. I asked Dad how to describe the steps needed to sort a list of randomly generated integers from smallest to largest. That didn’t get much of a response besides “Well, study the numbers, then put them in order.”</p>

<p>I decided we needed a visual aid. We cut up and numbered some paper square and manually went through the process of creating a random array and then sorting it.</p>

<figure>
	<a href="https://i.imgur.com/f3FobQr.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/f3FobQr.png"></a>
</figure>

<p>The first couple iterations of sorting the numbers didn’t make much progress towards describing any sort of algorithm. It sort of just <em>happened</em>. There were some vague mutterings about “this goes over here” and “then the 6 can move here…” and the like.</p>

<p>Eventually, I took over and said he had to tell me what to do instead. I would write down the instructions as we went along. That also didn’t go perfectly. After a couple of tries, a lot of clarifying questions, and a hint or two, however, I was able to write down the following steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Find min.</li>
  <li>Find max.</li>
  <li>Decide bin size.</li>
  <li>Move min to far left.</li>
  <li>Look right (within bin) for num not in bin.</li>
  <li>Move num to correct bin.</li>
  <li>Within bin, find number just smaller than num, place num in from of smaller number.</li>
  <li>If any num shouldn’t be in bin, put it in the right bin. (Repeat previous 3 steps).</li>
  <li>If all nums in bin are in valid bin, quickly sort “nearby”.</li>
  <li>If nearby is sorted, record max value.</li>
  <li>Do comparison to the right, until you find unsorted num.</li>
  <li>Check for nums in wrong bin.</li>
  <li>Either go back to putting nums in right bin, or go back to quickly sorting “nearby”.</li>
  <li>Check if array is sorted.</li>
</ol>

<p>By this point, both parents were sufficiently through with the conversation. But I had to take it one step further and turn this algorithm into working code.</p>

<p>After a few quick sessions ChuckSort was born. You can check out the source code on GitHub for more details.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Jessime/ChuckSort">https://github.com/Jessime/ChuckSort</a></p>

<p>You’ll notice that the algorithm in <code>chuck_sort.py</code> isn’t exactly the same as what’s above. It morphed a bit over the 3-4 short sessions it took me to write it up. I’m fine with that. The essence of what happened with those little paper squares is still captured in this repo. The fun bit is that the code actually works. Here’s the algorithm sorting 1 through 100:</p>

<figure>
	<a href="https://i.imgur.com/jcf92Mo.gif"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/jcf92Mo.gif"></a>
</figure>

<p>This exercise reminded me of two things.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Learning to think algorithmically is difficult and not something humans do intuitively. In some sense, this is great news for beginner programmers who often feel a lot of frustration about the difficulty of programming and their lack of progress. It’s normal! Becoming a good programmer is so much more than learning the syntax of a language. It’s about expression. It’s about taking hold of thoughts in your head and clarifying those thoughts until they can ultimately be expressed in binary. When you’re programming in the context of something like bioinformatics, it’s also about capturing real-world phenomena in some accurate way.</li>
  <li>Even if <em>you’re</em> used to thinking programmatically, it’s hard to capture what someone’s doing to process some task. Even when the process is as simple as sorting 20 numbers, I was never able to fully capture what Dad was doing to sort the numbers. I’m no psychologist, but it feels like this observation has interesting implications for assuming the intent or rationale of other humans. Given the political climate (there’s been a lot of politics this week), I find it entertaining how often we say things like, “He obviously did this because he wanted to…”, or “All of those people think that…”. It’s absurd. I can’t even tell you why my own father sorted 20 numbers the way he did. How are you going to assert the intentions of some random person you’ve never met on some complex political topic? I digress…</li>
</ol>

<p>tl;dr: Formalizing the world into code is <em>tricky</em>, but fun!</p>

<hr>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Transmitter localization is a both interesting and challenging task. Besides applying triangulation in combination with some type of direction finding receivers (using e.g. directional antennas, pseudo Doppler or the interferometer principle), the Time-Difference-of-Arrival (TDOA) method is widely used. In TDOA three or more (non-directional) receivers at different locations capture the unknown transmitted signal. Then it evaluates the differences in arrival time of the signals to calculate the transmitter’s position (multilateration).</p>
<p>This article first provides a short introduction to localization with TDOA. Second, it presents a simple experimental localization system based on three receivers, each consisting of a RTL-SDR USB-Stick and a Raspberry PI. Although the receivers and the overall setup are very simple, localization of transmitters works remarkably well.</p>
<h2>Basics of Time-Difference-of-Arrival</h2>
<p>Assume a signal is emitted by an (unknown) transmitter and is received by several receivers at different locations. Usually the signal arrives at different times at the different receivers due to the varying distances between transmitter and receivers. This difference in arrival time is called “TDOA”. A TDOA value can be measured between a pair of receivers. It should be emphasized, that we work on the time <em>difference</em> of arrival, since any absolute arrival times in relation to transmission times are in general not available (as opposed to other localization techniques like time-of-arrival, TOA).</p>
<p>To understand the idea of TDOA localization, consider a simple example based on only two receivers and an unknown transmitter as depicted in the figure below. First, assume that the signal arrives at both receivers at the same point in time, i.e. TDOA = 0s. Then it is obvious, that the distance from the transmitter to receiver 1 is the same as to receiver 2. The transmitter must be located somewhere on a straight line in the middle between the two receivers. This is not yet a unique position, but narrows the possible positions to a line.</p>
<div id="attachment_745"><p><a href="http://www.panoradio-sdr.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tdoa_basic_principle.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-745" loading="lazy" src="http://www.panoradio-sdr.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tdoa_basic_principle.jpg" alt="" width="671" height="387" srcset="http://www.panoradio-sdr.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tdoa_basic_principle.jpg 671w, http://www.panoradio-sdr.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tdoa_basic_principle-300x173.jpg 300w, http://www.panoradio-sdr.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tdoa_basic_principle-500x288.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 671px) 100vw, 671px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-745">TDOA system with 2 receivers in three cases: TDOA &gt; 0s, TDOA = 0s and TDOA &lt;0s. The possible TX positions form a hyperbola.</p></div>
<p>Now assume a second case, where the signal arrives earlier at receiver 1 and later at receiver 2. The TDOA value now becomes non-zero. This means, that the distance from transmitter to receiver 1 is smaller as to receiver 2 (Note, that a TDOA value can be converted to a distance by multiplication with propagation speed). In this case, the possible locations lie on a hyperbola with one of the receivers in its focal point.</p>
<p>To complete localization, more than two receivers are required – at least three for two dimensional localization in a plane. The above described method to create hyperbolas is applied pairwise to each receiver, such that for three receivers three hyperbolas can be generated (four receivers would yield ten hyperbolas). Ideally, all hyperbolas intersect at a single location on the map, that is the transmitter’s position.</p>
<div id="attachment_744"><p><a href="http://www.panoradio-sdr.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tdoa_3_hyperbola_principle.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-744" loading="lazy" src="http://www.panoradio-sdr.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tdoa_3_hyperbola_principle.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="331" srcset="http://www.panoradio-sdr.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tdoa_3_hyperbola_principle.jpg 527w, http://www.panoradio-sdr.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tdoa_3_hyperbola_principle-300x199.jpg 300w, http://www.panoradio-sdr.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tdoa_3_hyperbola_principle-453x300.jpg 453w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-744">Exact TDOA localization with 3 receivers and thus 3 hyperbolas with mulitlateration</p></div>
<p>The achievable resolution and accuracy on a map does not only correspond to the resolution of the TDOA measurement. It is also largely dependent of the transmitter’s location relative to the receivers. The resolution figure below shows, that the accuracy is very good in the area roughly between the receivers and poor elsewhere. In general, TDOA systems perform well in the area that is surrounded by the receivers.</p>

Resolution is heavily dependent on the transmitter’s position relative to the receivers</p></div>
<p>Although the basic idea of TDOA localization is not too complicated, some further issues need to be addressed: First, it is required to synchronize the receivers with each other in time. Second, a means of precisely determining the time differences of arrivals must be used. Third, all receivers must be placed apart, though connected and able to exchange considerable amounts of raw sampled data. These challenges need to be solved to build a practical system and will be treated in the following.</p>
<h2>A Simple Localization System using RTL-SDRs</h2>
<p>A complete TDOA system consists of three synchronized receivers, that are connected to a central signal processing unit. In the following, a simple and cheap system for localizing signals in a city will be described.</p>
<p><strong><em>Receivers</em></strong></p>
<p>The installed receivers are minimalistic and consist each of a RTL-SDR USB-stick (~20 $) and a Raspberry PI (~40 $). The receivers use the simple whip antenna delivered with the RTL-SDR dongle. For practical reasons the antennas had to be placed indoor, which is suboptimal and leaves room for improvement. The RTL-SDR is capable of receiving 2 MHz of instantaneous bandwidth in a range from below 100 MHz to more than 1 GHz. This makes it a cheap and versatile general purpose SDR, capable of receiving various different types of signals.</p>
<p>For the experiments three receivers were deployed around in the city of Kaiserslautern, Germany. The figure below shows the receiver’s positions. For ideal placement and good accuracy the receivers should have been placed outside the city. However, in the surrounding, mostly forestal, areas no suitable internet connection could be established. Despite the suboptimal placement, good accuracy is expected in the area roughly between the receivers.</p>

<p>All receivers are connected to a master PC for signal processing via internet. The master triggers measurements at each receiver (simultaneously). Then the receivers send the received sampled data back to master for further signal processing and delay analysis. The amount of sampled data can quickly become very large, since the RTL-SDR outputs 8 bit IQ-data with 2 MHz. This creates a data rate of 2 x 8 bit x 2 MHz = 32 Mbit/s per receiver. With an available DSL upload of 1 Mbit/s, transferring only 1 s of sampled data already takes approximately half a minute. Reducing the sample rate of the RTL-SDR or employing compression may relax data rates.</p>
<p>It is important, that the three receivers are tuned to exactly the same frequency. For that purpose the RTL-SDR’s frequencies are calibrated with special frequency correction busts, emitted by GSM base stations. Calibration with GSM signals is easy using the <a href="https://github.com/steve-m/kalibrate-rtl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kalibrate-rtl</a> software.</p>
<p><em><strong>Synchronization</strong></em></p>
<p>As mentioned above, a prerequisite for TDOA localization is the synchronization of the receivers. One possibility is to use a GPS receiver, that disciplines the Raspberry PI’s internal clock. However, the system utilizes a different method using a transmitter with known location as a reference, that is received well by all three receivers. There is a DAB+ transmitter (217 MHz, 2 kW) in the city of Kaiserslautern, that covers a large area and is perfect for synchronization.</p>
<p>Synchronization with a reference receiver works as follows: When the master triggers a measurement, each receiver first receives some samples of the reference receiver and then seamlessly switches to the unknown transmitter’s signal of interest. For synchronization, the master aligns the three receptions from the different receivers to each other on the time axis. Alignment is done in such a way, that the delay in the reference signal portion corresponds to the known distances of the reference transmitter to the receivers. Once the complete received signal is synchronized (or aligned) the TDOA of the unknown signals is simply calculated as the delay. Precisely spoken, this technique does not synchronize the receivers themselves, but rather the received signals.</p>
<div id="attachment_742"><p><a href="http://www.panoradio-sdr.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tdoa_with_reference_signal.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-742" loading="lazy" src="http://www.panoradio-sdr.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tdoa_with_reference_signal.png" alt="" width="550" height="232" srcset="http://www.panoradio-sdr.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tdoa_with_reference_signal.png 670w, http://www.panoradio-sdr.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tdoa_with_reference_signal-300x127.png 300w, http://www.panoradio-sdr.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tdoa_with_reference_signal-500x211.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-742">RTL-SDR signal for TDOA, first recording a reference transmitter (DAB+), then switching to the unkown transmitter’s signal.</p></div>
<p>The critical point for the synchronization is the requirement to switch between the frequencies <em>seamlessly</em>, such that not a single sample gets lost (otherwise, this will impair synchronization). Modifying the C library <a href="https://github.com/steve-m/librtlsdr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">librtlsdr</a> (commonly used for controlling the RTL-SDR) to perform seamless frequency switching using the “rtl_sdr” command made it crash during execution. The solution is to use a modified branch of the librtlsdr, called “<a href="https://github.com/mutability/librtlsdr/tree/async-rearrangements">async-rearrangements</a>” as a basis. Modifying this library for seamless frequency switching worked perfectly fine and showed that the RTL-SDR can do so.</p>
<p>The modified lib <a href="https://github.com/DC9ST/librtlsdr-2freq" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">librtlsdr-2freq</a> for switching between two frequencies is available as open source software.</p>
<p><strong><em>Signal Processing</em></strong></p>
<p>Measuring the delay between two inputs precisely is the most important operation for TDOA. For that purpose the correlation function is suitable. It is defined as</p>
<p><span data-display="true"> Corr(\tau) = \sum_{t=0}^{N-1}s_1(t)s_2(t+\tau)</span></p><p>(s1, s2 are the real signals received by RX1 and 2) and outputs for every hypothetical delay <span data-display="false"> \tau</span> between the two signals a value indicating how good the two signals match. The delay value of <span data-display="false"> \tau</span>, at which the correlation function has a peak is the delay between the signals (see also my <a href="http://www.panoradio-sdr.de/correlation-for-time-delay-analysis/">detailed description of correlation</a> and <a href="http://www.dspguide.com/ch7/3.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steven W.

<p>I still remember the first time I got an email from somebody asking me to link to their website.</p>
<p>They addressed me by name, described one of my blog posts in detail, and asked if I could include their link. It seemed so strange. Why on earth would somebody take the time to write me a personal email, just for a silly link—from a random blog that nobody was reading!</p>
<p>Since then, I’ve learned that these emails are common. Indeed, there are entire businesses built around finding ways to send these kinds of emails effectively and at scale. I didn’t know it, but a link is a powerful thing</p>
<p>There’s a lot of reasons for this. Your website won’t appear on search engines unless somebody links to it. Multiple links can improve your search engine ranking. Links can be a steady source of new visitors and they serve as an endorsement of your site. A single link can have a huge impact.</p>
<p>A link, on the open internet, is a vote. It’s your way of saying, “<em>this is great, and more people should know about it.</em>” We talk about how much power the search engines have, but if you think about it, the search engines listen to us. They see what we link to, what we click, and how long we stay.* At the end of the day, <em>we</em> are the curators of what gets surfaced on the internet.</p>
<p>This is one reason why it’s been so disappointing to see so many people leave their independent blogs in favor of social media platforms (like Medium) for creating content. When people post on these platforms, they lose their voice because the links aren’t the same! They’re often altered with <code>rel="nofollow"</code> attributes, which prevents search engines from crawling the links or counting them toward search rankings. There are reasons for this, but the result is that the links you post lose their power.</p>
<p>I continue to occasionally get emails from marketers asking me to link to their stuff. And while it’s annoying to receive spam, it’s also a reminder of the power I wield, just by having an independent website where I can link to whatever I want.</p>
<p>–</p>
<p>
<small>* Of course there are downsides, including the legitimate privacy concerns around search engines watching us too closely. 👀</small>

<p>Responding to something I wrote long ago and can no longer find (this happens more and more), a reader asked me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does your head really tingle when you are learning something you find interesting?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It actually does. It really can get intense. Sadly, this pleasant phenomenon is getting rare as I age, although I do still get it from time to time. It's usually associated with learning that broadens in my horizons in some non-trivial way, a meaningful or especially interesting insight, that "light bulb going on" feeling. Sometimes it's just sheer density of information, if I'm actually getting it. I never get that feeling when I feel stumped or overloaded; only when I think I'm successfully taking it in.</p>
<p>I remember a really strong example of this phenomenon from university. My head got so buzzy it was like being high. It felt really, really good. Probably not a coincidence that the lady professor was super cute. It was the <i>learning</i> high, definitely, just … crush-enhanced. ☺</p>
<p>Does <em>your</em> head tingle when you learn?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p><a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a>, or Wasm, is an open standard that allows developers to build apps that run inside a web browser using compiled programming languages. With WebAssembly, it’s possible to write components of web apps in languages such as C/C++, Rust, C#, and Go, among others, which run within the same sandbox as JavaScript. This allows things like porting existing libraries, leveraging capabilities not available in JavaScript, and running code faster because WebAssembly is compiled into a binary format.</p><p>Recently, I’ve been experimenting with WebAssembly to be able to run some Go code in the browser. Specifically, I’ve been trying to port certain parts of <a href="https://github.com/italypaleale/prvt">prvt</a>, an open source project for storing end-to-end encrypted documents, to run within a web browser directly. The reason for the WebAssembly experiment was two-fold: first, prvt makes extensive uses of cryptography and streams, both things which are not yet great in JavaScript; second, prvt itself is written in Go, so being able to re-use code in the browser would significantly simplify development.</p><blockquote><p>For an <strong>introduction to using WebAssembly with Go</strong>, I recommend <a href="https://golangbot.com/webassembly-using-go/">this article on Golang Bot</a>.<br>Additionally, more information can be found in the Go project’s <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/WebAssembly">GitHub wiki</a> and in the documentation for the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/syscall/js/">syscall/js</a> package.<br>Note that as of writing, <strong>WebAssembly support in Go is still experimental</strong>. Because of that, the APIs might change too. This article was tested against Go 1.15.</p></blockquote><p>This article contains four different yet connected things that I’ve learnt while working on the WebAssembly port, and which I thought useful to share.</p><ol><li>Working with and creating JavaScript objects from Go code</li><li>Creating Promises in Go for passing async results</li><li>Making HTTP requests from Go code</li><li>Streaming from Go code</li></ol><h2 id="javascript-objects-in-webassembly-and-go">JavaScript objects in WebAssembly and Go</h2><p>The WebAssembly runtime for Go automatically converts the most common Go types to their JavaScript equivalent. The documentation for the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/syscall/js/#ValueOf">js.ValueOf</a> method contains a nice summary table of how Go and JavaScript types are matched:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="text">| Go                     | JavaScript             |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| js.Value               | [its value]            |
| js.Func                | function               |
| nil                    | null                   |
| bool                   | boolean                |
| integers and floats    | number                 |
| string                 | string                 |
| []interface{}          | new array              |
| map[string]interface{} | new object             |
</code></pre></div><p>From here, you can see that the most common types, such as numbers, booleans, and strings, are converted automatically. The last row is particularly interesting as it explains how to pass “Plain Old JavaScript Objects” (POJO’s), which are the simplest kinds of objects (also called dictionaries).</p><p>For example, the following Go code defines a function called <code>MyGoFunc</code> that can be called from JavaScript code, which returns a dictionary with a string and a number (as you can see, types can be heterogeneous).</p><blockquote><p>For instructions of how to compile Go code into WebAssembly, check out the <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/WebAssembly#getting-started">Getting Started section</a> of the Wiki.</p></blockquote><p>After having compiled the code into WebAssembly and having imported it in the JavaScript code, you can call <code>MyGoFunc()</code> from JavaScript to see the result. For example:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>MyGoFunc</span><span>())</span>
<span>// Prints: {hello: "world", answer: 42}
</span></code></pre></div><p>However, what the documentation is less explicit about is that we can also <strong>use any JavaScript object</strong> inside the Go code, <strong>even built-ins</strong>! And this is where things can start getting more interesting.</p><p>For example, let’s try to pass a date as a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date"><code>Date</code></a> object. To do that, we first need to grab the <code>Date</code> constructor, loading its <code>js.Value</code> from the global scope of JS:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>dateConstructor</span> <span>:=</span> <span>js</span><span>.</span><span>Global</span><span>().</span><span>Get</span><span>(</span><span>"Date"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Then, we can create a new object off this constructor with the <code>dateConstructor.New</code> method, passing any argument to it as you’d pass to the <code>new Date()</code> constructor in JavaScript. The result of the invocation is a <code>js.Value</code> that can be returned to JavaScript:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>dateConstructor</span><span>.</span><span>New</span><span>(</span><span>"2020-10-01"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><p>So, we can modify our <code>MyGoFunc</code> to return the current date as computed in Go:</p><p>Invoking <code>MyGoFunc()</code> in the JavaScript code will now return a <code>Date</code> object:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>let</span> <span>d</span> <span>=</span> <span>MyGoFunc</span><span>()</span>
<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>typeof</span> <span>d</span><span>)</span>
<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>d</span> <span>instanceof</span> <span>Date</span><span>)</span>
<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>d</span><span>.</span><span>toString</span><span>())</span>

If you need a refresher on Promises, <a href="https://javascript.info/promise-basics">this is a good article</a>.</p><p>For example, consider this code, which creates a Promise that resolves with a message (<a href="https://www.mamalisa.com/?t=es&amp;p=5534">an Italian tongue-twister</a>) after 3 seconds:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>const</span> <span>p</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Promise</span><span>((</span><span>resolve</span><span>,</span> <span>reject</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>},</span> <span>3000</span><span>)</span>
<span>})</span>
</code></pre></div><p>In an <code>async</code> function, you can then <code>await</code> on the Promise above, so after 3 seconds you receive the message:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>// This is an async function, which can contain "await" statements inside

</code></pre></div><p>Invoking <code>MyFunc()</code> will show <code>sopra la panca la capra campa, sotto la panca la capra crepa</code> in the console.</p><p>When working with Wasm in Go, Promises are particularly important.</p><p>In fact, as per the documentation, you cannot make blocking calls in Go inside a function that is invoked by JavaScript directly—if you do that, you’ll get an immediate deadlock and your app will crash. Instead, the documentation recommends that all blocking calls be inside a goroutine, which raises the problem of then returning the value to the JavaScript code. Quoting from the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/syscall/js/#FuncOf">docs</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Invoking the wrapped Go function from JavaScript will pause the event loop and spawn a new goroutine. Other wrapped functions which are triggered during a call from Go to JavaScript get executed on the same goroutine.<br>As a consequence, if one wrapped function blocks, JavaScript’s event loop is blocked until that function returns. Hence, calling any async JavaScript API, which requires the event loop, like fetch (http.Client), will cause an immediate deadlock. Therefore a blocking function should explicitly start a new goroutine.</p></blockquote><p>Using a Promise is perhaps the best way to solve this problem: avoiding deadlocks while allowing programming with idiomatic JavaScript.</p><p>We saw in the previous section that we can create custom JavaScript objects from Go, and this applies to Promises too! We just need to create the <code>Promise</code> object by passing a function to the constructor. Just like in the pure-JS code above, this function receives two arguments, which are functions themselves: <code>resolve</code> should be invoked with the final result when the Promise’s work is done, and <code>reject</code> can be called when there’s an error to make the Promise fail.</p><p>Here’s an updated <code>MyGoFunc</code> that resolves with a message (<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/languages/yoursay/tongue_twisters/italian/trotting_trentonians.shtml">another Italian tongue twister!</a>) after 3 seconds:</p><p>To invoke this from JavaScript:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>MyFunc</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>

<p><span lang="FR">Radix Sort Revisited<o:p></o:p></span></p>





<p><span lang="EN-GB">Pierre <span>Terdiman</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">Last revision: 04.01.2000<o:p></o:p></span></p>





<p><span lang="FR">In every decent
programmer’s toolbox lies a strange weapon called a Radix Sort. Where does it
come from&nbsp;? Who invented it&nbsp;? I don’t know. As far as I can remember
it was there, fast, easy, effective. <i>Really</i> effective. So unbelievably
useful I’ve never really understood why people would want to use something
else. The reasons&nbsp;? Most of the time, they tell me about floats, negative
values, and why their new quick-sort code rocks.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">Enough, I’m tired.
Although the standard Radix Sort doesn’t work very well with floating point
values, this is something actually very easy to fix. In this little article I
will review the standard Radix Sort algorithm, and enhance it so that&nbsp;:<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><!--[if !supportLists]--><span lang="FR"><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span lang="FR">it sorts
negative floats as well<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><!--[if !supportLists]--><span lang="FR"><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span lang="FR">it has
reduced complexity for bytes and words<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><!--[if !supportLists]--><span lang="FR"><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span lang="FR">it uses
temporal coherence<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><!--[if !supportLists]--><span lang="FR"><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span lang="FR">it
supports sorting on multiple keys<o:p></o:p></span></p>











<p><span lang="FR">Is it worth writing
anything in 2000 about a sort routine&nbsp;? Doesn’t everyone already have
one&nbsp;? Aren’t those things already well known&nbsp;? Everyone knows how to
sort negative floats with a Radix, don’t you think&nbsp;?<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">Well, that’s what I
would’ve said some weeks ago. But I recently wandered on Ming C. Lin’s homepage
[2], and began to read her courses. Here’s what I found&nbsp;:<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">«&nbsp;Counting sort
and radix sort are good for integers. For floating point numbers, try bucket
sort or other comparison-based methods&nbsp;» (21 sept. 1999) [3]<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">As you see this is
not very old…I read more of the courses, read some older papers about collision
detection, and it appeared my own way of dealing with a specific part of this
problem was (at least from a theoretical point of view) faster than the
official one. Hence, I think this article will be useful for beginners as well
as for experienced programmers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>











<p><span lang="FR">A Radix Sort is an
apparently bizarre sort routine which manages to sort values without actually
performing any comparisons on input data. That’s why this sort routine breaks
the theoretical lower bound of the O(N*logN) complexity, which only applies for
comparison-based sorts. Radix is O(k*N), with k = 4 most of the time, and
although this is not an in-place sort (i.e. it uses extra storage) it is so
much faster than any other sorting methods it has become a very popular way of sorting
data.<o:p></o:p></span></p>





<p><span lang="FR">The algorithm<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">What is a <i>radix</i>, anyway&nbsp;?<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">Roughly we can say a radix is a position in a number. In the decimal
system, a radix is just a digit in a decimal number. For example the number
«&nbsp;42&nbsp;» has two digits, or two radices, which are 4 and 2. In
hexadecimal the radix is 8 bits wide. For example the hexadecimal number 0xAB
has two radices, A and B. The Radix Sort gets its name from those radices,
because the method first sorts the input values according to their first radix,
then according to the second one, and so on. The Radix Sort is then a multipass
sort, and the number of passes equals the number of radices in the input
values. For example you’ll need 4 passes to sort standard 32 bits integers,
since in hexadecimal the radix is a byte. By the way that’s why the Radix Sort
is often called <i>Byte Sort</i>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">How does it work&nbsp;? Say you want to sort some bytes, for
example&nbsp;those ones:<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">54,
18, 2, 128, 3<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">The idea behind the Radix Sort is to read input values and immediately
store them at the right place.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">Have a look at that sample code&nbsp;:<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>unsigned char InputValues[] = { 54, 18, 2, 128, 3 };<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>int SortedBuffer[256];<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>memset(SortedBuffer, -1, 256*sizeof(int));<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>// Fill with –1<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<pre><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>for(int i=0&nbsp;;i&lt;5&nbsp;;i++){<o:p></o:p></span></pre>

<p><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>unsigned char c = InputValues[i];<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<pre><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>SortedBuffer[c] = c;<o:p></o:p></span></pre>

<p><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>}<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>// Now you can read SortedBuffer and get
values back in sorted order<o:p></o:p></span></p>





<p><span lang="FR">You may think this example is stupid – it <i>is</i>&nbsp;! – but it
nicely introduces the ideas we’ll have to deal with. What do we need to change
in that code, in order for it to become useful&nbsp;? First we need to get rid
of the empty destination locations, so that the destination buffer (called
SortedBuffer in our example) has the same size as the input buffer (i.e. enough
for 5 values, no more). We also need a way to handle collisions – collisions in
the hash-table sense of the word, i.e. we must be able to deal with two equal
input values and know how to store both of them in the final buffer. Luckily
enough, both problems are solved by the same solution&nbsp;: an <i>offset table</i>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">The offset table is a 256-entries table telling us, for each possible
input byte, where we should store the result. It is usually built in two
passes, one to compute the distribution of bytes in the input flow (i.e.
histograms, or <i>counters</i>), another one to create the offset table
according to this distribution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">This sample code&nbsp;creates the counters:<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>int
Counters[256];<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>memset(Counters, 0, 256*sizeof(int));<span>&nbsp; </span>//
Set all counters to 0<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>for(
i =0&nbsp;; i &lt; NbItems&nbsp;; i++){<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>//
Loop over the input array<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>unsigned char c = InputValues[i];<span> </span>//
Get current byte…<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Counters[c]++;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>//
…and update counter<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>}<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">We can now create the offset table&nbsp;:<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<pre><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>int OffsetTable[256];<o:p></o:p></span></pre><pre><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>OffsetTable[0] = 0;<o:p></o:p></span></pre>

<p><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>for(i=1;i&lt;256;i++){<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>OffsetTable[i] = OffsetTable[i-1] +
Counters[i-1];<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>}<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">Now, for each input byte, we can
get the right offset back thanks to this table, put the input byte at the right
place in the destination buffer, increase the offset, and repeat the sequence
for the next byte.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">For example&nbsp;:<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>unsigned char c =
InputValues[i];<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>DestinationBuffer[OffsetTable[c]++] = c;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">The destination buffer won’t have
any empty locations&nbsp;: we have enough room in it for the same number of
values as in the input buffer, no more. Thanks to the offsets we know exactly
where we must store them, and whenever an empty location would have existed in
our first example, here it doesn’t appear because no offset actually maps that
empty location.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">Collisions are not a problem
either because offsets are increased each time we use one of them. If we have
two identical bytes in input, the first one will be put in
DestinationBuffer[Offset], Offset will be increased, and the next one will then
fall in DestinationBuffer[Offset+1]. Radix sort is <i>stable</i> by the way,
which means two same values in input will be in the same order in output.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">This last point is very important
to understand the next step&nbsp;: how can we extend the process in order to
sort not only bytes but also words, dwords, or event character strings&nbsp;?
This is actually very simple&nbsp;: we just have to sort again according to the
next radix. Recall a radix actually is a byte in the values to sort. The first
radix is the LSB (Least Significant Byte). The last one must be the MSB (Most
Significant Byte). Between those two, we perform all necessary passes. The
second pass doesn’t destroy what has been done in the first one because the
sorting method is stable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">Example&nbsp;: say we want to sort
those hexadecimal values&nbsp;:<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">0xBC, 0xAB, 0xBA, 0xAC, 0xBB, 0xAA<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">The first pass leads to&nbsp;:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR">0xBA<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR">0xAA<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR">0xAB<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR">0xBB<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR">0xBC<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR">0xAC<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">Note that the list is sorted
according to the last column (ie the LSB which is the first radix). The second
pass will sort this list according to the first column (ie the MSB, our second
radix) and since the sorting method is stable, the 3 numbers 0xAA, 0xAB and
0xAC which share the same MSB will be found in output in the same order as in
input. And since the input order has been determined by the first sorting pass,
eh, it’s already sorted according to the LSB, and here we are with the final
sorted list&nbsp;:<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">0xAA<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR">0xAB<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR">0xAC<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR">0xBA<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR">0xBB<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR">0xBC<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">Radix selection is
performed by shifting and ANDing the input value according to the pass
number&nbsp;:<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">unsigned
char Radix = (InputValues[i]&gt;&gt;(Pass&lt;&lt;3)) &amp; 0xFF;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">…where pass begins
to 0 and gets increased for each new pass.<o:p></o:p></span></p>







<p><b><span lang="FR">Sorting floating point values<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>



<p><span lang="FR">Ok, that was the
standard Radix Sort, as most of us knew it on old 16 bits computers. What
happened then, was the following&nbsp;: one day, we all switched to 80486 (or
Pentium) and suddenly we had floats. At first sight, a Radix Sort can’t deal
with floats&nbsp;: the inner structure of a float isn’t obvious, you don’t
really see how to shift them or AND a value with them (the algorithm involves
such an operation, as seen just above), you don’t even know how to do it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">The first step is to
learn how a floating-point value is actually built. This is well known
nowadays&nbsp;: the first bit is the sign bit, the next 8 bits are the biased
exponent, and the 23 last ones are the mantissa. The exponent is always
positive thanks to the bias. Chris Hecker once wrote a good introduction paper
to the numerous floating-points tricks you can afford on Intel processors [1].
Let’s quote him&nbsp;:<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">«&nbsp;Because the
exponent are always positive (and are in more significant bits than the
mantissa), large numbers compare greater than small numbers even when the
floating-point values are compared as normal integer bits. The sign bit throws
a monkey wrench in this, but it works great for single-signed values.&nbsp;»<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">I couldn’t have said
that better. And from this point, it is easy to see why it works with positive
floats. Let’s define a function IR(x) as the integer representation of any
floating-point value x. For example the floating-point value 42.0 has a binary
representation of 0x42280000. In other words&nbsp;:<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">IR(42.0)
= 0x42280000<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">The Radix Sort works
with positive floats because for any floating-point values x and y,<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">x
&gt; y &gt;0 =&gt; IR(x) &gt; IR(y)<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">Hence x and y will
be treated by the sorting code as IR(x) and IR(y), and the final order will be
correct. This is easy to check&nbsp;: just cast your float pointer into integer
pointer and ask your code to sort your array of positive floats&nbsp;! It
works. Well, it doesn’t work on DEC Alpha because the float format is
different, but that’s another story&nbsp;: it works provided you use IEEE
floats, which means it works on PC, on Dreamcast, and so on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

They might have multiple phone numbers (hence <code>repeated PhoneNumber</code>), e.g. for their home, their mobile and work.</p><div><p><span>example.proto</span></p><div><pre><p><span>message </span><span>Person</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  required string name </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  required int32 id </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  optional string email </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>3</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>enum</span><span> </span><span>PhoneType</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>MOBILE</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>HOME</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>WORK</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>  message </span><span>PhoneNumber</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    required string number </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    optional </span><span>PhoneType</span><span> type </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>default</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>HOME</span><span>]</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>  repeated </span><span>PhoneNumber</span><span> phones </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>4</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></pre></div></div><p>Note here within the schema for a <code>Person</code> message, we also <strong>number</strong> the fields (<code>=1</code>, <code>=2</code>, <code>=3</code>, <code>=4</code>). This allows us to add fields later without altering the existing ordering of fields (so you can continue to parse these fields without having to know about new fields).</p><p>Every time we want to add a new “type” of field, we define a schema (just like how you might define a class to add a new type of object). We can even define a schema within another schema, e.g. within the schema for a <code>Person</code>, we defined the schema for the <code>PhoneNumber</code> field.</p><p>We can also define the schema for an <strong>enum</strong> type <code>PhoneType</code>. This enum acted as a “tag” for our phone number.</p><p>Now, just as you might want a field to be one of many options (specified by the enum type), you might want the message to contain exactly one of many fields.</p><p>For example in our compiler we might want to encode an identifier as <em>one of two options</em>. Here we don’t want to store data in an index field if we’ve tagged it as a <code>Variable</code>.</p><div><p><span><a href="https://github.com/mukul-rathi/bolt/blob/master/src/frontend/ir_gen/frontend_ir.mli"> <!-- -->frontend_ir.mli</a></span></p><div><pre><p><span>type</span><span> identifier </span><span>=</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>Variable</span><span> </span><span>of</span><span> string</span></p><p><span>    </span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>ObjField</span><span> </span><span>of</span><span> string </span><span>*</span><span> index </span></p></pre></div></div><p>In our protobuf, we can add fields for each of these options, and use the keyword <code>oneof</code> to specify that only one of the fields in that group will be set at once.</p><p>Now, whilst this tells Protobuf that one of those values is set, we have no way of telling which one of them is set.

We:</p><ul><li>Add a tag field to specify the constructor the value has.</li><li>Define a message schema if a constructor has multiple arguments e.g for <code>ObjField</code>. If the constructor has only one argument (<code>Variable</code>) we don’t need to.</li><li>Specify a <code>oneof</code> block containing the fields for each of the constructors.</li></ul><p>We could manually write out all of the schema, but we’d have to rewrite these every time our language changed.
However we have a hidden weapon up our sleeve - a library that will do this for us!</p><h3 id="ppx-deriving-protobuf"><a href="#ppx-deriving-protobuf" aria-label="ppx deriving protobuf permalink"></a>PPX Deriving Protobuf</h3><p>OCaml allows libraries to extend its syntax using a <strong>ppx</strong> hook. The ppx libraries can preprocess the files using these hooks to extend the language functionality. So we can tag our files with other information, such as which types need to have a protobuf schema generated.</p><p>We can update our Dune build file to preprocess our <code>ir_gen</code> library with the ppx-deriving protobuf library:</p><div><p><span><a href="https://github.com/mukul-rathi/bolt/blob/master/src/frontend/ir_gen/dune"> <!-- -->dune</a></span></p><div><pre><p><span>(</span><span>library</span></p><p><span> </span><span>(</span><span>name ir</span><span>_</span><span>gen</span><span>)</span><span></span></p><p><span> </span><span>(</span><span>public</span><span>_</span><span>name ir</span><span>_</span><span>gen</span><span>)</span><span></span></p><p><span> </span><span>(</span><span>libraries core fmt desugaring ast</span><span>)</span><span></span></p><p><span> </span><span>(</span><span>flags</span></p><p><span>  </span><span>(</span><span>:</span><span>standard </span><span>-</span><span>w </span><span>-</span><span>39</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span></span></p><p><span> </span><span>(</span><span>preprocess</span></p><p><span>  </span><span>(</span><span>pps ppx</span><span>_</span><span>deriving</span><span>_</span><span>protobuf bisect</span><span>_</span><span>ppx </span><span>--</span><span>conditional</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></p></pre></div></div><p>Note the flags command suppresses warning 39 - “unused <code>rec</code> flag” - since the code the ppx_deriving_protobuf library generates raises a lot of those warnings. I would highly recommend that you also suppress these warnings!</p><p>An aside, <code>bisect_ppx</code> is the tool we use to calculate test coverage. It has a <code>--conditional</code> flag since we don’t want to preprocess the file with coverage info if we’re not computing the test coverage.</p><p>Telling PPX deriving protobuf that we want to serialise a type definition is easy - we just stick a <code>[@@deriving protobuf]</code> at the end of our type definition. For variant types, we have to specify a <code>[@key 1]</code>, <code>[@key 2]</code> for each of the variants.</p><p>For example, for our <code>identifier</code> type definition in our <code>.mli</code> file:</p><div><p><span><a href="https://github.com/mukul-rathi/bolt/blob/master/src/frontend/ir_gen/frontend_ir.mli"> <!-- -->frontend_ir.mli</a></span></p><div><pre><p><span>type</span><span> identifier </span><span>=</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>Variable</span><span> </span><span>of</span><span> string </span><span>[</span><span>@</span><span>key </span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>ObjField</span><span> </span><span>of</span><span> string </span><span>*</span><span> int </span><span>[</span><span>@</span><span>key </span><span>2</span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>[</span><span>@@</span><span>deriving protobuf</span><span>]</span></p></pre></div></div><p>We do the same thing in the <code>.ml</code> file, except we also specify the file to which we want to write the protobuf schema.</p><div><p><span><a href="https://github.com/mukul-rathi/bolt/blob/master/src/frontend/ir_gen/frontend_ir.ml"> <!-- -->frontend_ir.ml</a></span></p><div><pre><p><span>type</span><span> identifier </span><span>=</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>Variable</span><span> </span><span>of</span><span> string </span><span>[</span><span>@</span><span>key </span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>ObjField</span><span> </span><span>of</span><span> string </span><span>*</span><span> int </span><span>[</span><span>@</span><span>key </span><span>2</span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>[</span><span>@@</span><span>deriving protobuf </span><span>{</span><span>protoc</span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"../../frontend_ir.proto"</span><span>}</span><span>]</span></p></pre></div></div><p>This path is relative to the src file <code>frontend_ir.ml</code>. So since this <code>frontend_ir.ml</code> file is in the <code>src/frontend/ir_gen/</code> folder of the repo, the protobuf schema file will be written to <code>src/frontend_ir.proto</code>. If you don’t specify a file path to the <code>protoc</code> argument, then the <code>.proto</code> file will be written to the <code>_build</code> folder.</p><p>One extra tip, the ppx deriving protobuf library won’t serialise lists of lists. For example you can’t have:</p><div><div><pre><p><span>type</span><span> something </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Foo</span><span> </span><span>of</span><span> foo list list </span><span>[</span><span>@</span><span>key </span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>@@</span><span>deriving protobuf</span><span>]</span><span>)</span></p></pre></div></div><p>This is because if we have a message schema for <code>foo</code>, then to get a field of type <code>foo list</code> is straightforward - we use <code>repeated foo</code> in our field schema. But we can’t say <code>repeated repeated foo</code> to get a list of a list of type foo. So to get around this, you’d have to define another type here:</p><div><div><pre><p><span>type</span><span> list</span><span>_</span><span>of</span><span>_</span><span>foo </span><span>=</span><span> foo list </span><span>[</span><span>@@</span><span>deriving protobuf</span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>type</span><span> something </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Foo</span><span> </span><span>of</span><span> list</span><span>_</span><span>of</span><span>_</span><span>foo list </span><span>[</span><span>@</span><span>key </span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>@@</span><span>deriving protobuf</span><span>]</span></p></pre></div></div><p>Finally, to serialise our Bolt IR using this schema, PPX deriving protobuf provides us with <code>&lt;type_name&gt;_to_protobuf</code> serialisation functions. We use this to get a binary protobuf message that we write to an output channel (<code>out_chan</code>) as a sequence of bytes.</p><div><p><span><a href="https://github.com/mukul-rathi/bolt/blob/master/src/frontend/ir_gen/ir_gen_protobuf.ml"> <!-- -->ir_gen_protobuf.ml</a></span></p><div><pre><p><span>let</span><span> ir</span><span>_</span><span>gen</span><span>_</span><span>protobuf program out</span><span>_</span><span>chan </span><span>=</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>let</span><span> protobuf</span><span>_</span><span>message </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Protobuf</span><span>.</span><span>Encoder</span><span>.</span><span>encode</span><span>_</span><span>exn program</span><span>_</span><span>to</span><span>_</span><span>protobuf program </span><span>in</span><span></span></p><p><span>    output</span><span>_</span><span>bytes out</span><span>_</span><span>chan protobuf</span><span>_</span><span>message</span></p></pre></div></div><p>In our overall Bolt compiler pipeline, I write the output to a <code>.ir</code> file if provided, or to <code>stdout</code>:</p><div><p><span><a href="https://github.com/mukul-rathi/bolt/blob/master/src/frontend/compile_program_ir.ml"> <!-- -->compile_program_ir.ml</a></span></p><div><pre><p><span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span><span></span></p><p><span> </span><span>match</span><span> compile</span><span>_</span><span>out</span><span>_</span><span>file </span><span>with</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>Some</span><span> file</span><span>_</span><span>name </span><span>-&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>Out_channel</span><span>.</span><span>with</span><span>_</span><span>file file</span><span>_</span><span>name </span><span>~f</span><span>:</span><span>(</span><span>fun</span><span> file</span><span>_</span><span>oc </span><span>-&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>            ir</span><span>_</span><span>gen</span><span>_</span><span>protobuf program file</span><span>_</span><span>oc</span><span>)</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>None</span><span>           </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> ir</span><span>_</span><span>gen</span><span>_</span><span>protobuf program stdout </span><span>)</span></p></pre></div></div><h3 id="auto-generated-protobuf-schema"><a href="#auto-generated-protobuf-schema" aria-label="auto generated protobuf schema permalink"></a>Auto-generated Protobuf Schema</h3><p>The <a href="https://github.com/ocaml-ppx/ppx_deriving_protobuf">README</a> of the repository for the PPX Deriving Library has a thorough explanation of the mapping. We’ve already gone through an example of the autogenerated schema, so the schema shouldn’t be too unfamiliar. There was a slight modification I made though. For (<code>ObjField of string * int</code>) I said the generated output was:</p><div><div><pre><p><span>message _ObjField {</span></p><p><span>    required string objName = 1;</span></p><p><span>    required int64 fieldIndex = 2;</span></p><p><span>  }</span></p></pre></div></div><p>This is unfortunately not quite true. I put in the objName and fieldIndex for clarity, but the library doesn’t know what the semantic meaning of <code>string * int</code> is, so instead it looks like:</p><div><div><pre><p><span>message _ObjField {</span></p><p><span>    required string _0 = 1;</span></p><p><span>    required int64 _1 = 2;</span></p><p><span>  }</span></p></pre></div></div><p>That’s the downside of the autogenerated schema. You get the generic field names <code>_0</code>, <code>_1</code>, <code>_2</code> and so on instead of <code>objName</code> and <code>fieldIndex</code>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://www.scraperapi.com/?fp_ref=box-piper-app">Scraper API</a> provides a proxy service designed for web scraping. With over 20 million residential IPs across 12 countries, as well as software that can handle JavaScript rendering and solving CAPTCHAs, you can quickly complete large scraping jobs without ever having to worry about being blocked by any servers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.scraperapi.com/?fp_ref=box-piper-app" target="_blank">
<img src="https://www.boxpiper.com/779cab4c054e767248e43be74fabf94c/scraperapi-1.gif">
</a></p><p>Implementation is extremely simple, and they offer unlimited bandwidth. Proxies are automatically rotated, but users can choose to maintain sessions if required. All you need to do is call the API with the URL that you want to scrape, and it will return the raw HTML. With Scraper API, you just focus on parsing the data, and they’ll handle the rest.</p>
<p>As per data, they have handled 5 billion API requests per month for over 1,500 businesses and developers around the world</p>
<figure>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
            Having built many web scrapers, we repeatedly went through the tiresome process of finding proxies, setting up headless browsers, and handling CAPTCHAs. That's why we decided to start Scraper API, it handles all of this for you so you can scrape any page with a simple API call!
        </p>
        
	</blockquote>
</figure>
<p>One of the most frustrating parts of automated web scraping is constantly dealing with IP blocks and CAPTCHAs. ScrapperAPI handles it beautifully.
You can customize request headers, request type, IP geo-location and more. They automatically prune slow proxies from our pools periodically, and guarantee unlimited bandwidth with speeds up to 100Mb/s, perfect for writing speedy web crawlers.</p>
<p>Features loaded:</p>
<ul>
<li>Over 20 million residential IPs in the pool</li>
<li>Simple dashboard to manage usage and billing</li>
<li>Geo-targeting: target 12+ countries around the world</li>
<li>Free plan with 1000 requests &amp; all features</li>
<li>Seven-day, no questions asked refund policy</li>
<li>24/7 support and great customer service</li>
<li>Rotating and sticky IP sessions</li>
<li>Easy setup</li>
<li>Able to render JavaScript pages</li>
<li>Custom browser headers</li>
<li>Premium proxy pools</li>
<li>Auto-extraction of data from popular sites</li>
</ul>
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>When you sign up for Scraper API you are given an access key. All you need to do is call the API with your key and the URL that you want to scrape, and you will receive the raw HTML of the page as a result. It’s as simple as:</p>
<div data-language="sh"><pre><code>curl "http: ; //api.scraperapi.com?api_key=XYZ&amp;url=http://httpbin.org/ip"</code></pre></div>
<p>On the back end, when Scraper API receives your request, their service accesses the URL via one of their proxy servers, gets the data, and then sends it back to you.</p>
<h2>Basic Usage</h2>
<p>Scraper API exposes a single API endpoint, simply send a GET request to <a href="http://api.scraperapi.com/">http://api.scraperapi.com</a> with two query string parameters, api_key which contains your API key, and url which contains the url you would like to scrape.</p>

		<p>
            In social psychology, the pratfall effect is the tendency for interpersonal appeal to increase or decrease after an individual makes a mistake, depending on the individual's perceived ability to perform well in a general sense. An individual perceived to be highly competent would be considered more likable after committing a blunder, while a perceived average individual would be considered less likable.

<p>When a person makes a mistake or acts in a clumsy way that might even make people laugh, they are found to be more likeable, including in comparison with people who are more intelligent and clever.</p>
<p>When you make a mistake, you appear more human, more like others and so more likeable. People who are perfect can seem threatening, but people who are imperfect are safe and hence easier to truly like.</p>

<p>We can observe the truth of the Pratfall Effect with the famous film actress Jennifer Lawrence. Widely touted for her talent and beauty, she is also known for her gaffes, such as falling down at red carpet events and speaking brashly in interviews. Yet Lawrence is commonly considered a “down-to-earth” celebrity and regularly celebrated for her likeability.</p>

<h2>Revelation</h2>
<p>The Pratfall Effect experiment revealed three major social truths:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It’s OK to be fallible.</p>
<ul>
<li>If a person is generally considered smart and capable, committing a small mistake will generally make them more socially attractive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If individuals are considered average or mediocre, they are more likely to be negatively impacted by their mistake.</li>
<li>
<p>The ultimate effects of pratfalls are contextual.</p>
<ul>
<li>Subsequent studies have discovered that pratfalls are perceived differently based on other factors, including gender.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ending Note</h2>
<p>If you want to be liked, make mistakes sometimes (or just admit to error), though do be careful to make it in an area which is unimportant and which will not make people think you are incapable in areas where they need your ability.</p>

<p>I was talking to my friend Josh a couple weeks ago about the speed at which teams move and how best managers can create a sense of urgency. We pretty quickly agreed that there are two types of urgency for a team: push-based and pull-based.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Is your urgency push-based or pull-based?</p><p>It's a thought-provoking management question.</p><p>Ex: Arbitrary deadline=push, Excitement=pull</p><p>Does this division make sense? What other kinds of urgency are there?</p></div>— Joshua Levy (@ojoshe) <a href="https://twitter.com/ojoshe/status/1309279621448310786?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 24, 2020</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>I felt like this is an important delineation, and wanted to summarize our conversation a little, just by giving some examples.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Team:</strong><ul><li><strong>Push-based: </strong>You hire people who will what is asked of them, and nothing more.</li><li><strong>Pull-based: </strong>You hire people who are conscientious and self-motivated, and if they aren’t being pushed, they will push themselves and everyone around them.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Goals:</strong><ul><li><strong>Push-based: </strong>The team has “soul-less” goals like “get X done by Y” or “increase metric Y by Z”.</li><li><strong>Pull-based: </strong>The team clearly understands the value of what they are building and are excited about making it real.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Road-blocks:</strong><ul><li><strong>Push-based:</strong> Team members constantly lose momentum because they run into obstacles that are beyond their control.</li><li><strong>Pull-based: </strong>The “path is paved”, so-to-speak. Team members might face obstacles, but they are either empowered to clear those obstacles or have access to executives that can clear the obstacles for them.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Deadlines:</strong><ul><li><strong>Push-based:</strong> Arbitrary deadlines like “our exec wants this done by Friday”.</li><li><strong>Pull-based:</strong> Self-imposed deadlines like “this should take 2 weeks, and we will hold ourselves accountable to that”.</li></ul></li></ul>



<p>We actually discussed deadlines a little bit, and as Josh always does he broke out a few dimensions:</p>



<ul><li>Deadlines can be artificial or real. An artificial deadline is one in which there will be no repercussions if the deadline is missed, and a real one has repercussions.</li><li>Deadlines can be superimposed or self-imposed. A team can decide a deadline for itself, or someone (typically more senior) can decide a deadline for them.</li><li>Deadlines can be evident or arbitrary. An evident deadline might be “if we don’t build our product by November, we’ll miss out on the holiday season orders.”</li></ul>



<p>So a deadline that is real, superimposed, and arbitrary, could be something like “If you don’t accomplish this by end-of-month, you will be fired.”</p>



<p>Someone once told me that managers push and leaders pull. Plenty of people, companies, and teams have gotten results with very “push-based” urgencies, but if you ask someone which type of urgency they prefer on their team, they’ll likely say “pull-based”. Which is an interesting point to ponder.</p>

<p>Omnipedia went live on September 28th 2049, with Hsiung and Xu taking part in a press conference to celebrate its public launch. They described Omnipedia's mission statement as "offering an easily accessible primary source of balanced, responsible, and accurate information about anything and everything." Although it was initially hinted that some of Wikipedia's content would be carried over to Omnipedia for its initial launch, Hsiung stated that this turned out to be infeasible due to the copyright issues that had led to Wikipedia ceasing operations on April 13th 2048. As a result, Omnipedia will feature fully original content.<sup id="backreference-2"><a href="#reference-2">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>Following Omnipedia's announcement on June 18th 2049, some criticism was levelled at its purported status as a successor to Wikipedia.

                    <p><a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/brain/awaa238">A study which has just been published in the leading neurology journal Brain</a>,  indicates that Parkinson's disease is not one but two diseases, starting either in the brain or in the intestines.</p>

<p>These two groups of patients displayed strikingly different profiles on multimodal imaging battery.</p>

<p>These profiles support the existence of a brain-first and body-first subtype of Parkinson’s disease, and furthermore, that premotor rapid eye movement sleep (REM) sleep behaviour disorder is a highly predictive marker of the body-first subtype.
<img src="https://scx1.b-cdn.net/csz/news/800/2019/wheredoespar.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<p>Neuropathological autopsy studies of patients with Parkinson’s disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, or incidental Lewy body disease have shown discrepant results.</p>

<p>Heiko Braak’s staging system was derived from a cohort of patients, who were selected based on the presence of Lewy pathology in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, and all these patients conformed to a brainstem predominant type.</p>

<p>Other studies reported that some post-mortem cases do not harbour Lewy pathology in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, and a minority of patients do not follow the Braak staging scheme.</p>

<p>A pathological hallmark of Parkinson’s disease is the presence of intraneuronal a-synuclein inclusions termed Lewy pathology. However, it remains unknown from where the initial a-synuclein aggregates originate.</p>

<p>It has been hypothesized that a-synuclein inclusions initially form in nerve terminals of the enteric nervous system, and then subsequently spread via autonomic connections to the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus and intermediolateral cell columns of the sympathetic system (Braak et al., 2003).</p>

<p>In addition, Lewy pathology has been detected in gastrointestinal nerve fibres years prior to Parkinson’s disease diagnosis.
There is also epidemiological evidence that complete but not partial vagotomy may protect against later Parkinson’s disease.</p>

<p>Autopsy studies have shown that a minority of cases with Lewy pathology do not have pathological inclusions in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, and that a fraction of cases display a limbic-predominant distribution of a-synuclein inclusions with less pathology in the brainstem.</p>

<p>The scientists hypothesized that the appearance of isolated REM sleep behaviour disorder well before parkinsonism is a strong marker of the body-first subtype. The presence of REM sleep behaviour disorder in the premotor phase is a marker of the body-first type, probably a reflection of ascending a-synuclein pathology reaching the pons before the substantia nigra.

<p>To test this hypothesis, they recruited de novo patients with Parkinson’s disease and performed video-polysomnography to divide patients into de novo Parkinson’s disease without REM sleep behaviour disorder and de novo Parkinson’s disease with pre-motor REM sleep behaviour disorder. The study was conducted between August 2018 and January 2020.</p>

<p>The scientists have shown that prodromal and de novo patients with Parkinson’s disease can be categorized by means of multimodal imaging into distinct clusters, which are compatible with a brain-first and body-first Parkinson’s disease subtype.</p>

<p>Their conclusion is that the Parkinson’s disease comprises two subtypes: 
(i) a body-first (bottom-up) subtype, where the pathology originates in the enteric or peripheral autonomic nervous system, and then ascends via the vagus nerve and sympathetic connectome to the CNS;</p>

<p>(ii) a brain-first (top-down) subtype, in which the a-synuclein pathology initially arises in the brain itself or sometimes enters via the ol- factory bulb, and subsequently descends to the peripheral autonomic nervous system.</p>

<p><strong>Body-first (bottom-up) subtype:</strong>
The initial a-synuclein pathology appears in the enteric or peripheral autonomic nervous system. It then propagates via the sympathetic connectome to the heart, and via the vagus nerve to the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus.

<p>Ascending pathology affects pontine structures giving rise to REM sleep behaviour disorder before the substantia nigra shows substantial involvement.
When parkinsonism appears, signifying a loss of 450% of nigrostriatal dopamine terminals, all lower Braak stage structures show marked damage on relevant imaging markers.</p>

<p><strong>Brain-first (top-down) subtype:</strong>
 In the brain-first type, the initial a-synuclein pathology appears in the CNS.
The most likely site of origin seems to be the amygdala or connected structures, or the pathology may in some cases enter via the olfactory bulb.
Rarely, the pathology arises in the upper brainstem (substantia nigra or locus coeruleus).
The pathology spreads from the site of origin to the brainstem and cortex.
When parkinsonism appears, the brainstem shows a rostro-caudal gradient of pathology with marked involvement of the substantia nigra, moderate involvement of the neighbouring pons, but little involvement of the medulla and autonomic nervous system.</p>

        <p>Git is a free and open source distributed Version Control System (VCS). Git can
be hard, especially for people discovering it for the first time, but there are
a lot of things that make this an exceptional VCS worth learning. This post is
not meant to be a git tutorial, but rather a compilation of things and tips I
find interesting. I also wanted to give a perspective of git independent of
services like GitHub. Hopefully you can find something useful and “<em>git better
at it</em>” 🙃.</p>

<p>If you’re looking to learn how to use git, take a look at the <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/">Pro Git
book</a>, it’s free and it is a great resource!</p>

<h2 id="git-is-not-github-">Git is not GitHub 😮</h2>

<p>Services like <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> made git particularly popular, but
the convenience of something like Github has its downsides for new users: it
causes confusion about the differences between <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> or
<a href="https://gitlab.com/">GitLab</a>, and the actual version control system, <em>git</em>.
While the former are great to host git repositories and make them publicly
available (among other things), git is a piece of software designed to allow for
distributed version control and collaboration. This means that you can use it
offline, without GitHub, you can collaborate with people via chat, email, and
anything that allows you to send text to someone else. Yes, GitHub makes it
convenient to host your project and make it discoverable; it provides an
incentive for collaboration, but, at the end of the day, GitHub is not git, just
as Gmail is not e-mail.</p>

<h2 id="git-is-distributed-">Git is distributed 🖧</h2>

<p>For those used to GitHub, collaborating with git over e-mail might seem
anachronistic, but, consider the scale of projects and what git was designed to
do. Being able to send contributions as plain text allied with the threaded
nature of e-mail, means that you can have multiple discussions around certain
aspects of a contribution, which is a big plus. Linux kernel development, for
example, doesn’t happen on GitHub or GitLab. From the linux kernel GitHub Pull
requests (GitHub’s system for submitting contributions):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thanks for your contribution to the Linux kernel!</p>

  <p>Linux kernel development happens on mailing lists, rather than on GitHub -
this GitHub repository is a read-only mirror that isn’t used for accepting
contributions. So that your change can become part of Linux, please email it
to us as a patch.</p>

  <p>Sending patches isn’t quite as simple as sending a pull request, but
fortunately it is a well documented process.</p>

  <p>Here’s what to do:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Format your contribution according to kernel requirements</li>
    <li>Decide who to send your contribution to</li>
    <li>Set up your system to send your contribution as an email</li>
    <li>Send your contribution and wait for feedback</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>The development happens on various mailing lists for multiple subsystems. It’s
distributed development to an unprecedented scale. This scale has a price,
discipline in your contributions, something that GitHub doesn’t really help
reinforce –which seems to be the whole
<a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/pull/17#issuecomment-5654674">issue</a> that the
creator of git Linus Torvalds has with it.</p>

<h3 id="git-daemon-">Git daemon 🌐</h3>

<p>Focusing the development on a centralised service like GitHub can feel like
you’re using an improved version of Subversion client/server approach, but
remember, git is truly a decentralized system and we can do better. Suppose you
don’t want to use GitHub, but want to make your repository available for other
people to clone, pull from, etc. Git supports Peer-to-Peer setup out of the box
with <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-Git-Daemon"><code>git
daemon</code></a>.
Collaboration then happens on each peer local copy of the source tree and some
form of communication channel (e.g. e-mail, chat, etc).</p>

<p>From your git folder you can execute the following command</p>

<div><div><pre><code>git daemon <span>--export-all</span> <span>--base-path</span><span>=</span><span>.</span> <span>--reuseaddr</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li><code>--enable=upload-pack</code>: (enabled by default) allows for <code>git fetch</code>, <code>git pull</code>, and <code>git clone</code>.</li>
  <li><code>--export-all</code>: means that you don’t have to create a file named git-daemon-export-ok in each exported repository.</li>
  <li><code>--base-path</code>: allows people to clone projects without specifying the entire
path. Example: if you start the daemon with <code>--base-path=/srv/git</code> and try to
pull from <code>git://example.com/hello.git</code>, git daemon will interpret the path as
<code>/srv/git/hello.git</code>.</li>
  <li><code>--reuseaddr</code>: allows the server to restart without waiting for old connections to time out.</li>
</ul>

<p>Congratulations, your machine is now running a git server and anyone can do:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>git clone git://192.168.1.42/  <span>#Your IP</span>
<span># or</span>
git remote add Foo git://192.168.1.42/
git fetch Foo
git checkout develop
git push Foo develop
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="git-patches-">Git patches 📝</h3>

<p>As we have discussed, git is a decentralized system, you can send contributions
to anyone without the need of a centralized git repository. This is not only the
default way of collaborating with git, it is particularly useful when a server
is down, or if you don’t have permissions to write to a remote repository
—but would still like to propose changes.</p>

<p>You can create a patch from your current changes without committing the code on
your source tree:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># changes in the working tree not yet staged for commit</span>
git diff <span>&gt;</span> big-improvements.patch
<span># or changes between the index and your last commit;</span>
<span># what you would be committing if you run "git commit"</span>
<span># without "-a" option.</span>
git diff <span>--cached</span> <span>&gt;</span> big-improvements.patch
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As an example suppose the change is the addition of a README file, the diff
would look like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>diff --git a/README b/README
</span><span>new file mode 100644
</span><span>index 0000000..e69de29
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>More often, what we would like to do is to propose a change we have made in your
local source tree. To do this, we can use the <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-format-patch"><code>git
format-patch</code></a> command:</p>



<p>if we have commits ahead of the master branch, a diff file will be generated. We can also reference other commits in the same branch.
Suppose we made changes in the current branch and want to reference the changes in relation to the last commit. We can do:</p>



<p>the patch file will contain something like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>From daf1010eb425a67ca6b0ba60f7cbec15bcff31f1 Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001
From: John Doe &lt;heresjohnny@bestmail.com&gt;
Date: Tue, 09 Sep 2020 15:42:00 +0100
Subject: [PATCH] Update README
</span>
---
 README | 1 +
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)

diff --git a/README b/README
<span>index e69de29..d0fc019 100644
</span><span>--- a/README

</span><span>@@ -0,0 +1 @@</span>
<span>+This is a README file, that is all.
</span><span>--
</span><span>2.28.0
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>to apply the patch we do:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># patch as unstaged changes in your branch</span>
git apply 0001-Update-README.patch

<span># patch as commits</span>
git am 0001-Update-README.patch
</code></pre></div></div>

<!-- 
### git request-pull ✉️

Git comes with its own [pull request
module](https://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-request-pull).

This feature has nothing to do with [GitHubs pull
request](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/creating-an-issue-or-pull-request).
It's mean to facilitate the creation of summary messages to be sent through
e-mail for example. If you want to use GitHubs pull request feature without the
web interface, check out the [hub](https://hub.github.com/) command line interface tool.
{: .notice--danger}

Imagine that you built your work on your master branch on top of the v1.0
release, and want it to be integrated to the project. First you push that change
to your public repository for others to see. If this is a remote repository you might do it like this:

```bash
git push https://bestgitserver.com/project master
```

Then we run the following command:

```bash
git request-pull v1.0 https://bestgitserver.com/project master
```

This will produce a request message with information about:

 1. where to pull from (your downstream repository address)
 2. the upstream repository
 3. a summary of the changes between v1.0 release and your master.

You can then send this request by e-mail for instance, making the pull request
completely distributed and independent from GitHub proprietary system.
-->

<h2 id="git-tips-">Git tips 🔥</h2>

<p>We are all bound to get stuck sometimes when things go wrong. A good starting
point is this <a href="https://ohshitgit.com/">compilation</a>. These are solutions to
problems I often have to solve.</p>

<h3 id="premature-commit-">Premature commit 🔧</h3>

<p>You pulled the trigger too fast on that commit and wish you could include
additional changes? Make your changes, call <code>git commit --amend</code> and done. (Also
useful to change the commit message.)</p>

<h3 id="go-back-">Go back ⌛</h3>

<p>We messed up, go back to a previous commit.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># go back n commits n=1 in this case,</span>
<span># --soft: optionally don't discard changes</span>
<span># and put them on the staging area instead</span>
git reset HEAD~1 <span>--soft</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="put-changes-on-hold-">Put changes on hold 🚧</h3>

<p>So you want to get back to the state before you started making changes, but
don’t want to throw these changes away:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># stash the changes</span>
git stash
<span># get the changes back when needed</span>
git stash pop
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="where-it-went-wrong-">Where it went wrong 🔍</h3>

<p>You have a problem and don’t know which commit introduced it, enter <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bisect"><code>git bisect</code></a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>git bisect start          <span># start a bisect section</span>
git bisect bad            <span># Current version is bad</span>
git bisect good v2.2.1    <span># v2.2.1 is known to be good</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>bisect will now choose commits in the middle of the history and you can mark
them as good or bad with the same commands. When no more revisions are available
you’ll have a description of the commit that caused the problem. You can then reset
the bisect state with <code>git bisect reset</code>.</p>

<h3 id="rebasing-commits-">Rebasing commits 💥</h3>

<p>Sometimes we make two commits when in reality, we could have included all the
changes in a single commit, and our history would be clearer. This is what is
known as <em>squashing</em>. We can use <code>git rebase</code> to meld commits with previous
commits. It can also be used instead of merging branches. Git’s rebase command
temporarily rewinds the commits on your current branch, pulls in the commits
from the other reference and reapplies the re-winded commits back on top.</p>

<p>Most people will advise you to always squash the commits and rebase them onto
the parent branch (like master or develop) before you submit a pull request or
send out a patch. Whether rebasing is preferred to merging really depends on the
context.</p>

<p>If you want to read more about <code>rebase</code> vs <code>merge</code>, check out <a href="https://medium.com/hackernoon/mastering-git-why-rebase-is-amazing-a954485b128a">this
post</a></p>

<p>Whatever you do <strong>DO NOT</strong> rebase commits in a upstream repository people can
pull from. It will mess everyone’s history and lead to conflicts that all
downstream peers will need to fix.
Also, it’s <strong>never</strong> a good idea to <strong>rebase somebody else’s work</strong>, see <a href="https://yarchive.net/comp/linux/git_rebase.html">this
discussion</a>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># rebase last 2 commits</span>
git rebase <span>-i</span> HEAD~2
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The interactive system will open an editor where you can choose each commit in a
list that are about to be changed. In this case, it will list 2 lines with the
last 2 commits. This list reflects exactly how your branch will look like after
the rebase:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>pick c8175df added line
pick dc58443 added final line

<span># Rebase 65e38e0..dc58443 onto 65e38e0 (2 commands)</span>
<span>#</span>
<span># Commands:</span>
<span># p, pick &lt;commit&gt; = use commit</span>
<span># r, reword &lt;commit&gt; = use commit, but edit the commit message</span>
<span># r, reword &lt;commit&gt; = use commit, but edit the commit message</span>
<span># s, squash &lt;commit&gt; = meld into previous commit</span>
<span># f, fixup &lt;commit&gt; = like "squash", but discard log message</span>
<span># ...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can pick, reorder or squash any commits you want to make for a more readable
history.</p>

<p>As we discussed, you can also rebase the current branch onto another</p>

<div><div><pre><code>git checkout feature
git rebase <span>-i</span> master
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For more information about rebase see the <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase">documentation</a></p>

<h3 id="good-commit-messages-">Good commit messages 🧐</h3>

<p>Commit messages should be consistent across a project in terms of <strong>style</strong>,
<strong>content</strong>, and <strong>metadata</strong>. But some good rules are as follows:</p>

<ol>

October 3, 2020 | https://www.btao.org/2020/10/02/npm-trust.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.btao.org/2020/10/02/npm-trust.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>In 1984 the co-inventor of Unix, Ken Thompson, delivered a seminal speech in which he highlighted that <em>you can’t trust code that you did not totally create yourself</em> <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. For a while, this lesson was largely ignored as open-source package registries like RubyGems, PyPI and npm grew rapidly. However, as we’re seeing <a href="https://blog.reversinglabs.com/blog/mining-for-malicious-ruby-gems" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more</a> <a href="https://blog.npmjs.org/post/185397814280/plot-to-steal-cryptocurrency-foiled-by-the-npm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">and</a> <a href="https://snyk.io/blog/a-post-mortem-of-the-malicious-event-stream-backdoor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more</a> supply-chain attacks through software dependencies, the risks of using unvetted dependencies are becoming clearer.</p>

<p>The risks are particularly great for JavaScript applications. Veracode found that the average JavaScript project relies on 377 dependencies – compared with just 16 for Python projects, or 43 in the Java ecosystem<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. Whenever a developer pulls in a new dependency, they are implicitly trusting the maintainers of that dependency. Often, this trust is awarded on the basis of popularity – we assume that a popular library will be more carefully vetted, or that since many others trust the maintainers, we can too. Other times, this trust relationship and the risks involved are not considered at all.</p>

<p><a href="https://sambleckley.com/writing/npm.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Some have argued</a> that the ill health of the npm registry is a social, rather than a technical problem, and suggest a human-compiled set of packages in order to separate the wheat of maintained, healthy packages from the chaff of abandoned toy projects with no documentation. <a href="https://medium.com/@dpc_96143/cargo-crev-and-rust-2019-fearless-code-reuse-b75d58398cb8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Another suggestion from the Rust world</a> involves creating a manual web of trust from maintainers cryptographically signing each other’s projects. Either way, there are challenges: webs of trust have rarely taken off (outside of Debian), and compiling a vetted set of packages from scratch is a massive undertaking. I propose something in the middle: bootstrapping a web of trust using existing npm dependency relationships, and building from that foundation.</p>

<h2 id="existing-trust-relationships-in-npm">Existing trust relationships in npm</h2>

<p>Creating a web of trust from existing npm dependencies is, admittedly, somewhat problematic. As stated earlier, choosing to use a particular dependency is not always a well-considered decision based on researching its code and maintainers, and the trust relationship is merely implied. Similarly, there is no cryptographic verification of this weak trust, nor does npm currently have the infrastructure for such tools<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>. What I am suggesting is an imperfect starting point to demonstrate the need for, and potential of, stronger trust measures in open source.</p>

<p>To construct this initial web, we can model npm’s maintainerships as a graph. If we let each node be a maintainer, then the edges between them are the trust relationship arising from using a dependency. In other words, if Alice maintains a package A, and A depends on package B maintained by Bob, then there is a directed edge from Alice to Bob. We can even weigh these edges by the number of Alice’s packages in which she implies trust of Bob.</p>

<h2 id="exploring-the-graph">Exploring the graph</h2>

<p>This simple model exhibits a power-law-like pattern in terms of trust: the vast majority of users are trusted by few or no others, and a very small number of users are highly trusted. This type of pattern is common in social networks: you see a similar thing emerge when plotting follower counts on Twitter. Such power laws often lead to a rich-get-richer feedback process in which the inequality (in terms of trust, in this case) gets more pronounced over time<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/efe1a929e64ebeeb021e79f341b35faa4baf1397/c0643/static/img/maintainer-wot-in-degrees.png" alt="Scatter plot of in-degree vs. number of users. Shows a roughly power-law relationship."></p>

<p>Who are these highly-trusted users? They’re who you’d expect: bots for large projects (e.g. <code>types</code>), corporate accounts (e.g. <code>fb</code>), and the maintainers of extremely popular open-source libraries (e.g. <code>sindresorhus</code>, who maintains e.g. <code>string-length</code>).</p>

<p>Perhaps more interestingly, this web of trust exhibits some useful structures. A number of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongly_connected_component" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">strongly connected components</a> emerge – groups of users that, roughly speaking, all trust each other according to the web of trust principles (i.e. if I trust Alice, and Alice trusts Bob, then I trust Bob, too). All of these connected components are small, with the exception of a single one that’s home to over 11,000 users<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>. This core component – we’ll call it the <strong>strong set</strong> – could provide a starting point for a measure of trust in the npm ecosystem.</p>



<p>We can quantify trust in a slightly more nuanced way than simply looking at the in-degree of each npm user. The PageRank algorithm provides such a measure that takes into account the trustworthiness of the people who trust me. For example, I may only be trusted by one user, but if that user is <code>isaacs</code> (the creator of npm) then that trust relationship counts for a lot! After running PageRank, the 10 “most-trusted” users are:</p>

<ol>
  <li><code>types</code></li>
  <li><code>sindresorhus</code></li>
  <li><code>angular</code></li>
  <li><code>m1tk4</code></li>
  <li><code>tjholowaychuk</code></li>
  <li><code>google-wombot</code></li>
  <li><code>fb</code></li>
  <li><code>isaacs</code></li>
  <li><code>gaearon</code></li>
  <li><code>yyx990803</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Many of these are unsurprising. However, <code>m1tk4</code> stands out: they only maintain two rarely-downloaded libraries. Because one of these libraries is used by the BBC, <code>m1tk4</code> is implicitly trusted by a large number of relatively trustworthy BBC employees who maintain other, more popular projects. This demonstrates how PageRank diffuses trust across the social network of npm maintainers. In fact, <code>m1tk4</code> is not a member of the strong set mentioned earlier – but many of the users who trust them <em>are</em>. <code>m1tk4</code> just doesn’t trust those users back!</p>

<p>While PageRank gives a fun measure of trust, it’s a very rough model for the reasons mentioned earlier: it’s based on a pretty weak indication of real trust. However, it might be useful in detecting suspicious behaviours in npm, which is something we – or registry maintainers – need to do proactively if we want to stop supply-chain attacks. For example, it might be a red flag if a highly-trusted user suddenly starts using a library by someone with a PageRank-based-trust of close to 0. And regardless, the strong set comes merely from observing which dependencies people choose to use without applying any complex calculations.</p>

<p>How might we want to use the strong set to create a stricter trust (or reputation) system? I think that formalizing such a system is unlikely if it requires large-scale buy-in from npm users. Instead, we might create a simple wrapper for npm that checks if you’re about to install something from a developer outside of the strong set, similar to Liran Tal’s excellent <a href="https://github.com/lirantal/npq" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">npq</a>. Or perhaps security researchers could use the npm web of trust as an additional data point when deciding whether a suspicious package warrants further investigation. Either way, the state of trust within the npm ecosystem is not great. This model gives us a starting point.</p>

<p><em>Do you think I’ve got it all wrong? Or do you have further suggestions on how we can improve the state of trust in open source? <a href="https://www.btao.org/contact">Get in touch</a>.</em></p>

<p><em>A final note: this analysis is based on data from June 2020, which I collected for my Master’s thesis. I believe you’d reach similar numbers if you ran the analysis on data from today.</em></p>

		<h2 id="003">0:03</h2>

<div><p>Welcome to Signals and Threads, in-depth conversations about every layer of the tech stack from Jane Street. I’m Ron Minsky. </p><p>Today I’m going to have a conversation with Brian Nigito, essentially, about the technological underpinnings of the financial markets, and some of the ways in which those underpinnings differ from what you might expect if you’re used to things like the open Internet and the way in which cloud infrastructures work. We’re going to talk about a lot of things, but there’s going to be a lot of focus on networking, and some of the technologies at that level, including things like IP multicast. </p><p>Brian Nigito is a great person to have this conversation with because he has a deep and long history with the financial markets. He’s worked in the markets for 20 years, some of the time he spent working at the exchange-level where he did a lot of the foundational work that led to the modern exchange architectures that we know today. He’s also worked on the side of various different trading firms. For the last eight years, Brian’s been working here at Jane Street and his work here has covered a lot of different areas, but today, he spends a lot of time thinking about high performance, low latency, and especially network level stuff. </p><p>So let’s dive in. I think one thing that I’m very sensitive to is a lot of the people who are listening, don’t know a ton about the financial markets and how they work. And so just to get started, Brian can give a fairly basic explanation of what an exchange is.</p></div>

<h2 id="122">1:22</h2>

<p>I think when you hear about an exchange, you can think of lots of different kinds of marketplaces. But when we talk about an exchange, we’re talking about a formal securities exchange. And these are the exchanges that the SEC regulates, and they meet all of the rules necessary to allow people to trade in securities. So when we use that loosely, yeah, it’s pretty different than your average flea market. Supposed to be anyway.</p>

<h2 id="146">1:46</h2>

<p>That’s obviously a function which, once upon a time was done with physical people in the same location, right? Those got moved into more formal, more organized exchanges with more electronic support. Then eventually there’s this kind of transformation that’s happened essentially over the last 20 years, where the human element has changed enormous amount. Now, humans are obviously deeply involved in what’s going on, but the humans are almost all outside of the exchange and the exchange itself has become essentially a kind of purely electronic medium.</p>

<h2 id="217">2:17</h2>

<p>Yeah, it’s a really interesting story because you have examples of communication technologies and electronic trading, going back to the late ’60s, but probably more mid-‘70s (I’m being a little loose with dates) but it was kind of always present. But the rule set was not designed to force people to operate at the kinds of timescales that electronic systems would cause you to operate at. It was rather forgiving. So you know, if somebody on the floor didn’t want to deal with then electronic exchange, the electronic exchange had to wait. Over the past 10 to 15 years, that’s kind of flipped and so generally, we favor, always accessible electronic quotations.</p>

<h2 id="305">3:05</h2>

<p>To step back a little bit. The exchanges are the places for people to meet and trade, as you said, to advertise their prices. And for people to transact with each other. Other than people who are buying and selling, what are the other people who interact at the exchange level, what are the other kind of entities that get hooked in there.</p>

<h2 id="319">3:19</h2>

<p>So you have, obviously the entities who either in their own capacity or on behalf of other people are transacting securities, but then you have financial institutions that are clearing and guaranteeing those trades, providing some of the capital or leverage to the participants who are trading, they obviously want to know what’s going on there. You have other exchanges, because the rule set requires the exchanges to respect each other’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_quote">quotations</a> – in this odd way, there’s a web where the the exchanges are customers of each other. And you may also have various kinds of market data providers. So those quotes that reflect the activity on the exchange are eventually making their way all the way down to what you might see scrolling on the bottom of the television or your brokerage screen or financial news website, etc. I guess they even make it all the way down to the printed page when the Wall Street Journal prints transaction prices.</p>

<h2 id="410">4:10</h2>

<p>So what does this look like at a more systems level? What are the messages the different participants are sending back and forth?</p>

<h2 id="416">4:16</h2>

<div><p>The most primitive sorts of things are you have orders or instructions, there are other platforms where we have quotes and we may use that loosely, but we’ll just say orders. An order would just say that I would like to buy or sell, let’s say, a specific stock, and I’d like to do so at no worse than this price, and for no more than this quantity, and that may mean I could get filled at a slightly better price than that. I could get filled for less [quantity] than that. I could get filled not at all. </p><p>That order could basically check the book immediately and then come right back to me if there’s nothing to be done. Or it can rest there for some nonzero amount of time where it could advertise and other people may see it and choose to interact with it. And then obviously, I can withdraw that interest or cancel it. So when we talked about orders or cancels, those go hand in hand. </p><p>Finally, there’s execution messages where if you and I intersect on our interest I want to buy you want to sell or vice versa, then the exchange is going to generate an execution to you. And to me, saying that that happened and the terms of that trade.</p></div>

<h2 id="522">5:22</h2>

<div><p>One of the key properties here is that you have a fairly simple core set of messages, this basic data structure at the heart of it called “the book,” which is the set of orders that have not been satisfied. And then people can send messages to add orders and remove orders. And then if two orders <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cross.asp">cross</a>, if there are two orders that are compatible, where a trade can go up, then an execution occurs and the information flows out. </p><p>There’s a fairly simple core machine at the heart of it but then lots of different players who want different subsets of information for different purposes. There are people who are themselves trading, who want to see of course, their own activity and all the detail about that. And they also want to see what we call “market data,” that kind of public anonymized version of the trading activity so you can see what are the prices there are out there that are advertised for you to go and transact against. </p><p>In the end, you need to build a machine that’s capable of running this core engine, doing it at sufficient speed, doing it reliably enough… Maybe a thing that’s not apparent if you haven’t thought about it is: there’s like a disturbing dizzying amount of money at stake. And oh my God, you do not want to lose track of the transactions, right? If you say like, “Oh, you guys did this trade,” and then you forget about it and don’t report it, or you report to one side and not the other, terrible things happen. So reliability is a key thing.</p></div>

<h2 id="635">6:35</h2>

<p>Yeah and I think to go back, there’s lots of different consumers, lots of different participants. And I think the key word there is there’s lots of <em>competing</em> participants. So one thing you didn’t mention in there is disseminating all that information fairly. So trying to get it to everybody at the same time is a real challenge and one that participants are studying very, very carefully and looking for any advantage they can technologically within the rule set, etc. So that extra layer of competition sort of makes the problem a little more complicated, and a little more challenging.</p>

<h2 id="710">7:10</h2>

<p>This fairness issue is one that you’ve seen from the inside working on early exchange infrastructure at Island and Instinet, which eventually became the technology that NASDAQ is built on. Early on, you guys built an infrastructure that I think didn’t have all the fairness guarantees that modern exchanges happen today. Can you say more about how that actually plays out in practice?</p>

<h2 id="729">7:29</h2>

<div><p>When working on the Island system, it was very close, originally, to sort of “fair” in that you had the same physical machines, you had an underlying delivery mechanism, which we’ll talk about, that was very fair at getting it to those individual machines. And then you were sending copies of orders or instructions after going through one application to everyone. So you were all passing through about the exact same amount of work and the about the exact same number of devices. But it was actually very inefficient, we were using thousands of machines that were mostly idle. </p><p>So once we started trying to handle multiple clients on a single machine, it exposed some obvious and silly problems. The naive implementation where people would connect, we would collect all of those connections. And then when we had a message, we would send them on the connections serially, often in the order in which people connected. Well, that immediately led to thousands of messages per second before the exchange open where somebody tried to be the very first connection in that line. </p><p>Then you start sort of round-robining, so you know, you start from one and then the next time around, you start from two etc, etc, to try to randomize this. And then you had people who were connecting to as many different ports as they could and taking the fastest of each one. And so these incentives are very, very strong, and we’d like to use machines to their fullest, but to literally provide each participant their own unique machine for each connection starts to get ridiculous as well.</p></div>

<h2 id="904">9:04</h2>

<p>Where did that lead you? How did you end up resolving that problem?</p>

<h2 id="907">9:07</h2>

<p>A lot of these were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol">TCP</a> protocols. In those days, we actually had a decent number …</p></div></div>

<p>This article introduces a generic and light-weight debugging aid / event
tracing mechanism that is both feasible for targets without proper debugger
connection, as well as visual, providing visibility into high-level and
low-level events.</p>
<p>“What would an ocean be without a monster lurking in the dark? It would be like
sleep without dreams.”
― Werner Herzog</p>
<p>“The harder you work… and visualize something, the luckier you get.”
― Seal</p>

<p>For the past few weeks, I’ve been busy banging my head against the wall with a
system that contains a complex SoC and the vendor SDK is also a .. mess (to put
it politely). In the specific subsystem that I’ve been working with, the SDK
code structure is such that it’s pretty impossible to know who does what, in
what order and when.</p>
<p>In a normal world, one could use a debugger and various hardware assisted code
tracing tools, but the debugger connection
to this system is somewhat unstable to begin with and CoreSight TRACE is not available.
Utilizing SRAM-buffered message streams (e.g. Segger RTT) is also too unstable
(since it relies on the debugger connection).</p>
<p>In similar situations I’ve gotten away by using multiple GPIOs and toggling them
from strategic places and then used a logic analyzer to see what’s what. The
technique has many good qualities and is quite general, but requires pins to
be available to be toggled by software. This sadly is not the case on the
system in question.</p>
<p>There is an UART that is used for text-based debugging messages, but using
<code>printf()</code> from within highly asynchronous code (and ISRs) is akin to digging out
dragons out of one’s nose. On the other hand, the UART is the only thing not
dedicated to core system functionality, so I ended up using it.</p>
<p>In the end, I instrumented the code with a lot of UART writes (single bytes from
different parts), indicating entry and return from functions (including ISRs) in
a race-free manner. While I’ve used this
technique with great success in the past, this time the complexity of the system
was such that manually “decoding” the events from the logic analyzer’s protocol
decoder was pretty slow and tedious and involved a lot of head scratching and
crying. I wanted a way to visualize the data so that I could have both the
long-term view as well as the short-term one.</p>
<p>As a side note, I actually managed to solve my acute problem without these tools
before I wrote them, but these are the tools that would’ve aided my adventures
quite a bit, and I plan to use them in the future.</p>


<p>Armed with my <a href="https://www.saleae.com/">trusty logic analyzer</a>, I thought that
since it already has a rather nice UART decoding support, I’ll just export the
stuff from it into a simple to parse file, and then do a small program to draw
pretty things from that.</p>
<p><img src="https://lowerstrata.net/img/serial-tracing/saleae-serial-800.png" alt="Saleae Logic UART decoder"></p>
<p>Except that the export options for Saleae Logic do not support exporting the
protocol analyzer results (<strong><em>It actually does, please read on</em></strong>). I still love
the analyzer and the software, but I’d have to leave it behind. At least I could
export the actual digital trace data out from the program.</p>
<p>I’ve been waiting for a good problem to try <a href="https://sigrok.org/">sigrok</a> with.
I’ve been reading about it for a while, but didn’t have a problem to solve yet.
sigrok has a capable UART decoder, and supports command line exporting and
whatnot. Should’ve been trivial to achieve what I wanted. So, downloaded the latest release of <code>sigrok-cli</code> and PulseView and victory! Except that I failed completely to
load either of the exported formats (CSV and VCD) into PulseView. After figuring out where the code lives,
seems that the CSV decoder is incapable of handing data that is change-based.
Sequential CSV format would’ve worked, but I like working at high capture rates,
so the file sizes would’ve been prohibitive. The VCD import didn’t work either,
with very wrong imported results. So, damn you sigrok, I wanted to like you! (I
might come back to it eventually)</p>
<p>So, I was left without any sane manner of getting actual decoded data unless I
used the graphical Logic program manually. In the past, I’ve implemented
various tools that did quite complex analyses based on the change based CSV
that Saleae Logic exports, so I knew that writing a custom UART decoder was
doable. This was how <code>decode-serial</code> was born. It reads the
change based CSV in, recognizes UART frames and emits another CSV with the
timestamped recognized frames (aka “bytes” or “octets” if using 8-data bits per
frame).</p>
<p>From this (<code>decode-serial-csv/testdata/input/2017-09-23-serial-3000000-at-500Msps.csv.gz</code>):</p>
<pre><code>Time[s], DTRACE/SPI_MOSI, RX, UARTX
0.000000000000000, 0, 0, 1
0.362525714000000, 0, 0, 0
0.362526030000000, 0, 0, 1
0.362526330000000, 0, 0, 0
0.362526684000000, 0, 0, 1
0.362527020000000, 0, 0, 0
...
</code></pre>
<p>To this:</p>
<pre><code>timestamp(s),byte,isFrameValid,subascii
0.362525714000000,69,1,E
0.370543750000000,87,1,W
0.370661094000000,119,1,w
0.370664710000000,101,1,e
0.370762978000000,66,1,B
...
</code></pre>
<p>Like this (you can use the tool without the pipeline as well, but I tend to keep
CSV files in compressed format):</p>
<pre><code>zcat testdata/input/2017-09-23-serial-3000000-at-500Msps.csv.gz | \
./decode-serial.py UARTX 3000000 | \
gzip -9 &gt; testdata/output/2017-09-23-serial-3000000-transitions.csv.gz
</code></pre>
<h2 id="what-didn-t-actually-fail">What didn’t actually fail</h2>
<p>While writing this article I decided to do some “Deep Machine Learning Analysis”
and google whether it was at least somehow possible to export the protocol
analyzer data from Logic, and for sure, it is. It’s actually quite easy. The
feature just wasn’t located in a place where I looked for it. Ugh.
Co-incidentally, now that I’ve tried the export, the output format is compatible
with <code>generate-call-sequence</code> (covered below) once the display radix is first
set to <code>Dec</code>. So, ROTFL. On the other hand, it’s been a while that I had a
chance to write python properly and I have some future plans for the decoder,
so it wasn’t a completely useless exercise.</p>
<p><img src="https://lowerstrata.net/img/serial-tracing/science-dog-800.jpg" alt="Leading Advanced Deep Machine Learning Expert"></p>

<p>Once we have the individual frames recognized, the next issue is using them to
reconstruct “what happened”. Due to the nature of the tracing mechanism, it’s
best to use a single frame output to indicate when a specific function is
entered or left (separate codes and emitting are necessary for both). Sticking
to such an arrangement allows for a fairly light-weight operation, and if the
hardware peripheral has any kind of built-in queue available, pushing data out
can be made to happen without blocking the operation of the rest of code.
Although in my case the underlying output mechanism was strongly synchronized,
so I might’ve as well emitted more than a single byte at a time.</p>
<p>So, the code would have instrumentation akin to this:</p>
<pre><code>function execute {
  emitTraceByte('E');
  ...
  write(..);
  ...
  emitTraceByte('e');
}

function write(..) {
  emitTraceByte('W');
  ...
  // we've reached an important point within write, mark it (see below). Unlike
  // the other instrumentation here, this code does not have an "ending" pair
  emitTraceByte('D');
  ...
  emitTraceByte('w');
}

ISR complete {
  emitTraceByte('B');
  ...
  execute();
  ...
  emitTraceByte('b');
}
</code></pre>
<p>Given a list of single byte codes and timestamps when they were emitted, we can
then reconstruct a call-graph of a sorts (or rather, a call sequence). Assuming
we instrument the code always in pairs (enter and leave), this will be
sufficient to reconstruct a call “stack”. If the output mechanism works safely
from within ISRs, additional context information can be implicitly formed.</p>
<p>Next, we tell the <code>generate-call-sequence</code> tool how to translate the codes into
events (by placing these rules into a specification file):</p>
<pre><code>execute: E, e
write: W, w
complete: B, b, ISR1
callback: F, f
powerdown: C, c
sync: D
</code></pre>
<p>Above:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each line starts with a label (e.g. <code>execute</code>). This label will be emitted
into the visualization and should describe the function entered (e.g. the
function name might be a good choice here)</li>
<li>Each label is followed by 1 to 3 additional parameters.</li>
<li>The 2 parameter form describes that we have something with a start and an end.
Start and end codes can be given in ASCII if in <code>[a-zA-Z]</code> or hex
(<code>0x</code>-prefix) or unsigned decimal numbers. Internally the sequence generator uses
python <code>int</code>s, so the available code space is fairly large.</li>
<li>The 1 parameter form describes that we have an event “mark”. These are meant
to mark some important “thing” which does not represent a function call per
se. Marks will have a distinct visual representation in the event viewer.</li>
<li>The 3 parameter form is similar to the 2 parameter form, but also includes the
name of the context that will be “entered” when the start code is encountered.
It is currently assumed that the context will be left simultaneously to leaving
the function that created the context, so expressing that separately is not
required (nor supported).</li>
<li>The convention of using capital letters as start codes and lowercase letters
as end codes makes it slightly easier to read the instrumented code, but
this is not a technical requirement. Any codes are allowed as long as
they’re unique in the specification and the parser does not reject them.</li>
<li>Acceptable characters for both labels and contexts are from the set
<code>[a-zA-Z0-9_]</code>.</li>
<li>File format is ASCII, with support for comments (<code>#</code> starts a comment). For
file suffix, I’ve used <code>.gcs</code>, but you can use whatever you like.</li>
</ul>

<p>I don’t particularly like writing desktop GUI programs. I’ve yet to see a
toolkit / GUI-library that would fit my square hole I guess. So in general,
whenever user representation on desktop is required, I try to stick with either
CLI or HTML. However, some time back I ran across
<a href="https://github.com/nico/ninjatracing">ninjatracing</a>, which is a tool that
reads build logs generated by the quite awesome <a href="https://ninja-build.org/">ninja build tool</a> and emits “events” in JSON format. These events are in a
format that the Chrome’s built-in Trace Event profiling tool (aka <code>about:tracing</code>)
will read and lay out graphically. While the event viewer is geared towards Chrome
developers (and perhaps developers of highly-interactive …</p></section></article></div></div></div></div>

  <p>08 Sep 2020</p>

  <p>There’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rrAbLNePxU">a scene in Moneyball</a> in which Brad Pitt’s character, the
manager of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_Athletics">Oakland A’s</a>, is watching a recording of one of his
players trying so hard to run fast that he stumbles and falls. Lying on the
ground he’s angry at himself, because he doesn’t realize that right before he
started his run he hit a home run and scored the game-winning points. Watching
the scene, Pitt leans back, smiles a Brad Pitt smile and says: “how can you not
be romantic about baseball?”</p>

<p>There are moments in which I ask myself the same thing about programming.</p>

<p>We’re programming computers. We spend large parts of our days writing down
instructions for machines. Other parts of the day are spent making sure that we
chose the right instructions. Then we talk about those instructions: why and how
we picked the ones we picked, which ones we will consider in the future, what
those should do and why and how long it will probably take to write those down.</p>

<p>It can sound very serious and dry; a bureaucracy of computer instructions. And
yet.</p>

<p>And yet we, the ostensible bureaucrats, talk about magic as something that
exists —&nbsp;the good <em>and</em> the bad kind. There are <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/book/10.5555/547625">wizards</a>. Instructions
are <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-9.html">“like a sorcerer’s spells”</a>.</p>

<p>We don’t call them instructions, though, not when talking about what we produce
each day anyway. It’s code we write. Emotions are involved. Code, we say, can
be: neat, nice, clean, crafted, baroque, minimal, solid, defensive, hacky, <em>a
hack</em>, art, a piece of shit, the stupidest thing I’ve ever read, beautiful, like
a poem.</p>

<p>Some lines of code are a riddle to anyone but their author and the name code
serves as a warning. Other times, strangely, it’s a badge of honor.</p>

<p>Fantastic amounts of code have been written, from beginning to end, by a single
person, typing away night after night after night, for years, until one day the
code is fed to a machine and, <em>abracadabra</em>, a brightly coloured <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RollerCoaster_Tycoon_(video_game)#Development">amusement
park</a> appears on screen. Other code has been written, re-written, torn
apart and stitched back together across time zones, country borders and decades,
not by a single person, but by hundreds or even thousands of different people.</p>

<p>This world of programming is held together by code. Millions and millions of
lines of code. Nobody knows how much there is. Some of it is more than 30 years
old, some less than a week, and chances are you used parts of both yesterday.
There are lines of code floating around on our computers that haven’t been
executed by a machine in years and probably won’t be for another lifetime.
Others are the golden threads of this world, holding it together at the seams
without no more than a dozen people knowing about it. Remove one of these and it
all comes crashing down.</p>

<p>If you haven’t been here long enough and try to guess how much there is and how
many generations are layered on top of each other — you won’t even come close.
But stay around. After a while, more and more, you’ll find yourself in moments
of awe, stunned by the size and fragility of it all; the mountains of work and
talent and creativity and foresight and intelligence and luck that went into it.
And you’ll reach for the word “magic” because you won’t know how else to
describe it and then you lean back and smile, wondering how someone could not.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Software as a Service (SaaS) has become the dominant model for delivering business software. With SaaS, applications are hosted by a vendor and made accessible to end customers over the Internet on a subscription basis. The popularity of SaaS is making a substantial impact on the daily activities of IT workers. When software is hosted on internally managed PCs or servers, the IT department is responsible for maintaining the infrastructure that supports these systems. IT professionals need to procure, configure, test, and physically set up the hardware. Additionally, it is necessary to provide on-going support for the infrastructure in areas like security management, capacity planning, service continuity, and incident response. After shifting to the SaaS model, many of these activities are outsourced to the provider. <a href="https://www.bettercloud.com/wp-content/reports/451-research-bettercloud.pdf">IT workers spend far less time on tasks like managing data storage, upgrades, maintenance, and purchasing</a>.</p><h2 id="it-admins">IT Admins</h2><p>This threatens certain conventional roles in the IT Department. An engineer whose primary skillset is the physical installation of hardware cannot offer much value when the infrastructure has been outsourced to SaaS. However, the SaaS shift often frees up these IT professionals to focus on tasks that create more value for the business. IT workers become less technically focused and more connected to the business. The transition to cloud applications provides many benefits to IT admins including spending less time on daily maintenance, the increased ability to work remotely, increased participation in business strategy, improved relationships with business colleagues, and reduced boredom and frustration at work [38]. Therefore, although certain conventional IT roles are being eliminated, SaaS often enables these workers to move into more rewarding careers. System administrators that previously specialized in configuring on-site hardware are now responsible for designing and supporting cloud-based infrastructure. Database administrators that were previously focused on keeping a business’s databases healthy and running, <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/products/database/changing-role-of-the-dba-4369434.pdf">are often being transitioned into data architects who understand how to cultivate and leverage data to achieve business objectives</a>.</p><h2 id="software-engineers">Software Engineers</h2><p>Software engineers are highly affected as well. As the SaaS market matures, every conceivable niche of the business problem is now addressed by one or more SaaS products. This is reducing the number of new custom software projects enterprises need to initiate. However, many organizations still invest in developing software that supports the broader business strategy. For example, an internally developed customer-facing web portal may provide competitive differentiation in the market. Even though the back-office processes may be running on a standard SaaS product, there are often bolt-on custom software applications that could be developed to improve the customer experience or help the operation run more efficiently.</p><p>As organizations become more focused on leveraging data to create business value, software engineering roles are often shifting to a data engineering focus. When an organization’s portfolio of SaaS products exposes data through open APIs, many opportunities arise for engineering teams to use data. Often data from multiple applications can be combined and correlated to provide valuable business insights. For example, customer communications from the CRM could be run through a sentiment analysis tool to analyze the current level of customer satisfaction, and then overlaid with the customer’s payment patterns in the accounts receivable system. The finance team could be alerted to an increased likelihood of past due payment or bad debt. When SaaS is the predominant software model, engineers will spend more time on data and process automation projects as opposed to building new business applications from scratch.</p><p>These trends will require software engineers to develop different skill sets. Although it is popular for those in software engineering careers to view programming as a craft or a calling, the real need for these workers in a corporate setting is to create automation that increases revenue or decreases costs. Organizations hire software engineers to create a competitive advantage in the market, satisfy customer requirements, and optimize processes to reduce labor costs. Software engineers that are well aligned with business strategy are better positioned for career success than those overly focused on the technical minutiae of their chosen programming language. Software engineering jobs now typically require writing skills, problem-solving skills, research skills, and competencies in teamwork and collaboration.</p><h2 id="what-s-your-saas-career-strategy">What’s Your SaaS Career Strategy?</h2><p>Whether you work in IT or not, the proliferation of SaaS will impact your career significantly. Your ability to adapt and learn will help you turn cloud technology into a competitive advantage in the job market. In future posts I will be offering some ideas on how you can leverage these trends to supercharge your career and thrive in the cloud economy.

<![CDATA[Why Charge, How Much to Charge, and Pricing]]>

October 3, 2020 | https://boneandfeathers.com/2020/10/03/pricing-and-charging/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://boneandfeathers.com/2020/10/03/pricing-and-charging/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>I remember the first time I wrote a checkout system that took money from customers. It was for a paid real-time analytics product that I’d built – a few years before Google made it free with Analytics. I was using the Authorize.net API and was terrified. “What if I screw up the arithmetic and charge a customer too much? What if we get hacked?” but most importantly I struggled with the belief that anyone would actually pay us for software that I had built. It seemed unfathomable.</p>
<p>Like most things, as you mature as a software developer or product creator, you have a much better sense of how little you still know, which manifests as humility, making it hard to charge for your products.</p>
<p>You’ve written your own software or created your own product, and you know all about the various bugs, problems, inefficiencies, glitches and the various warts your baby has. So it is hard to look at it from a customer perspective and see the value, because you see all the things that need fixing or could be improved. You feel like your customer will see those things too and won’t pay until you fix every single one of them, at which point more perceived problems will have emerged, creating a never ending cycle.</p>
<p>You need to overcome these psychological barriers and realize that, as long as your software solves a real customer problem, and as long as solving that problem is worth more to your customer than the money you charge, you will make sales. Customers will buy. And those customers won’t return furious at you for not fixing every single bug, but will actually be happy that your product worked well enough. As Jim Collins once said, “Don’t let Great be the enemy of Good.”</p>

<p>It’s important that you overcome the psychological barrier to charging for your product or service early on. There are two core reasons for this:</p>
<p>Firstly, it ensures that you are building a business that can generate cash flow. If you make something free and have tremendous growth, it is as meaningless as standing on a street corner handing out $20 dollar bills. You are not validating your business model.</p>
<p>Secondly, everyone loves free stuff, and that love of free will poison your product decisions. You are getting feedback from people who incur no cost to use your product and thus the bar for product success is artificially low. You need feedback from people who incur a cost, so that they can inform your product decisions from a base of having incurred real cost. If your product decisions do not deliver enough value to justify what the product costs, you need to reevaluate and do better.</p>

<p>Pricing is weird. The more you charge, the more perceived value your product has, even before a customer learns about the product and tries it. Slap on an eye-wateringly high price and you will make a handful of sales, even on a brand new product targeting a new market. I’ve seen it happen. Your price won’t be optimal, but the psychology behind perceived value based on price is real and a useful input in your decision making.</p>
<p>The less you charge, the more you will find your customer service load per customer increases. Customers that pay less are more demanding. I’ve seen this pattern remain constant. It doesn’t apply to slight drops in pricing, but to products where prices are extremely low – in the $1 to $7 a month range. We’ve sold SaaS products at various prices with monthly or yearly subscription over the past 15 years and have found this to remain true.</p>
<p>There is a market for every price point. As our business budget has increased into the millions, I’ve discovered that it makes perfect sense for us to pay 6 figures and higher for certain things when the price is far lower than either: the cost of the problem, the revenue that we’ll earn by using the product, or a combination of both.</p>
<p>As a one or two person team, you’ll be sitting in a room, living off your savings and you’re going to have a very hard time believing that an enterprise customer will happily pay thousands or tens of thousands of dollars for your product per year. That is going to make it hard for you to make rational pricing decisions and very difficult for you to talk to customers and rationalize the cost of your product. This is an early stage problem that goes away quickly after your first few sales.</p>
<p>Start out low, but not too low, and increase your pricing. If you’re charging for a subscription product, it is easy to let your existing customers know that you’re increasing the price. Cut them a break e.g. give them their existing pricing for another year, or just grandfather them in at the old pricing on their existing licenses, which is what we did.</p>
<p>Starting higher and lowering prices later on is not a great look unless you provide a very clear and positive rationale. It risks your early adopters feeling like suckers and questioning their buying decision. It creates negative perceived value, as the product may not appear to be “worth” what it was when the price was higher.</p>
<p>At Wordfence, we started out at $17.95 per year, then raised the price to $35 per year, then to $49 per year, then to $99 per year. That shift happened between 2012 when we launched and around 2017. Those price increases seemed insanely high to me. I was sure our customers would revolt, that we’d receive social media pushback and outright incredulity from existing customers. None of those came to pass. In fact these increases created a positive outcome for our existing customers because we were able to grow the product and team, providing significantly more value.</p>

<p>Our hacked site cleaning business is interesting because we use a demand based pricing model. When our team gets busy, the price for site cleaning rises to help throttle demand. When they don’t have enough to do, the price automatically drops.</p>
<p>We recently conducted a financial study where we ‘bucketed’ buyers who paid $100 to $200 in one bucket, $200 to $300 in another bucket, all the way up to $2000. We plotted a bar chart showing how many buyers we had for a given pricing bucket for a given time period and separated the time periods into months with high demand and months with low demand.</p>
<p>In other words, we were able to examine our customer resistance to price increases as the pricing changed. Our average price is around $220 for a hacked site clean. When you examine this data, there appears to be no resistance to price increases, but then you have to consider that the price is increasing due to increased demand. So you’re really looking at how customers behaving in the face of increased price, but also increased demand. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_elasticity_of_demand" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Price elasticity of demand</a> says that as demand increases people will pay more. Ideally you’d want to see buyers still buying as you increase price and demand stays static.</p>

<p>I would be remiss without mentioning price discrimination. There is a rather unfortunate reality that some customers just want to spend money, some customers think through every purchase in a logical and systematic way, and others just want whatever the cheapest option is. I describe this reality as unfortunate because, if you create three versions of the same product and simply have a perceived differentiation between each product, but with a low, medium and high priced version, you will make more money.</p>
<p>You’ll make more money because customers that simply “want the best” will buy the higher priced version, some customers will just default to the middle tier, and others will make a rational choice to buy the lowest priced option or will default to that. If you had a single middle tier price, you’d exclude the “I want the best” customers and you may not make a sale to the deal shoppers.</p>
<p>In my humble opinion, it is unethical to exploit price discrimination without actually having differentiated products that provide more or less value, and where that value has some relationship to the costs to produce or maintain those products. So be a good person, make good choices, but know that price discrimination is a very real phenomenon and potentially a low friction way to increase cash flow.</p>

<p>We’ve chatted about overcoming your psychological resistance to charging for your creations, that you should charge early to validate and help shape your product and business, the perceived value of higher prices and the customer service load associated with lower prices.</p>
<p>We also covered how it will be challenging for you, living on Ramen and tepid tap water, to charge a lot for a product that you created, and that you need to separate your circumstances from the reality of the market available for your product and what they’ll pay.</p>
<p>We talked about how it is easier to increase prices than decrease them, and I used Wordfence as an example of how radically pricing can change over the years, provided you continue to increase the value that your customers receive. Finally we discussed how taking a data driven approach can help, but may not provide all the answers, and about price discrimination and how it can increase pricing efficiency.</p>

Unfortunately, Skype has no capacity for recording single person calls, at least as yet. This is not the place for an extended debate on the pros and cons of Skype, or Google Meet (only records corporate accounts), or the rest. Instead, lets sum up all these issue with the simple understanding that, if <strong>one person</strong> wants to record a webcam connected to their local computer, along with the screen, it is insane to imagine that the only way to get this is by:</p><ul><li>Making an account somewhere (Zoom, Meet, Skype, anything)</li><li>Giving a cloud service permission to record our screens</li></ul><p>At the same time, a lot of standard tools for screen recording do not play nice with webcam recorders (like <a href="https://www.maartenbaert.be/simplescreenrecorder/">Simple Screen Recorder</a> and <a href="https://help.gnome.org/users/cheese/stable/">Cheese</a>).</p><h2 id="open-broadcaster-software">Open Broadcaster Software</h2><p>The <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=obs+studio&amp;ia=web">OBS studio project</a> is a godsend.

With secret staking derivatives, users can pool SCRT in a secret contract that chooses how to stake pooled SCRT across validators in the network while issuing a synthetic staking derivative Secret Token (e.g., dxSCRT). In this sense, SCRT serves as collateral; dxSCRT is a liquid token, so it can be used or traded immediately.

It can be slower since you have to search the text, and doesn’t work in all circumstances. But when it works, it does save quite a few clicks, especially because you can select the button with ⌃ (Ctrl) + index, similar to Vimium’s indexing of links.

I would list Karabiner as my first tool, but the process to set up and break in is a tad more involved. Karabiner works by mapping mouse actions (mouse up, down, left, right, click, etc) onto the keyboard. In my personal setup that lets me use either hand/side of the keyboard, I’ve mapped <em>⌃ (Ctrl) + wasd OR ijkl</em> to my mouse movements. I’ve also mapped actions such as scroll, click, and right click, and have a precise and fast mouse navigation setting.</p><p>There are some details to getting it set up, and tweaking it to your preferences, which will be explained in detail in a follow up blog post very shortly.</p><h2 id="b-mouse-keys-nativehttpssupportapplecomguidemac-helpcontrol-the-pointer-using-mouse-keys-mh27469mac-macoshttpssupportapplecomguidemac-helpcontrol-the-pointer-using-mouse-keys-mh27469mac"><a name="mk"></a><a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/control-the-pointer-using-mouse-keys-mh27469/mac" target="_blank" rel="noopener">b.

But the real power comes from the custom workflows you can build or get from open-source: any action you could want to automate now at your fingertips you can use in Alfred.

Some of these tools work well in isolation, and others work better together in combination with each other and with native app shortcuts or OS shortcuts. For example, in Chrome, I limit my tabs to 9 with a chrome extension so I can navigate with command + tab number 1-9 (native chrome shortcut), use Vimium for clicking and indexing links, Karabiner for scrolling, and Alfred to quickly google or wikipedia in a new tab.</p><p>For that reason, I’d highly recommend spending even ten minutes getting intimate with all the shortcuts of your OS and the applications you use frequently. For me, knowing OneNote and Sublime Text shortcuts is essential.</p><p>In my opinion, shortcutting is much better than moving a cursor, even if controlled by a keyboard.</p><a name="mac"><h2 id="6-general-mac-shortcuts">6.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      

      <div>
        <p>This is a list of tools I use to increase my privacy on the Internet. I'm not a security expert. My goal is to have a good enough protection. Feel free to suggest any additions and improvements.</p>
<h2 id="firefox">Firefox</h2>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90343120-ed616080-e00d-11ea-9451-f2c69ada5246.jpg" alt="firefox"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/exp/firefox/">Firefox</a> probably doesn't need an introduction. It is an open-source project. It's run by Mozilla - a non-profit organization. Anyone can go to the <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/">Firefox repository</a> to take a look at the code and see how it works.</p>
<p>Firefox doesn't gather your personal data to serve you ads as Chrome. While Google seems careful and to an extend trustworthy with handling people's personal data, you don't seem to have much control how your profile is built and used.</p>
<p>The browser is constantly being improved. It seems slightly heavier than Chrome or Safari on my computer, but that's a minor issue compared to all the advantages. I use the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/">Developer Edition</a>.</p>
<h2 id="little-snitch">Little Snitch</h2>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90343121-edf9f700-e00d-11ea-91d7-a2a876111ca1.jpg" alt="Little Snitch"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/">Little Snitch</a> is a MacOS application that  monitors connections and lets you control inbound and outbound traffic from your computer. It visualizes these connections and shows where applications connect. This way you have information about both familiar and unfamiliar network actions that applications are trying to perform.</p>
<h2 id="pihole-adguard">PiHole &amp; AdGuard</h2>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90343124-ef2b2400-e00d-11ea-8f26-f4dcbdf189d6.jpg" alt="Pi Hole">
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90343113-e9cdd980-e00d-11ea-8d17-642c01565237.jpg" alt="AdGuard"></p>
<p><a href="https://pi-hole.net/">PiHole</a> &amp; <a href="https://adguard.com/">AdGuard</a> are ad blockers. PiHole is open-source while AdGuard is a paid offering. I use one at home and the other one at the office. AdGuard is slightly easier to setup and use. Both work network-wide, but AdGuard also provides standalone applications and browser plugins to protect from ads when being outside of private networks.</p>
<h2 id="nibspace">Nibspace</h2>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90343122-ee928d80-e00d-11ea-950f-3514adfca5fa.jpg" alt="Nibspace"></p>
<p><a href="https://nibspace.com/">Nibspace</a> is an alternative to Google Analytics. It provides basic information about the visitors of my websites. It doesn't use cookies and it has a small footprint (~ 1kb) while being affordable ($1/mo per domain). It's not open-source. There are few other, notable competitors such as <a href="https://usefathom.com/">Fathom</a>, <a href="https://simpleanalytics.com/">Simple Analytics</a> and <a href="https://plausible.io/">Plausible</a>.</p>
<h2 id="bitwarden">Bitwarden</h2>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90343117-ec303380-e00d-11ea-828d-c0bf960154a2.png" alt="Bitwarden"></p>
<p><a href="https://bitwarden.com/">Bitwarden</a> is an open-source password manager. I used to use 1Password, but I wanted something more affordable yet with similar features and Bitwarden fits the bill perfectly.</p>
<h2 id="nordvpn">NordVPN</h2>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90343123-ef2b2400-e00d-11ea-8026-de472ec96bc6.jpg" alt="Nord VPN"></p>
<p><a href="https://nordvpn.com/">NordVPN</a> is a personal virtual private network service provider. Their marketing seems aggressive, so I was a bit skeptical at the beginning, but then I decided to give it a try. Overall, NordVPN is one of the most polished and reliable VPNs I've used so far.</p>
<p>I also like that they show some innovation efforts, namely their NordLynx technology that is built around WireGuard - this relatively new VPN tunneling protocol</p>
<p>Last year <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21312609">NordVPN was hacked</a>, but they handled the whole situation pretty well in my view.</p>
<h2 id="fastmail">Fastmail</h2>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90343118-ecc8ca00-e00d-11ea-938b-7e9f884e8a6d.jpg" alt="Fastmail"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.fastmail.com/">Fastmail</a> is a paid e-mail service that focuses on privacy and doesn't display ads. It is a simple service to manage e-mails, calendars and contacts. It costs $5/mo. It is also fast. This is partly related to their work on a more reliable, faster IMAP alternative, called <a href="https://jmap.io/">JMAP</a> - so it goes beyond just a snappy UI.</p>

                <div>
                    <p><em>This article is the third in a three part series that explores gold and Bitcoin in detail as products, including who the customers are for gold and Bitcoin, what jobs gold and Bitcoin do for them, and a perspective on the future markets for gold and Bitcoin.</em></p><h3 id="what-everybody-ought-to-know-about-gold-and-bitcoin"><strong>What everybody ought to know about gold and Bitcoin</strong></h3><ul><li><a href="https://andyjagoe.com/what-everybody-ought-to-know-about-gold-and-bitcoin-part-1-of-3-gold-as-a-product/">Part 1: Gold as a product</a></li><li><a href="https://andyjagoe.com/what-everybody-ought-to-know-about-gold-and-bitcoin-part-2-of-3-bitcoin-as-a-product/">Part 2: Bitcoin as a product</a></li><li>Part 3: The future for gold and Bitcoin <em>(this post)</em></li></ul><hr><p>On July 1, 1979, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walkman">SONY released the Walkman</a>. Initial sales were disappointing, and the industry laughed at it because the sound quality was so poor compared to high-end speaker systems. But Walkman went on to be one of Sony's most successful brands of all time, selling almost 400 million portable music players. Walkman was never intended for the small number of people buying high-end speakers. Walkman enabled a much larger number of people to listen to music in places they never could have previously. In other words, Walkman's competition was never high-end speakers, it was non-consumption.</p><p>On January 9, 2007, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone">Steve Jobs announced the iPhone</a>. There was no app store at the time, and people forget how many <a href="https://bgr.com/2016/07/01/iphone-reviews-original-negative-ballmer-dvorak/">negative reviews it received</a>. Because it was such a poor actual phone, many early adopters actually carried an iPhone in addition to their regular cell phone. Steve Ballmer said <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eywi0h_Y5_U">"There’s no chance that the iPhone is going to get any significant market share</a>." So how did iPhone become Apple's most successful product ever, selling 2.2 billion units as of November 1, 2018, and extracting much of the profit from the wireless value chain that previously went to carriers? When iPhone launched, there were no smartphones that had web browsing and media consumption that people could actually use. The real competition for iPhone was non-consumption.</p><p>Uber was founded in 2009. When they were first raising money, many investors passed because they didn't think that the taxi market was big enough. But that was the wrong way to think about it. Uber's primary competition was not taxis, but non-consumption. And Uber ended up massively expanding the total market for rides.</p><p>What does all this have to do with gold and Bitcoin?</p><p>Similar to the products above, there have been no shortage of Bitcoin detractors since its launch on January 3, 2009. Bitcoin has no intrinsic value. It does not have alternative uses like jewelry or industrial applications. And gold has had thousands of years to entrench its position in the world. How could Bitcoin ever replace gold?</p><p>But what if this Bitcoin versus gold debate is a false dichotomy? </p><p>What if the "Bitcoin is digital gold" narrative is incomplete or misleading? What if thinking about Bitcoin in the context of gold is like thinking about Uber in the context of taxis?</p><p>Bitcoin enables a larger group of people than ever before to protect their savings and purchasing power. It does not do everything gold does. It doesn't need to.</p><p>Bitcoin's main competition is not gold. It is non-consumption. </p><p>Walkman, iPhone and Uber all seemed like toys when they were first launched. And though they may have been "inferior" products, that didn't matter because they were being sold to different customers. Over time, each product got better and better, and people began to trade down because the product was good enough and saved them money. In time, the new "inferior" products actually became better than the incumbents. And the incumbents shrank or disappeared.</p><p>But does this apply to Bitcoin? Is Bitcoin getting better? Isn't it the same now as when it launched in 2009?</p><p>Looking at the Bitcoin software project on Github we can see that it receives thousands of additions and deletions each week, and has received a steadily increasing number of contributions to master from 2010 to 2020.</p><figure><img src="https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/2020/09/image-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/image-1.png 600w, https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/image-1.png 1000w, https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/09/image-1.png 1600w, https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/size/w2400/2020/09/image-1.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Steady increase in Bitcoin commits to master (2010-2020)</figcaption></figure><p>Why is Bitcoin constantly being worked on and improved, even though it has no parent organization like Sony, Apple or Uber to push it forward?</p><p>Bitcoin works because it is a special kind of product. It's a multi-sided network.</p><p>Interaction between participants in the network creates incentives that drive the project forward. These network effects are why we see contributions to the Bitcoin project on Github growing at an increasing rate. </p><p>Let's map out the network flywheel¹ for Bitcoin and drop in the jobs to be done we identified in <a href="https://andyjagoe.com/what-everybody-ought-to-know-about-gold-and-bitcoin-part-2-of-3-bitcoin-as-a-product/">Part 2</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/2020/09/Bitcoin-Network-Flywheel-Map-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/Bitcoin-Network-Flywheel-Map-2.png 600w, https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/2020/09/Bitcoin-Network-Flywheel-Map-2.png 960w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Bitcoin Multi-Sided Network Flywheel</figcaption></figure><p>The multi-sided network for Bitcoin begins with Satoshi Nakamoto's vision for sound digital money and other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_bitcoin">early contributors</a> to the open source project and network. Once the network began to grow, specialized investors emerged to provide the financial capital necessary to develop the network. These investors typically hail from Silicon Valley or Wall Street, often co-invest on deals, and typically focus exclusively on cryptocurrency. Bitcoin mining operations developed, and these companies started building their own custom ASICs for mining, earning billions of dollars per year. Third party developers emerged to provide user-facing on-ramps and off-ramps to the Bitcoin network, as well as a wide range of infrastructure, analysis, trading and custodian services. Each layer of improvement to the network brought more users. Including more users, which itself brought more users.</p><p>The Bitcoin network exhibits increasing returns, which means that the more people who participate in the network, the more valuable the network is to every participant. This generates a natural monopoly and starts an exponential growth curve. </p><p>Gold is also a multi-sided network, but has weaker network effects.</p><figure><img src="https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/2020/09/Gold-Network-Flywheel-Map-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/Gold-Network-Flywheel-Map-1.png 600w, https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/2020/09/Gold-Network-Flywheel-Map-1.png 960w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Gold Multi-Sided Network Flywheel</figcaption></figure><p>The multi-sided network of gold begins with the metal itself and the memes behind why gold has been obsessed over for thousands of years. We discussed this in detail in <a href="https://andyjagoe.com/what-everybody-ought-to-know-about-gold-and-bitcoin-part-1-of-3-gold-as-a-product/">Part 1</a> of the series.</p><p>From here we move to investors, who have been putting financial capital to work developing new technologies and applications for gold for millennia. Today, the gold value chain is very mature, and even the promise of AI in the exploration process seems likely only to yield incremental results. </p><p>Incentivized by the value of gold, miners perform the costly and time consuming process of locating gold deposits and producing doré, a metallic alloy containing between 60-90% gold. The steps in this process are <a href="https://www.gold.org/about-gold/gold-supply/how-gold-is-mined/exploration">exploration</a> (1-10 years), <a href="https://www.gold.org/about-gold/gold-supply/how-gold-is-mined/development">development</a> (1-5 years), <a href="https://www.gold.org/about-gold/gold-supply/how-gold-is-mined/operation">operation</a> (10-30 years), <a href="https://www.gold.org/about-gold/gold-supply/how-gold-is-mined/decommissioning">decommissioning</a> (1-5 years) and <a href="https://www.gold.org/about-gold/gold-supply/how-gold-is-mined/mine-reclamation">reclamation</a>. </p><p>The doré that gold miners produce is then the basis for a complex ecosystem of third parties that add value and create useful applications from gold. Refiners like Valcambi, PAMP, and Heraeus convert doré into semi-fabricated metals and alloys for use in the industrial and jewelry sectors and investment grade bullion and coins. Gold bullion is then accredited by the LBMA for <a href="http://www.lbma.org.uk/good-delivery-explained">good delivery</a> and then stored in vaults like the New York Federal Reserve and the Bank of England before being traded over the counter in London and Zurich or on exchanges like the London Mercantile Exchange. Gold futures are most often traded on COMEX in New York, and companies like State Street Global Advisors and Blackrock have built financial products like gold ETFs that have claims on gold bullion.</p><p>The products produced by this third party ecosystem are bought by consumers as jewelry, investors as bars/coins or financial products with claims to bars/coins, central banks and industrial users. For consumers, investors and central banks, gold is valuable because other people find it valuable. And the more people who find it valuable and will accept it in exchange for goods and services, the more valuable it is to all. This is the primary network effect in the gold network.</p><p>Bitcoin has a similar network effect. It too is valuable because other people find it to be valuable. And the more people who find it valuable and will accept it in exchange for goods and services, the more valuable it is to all. </p><p>But Bitcoin's network effect is different, because gold is physical and Bitcoin is digital. The software eats the world hypothesis says that any product or service in any field that can become software, will become software. We see these dynamics play out in industry after industry, and the field of hard money and wealth preservation is no exception. </p><p>Why is digital different? Digital products can take advantage of zero marginal costs and universality of compute, attributes that a non-digital substitute cannot compete with. Bitcoin is ten times better than gold on a few very important factors that dramatically improve its usability and accessibility compared gold for the average person. Bitcoin can be instantly transmitted anywhere in the world, it is easily and instantly divisible in a way that gold is not, it is trivial to carry (no matter the quantity), and it is hard to seize. </p><p>These benefits effectively expand the market for Bitcoin to a much larger number of network participants compared to gold. And Metcalfe's law projects that the value of a network is proportional to the square of its number of nodes.</p><p>And unlike gold, this is not where Bitcoin's network effects end. Because Bitcoin is software, it is steadily getting better, whereas gold remains unchanged. We have already shown above the increasing rate at which contributions are being made by Bitcoin network participants to Bitcoin itself. Bitcoin has the advantage of Moore's law with respect to compute and storage cost, and because trust is built into the network itself, third party developers typically open source all their code so there is a same-side network effect among third party developers who borrow each other's code and best practices. This adds an incredible accelerant to the Bitcoin network and stands in contrast to gold's well developed but opaque and closed third party ecosystem.</p><p>That said, Bitcoin still has a long way to go relative to other …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

  <div><p>Right so yes I've spent over 25 years writing software for people in a professional capacity. As time has gone by, and I've learnt more about the process, I've slowly realised that actually writing code is actually quite a small part of the process. When I was a junior developer I probably spent 90% of my working day sat in front of an editor writing code. And I thought that was the job. Turns out it really isn't!Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>I think people both inside and outside of the industry fixate on coding for a number of reasons, and it's quite interesting to ruminate on those, but building software is so much more than writing code. Talking to users, agreeing on features, designing the interface, setting up the infrastructure, testing the platform for bugs, testing it for performance, providing support for it. These are all messy, imprecise things that have very human factors.Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>If you are a software engineer you can often seek solace in the code itself. Code is truth. You can't really argue with it. You can't argue with your compiler. It's really easy to fall into the trap of avoiding all work other than coding for these very reasons. But I would suggest that this makes you a really bad engineer! Engineering means getting your hands dirty, either literally in the case of Brunel, or from a human interaction point of view where software is concerned.</p></div>

  <div><p>So you are sort of saying that an engineer solves problems, and problems are experienced (mostly) by people, so to solve problems effectively you a) have to deal with people and b) have to really know how to solve the problem (e.g. dealing with infrastructure, performance, etc.) instead of only the parts you are comfortable with. Is that correct?</p></div><div><p>How much of this comes down to the attitude of the engineer? And how much of this comes down to actively studying?Â&nbsp;</p></div>

  <div><p>In my experience, almost 100% of that learning comes from hard won experience.Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>When I studied at university, I was really surprised to discover that the "Computing" courses that I was interested in were labelled as "Software Engineering". I thought it was odd at the time; I never really had thought it about it before, and I was even a bit worried that I might have been signing up for the wrong course!Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>I don't think many universities at the time offered "Computer Science" as an undergrad course; it's a very different discipline.Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>It took me a LONG time to get my head around the fact that one of the words in the job was "engineering". And really the only way I realised that was after years of working building software. At some point the penny dropped that I was an engineer, and that writing code was only 1 aspect of that job.Â&nbsp;</p></div>

  <div><p>There are a number of things that people starting off in a career of Software Engineering should try and keep in mind.</p></div><div><div><ol>
<li>Never stop learning. Software development is still a very immature discipline. I like to think about it like building jet aeroplanes. After the jet engine was invented, flying on a jet passenger plane was pretty dangerous! Google "the de Havilland Comet". There was so much new engineering that needed to be learnt to get to the point where now it is pretty much the safest mode of transport in the world. The software industry is still building de Havilland Comets to a certain degree. So much is being learnt in terms of best practices, what works and what doesn't. If you don't constantly learn new things, you will be left behind.</li>
<li>You know less than you think. You can wield great power writing software and it can go to your head! Good engineers are humble and never think they either know it all or know better than others.</li>
<li>Stretch yourself. If you know an OOP language, learn a functional one like Elixir or Haskell. If you have spent a lot of time with a very high level language like Python, try Rust. Think of it like a gym. The machine you cant stand the site of is probably the one doing you the most good.</li>
<li>It is an art as well as a science. There is room for beauty and elegance in software.</li>

  <div><p>I sort of feel swamped by things that I don't know, almost to the point of paralysis.</p></div><div><p>I'm new to Ruby on Rails and know that there is a huge ocean of knowledge that I could keep swimming in, but then again I'm competent enough to build this reasonably functioning Taaalk website. I look at React, which might help me get a job, and unlike with Rails, I know none of that currently. And then there are tangential things, for example improving my git skills.</p></div><div><p>It feels confusing, especially without a job where problems to solve aren't put in your plate. And it feels confusing because I can doÂ&nbsp;<em>enough to create</em>. I could probably build most things in my mind with Rails and a standard html.erb + scss front end... but while I would learn something, I wouldn't be learning in leaps and bounds in the same way I was when I was learning Ruby/Rails for the first time. I guess what I'm saying is that, in some ways, my ability to create is separated from my need to make drastic educational strides - so it is confusing to know what to focus on.</p></div><div><p>If you were in my shoes what would you be optimising for?

            <div><div>
  <div><p>A good rule of thumb for things like personal projects. If you want to learn something new, build the project with new tools, languages and frameworks. If you want to actually build a project, use what you know. So it depends what the point of the project is. I guess if you want to do both you have to just accept that it will take longer using whatever new shiny stuff youâ€™re using.Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>Tech and software engineering has always been obsessed with the new thing. People just canâ€™t help themselves! Itâ€™s fine if youâ€™re just working by yourself and playing around with a new language or framework, but if you are making those decisions on behalf of an employer with a large team, you can easily burn millions of pounds by making the wrong choice. The hard part of all this is making consistently right choices given varying contexts and requirements.Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>This goes back to what I was saying about engineering. It is not just coding. Itâ€™s the ability to understand a new technology, digest what is good and bad about it, consider it subjectively and then make a decision based on all that information. Good engineers will be good at that, and will be opinionanted about it as well. Being careful and conservative when they need to be, and working on the cutting edge when it makes sense.Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>I would recommend not trying to do 4 new things at once. So if you want to learn Flutter or React Native, donâ€™t then something totally foreign for the backend API. Just take it one step at a time. That way you will strike a balance between the fear and excitement of learning something new, and without the admitted drudgery of knocking out features that have no interesting aspects.Â&nbsp;</p></div>

October 3, 2020 | https://jix.one/the-assembly-language-of-satisfiability/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://jix.one/the-assembly-language-of-satisfiability/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Recently there has been a some discussion about how much practical use is seen by certain methods coming out of academia, especially those methods for which a wide practical applicability is often claimed.
Among these are techniques are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem">SAT</a> solvers, which I quite like and with which <a href="https://jix.one/project/varisat">I am also somewhat familiar</a>.
This lead to questions about how to make SAT solvers easier to use.
In this post I will give my personal perspective on that question.</p>
<p>The discussion started with <a href="https://twitter.com/jeremyjkun/status/1303057920419004416">Jeremy Kun’s post on Twitter</a>, where he asked for concrete examples where SAT solvers are used in practice.
He wrote about the responses in <a href="https://buttondown.email/j2kun/archive/whats-in-production/">his newsletter</a> and while he concedes that SAT solvers are more widely used than he initially thought, for some of the examples people responded with, he remains skeptical towards whether they really are as widely used as claimed.</p>
<p>While I don’t want to go into how widely used SAT solvers are on an absolute scale, I personally think that SAT solvers, or rather methods based on SAT solvers, have the potential to be used much more widely than they currently are.
This raises the question: what is stopping the industry from making more use of SAT solvers wherever applicable?</p>
<h2 id="are-we-bad-at-sat-solvers">Are We Bad at SAT Solvers?</h2>
<p>In his latest <a href="https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/">newsletter</a> titled “We’re Bad at SAT Solvers”<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, Hillel Wayne argues that this is a problem of usability.
SAT solvers require the input problem to be a propositional logic formula in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctive_normal_form">conjunctive normal form (CNF)</a>.
Apart from a few rare exception, this is not a natural way to express most problems which we want to solve using a SAT solver.
Even worse, as Hillel notes, translating problems into equivalent CNF formulas is not a straightforward process.
For a single given problem, there are often many different ways to do this.
Selecting a good approach often requires a lot of experience, some knowledge of SAT solver internals and running careful experiments.
Additionally, experience in encoding one problem domain into CNF might not translate to the problems of a different domain.</p>
<p>Even for seemingly simple constraints which are part of many problems, like counting the number of set Boolean variables, there is a <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=cardinality+constraints+CNF">vast amount of literature, including recent publications,</a> detailing different trade-offs that can be made.
These trade-offs are also not just an academic concern, but can make the difference between solving a problems in seconds or giving up after running the solver for days.
Many practical problems will contain different kinds of constraints and expecting users to be familiar with the corresponding literature for each of them is certainly a barrier for wide scale adoption.</p>
<h2 id="making-sat-solvers-easier-to-use">Making SAT Solvers Easier to Use</h2>
<p>In his newsletter Hillel then wonders what it would take to make them more useful to the industry.
He does mention that the related <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisfiability_modulo_theories">SMT solvers</a> seem to be doing much better in this regard, and consequently have a lot more users than SAT solvers.
SMT solvers are similar to SAT solvers, but allow much more freedom in the way the input problem can be expressed.
You are not limited to Boolean variables, but also have integers, fixed-width integers, arrays and other datatypes (depending on which SMT solver you use), you have many common operations on those types and you don’t have to get your problem into a specific normal form.
All that often comes with an API that allows you to manipulate the input formula as an abstract syntax tree, which you can inspect at any time.</p>
<p>I think the observation that SMT solvers are much easier to use than SAT solvers is an important observation.
At the same time, I think it also answers his question on how an easier to use SAT solver would look like: you would get an SMT solver.</p>
<p>So why are SAT solver authors not trying to lift some of the input restrictions like requiring CNF?
Or if SMT solvers work just as well as SAT solvers, why are people still working on those hard to use SAT solvers?</p>
<p>To answer these questions we need to have a very high-level look at how SMT solvers work.
This will also allow us to understand why people working on SAT solvers tend to implicitly count all applications of SMT solvers when talking about applications of SAT.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-smt-solvers-work">How do SMT Solvers Work?</h2>
<p>For SMT solvers there are two general approaches which dominate the landscape: bit-blasting and CDCL(T). Often solvers combine these or add additional techniques on top of this, but those two techniques form the backbone of any SMT solver I’m aware of.</p>
<h3 id="bit-blasting">Bit-Blasting</h3>
<p>Bit-blasting describes the process of taking the input formula and directly encoding it into an equivalent Boolean formula in CNF, which can then be solved by a SAT solver.
This process is limited to formulas where every data type has a finite set of values, as otherwise there is no direct way to encode each variable using a finite set of Boolean variables.
Luckily, a lot of software makes use of fixed-width integers, so bit-blasting is often very effective for problems that come from all kinds of software analysis.</p>
<p>I’m aware of two SMT solvers that use bit-blasting as their main strategy, <a href="https://github.com/Boolector/boolector">Boolector</a> and <a href="https://stp.github.io/">STP</a>, both having won several awards at solver competitions.
Both of them also use stand-alone SAT solvers to solve the encoded CNF formula. Boolector offers the choice between <a href="http://fmv.jku.at/cadical/">CaDiCaL</a>, <a href="https://github.com/msoos/cryptominisat">CryptoMiniSat</a>, <a href="http://fmv.jku.at/lingeling/">Lingeling</a>, <a href="https://github.com/niklasso/minisat">Minisat</a> and <a href="http://fmv.jku.at/picosat/">Picosat</a>, of which CryptoMiniSat and Minisat are also offered by STP.</p>
<p>For bit-blasting this makes clear that we need a SAT solver as backend and that any improvement to SAT solving also translates into a corresponding improvement to SMT solvers based on this approach. They can be accurately described as additional tooling around a SAT solver, that makes it easier to use and easier to apply to a wider area of problems. This way only the authors of the SMT solver need to be aware of all the techniques for encoding problems into CNF, lifting that burden from the users.</p>
<h3 id="cdclt">CDCL(T)</h3>
<p>The other approach, CDCL(T), is slightly more complicated, but also more flexible, as it can handle input problems with variables that have an infinite domain.
In common with bit-blasting though, is that it is again based around a SAT solver.
The CDCL stands for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-driven_clause_learning">conflict driven clause learning</a>, which is the algorithm employed by most modern SAT solvers<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, and the T stands for the extension with certain so-called theories. A theory here is just a collection of supported non-Boolean datatypes and operations which are also allowed in the input formula.</p>
<p>To work around this in CDCL(T) we construct a Boolean formula which is a sound over-approximation of the input formula.
I’m going to gloss over a lot of details, but essentially we can do this by replacing any subterm of the formula that we cannot encode by an unconstrained variable.
This formula can then be solved by a SAT solver.
If the solver declares the formula unsatisfiable, we know that our input problem is also unsatisfiable because our approximation can only make it easier to satisfy.
If the SAT solver produces a Boolean solution to our approximated problem, we then need to check whether we can extend it to a solution to the input problem.
This is done using so-called theory solvers, which handle the non-Boolean datatypes and operations.
If they are able to extend the solution to satisfy the input problem, we are done, otherwise the theory solvers produce some data which allows us to refine our Boolean over-approximation in such a way that it better approximates the input formula.
Then the process is repeated until either the SAT solver decides the problem to be unsatisfiable or until the theory solvers produce a solution.</p>
<p>As far as I’m aware<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, most CDCL(T) solvers come with their own SAT solver, which is tightly integrated to make the interaction between theory solvers and the SAT solver as efficient as possible.
Still those integrated SAT solvers use the same techniques, the same data structures and the same algorithms as stand-alone SAT solvers.
Any improvement made to stand-alone SAT solvers will find its way into integrated SAT solvers and vice versa.</p>
<p>There are too many solvers based on this approach to list them all here, but examples are <a href="https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3">Z3</a>, which seems to be the most popular, or <a href="https://cvc4.github.io/">CVC4</a> which has won many awards at solver competitions.</p>
<h2 id="cnf-as-assembly-language">CNF as Assembly Language</h2>
<p>This high-level description might leave you with the impression that SMT solvers are mostly thin wrappers around a SAT solver.
This would be far from the truth.
In my description I simply focused on the part where SAT solvers are used.
Overall I think a SAT solver is a significant part of a state-of-the-art SMT solver, but the majority of necessary complexity lies elsewhere, especially for CDCL(T) based solvers.</p>
<p>I think a good analogy of the relationship between the interface offered by SAT solvers and SMT solvers is that of assembly language and high level languages.
Here Boolean CNF formulas correspond to a universal assembly language that is supported by different SAT solver implementations, much like you can get CPUs that run the same instruction set from different vendors.
Keeping this layer as simple and minimal as possible, even if that complicates manual use, helps a lot with making different implementations compatible.
This in turn leads to increased competition between solvers, which I think played an important part in the improvements we’ve seen over the years.</p>
<p>SMT solvers then allow you to effectively use a SAT solver without having to be an expert in CNF encoding.
They give you a much easier to use input language and at the same time free you from making a lot of low-level decisions that would require expert knowledge about SAT solvers.
This is very much like compilers allow you to use high level languages while freeing you from having to worry about details like e.g. instruction scheduling or register allocation.
Also these days no one would call a modern compiler a thin wrapper that produces assembly code (I hope!).</p>
<p>The analogy even extends a bit further: Sometimes for specific problems that could be solved with an SMT solver, an …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><p>👋 Hi, My name is Mohd Danish from INDIA &amp; I started my Indiehacker journey in January 2019. </p><p>You can find me on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/mddanishyusuf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://twitter.com/mddanishyusuf</a> &amp; watch me how I failed &amp; success with my projects.</p><p>I really love to read good stories &amp; write true stories based on true life events. So, today I’m sharing my life experience about how I made good money with my product in less than 48 hours.</p><p>I solved 10 problems I faced with MVP &amp; launch on ProductHunt.</p><p>After all those, I build my first SAAS product that related to API called NoCodeAPI.com</p><p>NoCodeAPI - The easiest way to connect your Google Sheet, Airtable, Google Analytics, Twitter, Telegram, Open Graph API, MailChimp, 50+ application APIs without any backend.</p><p><img width="1440" alt="Screenshot 2020-10-03 at 6 37 53 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9165019/94992426-9ad10900-05a7-11eb-91d9-5fff09b4f1a6.png"></p><p>I Build NoCodeAPI MVP in 20 days. Finally, launch on ProductHunt on 12th January 2020 &amp; tweeted also. Everyone was loving it &amp; this was #1 product of the day. <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/nocodeapi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.producthunt.com/posts/nocodeapi</a></p><p>My tweet got 100k+ impression &amp; 17k media views.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/mddanishyusuf/status/1215947112187228161" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://twitter.com/mddanishyusuf/status/1215947112187228161</a></p><p>On the launch day, I got my first 3 paid customers &amp; more than 1200 signups. The launch was really successful but I learn one thing after 6 months that it’s easy to keep running a business &amp; get money from the customer pocket.</p><p>I made $2960 profit until 31-July-2020 but the growth was not good that I was expecting. But, One thing I realized that people need this product and I have to work more on market the product than develop new features.</p><p>One of my mentors told me that if you can get validate the idea &amp; people are paying for your service. Don’t give up just keep working on it and keep iterate according to what the user needs. So, I also get more confidence that Yes, this will be going to good.</p><p>Couple of things I did after that in Marketing:</p><ol start="1"><li>Made YouTube channels &amp; record videos for all the APIs. -&gt; Got Good traffic</li><li>Weekly email newsletter about new updates, integration, &amp; pricing update in the bottom -&gt; Got good conversion to paid users</li><li>Auto-mated email when free users cross API usage by 50%, 75%, &amp; 100% to upgrade plan.</li><li>Write content about the use-cases for the APIs.</li><li>Video call with the free &amp; paid customers if they need any help.</li><li>Improve the documentation part more easy &amp; simple for users.</li><li>I also keep adding one integration every week.</li></ol><p>After all these things I was able to get $850 MRR until and this was pretty great.</p><p>I see people were launching Lifetime deals and made more than 10k in 2 days.</p><p>I was working on NoCodeAPI 2.0 with a new dashboard &amp; I decide to launch a new version with 100 Lifetime deals launch offer. I was calculating that if I made this then I could be a millionaire in my country in 2 days and if I got failed then this will be a great lesson for my journey.</p><p>You guys can’t believe that I was getting mad and my heart was pumping. I was getting stripe notion on every 10 minutes. Someone bought Business Plan Lifetime subscription for $249. I was getting so excited &amp; feeling a high responsibility for the users.</p><p>And finally, the experiment was really successful &amp; I made $20,228 in less than 48 hours. I become the first solo millionaire in my country within 2 days.</p><p>It’s not about I never made that much money in my life, I sold the first product I build in Jan’2019 for $23k. The point is this money from my first SAAS product. </p><p>This all my experience with this experiment &amp; I’m seeing a huge potential with the product. I’m still working hard to make the product more mature &amp; profitable.</p><p>That's all.</p><p>I'll keep writing about my real-life experience. You can follow on twitter for the next story. <a href="https://twitter.com/mddanishyusuf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://twitter.com/mddanishyusuf</a></p><p>Peace.</p></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

		<span></span>
		<span><p>The Sound Blaster 1.0 was not the first PC sound card, but it was the first to support digital sound, two different types of sound synthesis, MIDI, and a joystick all in one card. Let’s lift the hood and examine how the card does its magic.<br>
You can follow along by <a href="https://github.com/schlae/snark-barker/blob/master/SnarkBarker.pdf">looking at the schematic here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Sound Playback</strong><br>
There are three methods a Sound Blaster card uses to play back digital audio.</p>
<p><strong>Direct DAC</strong><br>
The first is called Direct DAC and it means that the PC software has to feed the sound card each sample at just the right time. It works a lot like the parallel-port DACs that people used to build in the 80s and 90s, or like the Disney Sound Source. When you send a data byte to the sound card, it immediately changes the analog signal going into the speaker amplifier.</p>
<p>Software using this method typically sets up a periodic timer interrupt. In the interrupt handler, the new sample is calculated and then fed to the sound card for playback.</p>
<p>Although it’s a simple method, it produces extra noisy playback to due the timing jitter of the interrupt handler. Because PC interrupts are non-deterministic, the samples don’t occur at precisely the sampling rate. This timing difference means that the waveform being reproduced doesn’t match the source material, and the difference in voltage sounds like noise or hiss.</p>
<p><strong>DMA DAC</strong><br>
The other method uses the DMA (Direct Memory Access) controller on the PC motherboard to automatically send samples to the sound card. It does require a little bit more work to set up the operation.</p>
<ol>
<li>The software configures the PC’s DMA controller (historically an Intel 8237) with the source address and length. The DMA controller is set to perform a single transfer per DMA request (DREQ).</li>
<li>The Sound Blaster is configured for a particular sampling rate. It programs an internal timer to generate a DREQ signal at the sampling rate.</li>
<li>The software sends the playback command to the Sound Blaster.</li>
</ol>
<p>The next operations happen in a loop until all the samples have been played back. Notice that the software is not involved at all—just the DMA controller, the Sound Blaster, and main memory.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Sound Blaster asserts DREQ.</li>
<li>The DMA controller responds by asserting DACK (DMA Acknowledge) at the same time it places the memory address and memory chip select onto the bus. The data byte gets transferred directly from main memory into the Sound Blaster input register!</li>
<li>The Sound Blaster takes this data and sends it to the audio DAC.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, the Sound Blaster ends playback then triggers an interrupt to let the software know that it is done with playback.</p>
<p><strong>Auto-Initialize DMA DAC</strong><br>
The final method, introduced with the Sound Blaster 2.0, is very similar to the previous method, except the ending. The Sound Blaster triggers an interrupt as before, but then it reloads the sample counter to the original value and continues requesting samples from the DMA controller!</p>
<p>The usual way software uses this feature is to create a seamless digital audio stream using a double buffer. The DMA controller gets a buffer that is twice as big as the number of samples that the Sound Blaster is programmed to play back. Because of that, the interrupt gets triggered halfway through buffer playback. In the interrupt handler, the software then loads a new set of samples into the buffer half that has already been played. When playback hits the end of the DMA buffer, the interrupt triggers again, only this time the software refills the last half of the DMA buffer. The DMA controller then wraps around to the beginning of the buffer and playback continues unbroken.</p>
<p>One of the side effects of this approach is that if the software crashes, the DMA controller and sound card continue to play back the sample buffer in a loop. You may have heard this when playing old DOS games back in the day.</p>
<p><strong>Sound Recording</strong><br>
This works in very much the same way as playback including the Direct mode, DMA mode, and Auto-Init DMA modes, except data gets transferred in the opposite direction, from the sound card into main memory.</p>
<p>One interesting wrinkle is that the Sound Blaster doesn’t actually have a proper ADC (analog-to-digital converter)! Instead it uses a clever circuit and an algorithm to accomplish the same thing:</p>
<ol>
<li>An input filter processes the incoming sound to smooth out any high frequency transients. This is common practice, even with an ADC, to help prevent sampling-induced aliasing, but it it’s helpful for making the trick work.</li>
<li>A comparator looks at the difference between the audio DAC and the incoming signal. The output of the comparator is only one bit; it can only tell if the incoming signal is greater than or less than the setting of the audio DAC.</li>
<li>The DSP starts the audio DAC at the halfway point, then looks at the comparator output. The comparator output gets recorded as the most significant bit of the audio sample.</li>
<li>Depending on the bit, the DSP sets the audio DAC up or down half again—either 25% or 75%.</li>
<li>The DSP repeats steps 3 and 4, going halfway again and again until it’s obtained the 8 bits of a complete sample.</li>
</ol>
<p>This technique is known as successive approximation, and it’s a technique used in many ADC chips. The code looks something like this:<br>
<code><br>
mov	p1,#80h		; Start DAC at the halfway point, 1000 0000<br>
mov	c,t1			; 1 Put comparator output into carry bit<br>
mov	p1.7,c			; 2 If greater, then leave MSB as is. If less, clear MSB<br>
setb	p1.6			; 1 Set DAC to upper or lower halfway point<br>
mov	c,t1			; 1 Check comparator output again<br>
mov	p1.6,c			; 2 Rinse and repeat<br>
setb	p1.5<br>
mov	c,t1<br>
mov	p1.5,c<br>
setb	p1.4<br>
mov	c,t1<br>
mov	p1.4,c<br>
setb	p1.3<br>
mov	c,t1<br>
mov	p1.3,c<br>
setb	p1.2<br>
mov	c,t1<br>
mov	p1.2,c<br>
setb	p1.1<br>
mov	c,t1<br>
mov	p1.1,c<br>
setb	p1.0<br>
mov	c,t1<br>
mov	p1.0,c<br>
mov	a,p1			; We are done, copy DAC code into accumulator.</code></p>
<p><strong>The Hardware, Section By Section</strong></p>
<p><strong>Address Decoder</strong><br>
The address decoder takes the I/O port address off the ISA bus and looks for accesses at 210h, 220h, 230h, 240h, 250h, or 260h depending on the jumper setting. It also looks for 388h and 389h so that it can make the Yamaha OPL2 chip appear there for Adlib compatibility. It also decodes 0x200-207h as the joystick port (each address is actually the same).</p>
<p><a href="http://tubetime.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/address-decoder.png"><img src="http://tubetime.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/address-decoder.png" alt="" width="490" height="177"></a></p>
<p>A jumper, JP1, can be pulled to shut off the PC joystick port. The MIDI function still works, however. Many combo-IO boards came with a built-in joystick port so the one on the Sound Blaster may not always be needed.</p>
<p><strong>Reset Circuit</strong><br>
It’s important to make sure the card powers up in a good state without generating spurious noises, so the SB uses the ISA RESET signal to clear the OPL2, the CMS chips, the joystick one-shot, and basically all of the other internal state latches.</p>
<p><a href="http://tubetime.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/reset.png"><img src="http://tubetime.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/reset.png" alt="" width="496" height="159"></a></p>
<p>There is also an IO port that, if you write a 1 to it, resets the DSP and its associated bus interface. (You also have to write a 0 to it afterwards to allow the DSP to start operating.) Later versions of the DSP require this to exit high speed auto-init DMA mode, since in this mode, the DSP devotes 100% CPU to servicing DMA requests.</p>
<p><strong>DSP</strong><br>
The core of the digital sound capabilities of the Sound Blaster is the Digital Sound Processor, or DSP for short. It’s not actually a Digital Signal Processor in the traditional sense—it’s just an 8051 microcontroller with custom firmware.</p>
<p>The DSP also handles MIDI transmit and receive using the 8051’s built-in UART.</p>
<p><strong>DSP Bus Interface</strong><br>
The bus interface allows the host PC to talk to the DSP. It uses two unidirectional 8-bit registers as a “mailbox,” temporary holding areas for a single data byte. One is for PC-to-DSP communications, and the other is for DSP-to-PC communications. There are also two data flip flops that are used to signal when data is available in one of the registers.</p>
<p><a href="http://tubetime.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/mailbox.png"><img src="http://tubetime.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/mailbox.png" alt="" width="349" height="362"></a></p>
<p>When the PC sends data to the DSP (I/O port 2XCh), the data gets stored in an 8-bit register and the flip-flop is automatically set high (DAV_DSP).</p>
<p>When the DSP reads the register, the flip-flop gets cleared automatically.</p>
<p>When the DSP sends data to the PC, the data goes into the other 8-bit register and the other flip-flop automatically gets set (DAV_PC). The PC can check this bit by reading from I/O port 2XEh. When it reads from I/O port 2XAh, it receives the byte of data and the flip-flop automatically gets cleared. The DSP can see that the PC has read the byte by checking the DAV_PC input. The DSP often checks this pin to make sure the PC has read a data byte before writing a new data byte to the register, otherwise the byte in the register will be lost before the PC has a chance to read it.</p>
<p><a href="http://tubetime.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/data-flags.png"><img src="http://tubetime.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/data-flags.png" alt="" width="441" height="355"></a></p>
<p><strong>Interrupts</strong><br>
When the DSP is done with a particular (often lengthy) task, it can signal the host PC by asserting the interrupt line. It does this by pulsing IREQUEST which triggers a flip-flop that asserts the IRQ line on the PC bus. On the host PC, the interrupt handler is supposed to clear the interrupt by reading from I/O port 2XEh. This simply clears the flip-flop which then deasserts the IRQ line.</p>
<p><a href="http://tubetime.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/interrupt-flag.png"><img src="http://tubetime.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/interrupt-flag.png" alt="" width="426" height="281"></a></p>
<p><strong>DMA</strong><br>
When the DSP needs a new sample from the PC (or needs to transfer a new sample to the PC during record mode), it pulses the DREQUEST line. Note that the DSP also needs to enable DMA by asserting its DMA_EN# line. When DREQUEST pulses, it causes the DMA request flip-flop to output a 1 on the DRQ1 line. The PC’s DMA controller responds by asserting DACK1#, which clears the flip-flop. DACK1# also bypasses the address decode logic of the Sound Blaster and forces it to either accept data from or place data on the ISA bus lines. This data transfer happens between the ISA bus and the mailbox registers.</p>
<p><a href="http://tubetime.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/dma-flag.png"><img src="http://tubetime.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/dma-flag.png" alt="" width="527" height="170"></a></p>
<p><strong>Digital Audio Output</strong><br>
An 8-bit DAC connected to the 8051 generates an analog current corresponding with the digital code on its inputs. A current-to-voltage converter (U5C) changes the current into a voltage that is used by the rest of the circuit. This voltage goes through an antialiasing filter which removes distinctive- and ugly-sounding artifacts from the audio signal. U5A implements this filter using a Sallen-Key design. The filter cutoff frequency is about 4KHz, …</p></span></p></div></div>

                    <p>With today's zero or negative real interest rates, deciding what to do with your cash and short term savings has never been harder.</p><p>Savings accounts at major banks have paid close to 0% for nearly a decade, but now even online banks, credit unions and cash accounts from fintech startups pay 0.6% at best. CDs, "high yield" checking, and money market accounts are no better and come with even more restrictions. Treasuries? 1 month and 1 year T-Bills <a href="https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/Pages/TextView.aspx?data=billrates">also pay near zero</a>. Bond funds? Expense ratios, changing prices, default risk and minimums make these too complicated for the typical saver. What about peer-to-peer lending sites like Lending Club? These generate what seem like good returns, but it's hard to overstate the risk. You're making loans to people or businesses that didn't qualify for a loan from a traditional lender.</p><p>After exhausting all these options, you might just give up and decide to play the lottery with your savings. Since 1956, the UK government has offered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premium_Bond">Premium Bonds</a>, where interest for bond holders is determined by lottery. This gamified experience is one of the top savings vehicles in the UK, where about <a href="https://nsandi-corporate.com/media-resources/premium-bonds-factsheet">one third of citizens hold bonds valued in total at over $100 billion</a>. A startup named <a href="https://www.withyotta.com/">Yotta</a> just graduated from <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies?batch=S20">Y Combinator's Summer 2020</a> batch to launch a similar business in the US, and <a href="https://www.pooltogether.com/">PoolTogether</a> raised a <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/pooltogether/company_financials">seed round</a> led by <a href="https://www.ideocolab.com/ventures/">IDEO Colab Ventures</a> early this year for a blockchain-based version. Of course, these models are based on lotteries. They're gambling. Most people receive nothing, and any expected value calculation would tell you this game is not worth playing.</p><p>Are savings options so bad that people would rather gamble for the remote chance of winning some interest than even be bothered with a traditional savings vehicle?</p><p>Why have rates been so low for so long? Is there any end in sight?</p><h2 id="age-of-abundance">Age of Abundance</h2><p>Technology and digitization are driving incredible improvements in global quality of life, moving the world from an era of scarcity into an era of abundance. </p><p>Thirty years ago, finding an answer meant going to the library to read some books or asking people you knew. As of 2016, Google had indexed <a href="https://searchengineland.com/googles-search-indexes-hits-130-trillion-pages-documents-263378">130 trillion web pages</a>, providing instant answers to anything for everybody. Information is no longer scarce, and what's now scarce is matching the best answer to a question. Alex Danco calls this <a href="https://alexdanco.com/2019/09/07/positional-scarcity/">positional scarcity</a>.</p><p>Similar technology-driven processes of commoditizing supply and aggregating demand are playing out in industry after industry, giving rise to natural super-monopolies. Amazon has done this first in books, then in all retail. Netflix has done this in entertainment, Airbnb in accommodation, iTunes and Spotify in music, Facebook in your personal life, and Linkedin in your business life. The list goes on and on, and this software eats world process is still in the early innings.</p><p>The dark side to all this abundance is that technology is generating a Moore's law fueled deflationary cycle. Technology gives you more for less. This, by definition, is deflation. The faster technology spreads throughout the economy, the more deflationary pressure there is. In 2009, Microsoft was the only technology company in the top ten S&amp;P 500 companies by market cap. In 2019, the top five companies in the S&amp;P 500 by market cap were all technology companies. Humans, by nature, find it extremely difficult to see and understand exponential growth even when it is happening right in front of them.</p><p>If you want to test if you have a good feel for exponential growth, <a href="https://twitter.com/JeffBooth">Jeff Booth</a> in his book the <a href="https://amzn.to/3460StR">Price of Tomorrow</a>, asks a simple question. He says "Imagine if I fold a piece of paper on itself fifty times. (I can only fold it seven times before it resists too much, but let’s assume for the moment that I can keep folding it up to fifty times.) How thick would the piece of paper be on fold fifty?"</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I've never met anyone with a gut feel for exponential growth. You always have to calculate it. But everyone in the startup world at least knows never to turn their back on it.</p>— Paul Graham (@paulg) <a href="https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1235250332936081408?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 4, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>Most people give an answer of a few inches, and on rare occasions Jeff says he hears "to the ceiling" unless someone has heard the question before. The correct answer is that on fold fifty the paper would reach all the way to the sun (93 million miles).</p><p>But getting more for less seems great, right? What's the problem?</p><p>Consumer spending accounts for 70% of the US economy, and therefore growing the economy is heavily dependent on increasing consumer spending. But a steadily increasing deflationary force pushes consumers to spend less. And to get consumers to spend more, central banks lower interest rates to make borrowing cheap. This is why global debt has doubled over the last ten years.</p><p>In past situations, lower interest rates led to increased consumer spending which led to inflation, steadily decreasing consumer debt burdens. This is why the Fed has an inflation target of 2%. The US economy is built on credit and assumes a steady low level of inflation to work properly. But with strong <a href="https://www.lynalden.com/fiscal-and-monetary-policy/">deflationary pressure</a>, inflation has proven elusive. </p><figure><img src="https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/2020/09/image-4.png" alt="" srcset="https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/image-4.png 600w, https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/2020/09/image-4.png 829w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>What happens in an economy experiencing deflation? The cost of debt in real terms increases and there is downward pressure on wages. This means your mortgage or rent payment gets steadily more expensive in real terms at the same time that layoffs and unemployment increase because employees also get steadily more expensive (and don't respond well wages cut). The higher the debt level, the worse this situation is. And global debt levels have never been higher.</p><figure><img src="https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/2020/09/image-6.png" alt=""></figure><p>Left unchecked, this results in large-scale social unrest, populism, or worse. This explains why interest rates have been steadily decreasing for years and why the Fed has signaled <a href="https://twitter.com/BloombergTV/status/1306332101680287744">they will keep interest rates at zero until at least 2023</a>. And because zero interest rates are no longer sufficient to encourage enough new borrowing and spending, it's why Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in March that there is <a href="https://twitter.com/todayshow/status/1243133507859292160?lang=en">no limit to the amount of money the Fed is willing to put into the economy to keep it afloat</a>. The Fed continues to massively expand the supply of US dollars.</p><figure><img src="https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/2020/09/image-5.png" alt="" srcset="https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/image-5.png 600w, https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/image-5.png 1000w, https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/09/image-5.png 1600w, https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/2020/09/image-5.png 2332w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Understanding the fight between the exponential force of technology driven deflation and the inflationary forces of low interest rates and massive expansion of the money supply is important to understanding what is likely to happen to the future for interest rates and the yield on savings vehicles. With every doubling in the exponential spread of technology, deflation is harder and harder for governments and central banks to counter-act. This is a massive problem, but we'll leave that for another day. For our purposes related to savings, what's clear is that zero yield is probably here to stay.</p><p>Is there nothing we can do to save savings? It seems unreasonable to receive no compensation for letting someone borrow your savings. And even worse to have to pay for the privilege.</p><p>Savings accounts seem rather boring, like a long forgotten banking backwater. But what if we were to reimagine the savings account for the software century? Could we redesign them from first principles for the age of abundance? Could we unbundle them from the bank, strip out their costs, give them full transparency, and generally make them 10x better?</p><p>Let's try.</p><h2 id="can-software-save-savings">Can software save savings?</h2><p>Before we start, let's make sure we understand the problem we're solving.

<li>From bank run or default (e.g. FDIC insurance)</li>

<li>Provide compensation for the use of your money</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>As you look at these jobs to be done, can you identify a customer-first focus in how banks have prioritized them or what they have optimized for other than enriching themselves? I can't. Banks might pat themselves on the back for adding mobile account access or mobile check deposit, but the truth is that savings products have scarcely changed in decades, have evolved by incrementalism, and have never had a bottoms-up re-assessment. It reminds me of the wireless industry before the iPhone.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>If we took a customer-first focus to re-imagining the savings vehicle, what jobs would we optimize for?

<li><strong>Reasonable preservation of principal.</strong> Most savers need their money over the next year.</li>
<li><strong>Safety from theft, loss or default.</strong> Savers need to have confidence that their savings won't be stolen, lost or defaulted on by an insolvent institution.</li>
<li><strong>Electronic withdrawals.</strong> Let's assume customers have a checking account elsewhere so we can focus solely on ACH and internal transfers.</li>
<li><strong>Electronic deposits.</strong> …</li></ol></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><strong>The French language</strong> offers two ways of speaking about freedom: <em>libre arbitre</em> means â€˜free will;â€™ <em>volontÃ©</em> means â€˜the willâ€™ or, better, â€˜volitionâ€™. Each carries with it distinct conceptual baggage. On the one hand, we exercise free will when making a choice. For volition, on the other hand, our freedom amounts to an exertion of effort. One is intellectual; the other laborious. Although you could get away with using either in everyday conversation, the choice of one term rather than the other is consequential. Indeed, the history of this semantic rift spills beyond the French language. It reveals a fissure at the core of what it means to author oneâ€™s own life story.</p>
<p>Two hundred years ago, disputes over the nature of freedom were all-consuming in France. Thatâ€™s not only because political upheavals rocked the 19th century. In the wake of the 1789 French Revolution, men and women experienced radical democracies, military dictatorships, resurgent monarchies and constitutional republics â€“ a living exercise in political science during which questions of <em>libertÃ©</em> (another term for â€˜freedomâ€™) preoccupied national debates.</p>
<p>A scientific revolution also ignited beyond the Palace of Versailles, setting the fates of free will and volition on a collision course. The rise of psychology and neurology threw into disarray the terms with which people made sense of their selfhood. By the beginning of the 20th century, the young sciences showed how freedom involves our entire bodies; indeed, it penetrates far deeper into our being than mere choice.</p>
<p>The philosopher and psychologist Maine de Biran (1766-1824) led the vanguard. During a long political career, from the court of Louis XVI to the lower house of parliament â€“ an institution created after the brothers of the executed king took over the throne in 1815 â€“ Biran used his influence to gather the foremost French scientists. They studied the mind as part of the body. At a time when the nervous systemâ€™s workings were only beginning to be understood, the gatherings were, for some, an occasion to dispel freedom as an illusion. Emblematic was the physiologist Pierre-Jean-George Cabanis (1757-1808) who claimed that â€˜The brain secretes thought like the liver secretes bile.â€™ Material enquiry, and not the abstract notion of free will, was to explain our agency.</p>
<p>Biran saw the fledgling brain sciences otherwise. In his work <em>The Influence of Habit on the Faculty of Thinking</em> (1802), Biran showed how our freedom hinges on volition, which canâ€™t be easily confined to the space between our ears. Materialist scientists tilted at windmills, so Biran charged. The idea of free will is a fiction because our freedom needs friction.</p>
<p>Biranâ€™s insight was that our nervous system is not a cause of volition but its constraint. In putting our body to use, we exert effort and encounter resistance. The play between the two â€“ their modulation over time â€“ gives rise to habits. According to Biran, habit follows a double law: â€˜the less we feel, the more we perceiveâ€™. Before I studied the French language, the silent consonants and serous liaisons struck my ears like an indistinguishable mÃ©lange. By focusing on individual words, contorting my tongue and taking risks to speak, I eventually came to inhabit the language. Thanks to my sustained volition, a cacophony of foreign sounds eventually gave way to meaningful speech. For Biran, the paradigmatic habit is self-education.</p>
<p>His book overthrew the longstanding view that habit is blind repetition. RenÃ© Descartes and Immanuel Kant had condemned habits as mechanical routines. They cloud clear judgment. For Biran, however, the discrete decisions of our free will matter less than the direction of our volition over time. And as habits take over, new resistance mounts. My patterns of thought and verbal crutches take the place of intentional speech. When I find myself lost in conversation at a cocktail party, <em>voilÃ&nbsp;</em> rolls off my tongue instinctively whenever I feel itâ€™s time to wrap up. Habits open an opportunity to renew our efforts and overcome the resistance that takes over within us.</p>
<p><strong>In the 19th century</strong>, psychology and politics revolved in the same orbit. Uprisings sought to replace old monarchical habits with new democratic ones. Biran, however, was no democrat. He applauded NapolÃ©onâ€™s brief return from exile in 1815. The French deserved an emperor who would strengthen peopleâ€™s volition, which had been weakened by the unruly sentiments of popular sovereignty. Biranâ€™s vision of selfhood was as consistent as his politics was lamentable, tethered as it was to an enduring aristocratic disposition.</p>
<p>Bergson adapted Biranâ€™s insight for a modern world ruled by numbers: choices touch only the shallows of our selfhood</p>
<p>In the eyes of European liberals, the new social orderâ€™s success hinged on a different form of freedom â€“ free will. Universal male suffrage and market economies, both established with yet another French revolution in 1848, introduced novel decision-making capacities. The prolific polymath Charles Renouvier (1815-1903) argued that citizensâ€™ <em>libre arbitre</em> usurped the reign of God and monarch. We occupy the role of judge (following the Latin, <em>arbitrium</em>) who renders a decision, as it were, in the court of the mind. To act with a free will, we â€˜place the government of our innermost spirit in the hands of a single ideaâ€™. Renouvier spent the decade of 1854-64 writing his <em>Essays of General Critique</em>, a project to translate the individual will into the driving force of national regeneration. Government would thereby find its legitimacy in the voluntary consent of citizens.</p>
<p>National regeneration was the chief <a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/w/wsfh/0642292.0042.015/--brain-in-the-third-republic-science-pedagogy-and-national?rgn=main;view=fulltext" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">goal</a> of the Third Republic, which reinvigorated disputes between free will and volition. It was the longest democratic regime in the countryâ€™s history, lasting from 1870 to the Nazi occupation in 1940. Following its inception, investment in science was a national priority. Fidelity to the <em>patrie</em> was to be not only free but also rational.</p>
<p>When the first experimental psychology laboratories broke ground in the 1880s, their focus was psychometrics. Reaction time experiments allowed researchers to track the time of thinking, feeling and willing. They ranged between .1 and .3 seconds (the time from the reception of stimuli in the brain to the movement of a limb). The mathematical revolution in the study of mind also set in motion projects to scale intellectual aptitude â€“ Alfred Binet (1857-1911) released the first IQ measure in 1905 â€“ and to rationalise colonial conquests of â€˜uncivilisedâ€™ people in West Africa and Indochina. A trenchant materialism characterised the <em>fin de siÃ¨cle</em>, a period during which faith in numbers drove projects to hierarchise human freedom.</p>
<p>Critics returned to Biranâ€™s ideas. For Alfred FouillÃ©e (1838-1912), quantitative psychology demonstrated that thoughts constitute powerful motor actions â€“ what he called <em>idea-forces.</em> Their duration fluctuates with the obstacles we confront. In documenting the time taken to make decisions, experimental research didnâ€™t make freedom predictable so much as it laid to rest the idea of unencumbered free will. Such was the case in liberal politics as well: our choices (left or right, buy or sell) reflect the surface of our freedom. Deeper, FouillÃ©e believed, was a fleshly understanding of volition entangled with the bodyâ€™s sensory-motor coordination.</p>
<p>The philosopher Henri Bergson (1859-1941) went a step further. In an <em>oeuvre</em> that was awarded the 1927 Nobel Prize in Literature, Bergson showed how we experience the world as a <em>lived duration</em>. As he saw it, psychometrics recorded the trace left by our volition, much like a marathonâ€™s final standings indicate when runners pass the finish line. Within the flow of time, however, our freedom fluctuates between exertions of energy and effortless passivity. When I reflect inward on the life I live, I notice discrete decisions: the choice of college majors, career paths and romantic partners. When I probe deeper, the volition shaping my self comes into view â€“ that is, the kind of person I continuously strive to become â€“ and with it the constraints that have lent traction to my creativity. Bergson adapted Biranâ€™s insight for a modern world ruled by numbers: choices touch only the shallows of our selfhood.</p>
<p>Today, choice-making is central to economic forecasting, political analysis and psychological testing. Market data and survey metrics aggregate our collective decisions. Although our world is distant from that of France a century ago, the countryâ€™s thinkers offer an enduring reminder that our aspirations for freedom do not amount to one thing. Do we seek more choices? Or do we strive to resist the sediments of time â€“ that is, to make our selfhood anew?</p></div></div></div>]]>

        <p>Reviewing papers is a central source of diversion, confusion, joy, and
other feelings for many academics. Much has already been written about
how to structure a review, how to phrase criticism kindly, etc. But in
this brief post I want to point out that the <em>mindset</em> behind a review
is absolutely crucial for writing a useful and constructive review. My
core philosophy can be summarised as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When reviewing a paper, you are primarily a <em>midwife</em> for the paper,
not a <em>gatekeeper</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let me expand on this: it seems that many people consider their review
duties to be akin to that of the Night’s Watch. But this is altogether
the wrong approach for me. As reviewers, we are <em>not</em> the last line of
defence that protects our community from ‘improper’ research—may
it sound ever so romantic. I fully understand where this feeling comes
from: certainly, there <em>are</em> researchers that act in bad faith and try
to publish something they <em>know</em> is wrong. However, my issue with this
perspective is that it aligns itself along a low-prevalence event. The
common researcher does not have malicious intentions. If they <em>had</em> it
would be almost impossible to have any sort of scientific progress! So
rather than seeing ourselves as ‘protectors of the realm’, each one of
us should see themselves as the <em>midwife</em> of a paper: our <strong>ultimate</strong>
goal—not necessarily our <em>immediate</em> one—should be to help
the research get published eventually. Of course, the paper may not be
up to the standards of a certain conference. That’s fair. That happens
to all of us. But we should make sure that we are willing to cooperate
with the authors<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> to ensure that the research sees the light of day
at some point in time.</p>
<p>If we write reviews with <em>this</em> mindset, our statements will be imbued
with the proper spirit, making it possible to criticise constructively
in all situations.</p>
<p>To some extent, this mindset can also be used in other contexts. Code,
for example, should also be reviewed with a midwife mindset—even
though there may be more reasons to reject pull requests.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> However,
even in these contexts, try to be a supporter, instead of a preventer.</p>
<p>In short: <em>do not be a gatekeeper, be a midwife.</em></p>
<section role="doc-endnotes">
<hr>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
<p>Of course, cooperation goes both ways, and we cannot protect ourselves against ‘bad faith’ authors. I would argue that these cases are rare. If they are <em>not</em> rare, it might be a sign of a dysfunctional community or system, but handling these cases is beyond the scope of this post. <a href="#fnref:1" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:2" role="doc-endnote">
<p>For example, <em>feature creep</em> is an issue of code bases that does not necessarily have an equivalent in the scientific community. <a href="#fnref:2" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>

<!--
SYNOPSIS:		Background Information on Downloading and Installing Software from Sourcecode on Open-source Operating Systems
PREREQUISITES:		None
-->



<p>This document is intended for users of open-source operating systems who wish to install software direct from the original authors, rather than relying solely on the software (and versions) provided by their operating system. It is written for those who are not familiar with the concept of downloading software in source-code form, providing background information about relevant commands and the process in general.</p>



<ul>
  <li>Development and distribution: independent software developers, multi-os support, releases (archives), version-control</li>
  <li>Distributions: binary packages and package-managers</li>
  <li>Downloading: http, ftp, wget, checksums and signatures</li>
  <li>Archive files: tar, zip, gzip</li>
  <li>Common files: README and INSTALL; required dependencies</li>
  <li>Patching with sed/awk/patch</li>
  <li>Building and Installing: configure, make, cmake, perl and python</li>
  <li>Building and Installing Documentation</li>
  <li>Compiler settings and stripping; handing errors</li>
  <li>Post-installation</li>
</ul>



<p>A typical operating system consists of hundreds of different applications. In a proprietary operating system, the producer/seller of that operating system typically owns and manages the development of all that software. However open-source systems are usually created by obtaining and integrating applications invented and maintained by many independent groups - or even single independent developers. In addition, an open-source software project is often used in a variety of different operating systems - eg Linux-based, BSD-based, Hurd, and sometimes even integrated into proprietary operating systems such as Solaris, Mac, even Windows (if the licence allows).</p>

<p>The original software developers are sometimes referred to by distribution maintainers and end-users as the <em>upstream source</em> or simply <em>upstream</em>. Similarly, the developers often refer to the distributions that use their code, or the end-users as <em>downstream</em>.</p>

<p>Most open-source projects store their source code in a version-control system which is accessible over the internet (read-only for anonymous users). For such projects it is possible to download the very latest “in-progress” files, or to download the set of files “tagged” with some release-id (version number). However it is often not very efficient to do this; projects usually make regular <em>releases</em> by creating an <em>archive file</em> containing all the relevant files and make it available for download. For projects that do not have a public version-control system, such periodically released <em>archive files</em> are the only way to obtain the sourcecode directly.</p>



<p>There are many <em>operating system distributions</em> which do the work of finding, downloading and tweaking all the most-commonly used software packages. Several also compile it, and make the binary-form results available. There are many benefits, including quicker installation, one location to <em>find</em> relevant software, and particularly a supply of relevant <em>security patches</em>: the distribution maintainers watch for security updates and make it easy for end users to notice and install them.</p>

<p>However such distributions often don’t include the very latest version of software; if you need a newer version than the one provided by your distribution then it may be necessary to build it yourself.  Software is also often very customisable at install-time, particularly with the ability to omit features that are not needed. Because a distribution needs to keep a wide range of users happy, they tend to include <em>every</em> feature in the compiled applications they distribute; you as the end-user may be able to tune an application better by compiling it yourself.</p>

<p>Distributions generally include a <em>package manager</em> that keeps a database of which software is installed. It isn’t a good idea to go changing the software on a machine “behind the back” of the package manager; all sorts of odd behaviour could occur later. If your distribution has a package manager, then please read this document for background information - but then consult the documentation for your distribution to find out how to install software without confusing your package manager. Usually this involves writing a <em>package specification</em> that describes the software and then using the local package manager to compile and install the software. This applies to all distributions with package-managers, regardless of whether applications are distributed in binary (pre-compiled) or source-code form.</p>



<p>The usual way to download an archive file is by using a web-browser and clicking on a “download” button, clicking a link, or right-clicking a link and selecting “save as”. This downloads the file using the “http” protocol. Some sites instead make files available via the older “ftp” protocol. Many web-browsers support this too, ie clicking a link can also work here. Alternately, there are ftp client applications.</p>

<p>The “wget” or “curl” command-line application can also be used under unix-like operating systems to fetch a file via http or ftp when the correct URL is known.</p>

<p>Sites which publish software that is very frequently downloaded often have “mirror” sites set up, ie helpful people keep <em>copies</em> of the files in various places around the world. The original site usually has a list of the available <em>mirrors</em>, and you should choose one that is near to you. This helps reduce the cost of network bandwidth on the original publisher, and usually also lets you download faster.</p>

<p>Both the “http” and “ftp” network protocols can be intercepted by criminals or other undesirable parties who can then modify data as it downloads. Data can also potentially be corrupted by accident while underway (though this is not common). And when using a mirror-site, it is possible that someone has modified the files there (ie that the files on the mirror are not the same as those from the original publisher).  It is therefore a good idea to <em>verify</em> that what you downloaded is what the original publisher intended.</p>

<p>Many sites provide an <em>md5sum</em> file for each archive file, which holds a <em>checksum</em> of the contents of the file; sometimes a single <em>md5sums</em> file holds checksums for a number of other files. You should always obtain an md5sums file from the <em>original site</em>, never a mirror. And you should download it via the secure <em>https</em> protocol if possible. The unix <code>md5sum</code> commandline tool can then be used to compute the checksum of the big archive file, and compare it to the expected values to ensure the contents are as expected.</p>

<p>To compute the sum of a single file:</p>

<pre><code>   md5sum file-to-check
</code></pre>

<p>and “by hand” verify the output of this application against the expected value. If the value is in a webpage, you can open the “find” dialog on that page and copy-and-paste the value output by the md5sum program. The “find” will match only if the values are the same.</p>

<p>If the software provider provides an md5sums file which has a list of (filename, checksum) pairs, then you can run:</p>

<pre><code>   md5sum -c md5sums-file
</code></pre>

<p>which will look in your local system for every file listed in the md5sums-file, compute its checksum, and report an error if it is not the expected value.</p>

<p>Some software providers <em>sign</em> archive files instead of (or as well as) providing an md5 checksum. In this case you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>download the provider’s <em>public key</em> from their website (using https where possible)</li>
  <li>download the “signature file” for the archive-file; this will be a small file which has the same base name as the downloaded file, with suffix “.sig” or “.asc”</li>
  <li>perform the following steps</li>
</ul>

<pre><code># needed only once for each key, ie each "publisher"
gpg --import {public-key}

gpg --verify {signature-file-name}
</code></pre>

<p>The verify step decrypts the signature-file, revealing a checksum; it then runs a checksum algorithm over the real file and checks that they are the same. Obviously, the “gpg” application needs to be installed locally.</p>



<p>An <em>archive</em> is a single file that contains within it a number of other files. There are several different tools for creating such files but in all cases the process is effectively to append all the individual files together, and then add an “index” which contains the offset, length, name and other properties of the original files so that they can be extracted again.</p>

<p>Note: the word “archive” in English can imply something “old”, no longer used, or a “backup” copy. While archive files can be used to store backups or rarely used data, they are also convenient for passing data around a network.</p>

<p>The  “tar” application packs multiple files into a single “tar-format” archive file, which is the most commonly-used format in open-source. Tar originally meant “tape archive”, but the format works well on disks too. Tar archives remember not only the original names of files, but also their original Unix “owner id” and file-permissions. The ownerid is seldom useful (unless the tar archive was created on the same machine it is being unpacked on), but the file-permissions are. By convention, tar-format files are usually given names ending in “.tar”. Tar-format files containing sourcecode are sometimes referred to as “tarballs”.</p>

<p>The tar application doesn’t compress the file contents. However source-code files do compress very well and network bandwidth is always too slow and too expensive, so tar files are usually <em>compressed</em> after creation, using a generic compression application. The most commonly used compression type is “gzip”, and the resulting file is usually given the suffix “.tar.gz” or “.tgz”. Compression with bzip2 is also common, and such files are usually given the suffix “.tar.bz2”. Occasionally “xz” compression will be used; files are usually given the suffix “.tar.xz”.</p>

<p>The original version of the tar application was created a long time ago, and it has been reimplemented a number of times. Sadly this means that the commandline options available vary considerably depending on which version of the application you are using. The functionality also varies depending on version; in particular some versions can auto-detect when compression has been used, and decompress automatically …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="blog-page"><div><div><div><article><div><div><h2>Vets Who Code: What, Where, And How to Help</h2></div><p>When I started this journey&nbsp;<span>SIX</span>&nbsp;years ago, I just wanted to create an affordable solution for veterans to transition into the workforce as fast as they can without the hurdles of civilian life of trying to find a code school that accepts the GI Bill. I didn’t want my fellow troops in transition to fall through the cracks, like I did.</p><p>That’s why I went into the nonprofit sector in the first place. I wanted to help my brothers and sisters. What I found was a system designed, not to help them, but, to get as much money out of donors, sponsors and government agencies as possible by telling the story of how the nation fails our servicemen and women; all the while creating extremely high requirements, yet, having extremely low benchmarks for success. Did you know that unless you are actually sleeping on the streets in some states you aren’t considered homeless? Meaning, if you are living out of your car, living out of a hotel room, or couch-surfing, you don’t qualify for certain support services.</p><p>I should know — I’ve had the great displeasure of doing all three. Despite the adversity, perseverance enabled me to climb out of the darkness, with a deep desire to keep other veterans from falling into the abyss. Thinking back, that was the hardest six months of my life! It was development and design that helped me get through those tough times, not the current nonprofit sector filled with relics that have cozy relationships all the while doing the minimum.</p><p>I spent every waking moment learning skills that other people were either too stubborn or just too fearful to learn, and it added value to me — value the civilian sector could understand. Then, when a fallen soldier’s family needed help, my newly minted value empowered me to answer the call to bury a brother. Afterwards, I was like “what do I do next?” — leading to the stupid idea of turning something old (a freaking castle!) into something new, repurposing it to retrain veterans in real and digital skillsets. Unfortunately that didn’t work. But, out of it came true inspiration, something revamped, brilliant, and functional — something I hope would even make David Heinemeier Hansson (my hero) proud.</p><p><span>What is Vets Who Code?</span></p><p>Vets Who Code is a veteran founded, lead and operated 501(c)(3) distributed charitable non-profit, dedicated to filling the wide chasm between technical expertise needed and available with transitioning veterans and active duty military spouses through software development training and education. We utilize our distributed model for the capability to train veterans anywhere, but we are so much more. We are a team of people with hybrid tech skills and a lean mentality, focused on helping veterans not only learn how to program, but get jobs in the field and to do it without the unnecessary bloat that other nonprofits take on. From UX and DevOPs engineers to little old me, who got thrown into this because I simply wanted to help my fellow veterans, which is the most important part of this nonprofit. Currently 80% of the team is veterans, and we provide what you need to surpass our successes and learn from our mistakes. ’Cause if we are to celebrate this thing called life, we need to be there together.</p><p><span>Why Code?</span></p><p>Great question. Right now our country has a problem: we have programming jobs, but not enough programmers. Not only that, we don’t have enough GOOD programmers. On top of that, while it’s definitely better, veterans are still the highest unemployed demographic in America. So we had this crazy idea. What if we created a vetted curriculum designed around modern technologies? Not just any veterans, those who this skill could really impact. Not only that, let’s work tirelessly to mentor them in professional standards of code, business, and design. Can you imagine how much better you get at design thinking when the guy speaking has been thinking about it every day for the last 15 years? We then thought, what if we added tools to continue learning after you’ve dealt with us for 15 weeks? Our partners like Frontend Masters and Google Cloud give us amazing tools to gift the veterans so that they can learn and prep for up to a year. Not only that — we make introductions, and train them in the interview process to help them get jobs in the industry. You know what? It works. Our troops have been getting highly paid positions, and we couldn’t be happier. Here we empower amazing people to have the lifestyle they have earned, and we do it all online; a feat that wasn’t even possible 10 years ago.</p><p><span>How Can You Help?</span></p><p>That’s actually a question we get quite often. Our veterans spend 15 weeks with our team focusing on the language JavaScript and and all it encompasses, and understanding software architecture and computer science fundamentals. We focus on having workflows, interview questions, computer science, and UX research.</p><p>The most important thing you can do to support our mission is&nbsp;<a href="https://donorbox.org/vetswhocode-donation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>donate</span></a>. As a 501(c)(3) we are tax-deductible, and as a distributed non-profit, we don't have any wasteful operating cost. All proceeds go directly to resources and cool things for the troops.</p><p>If you’re a software engineer with at least two years experience working with ES6 and Javascript, sign up as a mentor. If you are a designer who can code, we are always looking for someone to help us with our user experience. If you are in HR, drop us a line in our contact form, so that we can get our troops into your pipeline for javascript jobs.</p></div></article></div></div></div></section></div>]]>

October 3, 2020 | https://wiki.alopex.li/RustStarterKit2020 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://wiki.alopex.li/RustStarterKit2020">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="wikipage">

<p>People were arguing about Rust’s std lib recently, so I went through the <code>Cargo.toml</code> of all the Rust projects I’ve written since 2015 and picked out the choice tools that get used over and over again. Up to date as of October 2020.</p>
<p>Also see <a href="https://wiki.alopex.li/RustCrates" title="Go to wiki page">RustCrates</a>, though that’s old. There’s also <a href="https://christine.website/blog/rust-crates-go-stdlib-2020-09-27">this</a>, which is narrower but deeper, and <a href="https://github.com/rust-unofficial/awesome-rust">awesome-rust</a>, which is shallower and broader, and the various <a href="https://www.arewewebyet.org/">more</a> <a href="https://arewegameyet.rs/">specific</a> <a href="https://areweasyncyet.rs/">websites</a> <a href="https://www.areweguiyet.com/">for various</a> <a href="https://areweideyet.com/">topics</a>.</p>

<p>I need to set up a new Rust dev environment, what do I install?</p>
<h2 id="linting-clippy">Linting – <code>clippy</code></h2>
<p>The one, the only, the great Rust style and correctness linter. Want to learn how to write “idiomatic” Rust, or just learn more about handy little corners of the language and library? Run <code>clippy</code> regularly. It’s distributed with the compiler via <code>rustup</code> now, so you have no excuse not to.</p>
<h2 id="build-cache-sccache">Build cache – <code>sccache</code></h2>
<p>Or, “how to make a full rebuild 70% faster”. <code>sccache</code> is a build artifact cache similar to <code>icecream</code> or <code>ccache</code>, except it’s actually trivial to just use. <code>cargo install sccache</code>, add a single line in a home dir config file, and you’re ready to go. Pretty much handles most crate and compiler versioning issues for you, so it Just Works if you update crates or install a new version of <code>rustc</code> or something. I think I’ve had to force-clear the cache due to some build weirdness a grand total of once. Looks like it has enough features to use in a professional context as well, at least on a small-to-medium scale.</p>
<h2 id="dependency-viewer-cargo-tree">Dependency viewer – <code>cargo-tree</code></h2>
<p>The best way to view what dependencies you are using, and what dependencies they are using, and so on. Best way to start cracking down on flabby dependencies.</p>
<h2 id="benchmarking-criterion">Benchmarking – <code>criterion</code></h2>
<p>Basically the best benchmark system out there. Incredibly simple to use, informative, and statistically sound. Doesn’t really do profiling, but it’s a good start for understanding your program’s performance, and better for proving that your implementation of X is faster than someone else’s.</p>
<h2 id="other-things">Other things</h2>
<p>Stuff that is less general purpose but occasionally very useful for the meta-programming process of choosing libraries, evaluating them, etc.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>cargo-geiger</code> – Measures how much unsafe code is in a codebase, and its dependencies</li>
<li><code>cargo-crev</code> – A <a href="https://wiki.alopex.li/ActuallyUsingCrev">very neat tool</a> for authoring and verifying distributed code reviews.</li>
<li>Various tools maintained by <a href="https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/rust-ecosystem">Embark Studios</a>, useful for production/company purposes like checking licenses, pinning specific versions of crates, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>The cool stuff Real Computer Scientists write about.</p>
<h2 id="hashing">Hashing</h2>
<p>No specific crates here. There’s no single crate that provides All The Hash Algorithms, just lots of little ones that generally provide a single algorithm each. Just type the name of the algorithm you want into <code>crates.io</code> and you’ll get at least a couple options, choose the one with 8 million downloads or whatever. <code>sha2</code>, <code>md5</code>, <code>crc</code>, etc. Lots of them are written by the Rust core team.</p>
<h2 id="compression">Compression</h2>
<p>Same as the hashing category. Type <code>zip</code> or <code>bzip2</code> or whatever into crates.io and you’ll get what you need. <code>flate2</code> might be the one crate that’s not quite trivial to find. Again, many of them are written by the Rust core team.</p>
<h2 id="encryption">Encryption</h2>
<p>I have little actual experience or authority on this topic, so I’m going to punt on this one.</p>
<h2 id="pseudorandom-number-generator">Pseudorandom number generator</h2>
<p>Use <code>oorandom</code>. (Disclaimer, I wrote <code>oorandom</code>, but people besides me seem to like it.) More usually you’ll see the <code>rand</code> crate in use. If you’re doing Real Science and need to generate <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.0/reference/routines.random.html">fancy probabilities</a>, then <code>rand</code> is the right tool, but most people aren’t doing that. Otherwise <code>rand</code> is complicated and has lots of features, while <code>oorandom</code> is very simple and has about two features, and I expect 80% of code to use at least one of them. <code>rand</code> has had several major breaking changes in its history that the rest of the ecosystem still hasn’t caught up with, while I intend <code>oorandom</code>’s API to change maybe twice in my lifetime. (Its version number, while obeying semver, is mostly a joke.)</p>
<p>There’s other lightweight PRNG crates that are just fine; see <code>oorandom</code>’s readme for a list of some others and choose one you like. Whatever you choose, use the <code>getrandom</code> crate to produce Real Random Seeds for it.</p>

<p>“I just need to solve this ooooooone common problem, but it needs to be solved WELL…”</p>
<h2 id="logging-log">Logging – <code>log</code></h2>
<p>Need to output log messages in your code? Why, use the <code>log</code> crate. Where do the log messages go? <code>log</code> provides only an interface, and that interface compiles to nothing if it isn’t used. You can write your own system for it to actually output the logs to, which is pretty easy, or use one of the small plethora of crates for it. My preferred one is <code>pretty_env_logger</code>, but <code>fern</code>, <code>slog</code> and others are all good too.</p>
<h2 id="parallel-data-crunching-rayon">Parallel data crunching – <code>rayon</code></h2>
<p>Ever have some computation where you have a big list of STUFF and want to process it in parallel, farming out jobs to as many threads as you have CPU’s? That’s what <code>rayon</code> does, and it does it really, really well. You still <a href="https://aspenuwu.me/posts/rust-optimization.html">have to know what you’re doing</a>, but changing a single <code>.iter()</code> into <code>.par_iter()</code> and watching your CPU-bound data-crunching run 8x faster is pretty magical. Now your CPU can help keep you warm this winter!</p>
<p>Please never use it in a library. It’s rude to spawn threads in library code, unless that’s specifically what the library is for.</p>
<h2 id="regexes-regex">Regexes – <code>regex</code></h2>
<p>To quote the inestimable <a href="https://www.jwz.org/blog/">jwz</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some people, when confronted with a problem, think “I know, I’ll use regular expressions.” Now they have two problems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, <a href="https://xkcd.com/208/">somebody’s gotta save the day</a>. So, use the <code>regex</code> crate. Also use <a href="https://crates.io/crates/ripgrep">anything else</a> <a href="https://crates.io/crates/xsv">written by BurntSushi</a>. BurntSushi is a paragon of Rust program design, and also just a great <del>human being</del> charred cuisine in general.</p>
<h2 id="threadsafe-globals-lazy_static">Threadsafe globals – <code>lazy_static</code></h2>
<p>“I know globals are evil,” you say, “but I just need one. I’ll only use it for good, I promise.” <code>lazy_static</code> has your back.</p>
<p>May eventually be superseded by <code>once_cell</code>, which looks like its <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2788">headed for inclusion into <code>std</code></a>.</p>
<h2 id="serializationdeserialization-serde">Serialization/deserialization – <code>serde</code></h2>
<p>Ever have a struct and just wanted to turn it into JSON, CBOR, XML, or some other engine of woe and devastation designed to be written to an I/O stream? Or had a blob of random JSON and wanted to just stuff it into a struct matching it? Sure you have. <code>serde</code> lets you do this with a single <code>#[derive]</code>. <code>serde</code> is without a doubt one of Rust’s killer libraries. It is better than any other serialization system I have ever used.</p>
<p>What data formats does it support? Anything; the actual reading and writing is done via plugin library. There’s a <a href="https://serde.rs/#data-formats">wide selection of them</a>, of varying quality, and writing your own is a little tedious but not terribly difficult.</p>
<h2 id="error-handling">Error handling</h2>
<p>This spot deliberately left blank.</p>
<p>Rust’s <code>Result&lt;T,E&gt;</code> type is one of the best setups for lightweight, transparent error handling I’ve seen, but it doesn’t do everything. How do you easily write your own error type without a bunch of boilerplate? What if you have multiple different error types from different libraries you want to coalesce together? How do you collect a backtrace of every function an <code>Err</code> is returned through, so you can find the root cause of where it came from? Can we do all this without allocating anything unnecessarily? And so on.</p>
<p>There have been various crates to try to solve these problems. First in 2015 there was <code>error_chain</code>, which was complicated and not very convenient. Then in 2017 there was <code>failure</code>, which was simpler but not very flexible, and which took an irritatingly long time to compile. Then in 2019 there was <code>anyhow</code>, which was about the time I stopped paying attention. Now apparently the new kid on the block is <code>eyre</code>, and I’m sure that in another year or two there will be something else.</p>
<p>So, I just write the boilerplate and make my errors descriptive enough I don’t need a backtrace. When I want to get fancy I implement the built-in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/error/trait.Error.html"><code>Error</code></a> trait, which used to be kinda useless but is now more helpful. And in another five years it’ll still work just fine.</p>
<h2 id="byte-mucking-bytemuck">Byte mucking – <code>bytemuck</code></h2>
<p>For the rare occasions you need to turn a structure into arbitrary <code>&amp;[u8]</code> or back. Doing this using unsafe pointers is quite easy, and also makes it very easy to screw up horribly with Undefined Behavior galore. (Did you know that changing the value of padding bytes in a struct in UB? You do now.) <code>bytemuck</code> lets you muck around with bytes a little more responsibly.</p>
<h2 id="human-dates-and-times-chrono">Human dates and times – <code>chrono</code></h2>
<p>Rust’s <code>std::time</code> doesn’t really handle calendar or wall-clock times, just arbitrary, monotonic <code>Instant</code>’s and measurable <code>Duration</code>’s between them. Nice, pure, computationally-robust time measurement. For all the nasty human calendar and timezone stuff, you use <code>chrono</code>. (And maybe <code>humantime</code>, but I personally reach for <code>chrono</code> first, just out of habit.)</p>
<h2 id="bit-flags-bitflags">Bit flags – <code>bitflags</code></h2>
<p>Defining type-safe bit-masks in a reasonably convenient way. Not always worth the trouble, but sometimes pretty convenient.</p>

<p>“I have to create or read a…”</p>
<h2 id="pngjpeggifetc-image">PNG/JPEG/GIF/etc – <code>image</code></h2>
<p>General-purpose loading and saving and images, which can handle a lot of formats. Can do some amount of image manipulation as well, such as cropping, smoothing, etc. but that will hopefully be pulled out into its own library at some point soon.</p>
<h2 id="small-data-things-uuid-base64-csv-semver">Small data THINGS – <code>uuid</code>, <code>base64</code>, <code>csv</code>, <code>semver</code>…</h2>
<p>Exactly what it says on the tin.</p>

<p>Not aware of any great encoders, but there’s plenty of <em>decoders</em> for common audio formats. <code>lewton</code> for Ogg Vorbis, <code>hound</code> for .wav, <code>minimp3</code> for MP3, <code>claxon</code> for FLAC. Video, I haven’t used enough to have an opinion on.</p>
<h2 id="config-files-toml">Config files – <code>toml</code></h2>
<p>For all your config file format needs. Works with <code>serde</code>, naturally.</p>
<h2 id="markdown-pulldown-cmark">Markdown – <code>pulldown-cmark</code></h2>
<p>There’s several good Markdown readers and writers, <code>pulldown-cmark</code> is my favorite. It supports CommonMark, it’s simple to use, and it’s pure Rust.</p>
<h2 id="templating-askama">Templating – <code>askama</code></h2>
<p>There’s several quite good text templating engines, but <code>askama</code> IMO rises above them all by compiling your templates into Rust code and type-checking your templates at compile time. Sometimes this isn’t what you want, but it is a great feature surprisingly often. This also makes it super fast, for when you really need to …</p></div></div>

        <p><span>I</span>n the mid-2020â€™s, NASA will launch a helicopter-like lander the size of a small car toward Titan, Saturnâ€™s largest moon. Nearly a decade later, after crossing about a billion miles of empty darkness, this spacecraft, dubbed Dragonfly, will gently settle onto Titanâ€™s sand dunes.&nbsp;There&nbsp;the sun will merely appear as a very bright star in the heavens and the Earth will barely be visible, like a floating mote of dust. The frigid temperatures will be colder than anywhere on Earth. But scientists believe this enigmatic world might harbor alien life.<br></p>

<p>Of all the planets, moons and asteroids in our solar system, Titan is a rarity. Along with Enceladus, another of Saturnâ€™s moons, and Europa, which orbits Jupiter, it is an ocean world, possessing flowing water and other liquids, organic materials, and an energy source that could provide just the right conditions for microbes to arise. Mars might be synonymous with pop-culture conceptions of aliens, but the Red Planet likely lacks those features and has been bone-dry and mostly atmosphere-less for some three billion years. These ocean worlds could be inhabited right now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The discovery of any kind of alien microbes on any of these worlds would be transformative, changing our prevailing views of life, its origins, and ultimately, ourselves. But if searches for life continue to turn up nothing, it may turn out that Earthlings have to explore much, much further to find fellow organisms in our galaxy.</p>
<p>â€œThese three moons in particular can help us test the hypothesis of whether life can naturally evolve in a place if you have all the ingredients it needs to survive,â€� says Morgan Cable, an astrochemist at Jet Propulsion Laboratory and part of a cadre of astronomers who want to send robotic explorers to these moons. â€œOr is life super unique and weâ€™re horribly alone?â€�</p>
<p>Along with Dragonfly, NASA is also building the Europa Clipper, a lander slated to sail toward Jupiter's moon in the near future. And though a return to Enceladus is not high on the agencyâ€™s priorities, a collaboration with the Breakthrough Starshot Foundation could eventually get a mission off the ground. Titan will come first, though, making it the first ocean world—other than Earth, of course—to be explored.</p>
<blockquote>Titan will be the first ocean world<strong>—</strong>other than Earth<strong>—</strong>to be explored.</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes visible to the naked eye with its faint yellowish hue, Saturn has fascinated Persian, Hindu, Chinese, Greek and other stargazers for millennia. But it was Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens who discovered Titan orbiting the sixth planet in 1655 using a telescope he built himself. Soon afterward, he discerned Saturnâ€™s rings and also spotted a clutch of its smaller moons, of which there are now known to be more than fifty. Huygens referred to the largest moon as Luna Saturni, and English astronomer John Herschel later gave it and other known moons names from Greek mythology. Those monikers stuck.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, data collected by the first Voyager probe during its brief, 37,000 mile-per-hour flyby revealed how surprisingly thick and opaque Titanâ€™s atmosphere is. Later came NASAâ€™s Cassini spacecraft, laden with sensitive instrumentation, which surveyed the ocean worlds and other moons until spectacularly ending its mission in 2017 by diving into Saturnâ€™s gaseous body. Before Cassini burned up, the data it sent back to Earth finally penetrated Titanâ€™s haze to map out its undulating plains, dunes, lakes, and craters.</p>
<p>Larger than our moon and even Mercury, which is roughly two-fifths the size of Earth, Titan hosts plenty of intriguingly unique environments. Nascent lifeforms might benefit from its bubbling ice volcanoes, with the heat and pressure from below thrusting up liquified, briny ice like flowing, molten rock on Earth. And Titan is occasionally bombarded by asteroids whose impacts could melt the ice frozen on its surface. But after a time the water they produce—and anything possibly living there—would inevitably freeze again.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nautilus-vertical/oceans_32ad92099390210393fe7b2b51e82e8a.jpg" alt="Titan surface - artist rendering"><figcaption><span>Artistâ€™s visualization of hydrocarbon pools on Titan's rocky surface. </span><br><span>Steven Hobbs</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Titanâ€™s dense, calm, orange-tinted atmosphere stands out, too, as an uncommon feature of worlds in our solar system. â€œThe reason weâ€™re interested in life on Titan is because of its atmosphere,â€� says Catherine Neish, a planetary scientist at the University of Western Ontario. Nitrogen and other molecules undergo reactions with ultraviolet light from the sun and cosmic rays, which turns them into more complex molecules. â€œAt the end of the day,â€� says Neish, â€œyou have these hugely complicated organic molecules that slowly trickle down to the surface, meaning that the Titan surface is covered in them.â€�<br></p>
<p>The chemical conditions on the surface could pose an obstacle to possible fledgling microbes—provided theyâ€™re like anything scientists know on Earth. But scientists have also speculated about life as we <em>donâ€™t</em> know it. Clouds of methane and ethane drift over Titan; they rain onto its surface, forming rivers and streams that ooze into polar seas comparable in size to the Great Lakes on Earth. Itâ€™s the only world in the solar system other than Earth known to have vast quantities of liquid on its surface.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Liquids are a superb medium for bringing molecules together, forming new ones, and sweeping away waste. Eventually, somewhere, molecules can become more complex and make new copies of themselves, crossing the blurry boundary that some scientists and philosophers would call â€œlife.â€� The methane lakes of Titan would offer very different building blocks than do Earthâ€™s pools; microbes would have to eat acetylene and breathe hydrogen rather than oxygen, and exhale methane instead of carbon dioxide.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These alien life forms would also need to cope with temperatures down to âˆ’180 degrees Celsius—roughly twice as cold as the coldest temperature ever recorded on Earth—and with methane being a poor medium for carbon-based organic molecules to dissolve in. That would limit the chemical possibilities, making it harder to break most chemical bonds, and crucially, it would result in slower chemical reactions. If microbes defied the odds and arose on the surface, then, their life cycle and ecological interactions would move very slowly compared to the processes thought to be involved in the beginnings of life on Earth.</p>
<p>Scientists are keeping an open mind about lifeâ€™s myriad forms, including a chemistry alien to us, so they equip their probes with a variety of instruments and make their explorations as thorough as possible. But it's hard to look for something you've never seen before. â€œIt may be that life in a lake like that is very, very different and potentially unrecognizable compared to life as we know,â€� says Cable. â€œWe donâ€™t want to miss it by accident because weâ€™re biased by Earth life.â€�</p>
<figure><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nautilus-vertical/oceans_13df004fcabca482b041f97e46687a81.jpg" alt="High-Temperature-Beebe-Vents-Black-Smokers"><figcaption><span>A hydrothermal vent in the Cayman Trough, three miles below sea level, may be similar to vents on Enceladus. </span><br><span>Chris German/WHOI/NSF</span></figcaption></figure>

<p><span>M</span>ethane lakes are not the only potential cradle for Titanian life. Titan, as well as Europa and Enceladus, have relatively warm oceans underground. Titanâ€™s salty waters are hidden beneath an icy crust 100 kilometers thick, blocking already-feeble light from the distant sun, so photosynthesis would be impossible. But it is possible that on some of the ocean worlds, alien microbes could instead glean energy from hydrothermal—hot water—vents found near volcanoes rising from the bottom of these vast oceans.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Earth, the movement of tectonic plates cracks the planetâ€™s rocky crust and creates such fissures. On the ocean worlds, the necessary force is provided by the constant gravitational pull of close orbits around the colossi of Saturn and Jupiter. Water percolating into cracking rock can then release energy.</p>
<p>â€œThe great thing about hydrothermal vents is that they provide a lot of energy sources for microbial life that doesnâ€™t include sunlight,â€� says Julie Huber, a marine chemist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. Organisms living at hydrothermal vents on Earthâ€™s seafloors, she explains, â€œcan use chemical energy, so that means things like sulphur, iron, hydrogen and methane and they create a base of the food chain.â€�</p>
<p>In the mid-1970s, oceanographers towing cameras on miles-long cables through the GalÃ¡pagos Rift in the Eastern Pacific Ocean, near the islands of the same name, collected the first clear evidence of hydrothermal vents. Theyâ€™ve subsequently been found scattered in seafloor volcanic areas near the edges of tectonic plates throughout the worldâ€™s ocean, spewing superheated, mineral-rich fluids that generate chemical reactions as they burble into the cold seawater.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It might seem challenging for anything to subsist in these harsh, bleak places. In fact, such environments typically offer wide ranges of temperature, pressure, acidity and energy, meaning that a diversity of microbial life is actually possible. Itâ€™s been theorized that life on Earth actually originated around hydrothermal vents rather than in primordial soup at the planet's surface, and some hardy organisms thrive there: mainly specially adapted bacteria and single-celled creatures known as archaea. Even in the ostensibly deadest spot on Earth, the nutrient-starved South Pacific Gyre east of Australia, scientists recently found microbes that apparently survived for millions of years in a form of stasis while embedded in the seafloor.</p>
<p>Vent fields off Costa Rica and in the Caribbeanâ€™s deep Cayman Trough are thought to be similar an undersea spot on Enceladus, and the connection between hydrothermal vents on Earth and potentially similar spots on ocean worlds has spurred collaborations between astrobiologists and oceanographers like Huber. The nascent deep-sea mining industry is interested, too, though for different reasons: the mineral-rich sulfide deposits include some valuable metals in dwindling supply on land, like manganese, copper, nickel and …</p></article></div>

<p>As part of Cybersecurity Awareness Month every Saturday I’ll be sharing links to videos, presentations, etc. that show interesting, surprising and entertaining content. </p>
<p>Today’s theme is aviation security. At the recent DEF CON Safe Mode conference there was an ‘<a href="https://aerospacevillage.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aerospace Village</a>‘ where hackers explored and exploited a range of aviation technology. Unless you’re in the business it’s not likely any of us would get to poke around in the avionics bay of a 747. Well, the folks from Pentest Partners did exactly that, and they presented the results at DEF CON 28…</p>

Our company was in free fall, and I had to do something about it.</p><p>But I couldn’t.</p><p>I spent weeks trying to figure it all out in my head. Every day, we would sit for hours in the office. Trying to understand what we really want to work on. Brainstorming ideas. Nothing worked.</p><p>I had the idea to take some time off for a while. But I never really explored it. I’ve always believed the only way to solve a problem is to start working on it. A mere thought of lying on a beach all day long and doing nothing caused physical pain in my head.</p><p>After a few weeks of struggle, I accepted that we’re not moving anywhere.</p><p><strong><strong>I needed a change.</strong></strong></p><p>I used to do martial arts as a kid. I remember when I first read about Shaolin. I was amazed. It seemed like something sacred, unreal to me. Very distant, but also very close in some way.</p><p>I remember begging parents to allow me to go there and train with monks.</p><p><em>“You’re out of your damn mind!”</em></p><p>I’m not blaming them; I’d probably tell my kids the same.</p><p>But now I had no excuse.</p><p>I decided to fly to China and study Kung Fu at The Shaolin Temple.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Q3pS6-bIyhrxVRndWfaux_yN_-PJBPebn2jwQJHImjIMygREWwyR3Wc8w0kILJgijhjt0r-d4BIdoeT3qsZO7VEfvQpbh5pVHakdASf1Q03R6s4clJWAUA0EjgxqNDkCdRKFH1ek" alt=""></figure><p>The Shaolin Monastery is like Mecca for Buddhists.</p><p>It’s a mysterious place where monks live, train, and meditate.</p><p><em>Some of them never leave the temple.</em></p><p>And while you can visit the temple as a tourist, there’s no way for a stranger to get into the private part of the monastery, where real monks train. There’s no website where you can apply. No email address.</p><p>But I had a plan.</p><p>I decided to find a martial arts school in Dengfeng, which is a small town 12 km from the temple. My idea was to get to Dengfeng, and then try to meet some younger monks from the temple and beg them to death to let me in.</p><p>After a few days of research, I found a school that seemed reasonable and applied.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/YDuca6U-Xj9WUbeyshjgYpN2oWYZXvEXofbvILQW7t-j-FljoSA9TjA_S3LTvOHsMWiiltMTuraj13qtDORfzWvbY_nxeqM6fI6xt_5bRC4wVUUuIYjFu-gBo6lLeZZFXbXzfbRz" alt=""><figcaption>Shifu and students.

There are hundreds of fake “Shaolin Kung Fu” schools in Dengfeng. They’re making money off the Shaolin brand, but there’s no real, authentic, hard training involved.</p><p>Getting another good one to accept me over night seemed impossible. But I kept looking.</p><p>I was looking for something original and challenging. And all Kung Fu schools I’d seen before were like holiday camps.</p><p>A few hours later, serendipity kicked into play.</p><p>I found a YouTube video from a former Xing Long student. I loved it. I went on their website and smiled.</p><p>The website said:</p><p><strong><strong>“Our school is not a holiday retreat.”</strong></strong></p><p>On a warm night of June 14th, I landed in Beijing.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Ku0IQGnR2GgIWEcrPMlgo-wFYzrsanZT3agAhjOq95QJNZmS9Axi2I1MxXmN6KBHi_bmHD50q7RsO96dWnjovN83jDGHhEIxKdsCf1X3sgntgTe16-EmsHXw3DmGMWNzPWdNWwrn" alt=""><figcaption>4:30 a.m. Meeting the dawn at a Beijing Railway Station.</figcaption></figure><p>When I arrived in Beijing, I still hadn’t heard from Xing Long.</p><p>But I had no choice.

So I bought a train ticket and embarked on 600 km journey to northern China.</p><p>After six hours of slumber in the high-speed train, I was in Siping.</p><p>At the exit of the train station, three students of Xing Long waited for me with a welcoming sign, “Vasili Shynkarenka.” They drove me to school.</p><p>That’s when I met the Master for the first time.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/TDkN2V3FfpErJtZ5GeLWTX__0T2KMX_dKy1xq40UENQN6OiQUEgQ3JW4jE-mfU5ECQwI4TDTflt5wuf2lz6IlbswXzhZ2bdmKpH09BsWQYqPA8nGsR9vPe6v70TcWczFbhI4DO-M" alt=""></figure><p>Shifu is 5”2, fast as a jaguar, has a bone-crushing handshake and dark brown eyes that look right into your soul.</p><p>He once tore off someone’s shoulder with bare hands.</p><p>At 12, he already trained in Shaolin.</p><p>Shifu turned pro after seven years.

<div>
<p>Much has been said about the importance of applying ferrite clamps, rings and beads to radios and other domestic products to fight QRM.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Articles on the correct placement of ferrite noise suppressors are common, but little has been written about the different options and where to buy them. &nbsp;In Australia, there are only a limited number of suppliers that carry stock.&nbsp; Ferrite size, shape and cost varies significantly.&nbsp; The information provided can be minimal or non-existent.&nbsp; Part numbers for ferrites listed in international catalogues are not generally available in Australia and buying these can entail long lead times and high freight costs.</p>
<p>Often we don’t really know what we’re getting and how effective they will work for us when they finally arrive.&nbsp; From this perspective, buying and using ferrite filters seems to have more in common with black magic than the application of radio science.</p>
<ul>
<li>How do I know if the ferrites I purchased are good, bad or totally ineffective?</li>
<li>Do I get what I pay for? &nbsp;Are expensive ferrites much better than cheap ones?</li>
<li>How can I tell if one ferrite is enough?&nbsp; Are 2 or 3 together really worthwhile?</li>
<li>What are the advantages of clamps over beads and rings?</li>
<li>Are big and heavy ferrites better than lightweight and small ones?</li>
<li>How far up the radio spectrum are these things going to work for me?</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-3.jpg" alt="" width="243" height="218" srcset="https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-3.jpg 832w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-3-300x270.jpg 300w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-3-768x690.jpg 768w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-3-60x54.jpg 60w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-3-150x135.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 243px) 100vw, 243px">Ferrites are a type of ceramic made from iron and other oxides and come moulded into different shapes.&nbsp; The material combination &nbsp;is called a ‘mix’.</p>
<p>The characteristics of these mixes determine where and how they should be used.&nbsp;&nbsp; When a wire passes through or near ferrite materials, it effectively adds resistance to that wire at radio frequencies, but this resistance effect varies with the frequency applied to the wire.</p>
<p>Every ferrite has its own characteristic impedance curve allowing it to absorb unwanted RF currents before reaching your receiver or appliance.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you can’t tell what that working curve is going to be just by looking at it.</p>
<p>For this experiment, we purchased sample ferrites from the Australian retailers Jaycar and Altronics.&nbsp; We compared these with samples of similar size from the QRM Guru ferrite kits, then further compared all of these with some cheap ‘no-name’ ferrites purchased from eBay.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-4.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="460" srcset="https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-4.jpg 800w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-4-300x173.jpg 300w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-4-768x442.jpg 768w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-4-60x35.jpg 60w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-4-150x86.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></p>
<p>Testing methodology is important.&nbsp; We used a spectrum analyser with a tracking generator.&nbsp; The spectrum analyser shows gain or loss of radio frequencies between any two points on the radio spectrum.&nbsp; Our unit has capability to scan the radio spectrum from 10KHz to 1.5 GHz, but in this trial, we profiled these ferrite devices between 100KHz and 450MHz.</p>
<p>The tracking generator creates a small signal that regularly sweeps between two frequencies we are monitoring at a very controlled level.&nbsp; We are then able to couple from the tracking generator to the spectrum analyser via a small brass rod, which will become our test wire.&nbsp; First we&nbsp; ‘<strong>normalise’</strong> to compensate for any stray capacitance and inductance around our test area.&nbsp; A flat yellow line represents zero dB.&nbsp; This line becomes our reference point before filtering is added.&nbsp; When any unknown ferrite is added to the test conductor, we measure a clear plot showing the unique characteristics of that item.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-5.jpg" alt="" width="985" height="509" srcset="https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-5.jpg 985w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-5-300x155.jpg 300w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-5-768x397.jpg 768w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-5-60x31.jpg 60w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-5-150x78.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 985px) 100vw, 985px"></p>
<p>With this arrangement we examined a graphic plot of each sample, then recorded five unique values which identify its effectiveness.&nbsp; We looked at :</p>
<ul>
<li>(<strong>A</strong>) The <strong>lowest</strong> frequency where the item drops below the -3dB (half-signal) point.</li>
<li>(<strong>B</strong>) The <strong>highest</strong> frequency where the curve crosses the -3dB point</li>
<li>(<strong>C</strong>) The frequency (<strong>MHz</strong>) where the greatest attenuation takes place</li>
<li>(<strong>D</strong>) The maximum degree of <strong>attenuation</strong> (peak –dB) that takes place.</li>
<li>(<strong>E</strong>)&nbsp; The <strong>weight</strong> of each ferrite item.&nbsp; (in grams)</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-7.jpg" alt="" width="932" height="360" srcset="https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-7.jpg 932w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-7-300x116.jpg 300w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-7-768x297.jpg 768w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-7-60x23.jpg 60w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-7-150x58.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 932px) 100vw, 932px"></p>
<p><strong>Not all characteristics are being tested here</strong></p>
<p>It should be noted that this article is focused on using ferrites for noise reduction only.&nbsp; In this role the energy being absorbed is not great.&nbsp; Where ferrites are used in high-current environments, such as in a transmitter balun, there will be an RF power threshold where they can no longer effectively absorb energy and their characteristics will begin to distort.</p>
<p>The overheating and saturation effects of high current applications are not a part of this study.</p>
<h2><strong>Study Results</strong></h2>
<p>The table below contains the raw results of our assessment, grouped in order of supplier, then size. &nbsp;The figures can be difficult to digest in this form, but we can take away some very important findings from this test data.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-8.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="459" srcset="https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-8.jpg 900w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-8-300x153.jpg 300w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-8-768x392.jpg 768w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-8-60x31.jpg 60w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-8-150x77.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"></p>
<h2><strong>Branding vs Price</strong></h2>
<p>The first significant observation is that they all worked.&nbsp; Regardless of the source, none of the samples tested were fake or defective.&nbsp; They were all capable of suppressing radio frequencies to a greater or lesser degree. &nbsp;This is reassuring, as you can never prove authenticity just by looking at a ferrite.</p>
<p>From these samples, we can surmise that regardless of their source, all of these clamp-on ferrites will provide at least some degree of effectiveness in the shack.</p>
<h2><strong>Ferrite Mixture Type</strong></h2>
<p>The next observation (with the exception of the Altronics Iron Core ring) is that all of these materials are composed from a similar mix of ferrite material.&nbsp; The absorption curves were all a reasonable match to <strong>Mix 43</strong>.&nbsp; This indicates that their application is appropriate for HF and low VHF frequencies.&nbsp;&nbsp; (The Altronics ring L4534A was purchased with the rest of the ferrites, but it does not qualify as a ferrite device.&nbsp; It is a powdered iron object with different characteristics.&nbsp; We left it in the test for contrast and will provide separate comment on these devices.)</p>
<h2><strong>Size vs weight correlation of ferrite clamps</strong></h2>
<p>Clamp-on ferrite devices come in a variety of different physical sizes and shapes.&nbsp; It is reasonable to think that bigger ferrites work better than smaller ones, but is this actually the case?&nbsp; We sorted our samples by weight and plotted this chart to see how closely the degree of absorption of RF energy followed the physical weight of each sample.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-9.jpg" alt="" width="874" height="242" srcset="https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-9.jpg 874w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-9-300x83.jpg 300w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-9-768x213.jpg 768w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-9-60x17.jpg 60w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-9-150x42.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 874px) 100vw, 874px"></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-10.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="267" srcset="https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-10.jpg 481w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-10-300x246.jpg 300w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-10-60x49.jpg 60w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-10-150x123.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 326px) 100vw, 326px">The answer appears to be”partially yes”.&nbsp; Generally, heavier ferrites will out-perform lighter versions, but there were a couple of exceptions that did very well.</p>
<p>The <strong>Altronics</strong> solid ring <strong>L4534A (A3) </strong>outperformed clamps of similar weight, as did the <strong>Jaycar</strong> <strong>LF1294 (J2)</strong>.&nbsp; Both are circled in red in the chart above.</p>
<p>There is a correlation between ferrite effectiveness and wall thickness.&nbsp; Both circled examples had a relatively small internal wire opening, which made for a thicker clamp wall.&nbsp; This equates to a higher density of ferrite material around the single conductor, giving superior performance.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-11.jpg" alt="" width="321" height="203" srcset="https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-11.jpg 425w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-11-300x190.jpg 300w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-11-60x38.jpg 60w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-11-150x95.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 321px) 100vw, 321px">Conversely, sample <strong>E1</strong> from eBay was a physically large clamp, but it catered for a thick 12mm cable.&nbsp; This thinner wall thickness reduced effectiveness, as seen by the data point circled in yellow on the chart above.</p>
<p>This effect is not as bad as it first seems, so don’t necessarily shop only for thick-walled clamps.&nbsp; Examine some of the following sections in this article which explore the most effective ways to use ferrite clamps.</p>
<p>The final comment on the size of clamps was the observation that the very small clamp-on ferrites don’t have sufficient mass for good performance.&nbsp; The smallest of the eBay clamps (<strong>E5</strong>) didn’t even reach -3dB.&nbsp; Unless a friend gives you a lot of them for nothing, there is a lot to be said for aiming straight for medium and large clamps, or the results could be disappointing.</p>
<h2><strong>Are solid ferrite rings better than split rings?</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-12.jpg" alt="" width="335" height="209" srcset="https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-12.jpg 552w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-12-300x188.jpg 300w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-12-60x38.jpg 60w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-12-150x94.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 335px) 100vw, 335px">This turned out to be an easy question to answer.&nbsp; Two rings of similar weight, hole-size and ferrite mix were compared.&nbsp; One was solid and the other was split.</p>
<p>The results were almost identical when tested.&nbsp; This tells us that shopping for solid cores have no real advantage over split cores.&nbsp; However, the split ferrites can be applied to cables without having to remove connector plugs and this makes them a more practical purchase.</p>
<h2><strong>What’s the best way to use ferrites?</strong></h2>
<p>An important question to answer is “<em>what is the optimum configuration for the application of ferrite clamps</em>“.&nbsp; It’s easy to imagine that two clamps are better than one, but how much better?</p>
<p>For this exercise we focused our attention on the QRM Guru clamps (<strong>Q2</strong>) designed for 8mm wire.</p>
<p>Compare the following screen captures and images of one and two clamps:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-13.jpg" alt="" width="1173" height="435" srcset="https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-13.jpg 1173w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-13-300x111.jpg 300w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-13-1024x380.jpg 1024w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-13-768x285.jpg 768w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-13-60x22.jpg 60w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-13-150x56.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1173px) 100vw, 1173px"></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-14.jpg" alt="" width="1164" height="429" srcset="https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-14.jpg 1164w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-14-300x111.jpg 300w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-14-1024x377.jpg 1024w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-14-768x283.jpg 768w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-14-60x22.jpg 60w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-14-150x55.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1164px) 100vw, 1164px"></p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, doubling up on the clamps gives an additional 3dB of RF absorption.&nbsp; At <strong>55 MHz</strong> the peak absorption jumped from <strong>-4.40 dB</strong> to <strong>-7.54 dB</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp; This tells us that if one clamp on its own does not quite do the job, then add another for improved performance.&nbsp; Be aware that to achieve a further 3dB, you must double again from two to four units.</p>
<p>Next, we explore the effectiveness of looping a wire through a clamp more than once.&nbsp; This can only work where there is sufficient slack in the cable, and where the hole in the core is large enough to accept additional turns.</p>
<p>Here is what happens:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-15.jpg" alt="" width="1151" height="458" srcset="https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-15.jpg 1151w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-15-300x119.jpg 300w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-15-1024x407.jpg 1024w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-15-768x306.jpg 768w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-15-60x24.jpg 60w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-15-150x60.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1151px) 100vw, 1151px"></p>
<p>This is a very interesting result showing that the single extra turn through the core increases absorption from -4.4dB to a huge -12.41 dB.&nbsp;&nbsp; This 8 dB increase makes a single clamp provide the same effectiveness of around six such clamps on the same wire.</p>
<p>Want to see some case studies covering off the use of ferrites?&nbsp; Click on the links below</p>
<h2><strong>Why adding turns makes ferrites much more effective</strong></h2>
<p>This effect is not really a mystery when we break down what’s happening.&nbsp; When we add ferrite to a wire, we are effectively adding series resistance to that wire, but this resistance effect varies with frequency.&nbsp; At steady DC, the ferrites have no effect, but as an AC signal is applied a resistance is developed within the wire surrounded by the ferrite material.&nbsp; The higher the frequency, the greater the increased resistance.&nbsp; This resistance is also affected by the type of ferrite material, its volume, and its distance from the wire concerned.</p>

<p><em>Guest blog post by <a href="https://lanebc.com/about/">Jay Michlin</a>, circa 1987 (used with permission). A recounting of a presentation by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Atkinson">Bill Atkinson</a> at the <a href="https://www.pa-smug.org/">Stanford Macintosh User Group (SMUG)</a> </em></p>



<p>HyperCard. Bill Atkinson. The auditorium was packed and everyone stayed until the end.<br>What more need be said?</p>



<p>I considered stopping this month’s report right here, because the first paragraph already<br>tells volumes. But I never learned to quit while ahead, so here’s more. Specifically, I’m going to try to explain what HyperCard is, both as Bill described it and as I see it. As you’ll see, my perspective is somewhat different.</p>



<p>Bill said that HyperCard tries to make more of the power of a personal computer available to nonprogrammers. There’s plenty of goodness in using a computer for word processing, spreadsheets and other applications. But to unlock the real power, you have to program, and that’s very hard. HyperCard delivers a lot of the power of programming, but with minimal burden.</p>



<p>Or, you can look at the matter another way. Before HyperCard, the Mac had documents and applications. Documents contain information, but by themselves offer no opportunity for interaction with you. Applications offer interaction, but do not contain information. HyperCard stacks are in between, with a combination of both information and interaction inherent in them.</p>



<p>Or, you can think of HyperCard as a software erector set. It comes with a kit of tools, a set of instructions and lots of parts. Like an erector set, it has one more thing — examples. When you first get the set, you build copies of the ex amples. Then you change a few small details. Eventually you become comfortable with the tools and the parts and start using it fluidly to express your own, original ideas. In the same way, HyperCard comes with dozens of sample stacks. They’re not an afterthought. They’re an integral part of the product, intended to help you use it immediately and learn it quickly.</p>



<p>Here’s what I think. HyperCard is the latest in a long list of “languages” that seek to make<br>computers easy to program. The need is not new, the idea is not new and the solution is not new. What’s special about HyperCard is that it’s brilliantly executed. Biil obviously spent a lot of time thinking and learning about his task before, during and after sitting down to code.</p>



<p>Let me explain. For the early computers there were no such things as “canned” applications like word processors and spreadsheets. Everyone was a programmer. There was no choice. Then, in the 1960’s, timesharing was invented. The primary external feature that made timesharing different was that it supported users interacting with the computer at terminals.</p>



<p>But the users still had to program if they were to get the machine to do anything, As terminal access to timesharing became more widespread, especially on college campuses, everyone understood that programming was a barrier. So they invented BASIC.</p>



<p>Perhaps you thought that BASIC always was as it is today on personal computers. It wasn’t. It was expressly designed to help college students get over the programming barrier on early timesharing systems. It did that in a number of ways:</p>



<ul><li>It was interpretive. Users could type a command and get instant results printed on the terminal. It’s an elementary fact of life that we learn better if we have quick, useful feedback. </li><li>It made simple things simple. To print something on the terminal, you said, “PRINT.” There was no need to tell the computer how to find the terminal or what the printing format was to be. </li><li>It was small in that it had very few statements and options defined. Of course, that was partly because the computers and translators of the time would have struggled to give quick response on a complicated language. But even when more features were added, they remained in the background, invisible to novice users who don’t need them. </li><li>It came with clear, obvious examples, either as part of a college course or in a manual. You learned to write BASIC by trying the examples. BASIC worked. It helped a generation of college students learn to use computers. Later, it was the primary offering on commercial timesharing systems from Tymshare and General Electric. And most recently, it helped launch the personal computer revolution. It wasn’t so long ago that to use a personal computer at all, you had to program.</li></ul>



<p>Personal computers and their application software have grown sophisticated so fast that we easily forget that computers and programming go together. It’s tempting to say that to- day, in the modern era, programming is no longer needed. We all just go to Computer Ware and buy whatever package we need to make our machines do anything.</p>



<p>For many, perhaps that is true. But Bill Atkinson, and Apple are saying that you still need the opportunity to program to tap the underlying power of your computer. HyperCard will be the BASIC of the modern era, with possibly as profound an effect on the future as BASIC has had up to now.</p>



<p>Those are my words, not Bill’s. But I wouldn’t be surprised if he agreed.</p>



<p> * * * *</p>



<p>In case you missed the meeting, here are some details. Bill wasn’t there alone. Dan Winkler, who created HyperTalk, HyperCard’s internal scripting language, was also present. So was Danny Goodman, who wrote the book. Also Kristee Kreitman, who did the artwork (of which there is lots), Robin Shank, who helped do the testing, and Mike Holm, the Product Manager.</p>



<p>As an aside, this is an interesting illustration of the difference between a modern business enterprise and one from the last generation. A modern corporation values the natural benefits to all concerned when employees from all parts of the organization go out and meet customers. A more traditional corporation sends out only carefully prepared marketing teams.</p>



<p>Anyway, Bill demonstrated HyperCard and talked about the philosophy behind it. Then Dan told us about HyperTalk. He showed it to be a powerful, yet well-behaved language. Despite the fact that it underlies much of what goes on in HyperCerd, HyperTalk remains invisible be- hind the scenes if you don’t need or want to know about it.</p>



<p>Then Danny told us about two stacks he designed and is now selling commercially. The first, Business Class, presents a map of the world. Click anywhere and you can learn about language, currency, time zones, air travel and other important conditions. The second, Focal Point, is a very generalized and very interactive desk calendar and diary. Both are implemented as HyperCard stacks.</p>



<p>Incidentally, when you buy a HyperCard stack, you can copy and modify it the same way you can manipulate the example stacks that come with HyperCard itself. Apple’s whole approach is to make HyperCard a common tool, and stacks a common medium that people exchange and build on.</p>



<p>Finally, here are a few miscellancous points our guests made in response to questions.</p>



<p>HyperCard is roughly 360K of code, nearly ten times the sum of Bill’s original MacPaint and QuickDraw combined. HyperCard requires at least 1 MB or memory and the 128K ROMs. The team tried for 512K, but couldn’t make it.</p>



<p>The program contains some pioneering work Bill has done to compress bit maps. The com- pression feature brings two advantages. First, it minimizes disk space to store stacks. And second, it speeds response because the program has fewer bytes to move to and from disk. The feature typically achieves 10-to-1 compressions, with up to 30-to-1 not unusual.</p>



<p>Bill claims to be about two-thirds done with HyperCard. The product is now at a point “where you can build stacks and count on them still working five years from now…” The next features to be added are international features beginning in a month or two (Kanji will take longer) and CD-ROM support a bit later. Color is on the to-do list, but not at high priority.</p>



<p>The product’s current limits are 16 million cards and 500 MB total storage for a stack. And according to Bill, “If you run into those limits, we can change them together.”</p>



<p>Exit, to thunderous applause.</p>

        <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>Design is easily one of the most misunderstood lines of work there is. If you’ve ever heard people comment on a piece of art saying <em>“I could do that”</em>, or bicker about a designer’s work being “overpriced”, you probably know what I mean.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Just a few months ago, The Sunday Times even published a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/manpower/8-in-10-singaporeans-willing-to-pay-more-for-essential-services">poll</a>&nbsp;stating that 71% of Singaporean locals think Artist is the most 'non-essential' job during a pandemic. This sprouted heated responses all over the world about the importance of the arts, which includes design work.</p>
<p>To those who have never set foot in the field, design looks like it’s easy and requires no smarts. It is in everything we see — our digital devices, our homes, the chair that you’re sitting on, and even the webpage you’re reading from right now — yet, it is so taken for granted. Why?</p>
<p>We gave our designers a penny for their thoughts, and learned a few things.</p>
<h3><strong>“I could do that.”</strong></h3>
<p>People often assume…</p>
<p>“It's easy.” — <strong>Leni</strong></p>
<p>“That design is easy and fast, and that everyone is capable of designing since there are many free softwares out there on the internet. The reason why everyone wants quick work from us is because they tend to underestimate the time and effort we invest in each design.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Creating a design is rarely the problem. Creating a great design that is set apart from others is challenging and takes time.” — <strong>Kelsey</strong></p>
<p>“That designing is easy, and that what we do can't bring value.” — <strong>Jye Miin</strong></p>
<h3><strong>“So, you like drawing?”</strong></h3>
<p>People think…</p>
<p>“That design is solely ‘art’. Though there is art in design, design is often also about problem solving. It’s often rooted in basic principles of decision making.” — <strong>Mei Kwan</strong></p>
<p><span>"That designers just do arts or&nbsp;create beautiful things. We actually often use design concepts to solve problems. That includes little things like the style and position of a button, colors, margins, etc. </span></p>
<p><span>These all serve to solve problems that users face, or rather help users achieve their goals when they interact with the apps/systems that we build. Design makes everyone's lives easier." — <strong>Adri</strong></span></p>
<h3><span>"You must be talented!"</span></h3>
<p><span>And people misunderstand that...</span></p>
<p><span>"Design is all about the talent. It’s a common misconception that design comes naturally to us.</span></p>
<p><span>Design requires more than an eye for aesthetics — it's often about user experience, purpose, creating solutions, and empathy. While we constantly learn, practice, and adapt in developing an eye for good design, we should also build on these fundamental principles. Talent, skill, and experience all play a part in making a great designer."&nbsp;— <strong>Han</strong></span></p>
<p>In what other ways do people misunderstand design work?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span>On Monday, a group of researchers sponsored by Breakthrough Listen, the world’s largest SETI program, </span><a href="http://seti.berkeley.edu/lunarseti/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">submitted a paper</a><span> to National Academy of Sciences’ Planetary Science and Astrobiology Decadal Survey that makes the case for establishing a SETI radio observatory on the farside of the moon. The decadal survey establishes scientific priorities for the next ten years and the new paper addresses one of the biggest problems facing the search for extraterrestrial intelligence today: The overwhelming amount of radio interference.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><p><span>Our planet has become so “loud” in the part of the radio spectrum observed by SETI that it threatens to drown out any signal sent from an intelligent civilization. Not only would a lunar radio telescope not have to deal with terrestrial radio interference, it could also significantly increase our chances of hearing from ET by opening up parts of the radio spectrum that are blocked by Earth's atmosphere. While the idea of using the moon for radio astronomy is decades old, the researchers make the case that technological advancements have finally made a lunar SETI observatory truly feasible.</span></p></div><div><div><p><span>
says Eric Michaud, an intern at the SETI Berkeley Research Center and the first author of the paper. “Maybe not today, but I think it’s going to get more and more feasible as time goes on.”&nbsp;</span></p></div></div><div><p><span>Radio interference has been a problem for SETI from the very beginning. In the spring of 1960, the planetary scientist Frank Drake trained the massive radio telescope at Green Bank Observatory in West Virginia on Tau Ceti and Epsilon Eridani, two stars a mere 12 light years from Earth. That summer, Drake spent his days studying the signals picked up by Green Bank’s giant mechanical ear in the hopes of receiving a message broadcast by an alien civilization orbiting those stars. Known as Project Ozma, Drake’s experiment marked the beginning of SETI, the scientific search for extraterrestrial intelligence.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><p><span>Shortly after Drake started his observations, he was surprised to find what appeared to be a signal of intelligent origin. After days of watching a needle drift lazily over a spool of paper recording the random undulations of cosmic static, Drake and his colleagues were jolted awake when the machine started recording the frantic pulses of a strong radio signal picked up by the telescope. The timing and magnitude of the pulses clearly marked them as artificial; there was nothing in the natural world that could produce such a frenetic radio profile. It would have been an astounding stroke of luck to pick up an alien message after only a few hours of observation, but it was hard to argue with the data.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><p><span>“None of us had ever seen anything like it,” Drake recalled in </span><em>Is Anyone Out There?</em><span>, his autobiographical book about the early days of SETI. “We looked at each other wide-eyed. Could discovery be this easy?”</span></p></div><div><div><p><span>

It was a letdown, but the false detection turned out to be a portent for the future of SETI. In the 60 years since Drake’s pioneering experiment, researchers have conducted dozens of SETI searches across thousands of stars and turned up empty-handed. At the same time, the sources of radio interference on Earth—military radars, TV towers, cell phones, and satellites—have exponentially increased, which greatly increases the chances that an extraterrestrial signal will be lost among the noise.&nbsp;</span></p></div></div><div><p><span>Earth was never a particularly great place to do any kind of radio astronomy due to our thick atmosphere blocking a large portion of the radio spectrum. The proliferation of radio communication technologies has only made things harder. The moon, by comparison, has no atmosphere and its nights last for weeks on end, which limits radio noise from the sun. And as&nbsp;NASA discovered through a spate of lunar orbiter missions in the late 1960s, the moon also acts as a natural shield that blocks radio signals emanating from Earth. As the planetary astronomer Phillipe Zarka has put it, “the farside of the moon during the lunar night is the most radio-quiet place in our local universe.” It’s exactly the sort of peace and quiet you want if you’re searching for faint radio signals from solar systems that might be hundreds of light years away.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><p><span>The new Breakthrough Listen paper proposed two main approaches to a lunar SETI observatory: an orbiter and a telescope on the surface. The basic idea behind a SETI lunar orbiter would be to scan for signals as it passed over the lunar farside and relay data back to Earth as it passed over the near side. One of the main advantages of an orbiter is cost. The proliferation of small satellites that are capable of accurate tracking combined with low-cost small launch providers like Rocket Lab means that a SETI orbiter could conceivably be sent to the moon </span><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-awards-contract-to-launch-cubesat-to-moon-from-virginia/#:~:text=The%20firm%2Dfixed%2Dprice%20launch,Tyvak%20Nano%2DSatellite%20Systems%20Inc." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">for less than $20 million</a><span>. This would be a valuable pathfinder mission that could pave the way for a more ambitious observatory on the surface, but without the risk and cost.&nbsp; As the </span><a href="https://www.supercluster.com/editorial/the-supercluster-podcast-water-bears-might-now-occupy-the-moon" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ill-fated Israeli Beresheet lander mission</a><span> reminded us, landing on the moon is extremely challenging even when the mission is backed by $100 million.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><p><span>But a SETI lunar orbiter would also come with a lot of compromises. It would only be able to conduct observations during the brief stretches when it was on the lunar farside, which would make a sustained observation campaign more challenging. The upshot is that an orbiter would have access to the full sky, whereas a telescope on the surface would be constrained by the moon’s rotation. The biggest downside of an orbiter is that it might lose a lot of the shielding benefits of the moon and be more vulnerable to radio interference from Earth since it would be orbiting high above the lunar surface.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><p><span>“The first SETI observations that are done from the lunar farside will be done from orbit, there’s no question about that,” says Andrew Siemion, the director of the Berkeley SETI Research Center and the second author on the paper. “I think eventually we absolutely want to do something on the surface because we want to build a very large aperture telescope, but even when we’re at that point I don’t think that would negate the utility of doing things from orbit as well.”&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><p><span>So what would a SETI observatory on the moon look like? One idea is to use the naturally parabolic lunar crater as a radio dish, much like the Arecibo telescope in Puerto Rico and </span><a href="https://www.supercluster.com/editorial/chinas-massive-telescope-is-the-next-great-seti-hope" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the FAST telescope in China</a><span>, which are built into natural depressions in the land. This idea was </span><a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/RS012i005p00845" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">first considered</a><span> back in the late 1970s by a group of scientists at the radio physics lab at the Stanford Research Institute. Their idea was to recreate Arecibo on the moon by suspending an antenna from the lip of a crater and using the basin as a reflector. The reduced gravity on the moon would allow for a radio telescope far larger than any on Earth, which could significantly enhance the sensitivity of SETI searches. Ultimately the researchers concluded that a lunar radio observatory was too expensive compared to SETI telescopes that could be built on Earth.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><p><span>But 40 years later, Michaud says that building a radio dish in a lunar crater may finally be cheap enough to pull off. One of the main drivers of this cost reduction is the advent of commercial launch providers like SpaceX and Rocket Lab, which have </span><a href="https://www.supercluster.com/editorial/cheaper-rockets-growing-the-human-family-in-space" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dramatically lowered the cost of space access</a><span>. Another driver is NASA’s push to establish a permanent human presence on the moon, which has subsidized the development of a fleet of commercial lunar exploration vehicles. “There’s so much interest in going back to the moon,” says Michaud, who cited Blue Origin’s lunar lander and Rocket Lab’s Photon Lunar satellite as examples of technologies enabled by </span><a href="https://www.supercluster.com/editorial/nasas-first-puerto-rican-born-director-aims-for-a-moonshot" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NASA’s Artemis program</a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><p><span>A crux of the original vision for lunar SETI observatories was that it would require a human settlement on the moon to build and operate the radio dish. But robotic systems have improved enough that it may be possible to take humans out of the equation. This was clearly demonstrated in 2019 when China’s Chang’e 4 rover landed autonomously on the farside of the moon. These advancements in autonomous navigation have laid the foundation for a lunar radio observatory that is built entirely by robots.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><p><span>It sounds like science fiction, but earlier this year NASA’s Advanced Innovative Concepts program </span><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/niac/2020_Phase_I_Phase_II/lunar_crater_radio_telescope/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">awarded one of it’s prestigious grants to Saptarshi Bandyopadhyay, a researcher at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, to figure out a way to make it happen</a><span>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>If you have been working as a network administrator for quite some time, you probably already know about <strong>switches</strong>.</p>



<p>Switches are essential blocks of any network environment. </p>



<p>When they associated with computers, they are responsible for <strong>receiving</strong> and <strong>transmitting</strong> traffic over a network.</p>



<p>However, do you really know <strong>how computers communicate?</strong></p>



<p>What tools do they use when you are dealing with a private local network?</p>



<p>Is it different when you are communicating over a larger network, or Internet?</p>



<p>In this tutorial, you are going to discover everything that there is to know about <strong>computer communication</strong>. </p>



<p>By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to clearly identify <strong>how computers are communicating</strong> and which tools they are using in order to achieve it.</p>



<h2>Switches and OSI Model</h2>



<p>Before jumping into the explanation, there is an important concept that you need to grasp : <strong>the OSI model</strong>.</p>



<p>The OSI model is made of seven layers :</p>



<ul><li><strong>Physical layer</strong> : essentially your cables and every physical part that links a computer to another</li><li><strong>Data-link layer</strong> : that defines the protocol used in order for devices to communicate over a local network (Ethernet most of the time)</li><li><strong>Network layer</strong> : defines the way computers are meant to communicate over a larger network or between a group of networks.</li><li><strong>Transport layer</strong> : that describes how data will be transmitted from one point to another (is it TCP or is it UDP?)</li><li><strong>Session layer</strong> : which states if we are talking about a full-duplex, half-duplex or simplex communications</li><li><strong>Presentation + application layer</strong> : your users are quite familiar with this layer because it represents the application they are using to communicate (Firefox or Chrome for example).</li></ul>



<p>In this list, we are going to focus on the second point because it is the one that relates to MAC addresses.</p>



<p>In most cases, communication is done via <strong>Ethernet.</strong></p>



<p>Ethernet, in simple words, is a protocol that defines a way for devices to communicate with each other.</p>



<p>It defines the way frames are formatted, how large they should be, where data should be stored and so on, the destination as well as the source of the message.</p>



<p>The destination and source are represented by the destination MAC address and the source MAC address of both devices.</p>



<p><em>But, what is a MAC address?</em></p>



<h3>MAC Address Definition</h3>



<p><strong>A MAC Address is an unique identifier given to your network adapter when it was built by a given NIC vendor.</strong></p>



<p>MAC addresses are represented by 12 hexadecimal characters, six groups of two, separated by colons or dashes (<a href="https://ouilookup.com/mac/98-E7-43">98-E7-43</a>-78-65-74 or <a href="https://ouilookup.com/mac/9C-7B-EF">9C-7B-EF</a>-45-F5-45 for example).</p>



<p>If your device is communicating over Internet, you can be pretty sure that it has a network interface card equipped with a MAC address (computers, gaming consoles, mobile phones..)</p>



<p>However, a MAC address on its own is not enough for your computer to send a message over a network.</p>



<p><em>Remember the OSI model we saw in the previous chapter?</em></p>



<p>When sending a message over the network, your message will be <strong>encapsulated</strong> with information from the presentation layer to the data-link layer.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/osi-model-layers-1024x282.png" alt="osi model and layers explained" width="1024" height="282" srcset="https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/osi-model-layers-1024x282.png 1024w, https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/osi-model-layers-300x82.png 300w, https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/osi-model-layers-768x211.png 768w, https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/osi-model-layers.png 1204w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>



<p>In other words, it will be assigned TCP (or UDP) headers, IP headers as well as Ethernet headers before going onto the wire.</p>



<p>If you just plugged your computer to the network, there is a chance that your computer does not know anything about other computers on the network.</p>



<p>It is important to say that if your computer already communicated over the network, it has a cache that it is going to use to format packets correctly.</p>



<p>Instead of having to connect every single computer to each other on a network, we use a device that binds the computers together : <strong>the switch.</strong></p>



<p>For now, let’s assume that we don’t have any router, as we simply want to send messages over a simple local subnet.</p>



<p>Use the following schema as a starting point : you have three computers on the network linked via a simple switch.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/simple-network-example.png" alt="simple network example" srcset="https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/simple-network-example.png 828w, https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/simple-network-example-300x174.png 300w, https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/simple-network-example-768x445.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 828px) 100vw, 828px"></figure></div>



<p>Computer A wants to send a message to computer B, h<strong>ow can it achieve that?</strong></p>



<h3>Understanding ARP on a local subnet</h3>



<p>In order to understand how computer A can send a message to computer B, you need to understand the <strong>ARP protocol</strong>.</p>



<p>ARP is a protocol used by computers in order <strong>to discover MAC addresses associated with IP addresses over a network.</strong></p>



<p>In short, when computer A decides to send a message to computer B, it does it using the IP address of computer B (192.178.1.3/24 in our case).</p>



<p>But if you remember the OSI model we saw just before, you realized that the message needs to have Ethernet headers.</p>



<p>That is to say that the message needs to have a source MAC address and a destination MAC address.</p>



<p>However, computer A has no idea of the MAC address of computer B.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/message-for-computer-b-1024x333.png" alt="" width="1024" height="333" srcset="https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/message-for-computer-b-1024x333.png 1024w, https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/message-for-computer-b-300x98.png 300w, https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/message-for-computer-b-768x250.png 768w, https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/message-for-computer-b.png 1269w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>



<p>In order to learn about it, it is going to use the <strong>ARP protocol</strong>.</p>



<p>Computer A will send an ARP discover frame to the switch stating that it needs to learn about the MAC address of computer B.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/arp-discover-schema-1024x346.png" alt="ARP discover example" width="1024" height="346" srcset="https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/arp-discover-schema-1024x346.png 1024w, https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/arp-discover-schema-300x101.png 300w, https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/arp-discover-schema-768x260.png 768w, https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/arp-discover-schema.png 1419w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>



<p>From there, your switch will broadcast the frame to all computers connected to the switch. As a consequence, every computer on the local network will receive the ARP discover frame.</p>



<figure><img src="https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/broadcast-arp-discover-switch-1024x346.png" alt="" width="1024" height="346" srcset="https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/broadcast-arp-discover-switch-1024x346.png 1024w, https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/broadcast-arp-discover-switch-300x101.png 300w, https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/broadcast-arp-discover-switch-768x260.png 768w, https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/broadcast-arp-discover-switch.png 1419w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>When receiving the message, if the IP address matches, the corresponding computer will send a message back stating that it is matching.</p>



<p>If it doesn’t match, the NIC of the corresponding computer will drop the message.</p>



<p>From there, the switch also learns about the MAC address and forwards the message back to the initiating computer.</p>



<p>Awesome, your computer now knows that the computer 192.178.1.3/24 has the <a href="https://ouilookup.com/mac/00-60-70">00-60-70</a>-14-45-10.</p>



<figure><img src="https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/complete-ethernet-message-network-1024x350.png" alt="" width="1024" height="350" srcset="https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/complete-ethernet-message-network-1024x350.png 1024w, https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/complete-ethernet-message-network-300x103.png 300w, https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/complete-ethernet-message-network-768x263.png 768w, https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/complete-ethernet-message-network.png 1290w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Now, your computer is able to properly format the message, the missing Ethernet header can now be completed!</p>



<p>As a consequence, the message is sent over the network and both computers can now happily communicate without any trouble.</p>



<p><strong>Quite nice!</strong></p>



<p>Now, you may be wondering : if I want to communicate with another computer located in another network, very far away from me, do I need to know about every single MAC address on Earth?</p>



<h2>Network communication over Internet</h2>



<p>In the previous chapter, we saw that communication can easily be achieved on a local subnet using the <strong>ARP protocol</strong>.</p>



<p>However, in most cases, you want to be able to communicate over Internet.</p>



<p>To answer the previous question, you don’t have to have every single MAC address stored on your computer, ARP is a protocol for local Ethernet resolution.</p>



<p>To complexify things a little bit, let’s add a router to our previous network and state that computer A now wants to communicate with computer D.</p>



<p>To understand communication over Internet, you need to understand the decision made by your computer to send a computer over the network.</p>



<p>When sending a message, your computer goes into the following decision making process :</p>



<ul><li><strong>Is the destination IP located on the subnet I am currently linked to? </strong></li></ul>



<p>If this is the case, we use the algorithm seen in the previous chapter (using ARP).</p>



<p>If this is not the case, the message is simply <strong>forwarded to your local router</strong> in order to be routed over Internet.</p>



<p>Note that your computer needs to know about the <strong>MAC address of your router</strong> in any case, using the ARP protocol described in the previous section.</p>



<p>The key here is to understand that <strong>the destination IP will be the one of the computer D but the MAC address is the one of the local gateway.</strong></p>



<p>In our example, the destination IP is not on the same subnet, so the message will be forwarded to the default gateway (aka our local router).</p>



<p>From there, the message is routed through hundreds of different routers to your destination and the response (if any) is sent back to you by the destination computer.</p>



<p>Awesome, you now know how message are sent over a network and how they can reach a local or a distant destination!</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>In this tutorial, you learnt <strong>how computers can easily communicate over a network.</strong></p>



<p>If you are dealing with a local subnet, you now know that the ARP protocol is used and that your message is broadcasted to everyone in order to learn the destination MAC address.</p>



<p>If you want to send your message over Internet, you often send your message to your local gateway (using the destination IP but the MAC of your router!).</p>



<p>From there, <strong>complex routing algorithms</strong> are used in order to reach the destination computer.</p>

<h4 id="intro">0. Introduction </h4><p>During a recent trip to North Korea, I noticed the recent and ubiquitous presence of <em>Information Technology Exchange Rooms</em> (정보기술교류실), physical stores where one can purchase a variety of electronic devices – from laptops and tablets to USB sticks and chargers – as well as software and video games for PC, mobile and tablets (for an in-depth look at what goes on inside those stores as well as what the app selection looks like, <a href="https://www.nknews.org/2019/02/what-to-buy-inside-a-north-korean-app-store/">this article</a> by Alek Sigley provides a an excellent description. There are also a few <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ujblnigJmM">videos</a> on YouTube). After looking through the catalogue of available games at different stores, I eventually decided to try and buy a Sim City-like game called <em>City Management</em> (도시경경).</p>
<figure id="attachment_426"><a href="http://digitalnk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/chongbo.png"><img src="http://digitalnk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/chongbo.png" alt="" width="845" height="760"></a><figcaption>Billboards for various app stores in Pyongyang</figcaption></figure><p>The game only cost 5000 wons (less than 1 USD) which I paid to have the app installed on the phone I had, a Samsung Galaxy A5 running Android 8. The vendor connected the phone to his PC, transferred the APK and tried to install it, but to no avail. After multiple attempts, he eventually informed me that North Korean apps most likely could not run on phones from other countries. </p>
<figure id="attachment_428"><a href="http://digitalnk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/marrichakyongchu.png"><img src="http://digitalnk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/marrichakyongchu.png" alt="" width="551" height="827"></a><figcaption>Advertisement for a car racing game inside a North Korean app store</figcaption></figure><p>Fortunately, I was later able to purchase one of the different tablets sold in North Korea. I got the <em>Morning</em> (아침) brand, which is geared towards students and quite affordable. The tablet ran Android 4 (Kit Kat) on an ARM cpu and came loaded with a few educational apps: language learning courses, dictionaries and several e-book libraries containing the complete works of Kim Il Sung, school textbooks and a collection of literary works. No games, but that could now be fixed quite easily.</p>
<figure id="attachment_431"><a href="http://digitalnk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/achimtablet.png"><img src="http://digitalnk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/achimtablet.png" alt="" width="800" height="490"></a><figcaption>A North Korean Ach’im (Morning) tablet</figcaption></figure><p>I retrieved the <em>City Management</em> APK from my phone and installed it on the tablet, where it ran perfectly. Unfortunately, after the game’s initial splash screen, I landed on this:</p>
<figure id="attachment_434"><a href="http://digitalnk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/buyserial.png"><img src="http://digitalnk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/buyserial.png" alt="" width="1024" height="600"></a><figcaption>Licence key needed</figcaption></figure><p>The screen tells us that there is no “key file” (열쇠화일) and that we should purchase one at a store. There is a “request number” (요청번호) likely used to generate the licence key and make sure it can’t be shared with other devices. Unfortunately, since the APK never installed, the vendor did not put a licence file on my phone when I bought the app. My stay in North Korea was coming to an end too and I did not have time to go back to an app store to buy a new key. So I figured I would take a look inside the app and see if I could get it running nonetheless. </p>
<hr id="licence">
<h4>1. Licensing system </h4><p>To start looking into the APK’s code, I’ll use the standard suite of tools to decompress, decompile and rebuild android apps: <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/dex2jar/">dex2jar</a>, <a href="http://java-decompiler.github.io/">jd-gui</a>, <a href="https://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool/install/">apktool</a> and <a href="https://github.com/appium/sign">apksign</a>. I’ll also use <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio">Android Studio</a> to run and debug the app. The fact that I couldn’t run the app on my phone may have just come from an Android version compatibility issue: I had no problem running it on an emulated Android 4.4 device with Android Studio. The decompilation of the <code>classes.dex</code> file gives us some interesting information right away:</p>
<figure id="attachment_438"><a href="http://digitalnk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/dex2jar1.png"><img src="http://digitalnk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/dex2jar1.png" alt="" width="211" height="326"></a><figcaption>Packages and classes from the decompiled <code>classes.dex</code> file</figcaption></figure><p>The name of the <code>com.bz.cityisland2</code> package actually refers to the original game that <em>City Management</em> is based on: <a href="https://www.sparklingsociety.net/sparkling-games/city-building-games/city-island-2/">City Island 2</a> by the Dutch game studio Sparkling Society. The name of the package <code>com.smartions.appprotected</code> refers to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/smartions-ag#section-overview">Smartions</a>, a company that offers solutions to “monetize your mobile game or app in China” and are apparently also City Island’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparkling_Society">distributor in China</a>. There are no mentions of those companies in the game itself however. The game’s loading splash screen only tells us that the game was made by the Ryusong (meteor) Technology Exchange Center (류성기술교류소) and that it is protected by the law for the protection of software (<a href="https://www.kisdi.re.kr/kisdi/common/premium?file=1%7C10360">콤퓨터쏘프트웨어보호법</a>). The law has been in place since 2003 to regulate the sales and distribution of software in the country and guarantees software developers the private ownership of their creation.</p>
<figure id="attachment_502"><a href="http://digitalnk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/kyongyong-1.png"><img src="http://digitalnk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/kyongyong-1.png" alt="" width="1000" height="640"></a><figcaption>Loading screen for the game</figcaption></figure><p>It’s hard to tell whether the North Korean version is based on the source code of the original game or if it’s entirely reverse engineered. In any case, the North Korean version does not use Smartions’s monetization system nor Sparkling Society’s but relies on a different system, which is the main difference from the original game. Save for the translation and some minor renames, the game is otherwise similar to the original (from a cursory examination) in its design, gameplay, features… to the original. </p>
<figure id="attachment_442"><a href="http://digitalnk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/UnityStructure.png"><img src="http://digitalnk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/UnityStructure.png" alt="" width="339" height="221"></a><figcaption>Structure a Unity APK. From Shim et al., <a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/scn/2018/6280768/"><em>Static and Dynamic Analysis of Android Malware and Goodware Written with Unity Framework</em></a> (2018).<br></figcaption></figure><p>There’s not much more we can glean from the Java code for now since, as the classes in <code>unity3dplayer</code> and <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code> file make clear, it is used to run code that was written with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_(game_engine)">Unity</a>, a popular cross-plaform video game framework which uses C# as its main programming language. The Unity code is stored in various library with the developer’s C# code being compiled to <code>Assembly-CSharp.dll</code>. C# compiled code is easily decompilable using tools such as <a href="https://github.com/0xd4d/dnSpy">dnSpy</a>. Once the dll is decompiled, we can look for the message we got earlier “열쇠화일이 존재하지 않습니다” (“The key file does not exist”) to find the bits of code we are interested in. The string search takes us to the <code>CIGLoadingScreen</code> class where we find the string among other variables:</p>

<![CDATA[Applying “Make Invalid States Unrepresentable”]]>

October 3, 2020 | https://kevinmahoney.co.uk/articles/applying-misu/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://kevinmahoney.co.uk/articles/applying-misu/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting" id="applying-make-invalid-states-unrepresentable">
  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><time itemprop="datePublished">02 October 2020</time></p>

<p>Here are some real life cases of applying one of my
<a href="https://kevinmahoney.co.uk/articles/my-principles-for-building-software/">favourite principles</a>.</p>

<p>I’ll try to update this as I come across good examples.</p>

<h2 id="case-1-contiguous-time-periods">Case 1: Contiguous Time Periods</h2>

<p>A straightforward way to represent a period of time is by its start
and end dates (<code>(Date, Date)</code>):</p>

<p><img src="https://kevinmahoney.co.uk/img/articles/misu/c1.png"></p>

<p>If we need to represent a timeline split in to contiguous periods, it
may be tempting to represent this as a sequence of periods (e.g. <code>List
(Date, Date)</code>):</p>

<p><img src="https://kevinmahoney.co.uk/img/articles/misu/c2.png"></p>

<p>However, with this representation there can be both gaps in the
timeline and overlapping periods:</p>

<p><img src="https://kevinmahoney.co.uk/img/articles/misu/c3.png"></p>

<h3 id="improved-representation">Improved Representation</h3>

<p>We can improve this representation so that the contiguous and
non-overlapping constraints always hold, and we can do this in a way
that may remind you of database normalisation - by removing
redundancy.</p>

<p>In a well formed contiguous timeline, the joint start/end
of the adjacent periods are redundant. Contiguous, non-overlapping
splits can simply be represented by a set of dates (<code>Set Date</code>):</p>

<p><img src="https://kevinmahoney.co.uk/img/articles/misu/c4.png"></p>

<p>You can begin to see how this representation simplifies the system
when you consider how to make a further split in the timeline. In the
list representation, splitting a period requires carefully modifying
the data-structure and ensuring constraints aren’t violated. In the
‘set of dates’ representation you simply add a date to the set.</p>

<p>It is sometimes still useful to represent the periods as a sequence of
start and end dates. It is trivial to project the set of dates in to
this form. As long as the canonical representation is the set, the
constraints will still hold.</p>

<h2 id="case-2-default-contracts">Case 2: Default Contracts</h2>

<p>In this system, a customer pays us a recurring rent based upon a contract.
Contracts last for a fixed amount of time, and when they expire we fall back to
a ‘default contract’. The customer can have many fixed contracts, and can
sign new contracts at any time.</p>

<p>This was represented as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A ‘customers’ table storing
    <ul>
      <li>The customer start date.</li>
      <li>An optional end date, should the customer leave.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A ‘contracts’ table storing
    <ul>
      <li>The contract start date.</li>
      <li>An optional end date, for default contracts that don’t end.</li>
      <li>If it was a ‘fixed’ or ‘default’ contract.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://kevinmahoney.co.uk/img/articles/misu/f1.png"></p>
<p>Customer and contract timelines</p>

<p>This representation allows for some undesirable states that are trivial to prevent:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The customer may have gaps in their contracts.</li>
  <li>A fixed contract may not have an end date.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://kevinmahoney.co.uk/img/articles/misu/f2.png"></p>
<p>Contract gaps</p>

<p>To make matters worse, the API for these contracts allowed you to
modify each individual contract, fixed or default, without guarding against
these states. This shows how a poor choice of
representation propagates itself through the design of a system.</p>

<p>This poor choice was not just a theoretical problem -
gaps in contracts were found on more than one occasion, requiring
hours of engineering effort to hunt down and fix.</p>

<h3 id="improved-representation-1">Improved Representation</h3>

<p>This is easily improved by removing the ‘default’ contracts from the
contract table. If the customer doesn’t have a fixed contract, it is
assumed they are on a default contract:</p>

<p><img src="https://kevinmahoney.co.uk/img/articles/misu/f3.png"></p>
<p>Inferred default contracts</p>

<p>Now there can no longer be any gaps, and 
the end date of a contract no longer needs to be optional as it only represents fixed contracts.</p>

<p>It’s worth reiterating that this representation can be projected in to the previous
representation using a database view if that form is more convenient. What is
important is that the underlying representation enforces these constraints, it
is not important how you view the data.</p>

<p>As with the first case, a better representation makes the manipulation
of the data structure simpler. In this case, adding a new fixed contract is
greatly simplified. There is no need to create or modify default contracts, or ensure
that the contracts are contiguous.</p>

<h3 id="the-influence-of-object-oriented-thinking">The Influence of Object-Oriented Thinking</h3>

<p>If this improvement seems obvious to you, you may wonder how the
original design happened in the first place.</p>

<p>I think this happens because of atomistic, object-oriented thinking.</p>

<p>In this mindset, the fixed contracts are <em>objects</em>, the default contracts are
<em>objects</em>, and each of these concepts must be reified as a row in a table and
never inferred.
There is a distrust of using any features the database
offers beyond storing or retrieving <em>objects</em>.</p>

<p>This approach is antithetical to quality relational design and
the principle of making invalid states unrepresentable.</p>

<p>It may feel “simpler” on some level, as you don’t really need
to think about your design.
However, as we see here, this lack of forethought inevitably
leads to complexity.</p>

  <h2><a href="https://blog.steve.fi/writing_an_assembler_.html">Writing an assembler.</a></h2>
  <p>3 October 2020 13:00</p>
  <div><p>Recently I've been writing a couple of simple compilers, which take input in a particular format and generate assembly language output.  This output can then be piped through <code>gcc</code> to generate a native executable.</p>

<p>Public examples include this trivial <a href="https://github.com/skx/math-compiler" rel="nofollow">math compiler</a> and my <a href="https://github.com/skx/bfcc" rel="nofollow">brainfuck compiler</a>.</p>

<p>Of course there's always the nagging thought that relying upon <code>gcc</code> (or <code>nasm</code>) is a bit of a cheat.  So I wondered how hard is it to write an assembler?  Something that would take assembly-language program and generate a native (ELF) binary?</p>

<p>And the answer is "It isn't hard, it is just tedious".</p>

<p>I found <a href="https://github.com/vishen/go-x64-executable/" rel="nofollow">some code</a> to generate an ELF binary, and after that assembling simple instructions was pretty simple.  I remember from my assembly-language days that the encoding of instructions can be pretty much handled by tables, but I've not yet gone into that.</p>

<p>(Specifically there are instructions like "<code>add rax, rcx</code>", and the encoding specifies the source/destination registers - with different forms for various sized immediates.)</p>

<p>Anyway I hacked up a simple assembler, it can compile <code>a.out</code> from this input:</p>

<pre><code>.hello   DB "Hello, world\n"
.goodbye DB "Goodbye, world\n"

        mov rdx, 13        ;; write this many characters
        mov rcx, hello     ;; starting at the string
        mov rbx, 1         ;; output is STDOUT
        mov rax, 4         ;; sys_write
        int 0x80           ;; syscall

        mov rdx, 15        ;; write this many characters
        mov rcx, goodbye   ;; starting at the string
        mov rax, 4         ;; sys_write
        mov rbx, 1         ;; output is STDOUT
        int 0x80           ;; syscall


        xor rbx, rbx       ;; exit-code is 0
        xor rax, rax       ;; syscall will be 1 - so set to xero, then increase
        inc rax            ;;
        int 0x80           ;; syscall
</code></pre>

<p>The obvious omission is support for "JMP", "JMP_NZ", etc.  That's painful because jumps are encoded with relative offsets.  For the moment if you want to jump:</p>

<pre><code>        push foo     ; "jmp foo" - indirectly.
        ret

:bar
        nop          ; Nothing happens
        mov rbx,33   ; first syscall argument: exit code
        mov rax,1    ; system call number (sys_exit)
        int 0x80     ; call kernel

:foo
        push bar     ; "jmp bar" - indirectly.
        ret
</code></pre>

<p>I'll update to add some more instructions, and see if I can use it to handle the output I generate from a couple of other tools.  If so that's a win, if not then it was a fun learning experience:</p>

<ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header></header><section><p>Sofware dysfunction is more often motivated by anxiety, fear, worry and embarassment than it is by a lack of technical skill. Engineers avoid work that needs doing because they’re afraid of becoming entangled with a nightmarish task, or because they’re afraid of looking stupid, or harming their career by spending time on grungy work. The task itself is rarely that difficult; it just seems so, which is enough of a barrier to discourage anyone from picking it up. One of the highest-leverage things you can do as an engineer is to recognize this emotional reaction in yourself and work to counter it. If you’re working on a single task, doing this can make your implementation significantly cleaner. If you’re a senior engineer with responsibility for a whole system, this can help you address high-impact architectural or operational issues.</p>
<p>You can see this in the common advice to sleep on a problem and come back to it in the morning. A bug that seems impossible when you’re tired and frustrated is far more approachable when you’re well-rested and caffeinated. Tedious investigative tasks (like scanning the logs for a bug or tracing all the possible code paths in a function) are still tedious in the morning, but infinitely more doable. You can knock it out in half an hour while drinking your morning coffee, rather than spending hours the night before avoiding the tedious work and hoping for a flash of inspiration.</p>
<p>Necessary work avoided becomes a haunted forest in the codebase. One engineer’s avoidant emotions turn into dangerous team habits as engineers teach each other to avoid touching certain files, or to pass odd-looking production bugs to the operations team. “This network behaviour is dark magic, let them handle it!” What began as a single engineer’s worry is now a team’s dysfunction, and can eventually metastasize into actively blocking engineers from working on the original technical problems: if you’re avoiding working on a worrying problem, it can feel threatening when someone else comes along and tries to solve it. What if they succeed, or worse still succeed easily? That would reveal that you weren’t good enough to solve the problem.</p>
<p>Just because you’re touching a scary part of the system doesn’t mean you’re facing scary work calmly and rationally. Engineers often approach thorny work like they’re going through a haunted house: either trudging through with eyes half-closed, or rushing through at full speed trying to get out as quickly as possible. Both tactics aim to take in as little of the frightening environment as possible, and neither tactic is a good way of solving real problems in technical systems. If you’ve ever just tweaked setings or frantically moved code around until it worked, you’ve done this.</p>
<p>From the inside, this doesn’t feel like emotionally-driven avoidance. It feels like working on legacy code, sharing friendly complaints about it with other engineers on your team. This is in part because a fear of hard technical problems can be a rational fear. Untangling messy parts of the codebase, identifying and removing dead code, cleaning up build, deploy and monitoring systems - these tasks often feel overwhelming because they can overwhelm you, sucking up days for no real gain. It can harm your career to spend time on this work in an org that mainly values shipping features. (I haven’t seen the other common worry - looking stupid - really be an issue in practice myself.) The trouble comes when you don’t recognise that part of your response is emotional, and therefore overrate the actual difficulty or risk.</p>
<p>How can you distinguish a rational response to a too-difficult task from a learned emotional reaction to a task that is merely worrying? This is a hard problem. I think it is the hardest problem that almost all engineers will regularly face. One approach is to avoid trying to tell the difference at all, and allot a certain amount of time to looking at randomly-chosen neglected parts of the system. Things that reduce stress in general are also good ways to reduce stress and worry about work. Good sleep, eating well, exercise, therapy, and working in an emotionally safe team all have a significant positive effect on the quality of engineering work. Once you start doing this, the difference is usually obvious in hindsight: if the task that worried you for six months took an hour or two of work when you finally mustered up the effort to look at it, you know your worry was unfounded. Dealing with worry is a virtuous cycle. Each difficult task you do makes you less scared of the next one.</p>
<p>Tackling a series of worrying tasks is one of the quickest ways I know to have massive impact in your engineering org. This is because once you understand a thorny piece of code, or a neglected system, you will usually see how to make obvious improvements. In any other part of the system these improvements would have been made already, but since you are the first person to really wrap your head around it in a long time, you get to make them here! Occasionally, you will see the opportunity to completely remove the worrying part of the system, which for me is one of the most satisfying things you can do as a software engineer. Removing things that cause your team stress has compounding benefits to your team, to the systems you work on, and to your engineering org in general.</p></section><hr></article></div>]]>

<![CDATA[An Honest Review of Gatsby]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>We decided to adopt Gatsby for <a href="https://docs.sentry.io/">Sentry’s customer-facing documentation</a> - well, I should say that <em>I</em> decided. We were already using it successfully for a variety of static marketing content, and I knew it had a lot of hype, so after a brief proof-of-concept it seemed like a safe choice.</p>
<p>To help contextualize everything I’m about to say, it’s important to understand the scope of our usage. Sentry’s documentation is not as straightforward as you might think - in fact, there are over 3,000 pages as of writing. We have a large amount of templated content designed to render language-specific examples, as well as a variety of different types of documentation (user guides, help desk-y articles, code-rich technical docs). Originally we had extended Jekyll to support a lot of this, but Ruby isn’t widely used at Sentry (approximately 0% of the engineering team knows Ruby), and it had become a big mess of spaghetti code with slow build times.</p>
<p>I also want to note that while this blog post is primarily focusing on the flaws of Gatsby as a framework, I’m not here to tell you that it’s not good for your use case. That said, I was not able to discover many of these short comings easily when evaluating Gatsby, and many things you read on the internet don’t stem out of real-world usage. My hope here is that Gatsby continues to improve over time, and that, as a user, you can be more informed about if it’s the right choice for you.</p>
<h2>Adopting Gatsby</h2>
<p>So, enter Gatsby. It seemed fast, was built on React (we’re experts on that here, with our gigabyte-sized Sentry frontend app), and had a huge adoption (assumed future existence and stability). While we didn’t have the desire to use MDX, it also seemed like a positive outcome given we could more easily deal with some of the rich aspects of our docs site, without having to resort to 2010-era JavaScript. We assumed a bunch of the other features of Gatsby had value-add, but we didn’t have an immediate need. These were things like dynamic source data - thus the need for a GraphQL engine at all - as well as the large plug-in ecosystem.</p>
<p>We started by iteratively converting sections of the Jekyll site into Gatsby - running them side by side for a time. At one point we eventually bulk converted pages, and ripped off the band aid. At this point though it was becoming clear build times were a problem. You’d spend at least 5 minutes on image optimization alone, with no way to even disable that. Slowly but surely we were depleting the ozone later on re-optimizing images which had already been pre-optimized. Oh yeah, and we were crippling our iteration speed as well, since the build cache would invalidate under a variety of situations in early development.</p>
<p>Making this worse was how we deployed Gatsby. We started off leveraging what we had already done: deploying Jekyll with Docker onto our own infrastructure - effectively just proxied via a CDN. We continued that for a period of time, but deploy times were far too long - upwards of 30-40 minutes for everything to build. Eventually we moved over to <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a> which dropped it down closer to 10 minutes, but ultimately it can’t fix what it doesn’t control.</p>
<p>The build and deploy times were the first of many woes, and they represent what would become a continued frustration: a problem without a clear solution.</p>
<h2>Enter MDX</h2>
<p>Rewind time a little bit - this actually wasn’t our first project converting documentation to Gatsby. The proof-of-concept I mentioned earlier was actually our <a href="https://develop.sentry.dev/">developer documentation</a>, which I had migrated out of Notion to make public. While doing that we had gotten our hands dirty with some initial MDX usability and extensions - like our code samples which support toggling between different languages. This was one of the many things we needed to solve for, but MDX made it look like it’d be seemingly easy. No more jQuery DOM manipulation, just clean, encapsulated React components. Or so we thought.</p>
<p>Almost immediately we hit rough spots with MDX. We were coming from Jekyll - which was Liquid-rendered (a template engine) markdown - to MDX - a strange offspring of Markdown and JSX, attempting all of the benefits of both, but missing by a fairly large margin. Let’s illustrate the crux of the issue with what has got to be one of the most common needs in a documentation system: an alert (or callout) component:</p>
<div data-language="markdown"><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>Alert</span> <span>level</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>info<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>You should know something important about this!<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>Alert</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>At face value this looks great. <code>Alert</code> is just a React component, and JSX is close enough to HTML that non-technical folks are able to pick it up fairly easily. Now the problem comes into play when you actually want to do something in the real world. Here’s an example from our API docs:</p>
<div data-language="markdown"><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>Alert</span> <span>level</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>warning<span>"</span></span> <span>title</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>Note<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>
    <span><span>**</span><span>PUT/DELETE</span><span>**</span></span> methods only apply to updating/deleting issues.
Events in sentry are immutable and can only be deleted by deleting the whole issue.
<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>Alert</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>How would you expect this to render? Both as an engineer and a non-engineer, I would expect - given this is markdown - that the “PUT/DELETE” text would be bold. It’s not. Because the MDX interpreter decides that once you enter a component block, it’s no longer markdown. So instead, we’re forced with this monstrosity <em>everywhere</em> in our documentation:</p>
<div data-language="markdown"><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>Alert</span> <span>level</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>warning<span>"</span></span> <span>title</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>Note<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>markdown</span><span>&gt;</span></span>

<span><span>**</span><span>PUT/DELETE</span><span>**</span></span> methods only apply to updating/deleting issues.
Events in sentry are immutable and can only be deleted by deleting the whole issue.

<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>markdown</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>Alert</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>There’s two things you should note here: 1) we have to use this <code>&lt;markdown&gt;</code> tag, 2) we have to put empty new-lines to ensure paragraph tags render.</p>
<p>“But David”, you might say, “why don’t you just tell the <code>Alert</code> component to render the text as markdown?“. If only you could, or at least, if only I could have possibly found a way to achieve that as a user with minimal Gatsby or MDX internals knowledge.</p>
<p>To Gatsby, or at least to the MDX team’s credit, they recognize some of these problems and <a href="https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx/issues/1041">there is work underway</a> on a 2.0 of the MDX dialect. While I’m confident they will improve things, I’m not confident MDX can ultimately succeed. It’s likely going to tradeoff one problem for another due to what it’s trying to achieve in the first place. It may get to a good place, but frankly, we need to step back and look at what we’re trying to solve, instead of creating a solution to a problem we don’t have. I don’t need JSX syntax in my markdown, I need a way to include JSX components. That might sound similar, but its quite a different thing.</p>
<p>As an example, there’s no reason I couldn’t simply use markdown syntax, and provide a way to achieve something akin to:</p>
<div data-language="markdown"><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>a-valid-html-tag-because-markdown-allows-that</span> <span>a-valid-property</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>a-value<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This wouldn’t force us to work around quirks in a new language (or interpreter even), and could be solved in a much more sustainable way. There are other alternatives as well. A generic way to render extensions in markdown could simply call into a React component, and avoid even trying to hijack HTML in the first place. While I don’t know what this might look like in Markdown, in <a href="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html">Sphinx’s use of reStructuredText</a> this was solved early on with Directives:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>.. my-directive:: some data
   :property-name: property-value</code></pre></div>
<p>I will hold out for MDX 2.0 and hope that finds a nice minimal-compromise place, but if not, we’ll be looking for a way to extend native markdown.</p>
<h2>A Broken DOM</h2>
<p>While we were able to work around the kinks of MDX, there’s been some things not yet solved. One of those is the layer which Gatsby uses to apply diffs to the DOM. I’m going to caveat this section with <em>I don’t know what the technical implementation is</em>, but I can make some assumptions given what I know of the domain. The system itself is intended to apply deltas to the DOM. This is naively also how React works, and I imagine under the hood it’s relying on React at least for part of it. We’ve had issues with this identified in two places already:</p>
<ul>
<li>progressive image loading</li>
<li>dynamic JSX components</li>
</ul>
<p>While they might not be linked to the same issue, they smell like they are, so we’re going to roll with it. The problem exhibits itself when you have a bunch of DOM that to a naive robot might look the same:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>&lt;div&gt;foo&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;bar&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;baz&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;foobizbar&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre></div>
<p>In React it uses the graph to identify which node is which - effectively creating a unique entity ID based on its location. In cases where that’s difficult, React will warn you to explicitly bind a <code>key</code> attribute on each element to ensure it can more accurately deal with updates. While I would assume Gatsby is at least partially using React’s DOM engine, what we see in production effectively takes the above example, and replaces some of the content with other subsets of content - meaning it’s unable to accurately identify which nodes need updated.</p>
<p>We’ve seen this where a progressive image is replaced with an entirely different image that’s present near it on the page. We’ve also seen this happen for a dynamically loaded section of content (our language-selector include tags). While we’ve yet to identify a fix for the image tags, our other issue was resolved by literally changing a <code>div</code> tag to a different tag, one which is less commonly used (in our case, <code>section</code>).</p>
<p>All of the cases happen after Gatsby’s initial static render and exist only when applying some form of delta.</p>
<h2>Let’s Talk GraphQL</h2>
<p>It’s a static website generator. It literally does not need GraphQL all over the place. While there are few instances in the real world where that is valuable, it shouldn’t require a GraphQL API to read objects that are already in memory.</p>
<p>I don’t want to spend the energy to hammer this in, but take a look at Jared Palmer’s <a href="https://jaredpalmer.com/gatsby-vs-nextjs">Gatsby vs. Next.js</a> as it echoes my thoughts.</p>
<p>So, let’s actually not talk about GraphQL, but all its done is create complexity for us.</p>
<h2>Minor Gripes</h2>
<p>There’s a number of other things we’ve found fairly frustrating at this point, but this post is already getting long, so I’m choosing to summarize them.</p></section></div>

    <section>
      <p>When the engineering managers I coach struggle to find ambitious goals, I sometimes leverage their ambitions to help them identify areas where they can improve. But, to my surprise, not so many EMs have ambitions beyond their current role.</p><p>When I had a “real job”, I was always driven by the next thing. I didn’t care about the title, but I always wanted more impact and responsibilities (in six years and two companies, I had seven different positions 😅). While I don’t recommend being as “opportunistic” as I was (but hey, I ended up being an entrepreneur), I do believe that thinking about the next position gives you <strong>perspective and makes you more in control of your career</strong>. But the difference between thinking about your next promotion and getting it is enormous. </p><p>Many engineers believe that if you do great work at your job, people will recognise that work and automatically give you an adequate promotion or raise. It is unfortunately far from reality, as <strong>those who get promoted, are not the best employees, but the more visible</strong>.</p><figure><img src="https://www.tlt21.com/content/images/2020/10/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.tlt21.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/image.png 600w, https://www.tlt21.com/content/images/2020/10/image.png 900w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Dilbert.com</figcaption></figure><h3 id="visibility-matters"><strong>Visibility matters</strong></h3><p>Think about your CTO’s typical day (or the VP Engineering, the one who will eventually decide on your promotion). They might have eight to ten meetings to attend, tens of emails (or Slack messages) to answer and they always have to switch their mind to a different project or a new problem that needs to be solved. So, unless you’re involved in the problem du jour, the number of seconds the CTO is thinking about you in a day is about zero. Pretty normal right? The CTO is a busy gal and can’t think about every single team member. But if you’re serious about this promotion, <strong>she should hear about you often</strong>. </p><p>In an <a href="https://staffeng.com/stories/katie-sylor-miller">interview with StaffEng</a>, Katie Sylor-Miller, a Frontend Architect at Etsy, says that “<em>a big part of being promoted [...] is making sure that your work is visible, that people know your name and you have a good reputation.</em>” I’m sure you’re thinking right now about OKRs, performance reviews, one-on-one(s) with your boss and all the other mechanisms in place at your company to make your work visible. Unfortunately, as rightly pointed out by <a href="https://defmacro.substack.com/p/how-to-get-promoted">Slava Akhmechet</a>, a product manager at Stripe, they’re too often <strong>“social fiction”</strong>:</p><blockquote><em>Following the overt mechanisms of advancement is neither sufficient nor necessary. It may even be actively harmful - almost everyone who does great work and takes performance reviews seriously toils in relative obscurity. Look at the people who occupy positions of considerable authority in your organisation. Did any of them get there by following some middle manager's feedback?</em></blockquote><p>Instead of social fiction, I think the word “game” is more appropriate for the advancement system in most companies (and any human interactions by the way). Since I’m pretty sure you’ve spent countless hours like me playing video games (or still do 🎮), how do you win at video games? <strong>You game the system</strong>.</p><h3 id="understand-the-promotion-process-at-your-company"><strong>Understand the promotion process at your company</strong></h3><p>If you’re currently an engineering manager, any promotion from now on will make you part of your company’s leadership team. And, as pointed out by <a href="https://lethain.com/being-visible/">Will Larson</a>, “<em>existing members of that team want to be comfortable that they’re expanding their ranks with folks they believe in, and they can’t believe in you if they don’t know you.</em>”</p><figure><img src="https://www.tlt21.com/content/images/2020/10/image-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.tlt21.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/image-1.png 600w, https://www.tlt21.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/image-1.png 1000w, https://www.tlt21.com/content/images/2020/10/image-1.png 1240w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>FangXianUo/iStock</figcaption></figure><p>As an engineering manager, you’re not contributing anymore to the codebase. You’re<strong> contributing to the company’s success</strong>. Managing your team is the means to get there, not the goal. More specifically, an engineering manager contributes to the company’s success by:</p><p><strong>1/ Attracting and retaining the very best engineers</strong>: like <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2005/07/25/hitting-the-high-notes/">Joel Spolsky</a>, I firmly believe that an organisation “<em>where the best software developers in the world would want to work [leads] to profits as naturally as chocolate leads to chubbiness.</em>” So even if there is a process in place to attract engineers, everyone in the company will thank you if you managed to score a high-profile recruit (while saving thousands in headhunter’s fees). Some tips for doing so:</p><ul><li><strong>Be recognised externally as an expert</strong> and someone great engineers would want to work with (blogging, speaking…)</li><li><strong>Continuously look for talent</strong>, especially visible ones (the ones who blog, speak, live code, contribute to open source…) and invite them for informal interviews</li><li><strong>Mentor external engineers</strong> pro-bono, even if they don’t end working for you, they sometimes have friends who might</li></ul><p><strong>2/ Shipping revenue-generating projects</strong>: for any company out there, technology is just the means to make more money. So which projects in your company right now have the highest revenue-generating potential? There are usually three or four such projects per year, so you need to make sure your team is involved in these projects, even if it means <strong>being proactive about it and not waiting for your manager to assign it to you</strong>. When I was an employee, I used to regularly crash meetings (or discussions at the coffee counter) and see if I could be useful to a project.</p><p><strong>3/ Proactively solving problems:</strong> I’m sure you’re the kind of person who always presents problems with a solution. What’s even better is for you to <strong>start solving the problem before your boss is even aware of it</strong>. CTOs have to make countless decisions every day, and they need to know they can count on leaders in their team to be proactive and make the right decisions for them. Obviously, this action shouldn't say hidden and you would have sent a message to the leadership with information about the problem, what your team is doing to solve it and a deadline.</p><h3 id="building-your-promotion-playbook">Building your promotion playbook</h3><p>When I was advising startups on fundraising, most of the work we were doing was building up a great story that would unroll during the roadshow (3 to 6 months). Getting promoted is not the same as fundraising, but the mechanism is similar:</p><p><strong>1/ Make your intentions known</strong>: promotion is a two-way street, and your management should be aware of your objectives, as well as you should be aware of what they’re expecting from someone who does your targeted job. Ideally, they should state clearly what you should be demonstrating to get the job so that you can show you’ve done it when the time is right.</p><p><strong>2/ Keep a log of your achievements and impact:</strong> start a <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/">brag document</a> or a <a href="https://staffeng.com/guides/promo-packets">promotion packet</a> that will be the base for any communication about your team’s accomplishments (especially the ones on high-impact projects).</p><p><strong>3/ Make it impossible for them to say no</strong>: when it’s promotion or review time, build a short presentation that shows factually how you achieved what the management expected of you and your team’s successes.</p><p>Keep in mind that <strong>the higher you go on the management ladder, the fewer positions are available</strong>. Sometimes you might want to make a lateral move at a smaller company to build up more responsibilities (like becoming CTO or VPE at a startup) before going back to a more mature company.</p><p>Last but not least, it’s essential to understand that while thinking about your next promotion should not be your main focus, <strong>it is part of your job</strong>. There are still way too many opportunistic leaders in technology organisations and not enough people like you. So please do me a favour, keep doing a great job AND get that promotion instead of all the opportunistic contenders 😉</p><hr><h3 id="news"><strong>News</strong></h3><p><em>This section is only available to email subscribers. <a href="https://www.tlt21.com/signup/">Sign up</a>, it's free!</em></p><hr><h3 id="summary"><strong>Summary</strong></h3><ul><li>Thinking about getting promoted gives you perspective and makes you more in control of your career</li><li>Those who get promoted are not the best employees, but the more visible</li><li>To be more visible: attract high-level engineers, ship revenue-generating projects, proactively solve problems</li><li>Getting promoted is a 6-month process that resembles a fundraising roadshow</li></ul><h3 id="reading-list"><strong>Reading List</strong></h3><p>[RESOURCE] <a href="https://progression.monzo.com/techops"><strong>Progression at Monzo</strong></a> - Monzo</p><p>[ESSAY] <strong><a href="https://defmacro.substack.com/p/how-to-get-promoted">How to get promoted</a> </strong>- Slava Akhmechet</p><p>[ESSAY] <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/software-engineering-promotions/"><strong>Software Developer Promotions: Advice to Get to That Next Level</strong></a> - Gergely Orosz</p><p>[ESSAY] <a href="https://lethain.com/being-visible/"><strong>Being visible</strong></a> - Will Larson</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="wikipage">

<p>People were arguing about Rust’s std lib recently, so I went through the <code>Cargo.toml</code> of all the Rust projects I’ve written since 2015 and picked out the choice tools that get used over and over again. Up to date as of October 2020.</p>
<p>Also see <a href="https://wiki.alopex.li/RustCrates" title="Go to wiki page">RustCrates</a>, though that’s old. There’s also <a href="https://christine.website/blog/rust-crates-go-stdlib-2020-09-27">this</a>, which is narrower but deeper, and <a href="https://github.com/rust-unofficial/awesome-rust">awesome-rust</a>, which is shallower and broader, and the various <a href="https://www.arewewebyet.org/">more</a> <a href="https://arewegameyet.rs/">specific</a> <a href="https://areweasyncyet.rs/">websites</a> <a href="https://www.areweguiyet.com/">for various</a> <a href="https://areweideyet.com/">topics</a>.</p>

<p>I need to set up a new Rust dev environment, what do I install?</p>
<h2 id="linting-clippy">Linting – <code>clippy</code></h2>
<p>The one, the only, the great Rust style and correctness linter. Want to learn how to write “idiomatic” Rust, or just learn more about handy little corners of the language and library? Run <code>clippy</code> regularly. It’s distributed with the compiler via <code>rustup</code> now, so you have no excuse not to.</p>
<h2 id="build-cache-sccache">Build cache – <code>sccache</code></h2>
<p>Or, “how to make a full rebuild 70% faster”. <code>sccache</code> is a build artifact cache similar to <code>icecream</code> or <code>ccache</code>, except it’s actually trivial to just use. <code>cargo install sccache</code>, add a single line in a home dir config file, and you’re ready to go. Pretty much handles most crate and compiler versioning issues for you, so it Just Works if you update crates or install a new version of <code>rustc</code> or something. I think I’ve had to force-clear the cache due to some build weirdness a grand total of once. Looks like it has enough features to use in a professional context as well, at least on a small-to-medium scale.</p>
<h2 id="dependency-viewer-cargo-tree">Dependency viewer – <code>cargo-tree</code></h2>
<p>The best way to view what dependencies you are using, and what dependencies they are using, and so on. Best way to start cracking down on flabby dependencies.</p>
<h2 id="benchmarking-criterion">Benchmarking – <code>criterion</code></h2>
<p>Basically the best benchmark system out there. Incredibly simple to use, informative, and statistically sound. Doesn’t really do profiling, but it’s a good start for understanding your program’s performance, and better for proving that your implementation of X is faster than someone else’s.</p>
<h2 id="other-things">Other things</h2>
<p>Stuff that is less general purpose but occasionally very useful for the meta-programming process of choosing libraries, evaluating them, etc.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>cargo-geiger</code> – Measures how much unsafe code is in a codebase, and its dependencies</li>
<li><code>cargo-crev</code> – A <a href="https://wiki.alopex.li/ActuallyUsingCrev">very neat tool</a> for authoring and verifying distributed code reviews.</li>
<li>Various tools maintained by <a href="https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/rust-ecosystem">Embark Studios</a>, useful for production/company purposes like checking licenses, pinning specific versions of crates, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>The cool stuff Real Computer Scientists write about.</p>
<h2 id="hashing">Hashing</h2>
<p>No specific crates here. There’s no single crate that provides All The Hash Algorithms, just lots of little ones that generally provide a single algorithm each. Just type the name of the algorithm you want into <code>crates.io</code> and you’ll get at least a couple options, choose the one with 8 million downloads or whatever. <code>sha2</code>, <code>md5</code>, <code>crc</code>, etc. Lots of them are written by the Rust core team.</p>
<h2 id="compression">Compression</h2>
<p>Same as the hashing category. Type <code>zip</code> or <code>bzip2</code> or whatever into crates.io and you’ll get what you need. <code>flate2</code> might be the one crate that’s not quite trivial to find. Again, many of them are written by the Rust core team.</p>
<h2 id="encryption">Encryption</h2>
<p>I have little actual experience or authority on this topic, so I’m going to punt on this one.</p>
<h2 id="pseudorandom-number-generator">Pseudorandom number generator</h2>
<p>Use <code>oorandom</code>. (Disclaimer, I wrote <code>oorandom</code>, but people besides me seem to like it.) More usually you’ll see the <code>rand</code> crate in use. If you’re doing Real Science and need to generate <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.0/reference/routines.random.html">fancy probabilities</a>, then <code>rand</code> is the right tool, but most people aren’t doing that. Otherwise <code>rand</code> is complicated and has lots of features, while <code>oorandom</code> is very simple and has about two features, and I expect 80% of code to use at least one of them. <code>rand</code> has had several major breaking changes in its history that the rest of the ecosystem still hasn’t caught up with, while I intend <code>oorandom</code>’s API to change maybe twice in my lifetime. (Its version number, while obeying semver, is mostly a joke.)</p>
<p>There’s other lightweight PRNG crates that are just fine; see <code>oorandom</code>’s readme for a list of some others and choose one you like. Whatever you choose, use the <code>getrandom</code> crate to produce Real Random Seeds for it.</p>

<p>“I just need to solve this ooooooone common problem, but it needs to be solved WELL…”</p>
<h2 id="logging-log">Logging – <code>log</code></h2>
<p>Need to output log messages in your code? Why, use the <code>log</code> crate. Where do the log messages go? <code>log</code> provides only an interface, and that interface compiles to nothing if it isn’t used. You can write your own system for it to actually output the logs to, which is pretty easy, or use one of the small plethora of crates for it. My preferred one is <code>pretty_env_logger</code>, but <code>fern</code>, <code>slog</code> and others are all good too.</p>
<h2 id="parallel-data-crunching-rayon">Parallel data crunching – <code>rayon</code></h2>
<p>Ever have some computation where you have a big list of STUFF and want to process it in parallel, farming out jobs to as many threads as you have CPU’s? That’s what <code>rayon</code> does, and it does it really, really well. You still <a href="https://aspenuwu.me/posts/rust-optimization.html">have to know what you’re doing</a>, but changing a single <code>.iter()</code> into <code>.par_iter()</code> and watching your CPU-bound data-crunching run 8x faster is pretty magical. Now your CPU can help keep you warm this winter!</p>
<p>Please never use it in a library. It’s rude to spawn threads in library code, unless that’s specifically what the library is for.</p>
<h2 id="regexes-regex">Regexes – <code>regex</code></h2>
<p>To quote the inestimable <a href="https://www.jwz.org/blog/">jwz</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some people, when confronted with a problem, think “I know, I’ll use regular expressions.” Now they have two problems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, <a href="https://xkcd.com/208/">somebody’s gotta save the day</a>. So, use the <code>regex</code> crate. Also use <a href="https://crates.io/crates/ripgrep">anything else</a> <a href="https://crates.io/crates/xsv">written by BurntSushi</a>. BurntSushi is a paragon of Rust program design, and also just a great <del>human being</del> charred cuisine in general.</p>
<h2 id="threadsafe-globals-lazy_static">Threadsafe globals – <code>lazy_static</code></h2>
<p>“I know globals are evil,” you say, “but I just need one. I’ll only use it for good, I promise.” <code>lazy_static</code> has your back.</p>
<p>May eventually be superseded by <code>once_cell</code>, which looks like its <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2788">headed for inclusion into <code>std</code></a>.</p>
<h2 id="serializationdeserialization-serde">Serialization/deserialization – <code>serde</code></h2>
<p>Ever have a struct and just wanted to turn it into JSON, CBOR, XML, or some other engine of woe and devastation designed to be written to an I/O stream? Or had a blob of random JSON and wanted to just stuff it into a struct matching it? Sure you have. <code>serde</code> lets you do this with a single <code>#[derive]</code>. <code>serde</code> is without a doubt one of Rust’s killer libraries. It is better than any other serialization system I have ever used.</p>
<p>What data formats does it support? Anything; the actual reading and writing is done via plugin library. There’s a <a href="https://serde.rs/#data-formats">wide selection of them</a>, of varying quality, and writing your own is a little tedious but not terribly difficult.</p>
<h2 id="error-handling">Error handling</h2>
<p>This spot deliberately left blank.</p>
<p>Rust’s <code>Result&lt;T,E&gt;</code> type is one of the best setups for lightweight, transparent error handling I’ve seen, but it doesn’t do everything. How do you easily write your own error type without a bunch of boilerplate? What if you have multiple different error types from different libraries you want to coalesce together? How do you collect a backtrace of every function an <code>Err</code> is returned through, so you can find the root cause of where it came from? Can we do all this without allocating anything unnecessarily? And so on.</p>
<p>There have been various crates to try to solve these problems. First in 2015 there was <code>error_chain</code>, which was complicated and not very convenient. Then in 2017 there was <code>failure</code>, which was simpler but not very flexible, and which took an irritatingly long time to compile. Then in 2019 there was <code>anyhow</code>, which was about the time I stopped paying attention. Now apparently the new kid on the block is <code>eyre</code>, and I’m sure that in another year or two there will be something else.</p>
<p>So, I just write the boilerplate and make my errors descriptive enough I don’t need a backtrace. When I want to get fancy I implement the built-in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/error/trait.Error.html"><code>Error</code></a> trait, which used to be kinda useless but is now more helpful. And in another five years it’ll still work just fine.</p>
<h2 id="byte-mucking-bytemuck">Byte mucking – <code>bytemuck</code></h2>
<p>For the rare occasions you need to turn a structure into arbitrary <code>&amp;[u8]</code> or back. Doing this using unsafe pointers is quite easy, and also makes it very easy to screw up horribly with Undefined Behavior galore. (Did you know that changing the value of padding bytes in a struct in UB? You do now.) <code>bytemuck</code> lets you muck around with bytes a little more responsibly.</p>
<h2 id="human-dates-and-times-chrono">Human dates and times – <code>chrono</code></h2>
<p>Rust’s <code>std::time</code> doesn’t really handle calendar or wall-clock times, just arbitrary, monotonic <code>Instant</code>’s and measurable <code>Duration</code>’s between them. Nice, pure, computationally-robust time measurement. For all the nasty human calendar and timezone stuff, you use <code>chrono</code>. (And maybe <code>humantime</code>, but I personally reach for <code>chrono</code> first, just out of habit.)</p>
<h2 id="bit-flags-bitflags">Bit flags – <code>bitflags</code></h2>
<p>Defining type-safe bit-masks in a reasonably convenient way. Not always worth the trouble, but sometimes pretty convenient.</p>

<p>“I have to create or read a…”</p>
<h2 id="pngjpeggifetc-image">PNG/JPEG/GIF/etc – <code>image</code></h2>
<p>General-purpose loading and saving and images, which can handle a lot of formats. Can do some amount of image manipulation as well, such as cropping, smoothing, etc. but that will hopefully be pulled out into its own library at some point soon.</p>
<h2 id="small-data-things-uuid-base64-csv-semver">Small data THINGS – <code>uuid</code>, <code>base64</code>, <code>csv</code>, <code>semver</code>…</h2>
<p>Exactly what it says on the tin.</p>

<p>Not aware of any great encoders, but there’s plenty of <em>decoders</em> for common audio formats. <code>lewton</code> for Ogg Vorbis, <code>hound</code> for .wav, <code>minimp3</code> for MP3, <code>claxon</code> for FLAC. Video, I haven’t used enough to have an opinion on.</p>
<h2 id="config-files-toml">Config files – <code>toml</code></h2>
<p>For all your config file format needs. Works with <code>serde</code>, naturally.</p>
<h2 id="markdown-pulldown-cmark">Markdown – <code>pulldown-cmark</code></h2>
<p>There’s several good Markdown readers and writers, <code>pulldown-cmark</code> is my favorite. It supports CommonMark, it’s simple to use, and it’s pure Rust.</p>
<h2 id="templating-askama">Templating – <code>askama</code></h2>
<p>There’s several quite good text templating engines, but <code>askama</code> IMO rises above them all by compiling your templates into Rust code and type-checking your templates at compile time. Sometimes this isn’t what you want, but it is a great feature surprisingly often. This also makes it super fast, for when you really need to …</p></div></div>

        <article>
    

    <p>I’ve always been fascinated by CPython and C language companionship.
On the one hand, we’ve got a comprehensive and straightforward tool, and on the other — 
performant and low-level one. I’d even say that this synergy is one of the main 
pillars that have led to Python’s widespread success nowadays.</p>

<p>However, as an infrequent user of C, I never fully realized how this combination works.
The more I used it, the more questions popped out:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How CPython calls binary executables and what is an ABI?</li>
  <li>Why ctypes and other FFI tools are slower than using C extensions?</li>
  <li>Why it’s not possible to call C++ library?</li>
</ul>

<p>I had no other choice but to take it all apart and look inside.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Most of the examples in this article are written in C.
That said, even despite I thoroughly explain all the topics,
<strong>I presume a reader is somewhat familiar with C/C++</strong> and compiled languages.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Let’s start with an exploration of binary executables.</p>

<p>CPUs speak in so-called <strong>machine code</strong> — low-level instructions
that operate directly over CPU memory, registers, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_logic_unit">Arithmetic logic unit</a>, etc.
A naive assumption would be that executables are just a list of such instructions for CPU to run.
Well, that’s not the case.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://azhpushkin.me/assets/images/python_c_abi/compiled_and_cpu.jpg" alt="Not happening.">
    
    <figcaption>Not happening.</figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>Compilers generate executable files according to standardized binary file formats.
Such files contain machine code, structured in a certain way,
and wrapped with a plethora of additional metadata.</p>

<p>Operating systems rely heavily on this metadata to determine how binary files should be used.
Because of that, each operating system features some exact format to work with.
Among the most popular ones are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>ELF</strong> (Executable and Linkable Format), used by most of Linux distros</li>
  <li><strong>PE</strong> (Portable Executable), used by Windows</li>
  <li><strong>Mach-O</strong> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach_(kernel)">Mach</a> object), used by Apple products</li>
</ul>

<p>As a Linux user, I’m using ELF throughout the article.
However, general ideas hold for other systems as well. 
I can also recommend looking at
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/631631/">“How programs get run: ELF binaries”</a>
if you want to learn more about execution flow.</p>

<p>Worth mentioning, even though each OS works with a specific file format,
it does not mean that running others is impossible.
It’s just a matter of parsing and executing machine code correctly.
<a href="https://www.winehq.org/">The Wine project</a> is a perfect example:
it’s a platform that runs PE files (Windows default format) on systems
without native PE support.</p>

<hr color="#dddddd">

<p>We are going to peek into ELF for a moment.
Meet our test subject:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// basics/dullmath.c</span>
<span>int</span> <span>fibonacci</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>n</span> <span>&lt;=</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>n</span> <span>==</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>return</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>fibonacci</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>fibonacci</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>-</span><span>2</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>float</span> <span>get_pi</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span><span>return</span> <span>3</span><span>.</span><span>14</span><span>;}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To use this code from other programs, we need to compile it to the so-called
shared library.</p>

<p><strong>Shared library</strong> (or <strong>shared object</strong>) is an executable binary file intended to
be used by other programs. We compile it once and simply <em>link</em> other programs against it.
Hence the name <em>shared</em> — everyone is using the same binary file.
Besides, there is no need for the <code>main</code> function
as the library is not designed to run standalone.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span># Note the naming convention: `lib&lt;name&gt;.so`</span>
<span>$ </span>gcc <span>-shared</span> <span>-fPIC</span> dullmath.c <span>-o</span> libdullmath.so
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The resulting <code>libdullmath.so</code> is an ELF file.
Note <code>-fPIC</code> compiler argument: it makes machine code
<a href="https://azhpushkin.me/posts/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position-independent_code">position-independent</a>. This ensures that
the library operates correctly regardless of the memory position, where it is loaded.
You can refer to <a href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2011/08/25/load-time-relocation-of-shared-libraries/">“Load-time relocation of shared libraries”</a>
and <a href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2011/11/03/position-independent-code-pic-in-shared-libraries/">“Position Independent Code (PIC) in shared libraries”</a> articles for a thorough examination.</p>

<p>Each ELF file contains a list of <strong>symbolic references</strong> (or just <strong>symbols</strong>).
Symbols are used to identify individual machine code sections by names.
We can look at those with a <code>readelf</code> tool to verify that our functions are available:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ readelf -D --symbols libdullmath.so | grep FUNC | grep GLOBAL
  5   1: 0000000000001109    74 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT  11 fibonacci
  6   1: 0000000000001153    14 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT  11 get_pi
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We also need to make our library visible to our programs. An easiest way to do so
is to copy it to <code>/usr/lib/</code> - default system-wide directory for libraries.</p>

<p>If you’d rather not mess with sudo or system-wide directories, you may as well use 
<code>LIBRARY_PATH</code> and <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> environment variables.
Both add a given path to the list of lookup directories.
<code>LIBRARY_PATH</code> is used by gcc during the compilation, and
<code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> is used by OS at runtime (gcc doesn’t bind location of shared object,
so there is a separate lookup at runtime).</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span># Copy to system default location</span>
<span>$ </span><span>sudo cp </span>libdullmath.so /usr/lib/  
<span>$ </span>
<span>$ </span><span># Or use environment variables</span>
<span>$ </span><span>export </span><span>LIBRARY_PATH</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span><span>pwd</span><span>)</span>    <span># add to compilation scope</span>
<span>$ </span><span>export </span><span>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span><span>pwd</span><span>)</span> <span># add to runtime scope</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>All the ways of calling C from Python are based on compiling a shared library
and loading it from Python.
So if you don’t feel very familiar with shared libraries, I highly recommend
tinkering around with them for a little. <a href="https://amir.rachum.com/blog/2016/09/17/shared-libraries/">“Shared Libraries: Understanding Dynamic Loading”</a> is a great starting point.</p>



<p>With the shared object compiled, we are ready to call it.</p>

<p>I consider <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html">ctypes</a> to be the easiest way to execute some C code, because:</p>
<ul>
  <li>it’s included in the standard library,</li>
  <li>writing a wrapper uses plain Python.</li>
</ul>

<p>Latter makes ctypes an implementation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_function_interface"><strong>Foreign Function Interface (FFI)</strong></a> for Python.
This is a general name for a mechanism by which you can write code in one programming language
to run another. One that you write is called the <strong>host</strong> language, one that
you execute — the <strong>guest</strong>. In our case, the host is Python, the guest is C.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> import ctypes
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span># note: ctypes require a path to file, not library name</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> lib <span>=</span> ctypes.CDLL<span>(</span>f<span>'/usr/lib/libdullmath.so'</span><span>)</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span>

&lt;_FuncPtr object at 0x7f3671537b80&gt;
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> lib.fibonacci

<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span>

    func <span>=</span> self._FuncPtr<span>((</span>name_or_ordinal, self<span>))</span>
AttributeError: /home/.../libdullmath.so: undefined symbol: other_function</code></pre></figure>

<p>All as expected: ctypes uses symbols to find functions, and invalid symbols
usage raises an undefined symbol exception.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>[</span>lib.fibonacci<span>(</span>i<span>)</span> <span>for </span>i <span>in </span>range<span>(</span>7<span>)]</span>
<span>[</span>0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> lib.get_pi<span>()</span>
0
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Yikes! What happened to <code>get_pi()</code>?</p>

<p>Well, to call the function correctly, we need to know the type signature of that function.
ELF does not carry types information, so we need to provide them manually.</p>

<p>ctypes allows this by declaring <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html#specifying-the-required-argument-types-function-prototypes">function argument types</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html#return-types">return types</a>. Default return type is considered <code>c_int</code>, so that did work out-of-the-box for <code>fibonacci</code> and did not for <code>get_pi</code>.</p>

<p>Easy fix.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> lib.get_pi.restype <span>=</span> ctypes.c_float
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> lib.get_pi<span>()</span>
3.140000104904175
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The exciting part starts once you try to compile this code as a C++ library.
This is an <em>easy way to break this demo down</em>.
As I pointed out at the start of an article, ctypes doesn’t support C++ libraries.
Even though this simple piece of code is perfectly valid as both C and C++.</p>

<p>Check this out:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>g++ <span>-shared</span> dullmath.c <span>-o</span> libdullmath.so  <span># just swap gcc to g++</span>
<span>$ </span>python
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> import ctypes
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> lib <span>=</span> ctypes.CDLL<span>(</span>f<span>'./libdullmath.so'</span><span>)</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> lib.fibonacci
Traceback <span>(</span>most recent call last<span>)</span>:
  File <span>"&lt;stdin&gt;"</span>, line 1, <span>in</span> &lt;module&gt;
  File <span>"/usr/lib/python3.8/ctypes/__init__.py"</span>, line 386, <span>in </span>__getattr__
    func <span>=</span> self.__getitem__<span>(</span>name<span>)</span>
  File <span>"/usr/lib/python3.8/ctypes/__init__.py"</span>, line 391, <span>in </span>__getitem__
    func <span>=</span> self._FuncPtr<span>((</span>name_or_ordinal, self<span>))</span>
AttributeError: /home/.../libdullmath.so: undefined symbol: fibonacci
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To discover why it is so, we need to take a closer look at
machine code, packed inside the generated binary.</p>



<p>As we have found out in the previous chapter, we need to know type signatures
to use a shared library properly. In fact, we need to know much more —
we need to understand an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface"><strong>Application Binary Interface (ABI)</strong></a> of compiled machine code.</p>

<p>An ABI is similar to an API, but on a much lower level. 
ABI could be described as a set of rules that define how 
certain compiled machine code works. One of the most important and 
illustrative parts of ABI is a calling convention.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calling_convention"><strong>Calling concention</strong></a> defines low-level rules of a function call.
For instance, it defines:</p>
<ul>
  <li>where arguments and return values are stored,</li>
  <li>what is the ordering of arguments,</li>
  <li>who is responsible for cleaning up after function return,</li>
  <li>and many, many more.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can refer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_calling_conventions#List_of_x86_calling_conventions">this Wiki comparison</a> to see that there are
plenty of different conventions, each with its own nuances and pitfalls. 
And this is just a tiny part of the binary interface.</p>

<p>I believe a good analogy to understand ABI is to imagine a <strong>jigsaw puzzle</strong>.
Each function is a piece. Each piece has a different form, just like
functions have different type signatures. The whole program is a finished puzzle.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://azhpushkin.me/assets/images/python_c_abi/abi_intro.jpg" alt="">
    
</figure>

<p>Compilers are the ones who take care of ABI.
They generate machine code accordingly to specific rules and ensure
it is coherent. Thus, all function calls, memory layout rules, and other details
in generated executable work in the same way.</p>

<p>Check out this example:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>// example.c</span>
<span>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
</span> 
<span>int</span> <span>fibonacci</span><span>(</span><span>int</span><span>);</span>

<span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"10th fibonacci number is %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>fibonacci</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>));</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>gcc <span>-c</span> example.c <span>-o</span> example.o
<span>$ </span>gcc example.o <span>-ldullmath</span> <span>-o</span> example
<span>$ </span>./example
10th fibonacci number is 55
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>During the library compilation, GCC created machine code for fibonacci 
according to certain conventions. Then, it produced matching callee machine code
for <code>example.o</code>. As we used one and the same compiler, the same ABI was applied,
and the binaries matched.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://azhpushkin.me/assets/images/python_c_abi/callee_and_caller.jpg" alt="">
    
</figure>

<p>But what if we use different compilers?</p>

<hr color="#dddddd">

<p>The bad news is that <strong>there is no standardized ABI neither for C++ nor for C</strong>. Different compilers, or even <em>different versions of the same compiler</em>, can …</p></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
<h2 id="headline-1">
The Question
</h2>
<p>
A recent homework problem had us derive the parallel plate
capacitor<sup><a id="footnote-reference-1" href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup> equation for electrostatics. This gives the
capacitance of a parallel plate structure in terms of the plate area,
distance between the plates and relative permittivity. The equation
for this situation is:
</p>
<p>
$
C = \epsilon_{R}\epsilon_{0}\frac{A}{d}
$
</p>
<p>
After solving this problem for the analytical solution, I was curious
to see how closely the result matched a 3D field solver. Using the
Capacitance Extraction mode in Cadence 3D Workbench, I designed a
parametric model of the parallel plate capacitor with variable edge
length, distance and dielectric constant (See image above for the
model). Dk<sup><a id="footnote-reference-2" href="#footnote-2">2</a></sup> was varied but the complex component (dissipation factor)
was set to zero to ignore any dielectric losses. The edges were swept
at lengths of 0.1 inch, 1 inch and 10 inch. The distance was swept
with values of 1mil, 10mil and 100mil. Finally, the dielectric
constant was swept with values of 1, 10 and 100. This resulted in 27
unique cases, and the analytical result was compared to the extracted
result in each case.
</p>

</figure>


<h2 id="headline-2">
Results Analysis
</h2>
<p>
There are two interesting takeaways from the results. First, we see
much higher error when the area is not significantly larger than the
dielectric height. This is expected because the field solver will
correctly solve the fringe fields along the edges of the structure,
while the equation is only valid when $A &gt;&gt; d$. These fringe fields
result in a computed capacitance which is always higher than the
equation-based formula. The reason we see more accuracy with smaller
dielectric thickness is that the fringe fields do not extend very far
laterally from the structure in that case.  
</p>
<p>
The second major takeaway is that we see much better agreement between
simulation and equation when the dielectric constant is higher. The
better agreement here is likely due to the fact that the absolute
value of the capacitance is much higher, therefore an error of a few
$pF$ is still a smaller percentage variation.
</p>
<p>
If anyone's curious to play around with the 3D Workbench file, it's
available here:

<h2 id="headline-3">
Update (Oct. 4, 2020)
</h2>
<p>
I had a quick chance to investigate the electric field intensity
vectors while varying the dielectric constant. Below are cutaway plots
showing the electric field intensity within both the dielectric
material and surrounding air. Note that the scale is kept the same on
both plots for easier comparison.
</p>
<figure><a href="https://shielddigitaldesign.com/images/post/2020/cap_field_dk1.png">
    <img src="https://shielddigitaldesign.com/images/post/2020/cap_field_dk1.png" alt="Figure 2. Fringe electric field, $Dk = 1$." width="600"> </a><figcaption>
            <p><em>Figure 2. Fringe electric field, $Dk = 1$.</em></p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<figure><a href="https://shielddigitaldesign.com/images/post/2020/cap_field_dk100.png">
    <img src="https://shielddigitaldesign.com/images/post/2020/cap_field_dk100.png" alt="Figure 3. Fringe electric field, $Dk = 100$." width="600"> </a><figcaption>
            <p><em>Figure 3. Fringe electric field, $Dk = 100$.</em></p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>
One interesting feature seen from this comparison is that the field
intensity within the dielectric material is much stronger for lower
Dk. This makes perfect sense; in reference <sup><a id="footnote-reference-1" href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup>, we see that the
electric field magnitude can be represented using Gauss's Law<sup><a id="footnote-reference-3" href="#footnote-3">3</a></sup> as:
</p>
<p>
$
E = \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon}
$
</p>
<p>
Thus, reducing Dk will increase the electric field intensity. The
direction of the field can be seen as normal to the conductors, even
wrapping around the conductor edges. Since the effective Dk at the
edge is lower in Figure 2, the field intensity is higher out to a
further distance. What are the practical implications of this
characteristic? We know that in nearly all cases, lower Dk is
better since we can use wider traces for a given dielectric thickness
(resulting in lower skin effect losses).<sup><a id="footnote-reference-4" href="#footnote-4">4</a></sup> It also helps with
crosstalk since there will be lower capacitive coupling. Lastly, since
the flight time of a signal is inversely proportional to the square
root of Dk, a lower Dk will result in a longer flight time (in
$\frac{ps}{inch}$). This means that if you have to match two traces to
within a certain flight time, the physical trace length mismatch is
more forgiving with lower Dk material.
</p>
<p>
When would we want a higher Dk material? I can think of one very
important situation: power and ground planes. We can improve the
design of the power distribution network (PDN) with higher Dk
material, as well as using the thinnest dielectric possible between
these planes. In addition to increasing the capacitance of the PDN,
this arrangement will also reduce the inductance which will help with
ground bounce and extend the effective frequency range of the PDN. 
</p>
<p>
So, what can be done to reduce fringing fields along the edges of
PCBs? The 20H rule was once touted as a method of reducing these
fields. I believe one of the origins of the 20H rule may be this<sup><a id="footnote-reference-5" href="#footnote-5">5</a></sup>
set of guidelines (see the 7th bullet point). While this study did not
look into the effects of the 20H rule, many authors consider the 20H
rule to be a bit of a myth which has been confirmed by research.<sup><a id="footnote-reference-6" href="#footnote-6">6</a></sup>
Whether or not the power planes are recessed, I have always considered
an edge fence of ground vias to be an effective way to suppress fringe
fields around a board. Sounds like a great topic for follow-up
investigation!

<h2 id="1-hacking-physics-">1. Hacking physics <a id="sec-1" name="sec-1"></a></h2>

<p><em>Hacker spirit.</em> Nowadays, the word “hacker” conjures up visions of
Russian trolls, Julian Assange, and Angelina Jolie’s 90s pixie cut.
But a nobler usage predates this.
Hacker culture, in the original sense, grew out of places like MIT
in the 60s, with its tradition of highbrow silliness and elaborate technical pranks.
Although associated with programming, hacker spirit can be viewed as
a broader ethos about play, understanding and creativity.
In the words of open-source gnuru Richard Stallman,</p>

<p><span>
What [hackers] had in common was a love of excellence and
programming. They wanted to make the programs that they used be as
good as they could. They also wanted to make them do neat things. They
wanted to be able to do something in a more exciting way than anyone
believed possible and show ‘Look how wonderful this is. I bet you
didn’t believe this could be done.’
</span></p>

<p>Using techniques in a clever or unexpected way is a <em>hack</em>, with <em>hack
value</em> quantifying the degree of ingenuity. (“Hack” is actually a
back-formation of “hack value”.)
Hackers do not look for the most powerful, or obvious, or easy tool
for the job.
They delight in the unexpected, in using humble means to achieve
extraordinary ends.
In a way, they realise David Deutsch’s
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beginning_of_Infinity">definition</a>
of knowledge as
<em>information with causal power</em>.
Knowing a technique well enough to hack it means you can act on the world in new ways.</p>

<p>I think physics needs more hacker spirit: more people willing to fool
around and explore what our marvellous toolset can do, to creatively
defy expectations and push the Deutschian envelope.
Physics is not withouts its hackers but unlike computer
science, the hackers are colourful exceptions, tending towards
goofy irreverence and self-mythology
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_feynman">Richard Feynman</a>
springs to mind).
I think hacking should go mainstream.</p>

<p><em>Napkin hacks.</em> My goal in this post is to outline a few simple hacks
for the back of a napkin.
I think of these as algorithms for a napkin computer, and with some
practice, they really
can be implemented using high school algebra on a small piece of
paper, without calculus or calculators (though the latter save
time).
While there is whimsy and irreverence aplenty, our focus will be
<em>real physics</em>.
Our goal will be a beautiful proof of the existence of atoms, due to
none other than Albert Einstein, the greatest physics hacker of all.
Another running theme is rain, a tribute to my rainy city of residence,
Vancouver.</p>

<p>Hackery is not just about excellence and creativity for their own
sake, but has clear pedagogical implications.
Most people have to wait until grad school to compute viscous drag, estimate
urban power usage, or determine the size of the E. coli genome.
But imagine a world where high school students are so empowered that,
given a few hints, a pencil, and a napkin, they could discover it all
themselves.
This world is very close to ours: all we need is a little more hacker
spirit in the enjoyment and instruction of physics.</p>

<p><em>Notes.</em> This post really consists of three distinct tutorials.
The <a href="#sec-2">dimensional analysis tutorial</a> and <a href="#sec-3">section on Fermi estimates</a> can be
read independently. The <a href="#sec-4">last tutorial</a> on random
walks assumes you have read the dimensional analysis section.
The exercises are just as important as the text, but only the results
of <a href="#sec-2-3">Exercise 3</a>
and <a href="#sec-4-2">Exercise 14</a> are used subsequently.
Solutions, and various other technicalities, are collected

<p>We will start with one of the most powerful but underappreciated tools in
physics: <em>dimensional analysis</em>.
Physics is ultimately about experimental measurements.
Take some object, maybe an old pumpkin, and poke or prod it with a
measuring device.
The device returns a number, but that’s now what interests us;
instead, we want to know the <em>physical property</em> probed by that
device.
This is what we mean by <em>dimension</em>.
For instance, if we compare the width of the pumpkin to a ruler, the
dimension is the length, if we put it on some scales it’s the mass,
and if we time how long it takes to rot, the dimension is time.</p>

<p>We denote the dimension of length by $L$, time by $T$ and mass by
$M$.
We use brackets $[\cdot]$ to refer to the dimension of a measurement.
It’s easy when the measurement is given in some units, since we can
throw away the numbers and just ask: what aspect does the unit measure?
For instance,</p><p>

\[[20 \text{ cm}] = [\text{cm}]  = L, \quad [5 \text{ lb}]
=[\text{lb}] = M, \quad \quad [2 \text{ days}] =[\text{days}] = T.\]

</p><p>Centimetres measure length,
hours measure time, and pounds measure mass.
More complicated dimensions follow from the basic ones according to
simple rules which are easier to show than tell.
Area, for example, has dimensions $L^2$:</p><p>

\[[1 \text{ cm}^2] = [\text{cm}^2] = [\text{cm}]^2.\]

</p><p>An alternative to units is using general formulas, e.g. for the area of a rectangle:</p><p>

\[[\text{area}] = [\text{width}\times \text{height}] = [\text{width}]
\times [\text{height}] = L^2.\]

</p><p>Dimensions can be divided as well as multiplied:</p><p>

\[[\text{velocity}] = \left[\frac{\text{distance}}{\text{time}}\right] =
\frac{[\text{distance}]}{[\text{time}]} = \frac{L}{T}.\]

</p><p>Be careful: only measurements with the same dimensions can
be added and subtracted.
For instance, it makes no sense to ask what “$1$ cm + $4$ hours” is,
though it <em>is</em> sensible to compute “$1$ cm + $4$ feet”.</p>

<p>Physical laws tell us how measurements depend
on each other.
For example, Newton’s second law $F = ma$ tells us how measurements of
force, mass and acceleration are related.
If the two sides of $F = ma$ are equal, the dimensions must agree,
with</p><p>

\[[F] = [m a] = [m]\times \left[\frac{v}{t}\right] = \frac{ML}{T^2}.\]

</p><p>The point of dimensional analysis is that you can sometimes <em>reverse</em>
this process, and determine the physical laws from dimensions!
Let’s see how.</p>

<h3 id="21-pendulous-pumpkins-">2.1. Pendulous pumpkins <a id="sec-2-1" name="sec-2-1"></a></h3>

<p>Suppose we attach an old pumpkin to a length of string and give it a
kick.
Gravity will pull on the pumpkin, causing it to oscillate back and
forth with some period of oscillation $t$.
If we know how the period of oscillation depends on other properties
of the system, we can utilise this knowledge to make a pumpkin clock!
Let’s start by listing some relevant quantities:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the mass of the pumpkin $m$, with dimension $[m] = M$;</li>
  <li>the length of the string $\ell$, dimension $[\ell] = L$;</li>
  <li>gravitational acceleration $g = 9.8 \text{ m/s}^2$, dimension $[g] =
LT^{-2}$ (from the units);</li>
  <li>the initial displacement of the pumpkin $x$, dimension $[x] = L$.</li>
</ul>

<figure>
    <div><p><img src="https://hapax.github.io/images/posts/hacker3.png" width="30%"></p><figcaption><i>Physical features of the pendulous pumpkin.</i></figcaption>
	</div>
	</figure>

<p>Not all of these quantities will turn out to be relevant.
Galileo discovered that as long as the initial kick is
small, it has no affect on the period: pendulums are “isochronic”.
Grab a pumpkin, stopwatch and string, and check for yourself!
Galileo realised he could exploit this property to make a reliable
timepiece, and invented the pendulum clock.
(There is actually a deep physical reason pendulums are isochronic for
small kicks, but we will have to leave that for another time!)</p>

<p>In terms of relevant features, this leaves the pumpkin mass $m$, string length $\ell$, and gravity $g$.
You can also eliminate the pumpkin mass empirically, but as we’ll see,
we can leave it in and let dimensional analysis <em>tell us</em> it’s irrelevant.
At this point, I’m going to do something a bit sneaky.
Instead of period $t$, we will deal with the <em>angular velocity</em></p><p>

\[\omega = \frac{2\pi}{t}.\]

</p><p>(We will explain another way to get factors of $2\pi$ in Exercise 4.)
Dimensional analysis is nothing fancier than guessing that $\omega$ is related to $m$,
$\ell$ and $g$ by a relation of the form</p><p>

\[\omega = m^a \ell^b g^c,\]

</p><p>for some numbers $a$, $b$, and $c$.
Our goal is to figure out what these numbers are.
We can find the powers by matching dimensions on each side:</p><p>

\[\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{T} = [\omega] = [m^a \ell^c g^c] = \frac{M^aL^{b+c}}{T^{2c}}.
\end{align*}\]

</p><p>Requiring the leftmost and rightmost expressions to be equal, we can immediately read off the powers:</p><p>

\[a = 0, \quad 2c = 1, \quad b + c = 0 \quad \Longrightarrow \quad a =
0, \quad c = -b = \frac{1}{2}.\]

</p><p>As promised, dimensional analysis kindly informs us that the mass
is irrelevant!
My earlier piece of sneakiness (replacing period with angular
velocity) actually gives the exact answer for small kicks:</p><p>

\[\omega = m^a \ell^b g^c =  \sqrt{\frac{g}{\ell}}.\]

</p><p>We didn’t need to solve a differential equation, analyse forces, or even deal with numbers.
Dimensional analysis let us skip straight to the answer!</p>

<p>Suppose we want to make a pumpkin clock with the conventional
grandfather-clock period of $t = 2 \text{
s}$, so that each half swing takes
one second.
Then we should suspend the old pumpkin from a string of length</p><p>

\[\ell = \frac{g}{\omega^2} = \frac{g t^2}{(2\pi)^2} = \frac{9.8 \text{
m}}{\pi^2} \approx 1
\text{ m}.\]

</p><p>Incidentally, this explains why grandfather clocks are so large.
They will house a large (typically non-curcurbitar) pendulum with
$\ell \approx 1$ m.</p>

<p>In order to make the clock, we need a ruler to measure out the length
of string.
But for maximal whimsy, we can switch things up, and turn a stopwatch,
pumpkin and spool into a ruler!
Measure with the string and snip off the corresponding length, attach
the pumpkin and gently wobble.

<p>This document is a set of guidelines for using C++ well.
The aim of this document is to help people to use modern C++ effectively.
By “modern C++” we mean effective use of the ISO C++ standard (currently C++17, but almost all of our recommendations also apply to C++14 and C++11).
In other words, what would you like your code to look like in 5 years’ time, given that you can start now? In 10 years’ time?</p>

<p>The guidelines are focused on relatively high-level issues, such as interfaces, resource management, memory management, and concurrency.
Such rules affect application architecture and library design.
Following the rules will lead to code that is statically type safe, has no resource leaks, and catches many more programming logic errors than is common in code today.
And it will run fast – you can afford to do things right.</p>

<p>We are less concerned with low-level issues, such as naming conventions and indentation style.
However, no topic that can help a programmer is out of bounds.</p>

<p>Our initial set of rules emphasizes safety (of various forms) and simplicity.
They may very well be too strict.
We expect to have to introduce more exceptions to better accommodate real-world needs.
We also need more rules.</p>

<p>You will find some of the rules contrary to your expectations or even contrary to your experience.
If we haven’t suggested you change your coding style in any way, we have failed!
Please try to verify or disprove rules!
In particular, we’d really like to have some of our rules backed up with measurements or better examples.</p>

<p>You will find some of the rules obvious or even trivial.
Please remember that one purpose of a guideline is to help someone who is less experienced or coming from a different background or language to get up to speed.</p>

<p>Many of the rules are designed to be supported by an analysis tool.
Violations of rules will be flagged with references (or links) to the relevant rule.
We do not expect you to memorize all the rules before trying to write code.
One way of thinking about these guidelines is as a specification for tools that happens to be readable by humans.</p>

<p>The rules are meant for gradual introduction into a code base.
We plan to build tools for that and hope others will too.</p>

<p>Comments and suggestions for improvements are most welcome.
We plan to modify and extend this document as our understanding improves and the language and the set of available libraries improve.</p>



<p>This is a set of core guidelines for modern C++ (currently C++17) taking likely future enhancements and ISO Technical Specifications (TSs) into account.
The aim is to help C++ programmers to write simpler, more efficient, more maintainable code.</p>

<h2 id="intarget-target-readership"><a name="SS-readers"></a>In.target: Target readership</h2>

<p>All C++ programmers. This includes <a href="#S-cpl">programmers who might consider C</a>.</p>

<h2 id="inaims-aims"><a name="SS-aims"></a>In.aims: Aims</h2>

<p>The purpose of this document is to help developers to adopt modern C++ (currently C++17) and to achieve a more uniform style across code bases.</p>

<p>We do not suffer the delusion that every one of these rules can be effectively applied to every code base. Upgrading old systems is hard. However, we do believe that a program that uses a rule is less error-prone and more maintainable than one that does not. Often, rules also lead to faster/easier initial development.
As far as we can tell, these rules lead to code that performs as well or better than older, more conventional techniques; they are meant to follow the zero-overhead principle (“what you don’t use, you don’t pay for” or “when you use an abstraction mechanism appropriately, you get at least as good performance as if you had handcoded using lower-level language constructs”).
Consider these rules ideals for new code, opportunities to exploit when working on older code, and try to approximate these ideals as closely as feasible.
Remember:</p>

<h3 id="in0-dont-panic"><a name="R0"></a>In.0: Don’t panic!</h3>

<p>Take the time to understand the implications of a guideline rule on your program.</p>

<p>These guidelines are designed according to the “subset of superset” principle (<a href="#Stroustrup05">Stroustrup05</a>).
They do not simply define a subset of C++ to be used (for reliability, safety, performance, or whatever).
Instead, they strongly recommend the use of a few simple “extensions” (<a href="#S-gsl">library components</a>)
that make the use of the most error-prone features of C++ redundant, so that they can be banned (in our set of rules).</p>

<p>The rules emphasize static type safety and resource safety.
For that reason, they emphasize possibilities for range checking, for avoiding dereferencing <code>nullptr</code>, for avoiding dangling pointers, and the systematic use of exceptions (via RAII).
Partly to achieve that and partly to minimize obscure code as a source of errors, the rules also emphasize simplicity and the hiding of necessary complexity behind well-specified interfaces.</p>

<p>Many of the rules are prescriptive.
We are uncomfortable with rules that simply state “don’t do that!” without offering an alternative.
One consequence of that is that some rules can be supported only by heuristics, rather than precise and mechanically verifiable checks.
Other rules articulate general principles. For these more general rules, more detailed and specific rules provide partial checking.</p>

<p>These guidelines address the core of C++ and its use.
We expect that most large organizations, specific application areas, and even large projects will need further rules, possibly further restrictions, and further library support.
For example, hard-real-time programmers typically can’t use free store (dynamic memory) freely and will be restricted in their choice of libraries.
We encourage the development of such more specific rules as addenda to these core guidelines.
Build your ideal small foundation library and use that, rather than lowering your level of programming to glorified assembly code.</p>

<p>The rules are designed to allow <a href="#S-modernizing">gradual adoption</a>.</p>

<p>Some rules aim to increase various forms of safety while others aim to reduce the likelihood of accidents, many do both.
The guidelines aimed at preventing accidents often ban perfectly legal C++.
However, when there are two ways of expressing an idea and one has shown itself a common source …</p></div></div>
