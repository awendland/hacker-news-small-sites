<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Generating APIs is becoming more and more popular. Especially the GraphQL community is "suffering" from this trend.
Production-ready APIs with authentication and caching in minutes, define the schema, and you're almost done.
As we all know, everything comes at a cost.
This post takes a critical look at generated GraphQL APIs, the benefits as well as the tradeoffs you're going to make.</p><h2>History and Trends<a href="#history-and-trends" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Generated GraphQL APIs look like a hot trend nowadays. Some venture backed companies push this topic hard to make it mainstream.
We hear praises of the amazing developer experience and how productive people are.
However, is this really a sustainable business?</p><p>If we look back a few years you might remember the term "Backend as a Service" (BaaS), established by companies like Parse.
The impact of parse, nowadays seems to be diminished. A lot of others jumped on the BaaS train, but except Firebase, you don't hear much on the topic nowadays.</p><p>Then came GraphQL and companies tried the same thing again.
If we look at the graveyard of failed companies you might find some familiar names like Reindex, Graphcool, etc...</p><p>Today, we have tools like Appsync and Hasura leading the pack, followed by many smaller companies who imitate them and try to diversify in various ways.</p><p>Appsync might be an outlier because their goal is not only BaaS but making AWS products easy to integrate, which is a different value proposition than their competition.</p><p>Another emerging trend is (Serverless) Databases as a Service.
dgraph offers a native GraphQL Database.
FaunaDB offers a Serverless Database which also comes with a GraphQL interface.
Then there's edgeDB which also offers a GraphQL interface.
I guess if you search for a while you'll find more.</p><p>Another quite popular category is Content Management Systems with GraphQL APIs.
The distinction from just BaaS is that these tools allow non-technical people to create content while developers can consume the content via GraphQL APIs.</p><p>How comes that the idea of BaaS/generated APIs keeps coming up while most of the implementations fail?</p><p>We might be able to look back in time to better understand why this approach is failing.
If you ask Prisma, the makers of Graphcool, they refer to this tweet:</p><blockquote><p>Exposing the database schema 1:1 via a generated graphql api totally misses the point of graphql - or an api as an intended abstraction.</p><p>-- <cite>Manuel Schoebel</cite></p></blockquote><p>We'll come back to this citation later.</p><h2>Developer experience of generated APIs<a href="#developer-experience-of-generated-apis" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>One feature of generated APIs you cannot deny is the developer experience.
If you're an experienced Full-Stack developer you're able to start new projects in minutes.
Spin up a database, define the schema, API done. You're now able to start building the frontend.</p><p>Some of the services allow you to build the schema using a user interface only.
This allows even less experienced Frontend developers to build their own "APIs".
You click a few buttons and your API with authentication is ready to use.</p><p>But what about maintenance?
How do you evolve applications built using this approach?
What if you don't just have one API consumer?</p><p>Let's have a look at possible use cases.</p><h2>Use cases of generated APIs<a href="#use-cases-of-generated-apis" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Generating APIs can be an amazing time-saver if you're a single developer, working on a small project.
You don't have to expose the API to other developers. It's just you using them.
You understand the tradeoffs, e.g. leaking some business logic into the client.
You're still happy because you saved a lot of time not having to build a backend.</p><p>Another good example where generated APIs can be very helpful is prototyping.
You want to bring an idea to life. You don't care about the quality of your API.
All you need is some CRUD methods to demonstrate an application to a prospect.</p><p>What about larger teams and projects? Are generated APIs also a good fit for enterprise use cases?</p><p>In order to answer this question, let's first have a look at what an API is.</p><h2>What is an API?<a href="#what-is-an-api" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>I'll not go into much detail of this topic, as I want to stay focused.
If you're interested to learn more about what an API is, I can highly recommend Erik Wilde <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDYeU2T4v2o" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">talking about the topic</a>.</p><p>Too long, didn't watch:</p><p>An API is an interface, abstracting away an implementation of a contract.
In Eriks example, he explains how a weather forecast company exposes their forecasts through an API to other developers.</p><p>GraphQL is a Query language, offering one way of implementing APIs.</p><p>APIs make integrations scalable because we can rely on standards and don't have to understand every detail of a system.
E.g. if an API speaks GraphQL, clients know already how to interact with the system.
We can understand the API by issuing an introspection Query and from there on use the Queries and Mutations defined in the GraphQL schema.</p><p>Without tools like GraphQL, we had to invent custom contracts and integration tooling for every API.</p><p>One important aspect of the success of an API is its design.
APIs must be able to cover common use cases of API consumers.
E.g. a weather API is useless if it's almost impossible to get forecasts for the next few days in a very easy way.</p><p>Next, we'll look into API design to further understand why generated APIs don't scale.</p><h2>On good API design<a href="#on-good-api-design" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Going back to the weather forecast service, we talked about success factors of the API.
An API can also be seen as a product as it serves a specific purpose.</p><p>How can a weather forecast API be successful?
As with any other product, you have to talk to your users and adapt to their needs.
You have to re-shape your product to serve your customers well.</p><p>In case of an API, re-shaping means finding a good API design.</p><p>And with that, we're at the core of the problem of generated APIs.</p><p>It's impossible to design an API when all you do is deriving it from e.g. database tables.
A good API is not just making raw data accessible. A good API is driven by use cases, making it easy to integrate.
It doesn't have to be a public facing API. If you're providing an API to other developers it should be designed around their use-cases.
Deriving APIs from database schemas, tables or whatever it is means, you're not designing, you're not focussing on your users.</p><p>The consequences are well described by Erik:</p><blockquote><p>If you're designing an API by avoiding designing it, you end up with the design you deserve.</p><p>-- <cite>Erik Wilde</cite></p></blockquote><p>If you skip the design phase, you'll end up with unhappy users.
If your company depends on the success of your APIs, this could be a deal breaker.</p><p>Imagine you're an engineer and your task is to build a new steering wheel for a car.
You'll take the whole description of the CAN-BUS (internal communication system) description of the car and "generate" a panel of knobs from it.
This steering wheel might have thousands of buttons and is barely usable.</p><p>Wouldn't it make more sense to figure out how people would want to steer a car?
What knobs they need on it to control the radio without losing control of the car?
Once you have figured out the requirements you could then start mocking a few designs.
With those designs you'd then go to users and test if they work they way you expect.
You'll then iterate your ideas until you find a good design.
Only then, you'll actually build a real steering wheel.
One that you're confident will solve the problem of your user.</p><p>What's different from a steering wheel and the API of your service?
Why is it not obvious that generated APIs don't solve the problem.</p><p>You'd be much faster generating a steering wheel because you don't have to spend time designing and implementing it.
If you're the only user of your steering wheel, this might work because you know all about CAN-BUS systems.
However, this approach won't scale if you want to build APIs for other teams and companies.</p><h2>Information hiding principle<a href="#information-hiding-principle" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Another important aspect of APIs is abstraction and information hiding.</p><p>API consumers should not have to think about the implementation.
But what if the API is leaking implementation details?</p><p>Let's have a look at this simple example:</p><p>Even if the language is GraphQL, it's clear that we're talking to a relational database and SQL is used behind the scenes.</p><p>Should an API consumer have to think about primary keys? Isn't that a concern of storing data, a completely different layer?</p><p>How about JSON selectors as arguments?</p><p>Isn't the implementation leaking information on how data is being stored?</p><p>Here's another example where GraphQL is being abused as an ORM.</p><p>The consequence of these examples is that it's almost impossible to make changes to the implementation.</p><p>Developers who know some basics on databases might see another problem with this approach.
In case of complex WHERE clauses (hello SQL) or aggregations, you have to make sure that the required indices exist on the database.
Otherwise, you'll run into full table scan problems.</p><p>I think it's clear that all these examples violate the principle of information hiding.</p><h2>Implementing APIs<a href="#implementing-apis" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>In the very beginning, we were looking at the developer experience of generated APIs and how much time you can save by not implementing the API but generating it.
We then learned that generated APIs generally don't scale well beyond personal projects because they are not driven by use cases.</p><p>Now, let's have a look at what actually makes a good API implementation.</p><p>A good API implementation decouples the API contract from data storage and other aspects like e.g. authentication.
A good API implementation allows you to change how you store data without breaking the API contract.
A good API also allows you to easily evolve and extend the contract for new use cases.
These three requirements are impossible to accomplish with generated APIs that are tightly coupled to infrastructure.</p><p>But there's one additional component that tops all of them: Business logic or state machines.
A good API doesn't force API consumers to implement their own state machine to interpret the data of the API.
Forcing API consumers to interpret raw data and derive state is prone to errors and should be avoided.</p><p>Let's have a closer look at state machines.</p><h2>State …</h2></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
	

	<p>Open source licenses are in the news again. Elastic recently <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/licensing-change" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">changed the licensing for ElasticSearch and Kibana</a> from Apache 2.0 to a choice of <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/licensing/server-side-public-license" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Server Side Public License</a> (SSPL) or the non-open source Elastic license. Like most open source licensing changes, this one prompted a lot of discussion. Examples <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25776657" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25833781" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> include some of the more printable comments.&nbsp;</p><p>But we’re not here to discuss Elastic’s business model or their choice of license(s).&nbsp; We’re here to discuss ClickHouse licensing and Altinity’s view of it. Here’s the executive summary.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>ClickHouse is Apache 2.0.&nbsp; Altinity is committed to ensuring it stays that way.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Our contributions to ClickHouse are<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_License" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Apache 2.0</a>. Our ecosystem projects like the ClickHouse Kubernetes operator are likewise Apache 2.0. We believe the Apache 2.0 license is best for our users. It’s also the best way to make ClickHouse the most popular SQL data warehouse on the planet. There are several reasons for our outlook.&nbsp;</p><p>The most important feature of Apache 2.0 is that it allows use for any purpose, which is the first of the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">four essential freedoms</a> of open source software. Such freedom is important for all applications, regardless of whether they run on-prem or as cloud services. Apache 2.0 opens the door to imaginative new services as well as creative paths to develop them. Installed&nbsp;applications morph into online services. Services that hide data behind APIs morph into open data. This freedom is key to enabling innovative new ways to incorporate analytics into applications, which in turn unlocks new business opportunities.&nbsp;</p><p>Apache 2.0 is also a great license for contributors.&nbsp; It has been around since 2004, which is a long time in open source. Corporate legal departments understand it and can easily approve contributions from employees. Individual contributors understand the freedom Apache 2.0 confers to publish their work and use it freely in future. It’s a win-win: companies are motivated to make investment decisions in open source projects, and contributors are motivated to implement them.&nbsp;</p><p>Apache 2.0 licensing opens a path to increasing ClickHouse capabilities and worldwide use. More important, it is enabling a flood of innovation in analytic applications. In a crowded market with many database products besides ClickHouse, that’s a critical competitive advantage.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 id="h-apache-2-0-creates-a-level-playing-field">Apache 2.0 creates a level playing field</h2>
</p><p>Since the ClickHouse Apache 2.0 license places no restriction on business use, we can expect many competing services that leverage ClickHouse in one way or another.&nbsp; This includes hosted ClickHouse and value-added analytic services built on top of ClickHouse capabilities. It also extends to add-ons for countless existing services ranging from web analytics to network flow log management to financial asset valuation and everything in between.</p><p>The competition will be distressing for unprepared vendors, but it’s great for users. Competing services mean that users have alternatives. It also means that innovation is not random but focused on things that users care about: SQL features, performance, security, cost-efficiency, and time to market.&nbsp;</p><p>The same vendors that offer ClickHouse managed services have contributed popular features to ClickHouse like <a href="https://altinity.com/blog/clickhouse-and-s3-compatible-object-storage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">S3 storage integration</a>, <a href="https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/operations/access-rights/#role-management" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Role-based Access Control</a>, <a href="https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/select/with/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Common Table Expressions</a>, and many more. ClickHouse is experiencing the same <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coopetition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">co-opetition</a> feedback effect that helped fuel the success of Linux, Kubernetes, PostgreSQL, and other open source projects.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 id="h-restrictive-licenses-like-sspl-are-antithetical-to-user-interests">Restrictive licenses like SSPL are antithetical to user interests</h2>
</p><p>The Server Side Public License is an attempt to set back the clock on open source software development. It rules out new SaaS offerings based on projects whose value&nbsp;</p><div><blockquote>
<p>…entirely or primarily derives from the value of the Program or modified version, or offering a service that accomplishes for users the primary purpose of the Program or modified version.&nbsp; (SSPL Section 13).&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
</div><p>The goal of the SSPL and similar licenses is nothing short of setting up monopoly providers of SaaS offerings. It has ambiguous terms–creating uncertainty for potential competitors–and onerous viral requirements. Services that fall under Section 13 must release all source code required to run the entire SaaS offering. That includes everything from the service management plane down to deployment and backup scripts. SSPL is <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/copyleft.en.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">copyleft</a> with fangs.&nbsp;</p><p>This obviously affects vendors trying to set up competing services to the copyright holders of SSPL projects. But the effect on the market is far wider.&nbsp; Analytics are pervasive in modern applications and SaaS is the primary way that software is now distributed. The SSPL potentially harms any user building an application who just wants a managed offering to take care of running it. We believe that’s an unacceptable limitation.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 id="h-but-wait-what-about-amazon">But wait, what about Amazon?</h2>
</p><p>Many vendors have justified <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/16/mongodb-switches-up-its-open-source-license/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open source relicensing as a necessary defense</a> against “strip mining” from public clouds. Aren’t we afraid of this ourselves? If so, it’s a bit late. There are already multiple cloud services for ClickHouse, including our own offering, <a href="https://altinity.com/cloud-database/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Altinity.Cloud</a>. There’s also <a href="https://cloud.yandex.com/services/managed-clickhouse" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yandex.Cloud</a> and at least three services in China. New entrants need to compete by adding additional value, <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2020/07/08/suse-acquires-rancher-labs-reported-600m-chases-1b-revenue-goal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just as Rancher did</a> in the Apache 2.0-licensed Kubernetes market.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Our goal at Altinity is to help customers bring high-value analytic applications to market quickly and operate them cost-effectively. We focus on development efficiency, data privacy, world-class support, and operations. We do so on all platforms, both public cloud and on-prem. Anybody who has worked on such services knows there’s opportunity here to build many valuable companies, not just one.&nbsp;</p><p>Other paths are possible. Vendors may fork ClickHouse and try to add licenses that create a proprietary fortress. If so, we would point to some friendly advice from a famous competitive analyst of the Italian Renaissance:&nbsp;</p><div><blockquote>
<p><em>So the best fortress that exists is to avoid being hated by the people. If you have fortresses and the people hate you, they will not save you</em>.</p>
<p><cite><em>Niccolo Machiavelli, The Prince</em></cite></p></blockquote>
</div><p>We don’t want to build new fortresses to protect ourselves against our users. We want to tear them down. Apache 2.0 is the key to enabling a new generation of analytic applications based on ClickHouse. Altinity is all in.&nbsp;</p><p>P.S., If you are worried about ElasticSearch and Kibana switching licenses, this might be a nice time to look at alternatives. ClickHouse can store log data remarkably well. More on that in future articles.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>A close look at the psychology of wine, how marketing affects your perceptions, and why you’re paying too much for wine.</em></p>



<p>In 2002, four Wall Street businessmen sat down for dinner at the Balthazar in New York City. They ordered a Mouton Rothschild 1989 for the table.</p>



<p>The Balthazar menu lists this wine at $2,000. It’s not hard to see why. The Mouton Rothschild 1989 is an exceptional wine, produced from grapes grown on 205 acres near Pauillac, just northwest of Bordeaux. At the time the grapes were grown, the vineyard was owned by Philippine de Rothschild, a member of the infamous Rothschild family at the center of banking in Europe from the eighteenth century onward. According to the <a href="https://www.liz-palmer.com/wine-review-chateau-mouton-rothschild-1989/">tasting notes</a> of Liz Palmer, the noted wine critic, the Mouton Rothschild 1989 is “a lovely Pauillac that has reached its plateau of maturity; notably dark ruby in colour; It has an engaging cedar and tobacco bouquet with hints of mint; not much fruit concentration; the palate follows suit – is medium-bodied and continues the aromatic theme of cedar and tobacco; demonstrates great persistence; well-defined – ‘old school’.” At a tasting in 2018, Jane Anson, the Bordeaux correspondent for <em>Decanter </em>magazine, gave it 97 points out of a possible 100.</p>



<p>That was the wine they ordered.</p>



<p>But it wasn’t the wine they got.</p>



<p>Instead, their server brought them an $18 Pinot Noir.</p>



<p>There had been a mix-up. The staff had poured the two wines into two decanters and sent the wrong decanter to the table.</p>



<p>Five minutes later, the restaurant manager rushed to their table to explain what had happened.</p>



<p>How did they these businessmen react? With incredulity, that a restaurant could make such a costly mistake? That their dinner had been ruined?</p>



<p>Nope.</p>



<p>Though they suspected what they were drinking wasn’t the wine they had ordered, they didn’t realize they were drinking an $18 Pinot Noir.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, a few tables away, the beneficiaries of the mistake—a couple who ordered the $18 Pinot Noir—didn’t realize it, either. In fact, as they unknowingly drank the $2,000 Mouton Rothschild 1989 they “jokingly pretended to be drinking an expensive wine.”<span id="easy-footnote-1-65224613"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-65224613" title="Mercer, C. (2020) NY restaurant couple mistakenly served $2000 Mouton 1989 after ordering $18 Pinot. <em>Decanter</em>. October 22, 2020."><sup>1</sup></a></span></p>



<p>How could this have happened?</p>



<p>Not the mistake in the kitchen: the swapped decanters, the wrong wine at the wrong tables.</p>



<p>The real mistake was a mistake in perception: that an $18 Pinot Noir and a $2,000 Mouton Rothschild 1989 could be confused in the first place.</p>



<p>In today’s post, we’re going to take a deep dive into the world of expensive wine. We’ll see if expensive wine really tastes better or if the mix-up at the Balthazar was a one-off mistake. We’ll explore the ways price signals quality. We’ll look at how expectations influence perceptions. And we’ll finish with a definitive guide to buying great wine.</p>



<p>Sometimes you can answer a question with a statement supported by data, science, and story.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The answer to the question—<em>does expensive wine really taste better?</em>—is not such an answer. Instead, this answer is a series of layers, each one more complicated than the last, and each one introducing a new set of questions—and a new set of revelations about taste, status, and perception.</p>



<h2>People can’t tell the difference between expensive wine and cheap wine</h2>



<p>When people don’t know the price, they like cheap wine just as much as expensive wine.&nbsp;Between April 2007 and February 2008, Robin Goldstein and his colleagues conducted 6,175 blind tests with 506 participants tasting 523 wines that ranged in price from $1.65 to $150.00 per bottle. About 12% of the participants had taken a sommelier course or had some kind of training. The test was double-blind: neither the person drinking the wine nor the person serving the wine knew the price. After each taste, participants rated it either “Bad,” Okay,” “Good,” or “Great.” Goldstein found that, on the whole, people actually gave <em>higher </em>ratings for cheap wine than expensive wine. However, compared to non-experts, the experts rated expensive wine more favorably. It seems that everyone likes cheap wine more than expensive wine, though experts are better at rating expensive wines compared to non-experts.<span id="easy-footnote-2-65224613"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-2-65224613" title="Goldstein, R., Almenberg, J., Dreber, A., Emerson, J.

<p>Other blind tastings have produced the same results. In 2011, Johan Almenberg and Anna Dreber of the Stockholm School of Economics had 135 people rate a $40 wine and 131 people rate a $5 wine, both on a scale of 1 to 100. They split the tasters into three groups:</p>

<p>Of this third group, people rated the cheap wine a 60.0 and the expensive wine a 58.5.

<p>For many people, a $40 wine sounds expensive. But for others, such as sommeliers, wine critics, and others, a $40 wine is still well below the threshold of what a great wine should cost. What if we compare a $40 wine (expensive to some, but cheap to others) to a $400 or $4,000 wine? In 2013, Vanessa Harrar and her colleagues conducted a blind tasting of seven sparkling wines, including six Champagnes. There were fifteen tasters, including four who considered themselves experts and five who considered themselves novices. This tasting, too, revealed no correlation between price and rating. Cheap Champagnes taste better than expensive Champagnes. In fact, of the wines sampled, the lowest rating was a Perrier-Jouët Belle Epoque Blanc de Blanc 2002, priced at £400; while the highest rated wines were a Mumm Vintage 2004 (£40) and a Perrier-Jouet Belle Epoque 2004 (£100). It seems that not only do cheap wines taste the same as expensive wines, but expensive wines taste the same as <em>very</em> expensive wines, too. <span id="easy-footnote-4-65224613"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-4-65224613" title="Harrar, V., Smith, B., Deroy, O. et al.

<p>Follow-up studies confirmed this. The next year, Robert H. Ashton published the results of his tasting session in the <em>Journal of Wine Economics</em>. In his study, 48 people, all members of a wine appreciation club at Duke University, tasted six wines each. They rated each wine on a scale of 1 to 10. As before, people thought the cheaper wines tasted better. In fact, in one of the tastings, the most expensive wine (a $119 bottle) was ranked a 3.70 and the cheapest wine (a $22 bottle) was ranked a 4.00.<span id="easy-footnote-5-65224613"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-5-65224613" title="Ashton, R.

<p>These and numerous other studies point in the same direction: in blind taste tests, people can’t distinguish cheap wine from expensive wine.</p>



<h2>People can’t tell the difference between two wines</h2>



<p>There’s a deeper issue, though. The real reason people can’t distinguish expensive wine from cheap wine is because they can’t distinguish <em>any </em>wine from <em>any other</em> wine—at least at rates that are no better than chance. In a series of two tastings, Roman Weil, the former co-chairman of the Oenonomy Society of the US, poured two wines into four glasses: one wine split between two glasses and the other wine split between the other two glasses. Then, he took one of the four glasses away, and served the remaining three glasses in the tasting. Thus, two of the three glasses were poured from the same bottle, and one of the three glasses from its own bottle. (If this is getting confusing, scroll down to the image.) Weil asked people to identify which two were the same and which one was different.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How did people do?</p>



<p>Not great.</p>



<p>In the first tasting, people identified the wines from the same vintage only 41.5% of the time. That’s not very good when you consider that people would correctly pick the two wines from the same bottle 33.3% of the time if they made decisions at random: there are three glasses, so picking the two of three glasses at random would be correct 1 in 3 times. <span id="easy-footnote-6-65224613"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-6-65224613" title="Weil, R.L. (2001). Parker v. Prial: The death of the vintage chart. <em>Chance</em>, 14, 27–3"><sup>6</sup></a></span></p>



<p>Weil’s second tasting produced similar results. This time, Weil had 395 people compare 855 pairs of regular wines and reserve wines, which are usually produced from superior grapes. People correctly identified only 346 of the 855 pairs, or roughly 40.5% of pairs, compared to the 33.3% that would be expected from random chance. Then, in a final step, Weil asked the 346 people who got it right to tell him which wine was the regular wine, and which wine was the reserve—the purportedly better wine. Of the 346 people, 170 people (49.1%) preferred the regular wine and 176 (50.9%) preferred the reserve—rates that are virtually the same as picking one of the wines at random (50.0%).<span id="easy-footnote-7-65224613"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-7-65224613" title="Weil, R.L.

<p>Weil’s studies show that people can tell two wines apart at rates that are barely better than chance (1 in 3) , and when they can, they pick the better wine at rates equal to chance (1 in 2).</p>



<p>Wine is an acquired taste. It takes time, training, and practice to tell good wine from bad (which could, itself, be evidence that great wine isn’t objectively great, though I digress). Perhaps expert tasters would perform better?</p>



<p>Unfortunately not. Professionals don’t do any better than novices: even people who are trained to taste, describe, and recommend wine for a living—and whose recommendations carry enormous weight within the industry and beyond—can’t tell one wine from another in a blind test. One of the first studies to reveal these inconsistencies took place at the wine competition of the California State Fair between 2005 and 2008. The competition is the oldest in the United States, and its judges include, “winemakers, wine buyers, wine critics and professors of enology and viticulture,” according to Robert T. Hodgson, the retired statistics professor and 35-year owner of the Fieldbrook Winery in California who conducted the study. Wineries are happy to pay more than $1 million collectively in entry fees to have their wine judged at the fair, since a gold medal awarded by judges at the fair can propel an unknown wine to the top of the market.<span id="easy-footnote-8-65224613"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-8-65224613" title="Hodgson, R.T.

<p>Typically, judges at the state fair taste between four and six flights of wine per day, and each flight contains 30 wines. However, Hodgson served them a second flight that contained …</p></div></article></div>

			<p><span>T</span>his past summer, my wife and I ventured to an area near Mount Adams in southwestern Washington state to census bumblebees. We camped there over the weekend as we took part in the Pacific Northwest Bumblebee Atlas survey. Scientists want to fill gaps in their knowledge about the bees. Learning about the relative number of different species, and their floral resources over a broad area, provides invaluable information, particularly when some species are in decline. I was helping to determine where conservation efforts may be needed. Survey participants choose a territory where they capture and photograph bumblebees on two occasions. I still marvel at the variety in the photos we took—bees with coloration incorporating rusty bands of hair, black stubby hairs, white patches, orange bands, and a brilliant, lemon-yellow covering of long hairs. <a href="https://nautil.us/issue/90/something-green/the-fungal-evangelist-who-would-save-the-bees" target="_blank">Bumblebees</a> are really quite beautiful when observed more closely.</p><figure data-alt="Hainze_BREAKER"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/18113_ca9eac0c76de0cab71d5b50951fe4c5f.png" width="733" alt=""><figcaption><span><strong>FIGHT OF THE BUMBLEBEE:</strong> A 2017 global study found that one-third of assessed bumblebee species were in decline. The U.S. is studying whether to place the western bumblebee on the endangered species list.</span><span>Stephen Ausmus, USDA ARS / Wikimedia</span></figcaption></figure><p>There is some risk involved, of course. Bumblebees have a painful sting and, unlike the honeybee, with its barbed stinger, the sharp, smooth bumblebee stinger can sting multiple times. Insect stings may serve two purposes. The first is to incapacitate prey. The second is to ward off predators. Bumblebees feed solely on pollen and flower nectar. So they would not sting to subdue prey. A bumblebee nest full of honey and nearly immobile larvae, though, is highly attractive to predators. The bumblebee sting is a weapon used for defense—a mechanism to escape predation from animals that may be 50,000 to 100,000 times their size.<sup>1</sup> And judging by the way most people respond, it works pretty well. The sting of the honeybee has been used as a reference point by sting pain connoisseur, Justin Schmidt. He rates the bumblebee and <a href="https://nautil.us/issue/3/in-transit/tracking-honeybees-to-save-them" target="_blank">honeybee</a> stings as a pedestrian 2 on his scale of 1-4.<sup>2</sup> But that’s a sufficient wallop for people to keep their distance from these bees—and that’s the way the bees like it.<br></p><p>The unparalleled success of insects as a group of organisms results from their ability to escape existential threats. They’re escape artists. They’ve evolved multiple means of eluding the larger animals that endanger them—by stinging, biting, flying, jumping, running, startling, hiding in crevices, and using camouflage as well as chemical defenses. Yet these masters at evading far larger animals face a threat more pernicious than predation today. The resulting decline in the number of insects and in the number of insect species is increasingly well documented. Why should this be alarming? Insects play significant roles as food or in the growth of food for many organisms, including human beings. Insects are also recyclers, decomposing plant matter and animal dung and contributing to the organic content of soils.</p><blockquote><p>It’s not all honey and butterflies in our relationship with insects.</p> </blockquote><p>It’s been said that if human beings disappeared, we would not be missed. Insects and other organisms would thrive. Yet we and many other animals <a href="https://nautil.us/issue/73/play/we-need-insects-more-than-they-need-us" target="_blank">would not survive were insects to disappear</a>. The plight of the island marble butterfly (<i>Euchloe ausonides insulanis</i>) and the western bumblebee (<i>Bombus occidentalis</i>) exemplify the multiple stressors on insect survival in the <a href="https://nautil.us/issue/90/something-green/dawn-of-the-heliocene" target="_blank">Anthropocene</a>, the proposed name for a new epoch in which human-generated change outstrips the effect of natural forces on the Earth. What responsibilities, if any, do we bear toward these insects? And what can each of us do to stem the tide of global insect decline?<br></p><p>In my recent book, <i>Nature Underfoot</i>, I argue that we crush, poison, and destroy insects and their habitat at our own peril. Yet reasons for acting to prevent insect decline run much deeper than self-interest. Humans cause habitat loss, produce pesticides, and import non-native species. We bear, according to certain strands of philosophical and religious thought, responsibility for the catastrophic losses insects experience today. Some say that insects have moral value since they strive to achieve their ends, just as we and other animals do. Others argue that insects have <a href="https://nautil.us/issue/72/quandary/human-exceptionalism-stifles-progress" target="_blank">moral value as a part of God’s creation</a>. Scientists point to the value of insects in global ecosystems, or the value implied by tens or hundreds of thousands of years involved in the evolution of an insect species.</p><p><span>T</span>he insect apocalypse has captured headlines, but the situation is more nuanced than that. Scientists find an increase in the overall numbers of arthropods in the Arctic, but a decline in diversity. Certain habitats in the Arctic are also affected more than others.<sup>3</sup> In Puerto Rico, insect declines initially attributed to climate change may have resulted instead from hurricanes.<sup>4</sup> Some insect species have even increased in numbers—mainly those that are tolerant of human activities or that benefit from associating with humans or from <a href="https://nautil.us/issue/78/atmospheres/is-net-zero-emissions-an-impossible-goal" target="_blank">climate change</a>.</p><p>Despite that, the general trend is negative as climate change, habitat destruction (in the form of deforestation, urbanization, and <a href="https://nautil.us/issue/66/clockwork/herbicide-is-whats-for-dinner" target="_blank">intensification of agriculture</a>), and pesticides take their toll. These forces are overtaking the insects. They are coming so quickly that even these spectacularly successful evolutionary improvisers do not have time to escape. It’s often difficult for scientists to identify a single contributing factor. A new paper, introducing a special issue on the plight of insects, published in the <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</i>, referred to the decline of these tiny creatures as “death by a thousand cuts.”<sup>5</sup></p><figure data-alt="Hainze_BREAKER-2"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/18112_d05c25e6e6c5d4898161e0aaf700d9c7.png" width="733" alt=""><figcaption><strong>EDGE OF EXTINCTION:</strong> The Lazarus-like return of the island marble butterfly is remarkable, but the pressures that endanger its prairie habitats remain.</figcaption></figure><p>There is a paucity of long-term records for insect populations. The best historical records are for moths and butterflies in Europe and North America. The story of the island marble butterfly, a grassland species, illustrates the myriad forces arrayed against insects. It was declared endangered in the United States in May of 2020. It is charmingly small—mostly white on the tops of the wings and mottled green, yellow, and white on the undersides. Perhaps its colorful camouflage is a way of escaping predation. This little butterfly was thought to be extinct since 1908, when it was last collected on Gabriola Island, British Columbia. Quite by accident 90 years later, while conducting a survey of butterflies in Puget Sound prairie habitats, a Washington state biologist, John Fleckenstein, collected two of these butterflies on San Juan Island. Neither Fleckenstein, nor his colleague, Ann Potter, could identify the butterflies as they reviewed his collection. So, Potter took the butterflies to a butterfly conference in Corvallis, Oregon, where experts were ecstatic to see the butterfly once thought extinct!<sup>6</sup><br></p><p>The Lazarus-like return of the island marble butterfly is remarkable, but the pressures that endanger it remain. The prairie habitats where the butterfly is found have been farmed, used for pasture, and developed for housing, destroying much of its original habitat. The butterfly caterpillars feed and develop on plants in the mustard family. The native mustard, Menzies’ pepperweed (<i>Lepidium virginicum</i> var. <i>menziesii</i>), that must have originally supported the butterfly, is often found surrounding lagoons on San Juan Island. These plants and the island marble butterfly are damaged by winter storm surges, which will become more serious as climate change causes sea levels to rise. Fortunately, the butterfly has adapted to feeding on two non-native plants, field mustard (<i>Brassica rapa</i>) and tumble mustard (<i>Sisymbrium altissimum</i>) that grow elsewhere on the island.</p><blockquote><p>We and many animals wouldn’t survive if insects disappeared.</p> </blockquote><p>Other invasive species have had a more deleterious effect on the island marble butterfly. The brown garden snail (<i>Cornu aspersum</i>), brought from Europe to the west coast as a source of escargot, competes with the island marble butterfly in consuming field mustard and tumble mustard. The European rabbit (<i>Oryctolagus cuniculus</i>) develops large populations in the San Juan Islands and also feeds on butterfly host plants. Deer, though native in the San Juans, are destructive of prairie habitat. Deer numbers are very high there because their predators, such as wolves, cougars, and bears, were eliminated by European settlers. Deer not only destroy island marble butterfly habitat, but they may ingest eggs and caterpillars in the process. Island marble butterflies also suffer from predation by native spiders and by a European paper wasp (<i>Polistes dominula</i>).<sup>7</sup><br></p><p>A vigorous and widely distributed population of butterflies could withstand the <a href="https://nautil.us/blog/fear-is-good-for-the-forest" target="_blank">pressure of predation</a>, but it poses a significant risk for the tiny, localized population of island marble butterflies. Death by a thousand cuts. Habitat destruction, loss of food plants, invasive species, climate change, and predation are primarily human-driven problems. Fortunately, what is believed to be the last island marble butterfly population falls within the boundaries of the San Juan National Historic Park. Here, the park service is actively rearing and releasing butterflies and making a significant effort to preserve their habitat. The island marble butterfly is in a fragile state but hopefully its new endangered status will yield another amazing recovery.</p><div>

<img src="http://hallofshame.gp.co.at/images/qtime/qtanim2.gif" width="174" height="145" alt="(Animation) Ban the Drawer">
As part of their effort to mimic the appearance of the hand-held consumer device, the designers of the <i>QuickTime 4.0 Player</i> employed "drawer-like" interface elements.  The most notable of these, and unquestionably the single biggest blunder in the design of the application (other than attempting to mimic a physical device) is the <strong>Favorites Drawer</strong>.  The Favorites Drawer is intended to provide the user rapid access to his or her favorite multimedia files.  By that concept alone, it <i>should</i> be a useful interface feature.  Unfortunately, by virtue of attempting to mimic real-world devices, and due to a complete lack of familiarity with basic design principles, the Favorites Drawer in <i>QuickTime</i> is a dismal failure.
<p>The designers provided a smooth animation to give the appearance of the drawer opening at the bottom of the device, much like, one supposes, a panel might open on a hand-held device, and very much like the phone number "drawer" used in IBM's <a href="http://hallofshame.gp.co.at/phone.html"><i>RealPhone</i></a>.  The drawer demonstrates one distinct problem of translating real-world phenomena to the computer desktop: <strong>real-world phenomena are not subject to the constraints of screen size</strong>.  The extent to which the drawer can "open", and therefore the number of items visible in the drawer, is a function of where the player is located in relation to the bottom of the screen.  If you want to hold more than a few items in the drawer, you'll have to first position the player near the top of the screen.  If you want to hold a lot of items in the drawer, you'll have to increase the resolution of your monitor.  If the player is positioned too close to the bottom of the screen, the drawer will simply not open.
Similarly, the current size of the player can interfere with the user's ability to access items in the Favorites Drawer; if the size of the player is increased, there is less screen real estate into which the drawer can open and therefore, fewer items in the drawer are accessible.  These problems would not exist if the designers had employed a standard pop-up window to contain the user's favorites.  These problems are the direct, expected results of dogmatic adherence to a faulty design philosophy.  By restricting themselves to the real-world metaphor, and not availing themselves of the dynamic features that computers provide, the designers needlessly restricted the utility and usability of the software.
</p><center><img src="http://hallofshame.gp.co.at/images/qtime/favs.gif" width="347" height="193" alt="Could not have been made any worse"></center>
<p>A look at the arrangement of items in the drawers demonstrates another fundamental problem with the translation of physical devices to software.  The favorites are arranged in a matrix, the number of elements of which is limited by the size of the screen.  A physical item is limited by its physical size.  A virtual item, such as a list of phone-numbers or favorites, is limited only by the amount of computer memory.  If the designers had provided a standard list box there would be virtually no limit to the number of favorites that a user could maintain.  Furthermore, by availing themselves of other standard GUI elements, the designers could have provided a great deal of additional functionality such as organizing favorites by whatever constructs the user wishes to employ, or creating a PlayList of items to be played successively.  Computer software is the ideal platform on which to offer such functionality, but because of their adherence to the physical device, the designers of the <i>QuickTime 4.0 Player</i>, like other RealThings apologists, have made their software woefully inept in an area in which it should greatly excel.
</p><p>The images in the Favorites Drawer, despite their appearance, are not entirely meaningless.  The <i>QuickTime 4.0 Player</i> assigns an image to those items that represent <strong>sound</strong> files.  All sound files however, will be assigned the <strong>same image</strong>, and the program provides no means by which the user can substitute a meaningful image.  On the other hand, the image used to represent a given movie is a thumbnail image of the first frame of the movie.  On the surface, this may seem appropriate, until one looks at a collection of movies: most of the movies we downloaded, especially those from Apple, begin with a <strong>blank, black screen</strong>.  The first frame of the remainining movies constituted a copyright notice which is especially unrecognizeable when reduced to thumbnail size. <strong>What were they thinking?</strong>
</p><p>The images in the drawer indicate little more than the fact that the drawer contains items.  For some completely inexplicable reason, the designers did not feel that it was important to display a title or other description of the item itself, nor did the designers provide any secondary means in the drawer itself, such as tooltips, balloon help, or a message in a status bar to distinguish various titles.  This is not a result of the inappropriate application of a real-world metaphor; this is simply pitiful design.  Balloon Help would certainly help the user,  but it would still require the user to pass the cursor over each image until the desired target could be located.  Since Balloon Help requires intervention of the user to be effective, it should be regarded as little more than a quick fix and not a substitute for an appropriate design of the Favorites function.
</p><p>The lack of meaningful descriptions for the items forces the user to rely on the physical position of the item in the matrix.  Unfortunately, if the user resizes the player window, the number of images in each row of the drawer may or may not change. The end result is that the user can no longer rely on image position as an aid to identification.  An item that was the third row from the bottom, might, after resizing, appear in the second row.  Because of the lack of labels and reliable positioning information, selecting a particular movie or sound file from the favorites drawer is not unlike trying to find a caramel-filled chocolate from a sampler box of chocolates.   As expressed by Forest Gump in the movie bearing his name:
</p><center><p><strong><em>
Mama always said life is like a box of chocolates,<br>
you never know what you are going to get.</em></strong>
</p></center>
<p>The only reliable means of finding a particular type of chocolate is to either bite into each, or at least press your thumb into the bottom of each and hope that nobody notices later.  Similarly, the only reliable means with which the user can identify a file of choice in the favorites drawer is to open several until he or she <em>happens upon</em> the file of interest.  If the designers had been concerned with the users' objectives at this point of the interaction with the <em>QuickTime 4.0 Player</em>, specifically, the ability to rapidly locate and open a particular file of interest, the favorites drawer would never have seen the light of day.  Unfortunately, the designers were far more interested in form over function, where "looking good" is considered more important than working well.
</p><p><img src="http://hallofshame.gp.co.at/images/qtime/orgfav.gif" width="257" height="198" alt="An old standby to the rescue">The application does provide additional means to determine the names of one's favorite media files, but the user must <strong>go somewhere else</strong>.  The application's menu bar offers a function labelled "Organize Favorites", which when selected provides a <strong>standard listbox</strong> containing the names of the favorites.  The listbox allows the user to rename favorites, delete favorites from the list, and reorder items in the list; these functions are notably unavailable from the Favorites Drawer itself.  The Organize Favorites dialog is not without its own design problems.  Surprisingly, the Organize Favorites dialog does not allow the user to Add favorites to the list, for that, the user has to ...<strong>go somewhere else</strong>.  Items in the list can be reordered, but no indication is provided that this is possible.  Further, as an example of a failure to pay attention in <strong>GUI 101</strong>, the designers do not allow the user to make multiple selections in the listbox; you cannot delete more than one item at a time, nor move more than one item at a time.  (Additional design inadequacies of the dialog are discussed below).
</p><p>Those limitations aside, all the designers need to do is add the ability to launch a favorite from the Organize Favorites dialog, change the title of the dialog to "Favorites", and burn the source code for the drawer. In so doing, they will exponentially improve the utility and usability of the Favorites function.  Then, after the designers complete <strong>GUI 201</strong>, they might want to provide the user the ability to <strong>organize the favorites</strong> into categories, <strong>export groups</strong> of favorites to share with others, add the ability to <strong>create a playlist</strong>, and open a favorite in a <strong>new window</strong>.  When you are dealing with a computer and not a real-world physical device just about anything is possible.

Typically we assume that if we get more things done each day, we’re highly productive. But the assumption couldn’t be more wrong.</p><p>Productivity is not about getting all things done, it’s about getting the most important things done, those with the most impact to reach your goals.</p><p>When we think of someone productive, a friend or colleague, we tend to picture someone “busy” pushing through those tasks ticking them off one by one, trapped under an ever-growing pile of work. </p><p>It’s easy to think that busy people with a lot of output are productive, but the actual work they produce might be of little use. Being busy with many tasks, work-responsibilities, and long working hours does not mean that you are productive.</p><p>To become more productive, focus on the tasks that bring you closer to your goals, and consistently do so. Not everything is essential. No matter what you’re working on, there are tasks that you shouldn’t do or delegate, and only a few that are truly important.</p><p><strong>James Clear</strong>, the author of bestseller Atomic Habits, puts it in this way:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>
<p><span> “Being productive is about maintaining a steady, average speed on a few things, not maximum on everything.”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p><strong>Darius Foroux</strong>, author and productivity guru, says:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>
<p><span>“Productivity is when you focus on relevant output, getting the right things done. Things that improve your career, business, organization.”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h2 id="what-does-productivity-mean-to-you">What does productivity mean to you?</h2><p>Before you put your head down and start thinking about becoming more productive, think about “why” you have this urge, what’s driving you. A standard answer that you might think of is; having more free time to do the things you enjoy doing. </p><p>If you can do more with less, surely you can reach your goals sooner, leaving you with time to focus on other goals in life. Is it a career goal you have, more time to read books, more time with your family or friends? Having clarity around what’s driving your actions will help you when things get tough.</p><h2 id="what-are-the-benefits-of-increasing-personal-productivity">What are the benefits of increasing personal productivity?</h2><p>We all have 24 hours in a day, it’s up to each of us to determine how we want to use those hours. Productive people get more done with less effort, allowing them to focus on what was driving them in the first place. </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>

</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>There are clear benefits of improving your personal productivity, focus on the tasks with the most impact, the right things, and you’ll achieve more, and get better results.</p><p>Other benefits can be:</p><ol><li><strong>Reduce Stress</strong><br>When you become more organized and start to achieve your most impactful tasks on time, you will feel less stressed. Instead of running around trying to accomplish everything, you can focus on what matters the most. Your personal well-being increases, e.g., you feel happy and comfortable.</li><li><strong>Increase Engagement</strong><br>Increased productivity and engagement are closely related to each other. More productive people are usually also more passionate and engaged in the work they do. <a href="https://hbr.org/2013/07/employee-engagement-does-more">Harvard Business Review</a> pointed out that higher engagement leads to a 22% increase in productivity. </li><li><strong>Improve self-confidence</strong><br>Improving productivity also allows you to learn more in less time. And, when you get better at what you do, you’ll also increase your confidence. In other words, productive people will learn more, get better at what they do, and become more self-confident.</li></ol><h2 id="how-to-become-more-productive">How to become more productive</h2><p>As highlighted earlier in this article, it’s a significant difference between “movement” and “achievement.” Checking off tasks will allow you to feel more accomplished, but it won’t ensure that you move closer to your goals. Whatever strategy or technique you go with, and there are plenty to choose from, the most important thing to remember is to go with the one you feel most comfortable with.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>

</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Like everything else in life, to make a change, it requires time and focus. So you need to look for a strategy that you can stick with and create a habit around.</p><p>To get you started, <strong>here are some of the most common and practical productivity strategies:</strong></p><h2 id="the-pomodoro-method">The Pomodoro Method</h2><p>Perhaps one of the most known and researched methods out there, and for a good reason, it’s simple and it works. This method can help you keep focus by getting things done in shorter bursts. </p><p>In-between, you take frequent breaks that can either be short or long, depending on how many tasks you’ve completed. You don’t need any particular tools to get started, all you need is a timer. In short, here’s how it works:</p><ul><li>Start on a task that you want to accomplish</li><li>Set the timer on 25 minutes (This block is referred to as the “Pomodoro”)</li><li>Work on the task until the timer rings, put a checkmark on a paper</li><li>Take a 5-minutes break</li><li>After completing 4 “Pomodoros” take a 15-20 minutes break</li></ul><p>The main idea behind this popular technique is that the timer creates a sense of urgency, allowing you to keep focused and not give in to distractions. <a href="https://blog.doit.io/the-pomodoro-technique-boost-your-productivity/">Learn more about the Pomodoro Method.</a> </p><h2 id="eat-that-frog-method">Eat That Frog Method</h2><p>Mark Twain once said, “Eat a live frog first thing in the morning, and nothing worse will happen to you the rest of the day.” Applied to the real world, the “frog” would symbolize the most impactful and essential task you have to complete on a given day, week, or month. </p><p>If you eat that frog in the morning, or when you are the most productive, then you’ll get more done. <a href="https://blog.doit.io/eat-that-frog/">Learn more about the Eat that Frog method.</a></p><h2 id="the-eisenhower-matrix">The Eisenhower Matrix</h2><p>Former President and five-star general, Dwight Eisenhower, had an extraordinary capability of being productive for more extended periods. One of his most essential productivity strategies is called the Eisenhower Matrix (or Box), and it’s a simple decision-making tool that you can easily incorporate in your daily routines. </p><p>The matrix labels tasks, depending on their level of importance and urgency. Learn more about <a href="https://blog.doit.io/the-eisenhower-matrix/">how to use the Eisenhower Matrix in this article.</a></p><h2 id="focus-on-one-thing">Focus on ONE thing</h2><p>A productive person doesn’t necessarily do more work, they focus their work on the right things. And If you then focus your energy on “one” right thing after the other, you’ll accomplish more, and you’re likely to achieve your goals quicker. </p><p>This is, however, not just about focusing on one thing in your life period. It’s about being critical of what you choose to focus your energy on, where you have the most impact, and eliminate waste. Hone in on what matters and let go of everything else. This technique is not as simple as it may sound, but if you learn to master it, you can achieve almost anything. Learn more about <a href="https://blog.doit.io/focus-on-one-thing-leads-to-better-work/">how focusing on one thing can help you.</a></p><h2 id="the-ivy-lee-method">The Ivy Lee Method</h2><p>This 100-years old, 15-minutes method has been used by many professionals to increase their productivity. Why does it work? It’s dead simple. Here’s how it works:</p><ul><li>At the end of each day, write down the six most important tasks that you need to complete the following day. Not more than six.</li><li>Prioritize and stack rank these tasks in order of importance</li><li>Next day, start with your most important task and don’t more to the next task until you’ve completed the first one.</li><li>Work through the list of the tasks in the prioritized order. If you have unfinished tasks from one day, move them over to the new list next for the next day.</li><li>Every day you rinse and repeat this process. <a href="https://blog.doit.io/the-ivy-lee-method/">Learn more about The Ivy Lee method, and how it can help you. </a></li></ul><h2 id="the-15-minute-anthony-trollope-routine">The 15-Minute Anthony Trollope Routine</h2><div><p>How did Anthony Trollope, a prolific English novelist and civil servant of the Victorian era, manage to write 47 novels, an autobiography, 2 plays, short stories, travel books, and countless of articles? </p><p>How can you possibly do all that while also maintaining a career at the Post Office as well? The answer lies within the system he setup for himself, a routine better knows as the <a href="https://blog.doit.io/the-15-minute-anthony-trollope-routine/">15-minute Anthony Trollope routine</a>. &nbsp;</p></div><h2 id="other-more-simple-techniques-to-try">Other more simple techniques to try</h2><p>Experts in this field have a tendency to overcomplicate things.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><strong>Of course</strong> we want type safety when programming Factorio mods. Unfortunately, Factorio's Lua modding API offers no such provisions. Good news! <a href="https://github.com/cdaringe/factorio-type-kit">factorio-type-kit</a> helps bridge that gap via TypeScript. While TypeScript doesn't offer
the strongest safety guarantees of any language under the sun, it does offer moderate safety, and works well
as a Lua replacement. The following steps are required to author factorio mods in TS:</p>
<h2>Factorio in TypeScript - Outline</h2>
<p>We will execute the following steps later, but at a glance, here are the general required steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install <a href="https://nodejs.org/">node</a>. I recommend using <a href="https://github.com/Schniz/fnm#using-a-script-macoslinux">fnm</a> for installing and managing nodejs installations.</li>
<li>(optional) Install <a href="https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install">yarn</a>. <code>npm</code> is the default package manager for nodejs, but the following document uses <code>yarn</code>. It takes only moments to install.</li>
<li>Setup a <code>nodejs</code> project</li>
<li>Install <a href="https://github.com/cdaringe/factorio-type-kit">factorio-type-kit</a>, <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/#installation">typescript</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/TypeScriptToLua/TypeScriptToLua">TypeScriptToLua</a></li>
<li>Configure the typescript compiler to use TypeScriptToLua</li>
<li>Code</li>
<li>Package &amp; deploy the mod</li>
</ol>
<p>It is assumed that the reader has installed node &amp; yarn before proceeding further.</p>
<p>Let's get to work.</p>
<h2>Bootstrapping a barebones mod</h2>
<p>The following command can be run to bootstrap a fresh mod project <em>automatically</em>:</p>
<!-- <Shell children='$ yarn create factorio-mod <mod-name>' /> -->
<pre><code><span>$</span><span> yarn create factorio-mod &lt;mod-name&gt;</span></code></pre>
<p>For demonstration purposes, I will create a mod called <code>vroom</code>. This mod will make the character accelerate as he runs, allowing the player to travel at warp speed!</p>
<pre><code><span>$</span><span> yarn create factorio-mod vroom</span>
...
Victory! Your mod is ready to roll. Execute the following commands to get going:
  - cd "/Users/cdaringe/src/vroom"
  - yarn start
✨  Done in 5.75s.</code></pre>
<p>This step automatically installs the aforementioned dependencies and sets up the compiler toolchain.
If you want to do these steps manually, please see the <a href="https://github.com/cdaringe/vroom">vroom</a> codebase, and replicate the artifacts hosted there. <a href="https://mods.factorio.com/mod/vroom">@mods.factorio.com</a></p>
<h2>Understanding the barebones mod</h2>
<p>Let us <code>cd "path/to/vroom"</code>, and study the content. If you
are familiar with the <a href="https://wiki.factorio.com/Tutorial:Mod_structure">factorio mod directory stucture</a>,
this should look quite familiar.</p>
<pre><code>~/src/vroom via ⬢ v15.0.1
❯ ls -alh
Permissions Size User     Date Modified Name
.rw-r--r--   167 cdaringe 24 Jan 11:37  control.ts
.rw-r--r--   183 cdaringe 24 Jan 11:37  info.json
drwxr-xr-x     - cdaringe 24 Jan 11:37  node_modules

.rw-r--r--   35k cdaringe 24 Jan 11:37  yarn.lock</code></pre>
 <!-- `.trim()} /> -->
<ul>
<li><code>info.json</code> - the entrypont to all factorio mods, pre-populated with some essentials</li>
<li><code>control.ts</code> - this file will compile to <code>control.lua</code>, which Factorio uses to run your mod!</li>
<li><code>tsconfig.json</code> - typescript configuration, critically including <a href="https://typescripttolua.github.io/docs/configuration">TypescriptToLua configuration</a></li>
<li><code>package.json</code> &amp; <code>node_modules</code> - resources to support your TS development experience :)</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's open up <code>control.ts</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> onTick = <span>(<span>_evt: OnTickPayload</span>) =&gt;</span> {
  game.print(serpent.block({
    <span>hello</span>: <span>"world"</span>,
    <span>its_nice</span>: <span>"to see you"</span>
  }));
};

script.on_event(defines.events.on_tick, onTick);</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><code>script.on_event</code> - typed</li>
<li><code>game</code> - typed</li>
<li><code>serpent</code> - typed</li>
<li><code>evt</code> - typed, via casting</li>
</ul>
<p>Boom! Types for everything!</p>
<p>...but not quite. The Factorio Lua documentation is <em>lossy</em>, and has many cases where we simply <em>cannot</em> parse correct type definitions from the Factorio website. Until the factorio development team publicly supports  machine-readable API documentation, <code>factorio-type-kit</code> TypeScript provisions will generally only be 70-80%+ complete. Thus, TypeScript users will be periodically disappointed to find <code>any</code> or <code>unknown</code> types in various interfaces. With that said, <code>factorio-type-kit</code> users are welcome to manually backfill essential definitions to make our community's development kit better.</p>
<h2>Starting the mod compiler</h2>
<pre><code><span>$</span><span> yarn start</span></code></pre>
<p>Momentarily after launching the watching compiler, <code>control.lua</code> should be emitted. Open it up:</p>
<pre><code>onTick = <span><span>function</span><span>(_evt)</span></span>
    game.<span>print</span>(
        serpent.block({hello = <span>"world"</span>, its_nice = <span>"to see you"</span>})
    )
<span>end</span>
script.on_event(defines.events.on_tick, onTick)</code></pre>
<p>The TypeScriptToLua compiler does a fanstastic job on producing readable Lua.</p>
<h2>Implementing vroom</h2>
<p>The very first thing the <code>vroom</code> mod needs to do is detect when the player is in motion.</p>
<p>Rather that pull up the documentation, I'll just open up another call <code>script.on_event</code>, then
begin typing in <code>defines.events.</code>. After intellisense presents me options, I will select <code>on_player_changed_position</code>. The type definitions tell me a callback is also required. I will enter in <code>onPositionChanged</code>.</p>
<pre><code>script.on_event(
  defines.events.on_player_changed_position,
  onPositionChange
);</code></pre>
<p><code>onPositionChange</code> is not defined yet. Let's discuss what it needs to do then draft it.
First, it needs to get the player's current speed. Next, the speed needs to increase when running. Because the purpose of the mod is to accelerate the user, we multiply the previous speed by a scalar every so often.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> onPositionChange = <span>(<span>evt: OnPlayerChangedPositionPayload</span>) =&gt;</span> {
  <span>const</span> player = game.get_player(evt.player_index);
  <span>if</span> (player.walking_state.walking) {
    
  }
};</code></pre>
<p>Immediately take note that we have manually specified the type of <code>evt</code> as <code>OnPlayerChangedPositionPayload</code>. All factorio script event types follow the event naming convention: <code>&lt;CamelCased-EventName&gt;Payload</code>. A future version may automatically apply types to the <code>on_event</code> callback, so you not need cast.</p>
<p>The first thing I noticed was that <code>evt</code> did not have a reference directly to the player I needed.
It does contain the <code>player_id</code> however, and with that ID we can call the <code>get_player</code> method on the global <code>game</code> instance. <code>get_player</code> returns an instance of a <code>LuaPlayer</code>, contains a <code>walking_state</code> property. Let's use <em>that</em>. We know that we <em>only</em> want to speed up the player if he is in motion, so let's further wrap our logic inside a conditional--<code>if (player.walking_state.walking) { ... }</code>.</p>
<p>Next up, how do we actually speed up the player? After searching the API documentation, I concluded that there was not a direct value specifying a velocity of the character. However, I did come across <code>character_running_speed_modifier</code>, which the type definitions told me is of type <code>number</code>. Unexpectedly, through trial and error, I learned that <code>character_running_speed_modifier</code> could be zero. <code>Speed * 0 = 0</code>, so Factorio likely does a 0 check internally before calculating the player's speed. We will have to do a similar check. Notice that typescript did not me help uncover my bug! Anything of type <code>number</code> can rightfully be zero, so shame on me! Defensive programmers everywhere are saying "you should have seen this coming", and they would be correct :). Equipped with this knowledge, let's fill in the rest.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> onPositionChange = <span>(<span>evt: OnPlayerChangedPositionPayload</span>) =&gt;</span> {
  <span>const</span> player = game.get_player(evt.player_index);
  <span>if</span> (player.walking_state.walking) {
    <span>const</span> lastSpeed = player.character_running_speed_modifier;
    <span>const</span> baseSpeed = lastSpeed == <span>0</span> ? <span>1</span> : lastSpeed;
    player.character_running_speed_modifier = baseSpeed * <span>1.01</span>;
  }
};</code></pre>
<p>When our player stops running, we want to restart the acceleration process for the next time he runs.
My original approach was to listen for <code>keyup</code> events. Alas, Factorio has no key events. How else could I determine if the player has stopped running, and thus safely reset the speed modifier? Easy! On every tick of the game, I can check all players for motion--and turn off the multiplier if they are stopped!</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> onTick = <span>(<span>_evt: OnTickPayload</span>) =&gt;</span> {
  <span>Object</span>.entries(game.players).forEach(<span>(<span>[_id, player]</span>) =&gt;</span> {
    <span>if</span> (
      player.character_running_speed_modifier &gt; <span>0</span> &amp;&amp;
      !player.walking_state.walking
    ) {
      player.character_running_speed_modifier = <span>0</span>;
    }
  });
};</code></pre>
<p>That is, for every player, if there is a positive speed modifier and and the player is not walking, zero out the modifier.</p>
<p>Why didn't we just do a <code>game.players.forEach</code>? <code>game.players</code> isn't an array, so that won't work. TypeScript protected us from making that mistake! What about <code>Object.entries(game.players).forEach</code>? Yep, that worked! Why did we not do <code>Object.values(...)</code>? Because <code>game.players</code> is a <a href="https://lua-api.factorio.com/latest/LuaGameScript.html#LuaGameScript.players">special dictionary</a> in Lua. Not all iterables map cleanly between languages. <code>Object.values(...)</code> wouldn't have given us compiler error, but still would have failed. Improved typing is needed to protect against these failures. While TypeScriptToLua generally helps out a great deal protect us from writing erroneous code, it is only as good as its applied type constraints.</p>
<p>When using JS standard library provisions, as we did above, the compiler will add a typescript-lua polyfill, <code>lualib_bundle</code>. The emitted Lua perhaps is not as elegant:</p>
<pre><code><span>require</span>(<span>"lualib_bundle"</span>);

onTick = <span><span>function</span><span>(_evt)</span></span>
    __TS__ArrayForEach(
        __TS__ObjectEntries(game.players),
        <span><span>function</span><span>(____, ____bindingPattern0)</span></span>
            <span>local</span> _id = ____bindingPattern0[<span>1</span>]
            <span>local</span> player
            player = ____bindingPattern0[<span>2</span>]
            <span>if</span> (player.character_running_speed_modifier &gt; <span>0</span>) <span>and</span> (<span>not</span> player.walking_state.walking) <span>then</span>
                player.character_running_speed_modifier = <span>0</span>
            <span>end</span>
        <span>end</span>
    )
<span>end</span></code></pre>
<p>Even with the extra boilerplate generated, the code is still quite readable. Could be cleaner! Surely as the TypeScriptToLua compiler evolves in time, it will be.</p>
<h2>Deploy it</h2>
<p>I do not yet have clean, polished package &amp; deploy scripts, but I do have functional ones.
Do your best to cover your eyes. Running <code>yarn install_mod</code> syncs the mod into the local Factorio installation. Coupled with a watch script, every code change immediately syncs in the game folder, and requires only a scenario reload to exercise the new scripts.</p>
<pre><code>"scripts": {
  "clean:install": "rm -rf ~/Library/Application\\ Support/factorio/mods/vroom*",
  "copy:install": "VERSION=$(cat info.json | jq -r .version) &amp;&amp; rsync -r --exclude node_modules --exclude '.git*' --exclude build --exclude 'npm*' --exclude README.md --exclude package.json --exclude '*.lock'  ./ ~/Library/Application\\ Support/factorio/mods/vroom_$VERSION/",
  "install_mod": "run-s clean:install copy:install",
  "watch": "chokidar …</code></pre></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As I was sitting at work, coming up with a way to solve some synchronization issue between our relational database and a search index, it got me thinking… Is it possible to have a database that can handle this stuff for me, the way, for example, Postgres handles the creation and maintenance of an index? Just one <strong>CREATE INDEX</strong> away from efficient and fast queries. What about a database that can serve every need: storing and reading data effectively, scaling smoothly as the workload increases, being able to run complex searches, do batch and stream processing for analytical purposes and work with every other access pattern we can imagine.</p><p>Almost any organization that handles data uses a relational database in its stack. It makes sense, it’s a battle-tested technology that stood the test of time. For a large percent of the applications, the need won’t arise for a different kind of data system. Take Postgres for example: it’s highly scalable, it has transactions with ACID properties, materialized views, supports partitioning and replication, joins, views, triggers, stored procedures, hot backups, all that kind of stuff. We can go
along way with it without having to worry about problems with the dataflow in our system. But of course, not all data models are suitable for Postgres, and even though it supports things like full-text searches and JSON columns, some times it is more suitable or easier even, to use different technology.</p><p>But even though relational databases have come a very long way, still they are not designed to handle every possible workload, so we resort to having to combine multiple systems to handle this broad variety: we use Redis for caching, Elasticsearch for searching, Kafka for stream processing, and many more similar tools and technologies, each of them serving a very narrow purpose in handling our different use cases.</p><p>But is there a way to unify the interface across these systems?</p><p>These technologies are great at what they do, we just need something that nicely ties them together instead of putting that burden on our applications. Putting the application in this role is too much of a responsibility, storing and transporting the data from one place to another as well as handling all of the business logic is a sure way of making those systems permanently inconsistent with each other.</p><p>Instead, if we can figure out a way of making these diverse components work nicely together, we will have a much more reliable solution. Kinda like the pipe in Unix, allowing the user to compose different workflows together out of simpler programs, by sending the output of one command to another, for further processing.</p><p>Now I know there are tools today that handle some of these cases that I mentioned, and they are getting better each day, but they’re far from simple to operate and maintain, and more importantly, they’re not of declarative nature.</p><p>Instead of relying on tools, is it possible to have some abstraction akin to SQL, some declarative language that will hide away the complexities of storing and synchronizing the data across the different data systems, making it easier to combine the disparate technologies, while also providing escape hatches in case the need arises to access the underlying storage directly?</p><p>Taking inspiration from the UNIX philosophy which emphasizes building complex systems out of simpler, extensible, and modular components, can we apply the same principles here, to our future data systems?</p></div></div>]]>

January 24, 2021 | https://blog.testproject.io/2021/01/19/the-testing-mindset-myth/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.testproject.io/2021/01/19/the-testing-mindset-myth/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span>I spent a significant amount of my career in the role of a dedicated testing specialist. I worked at Microsoft leading a variety of cross-company initiatives when we had 10,000 testers at the company. We worked closely with development teams and, at the time, made a difference in product quality. For most of that time, developers generally did a small bit of testing, but our test teams performed the vast majority of all testing efforts, including extensive suites of verification tests enhanced with a flurry of diagnostic tools and a healthy dose of exploratory testing and investigation.</span></p><p><span>Somewhere in my tester journey, Microsoft moved from a mix of testers with and without programming experience to a model where all testers knew how to program, and I was a fly on the wall when we came up with the title for the infamous <a href="https://blog.testproject.io/2018/11/06/the-software-engineer-in-test/">SDET</a> role. There were many good (and some not so good) reasons for this move that are outside the focus of this post. One thing I remember from some folks opposed to the move was a notion that testers who knew how to program could not do effective testing because they were “skewed” by their understanding of how the code works. The feeling of these people was that the testing mindset is separate from the developer mindset 🧠 – that if you had one, you couldn’t have the other.</span></p><p><span>My experiences showed a different story. While I certainly ran across testers who tried too hard to solve every testing challenge with code, most readily and easily took on the role of tester and did deep exploration and investigation in order to understand and evaluate risk. Often, as expected, they would write programs or utilities to accelerate their testing. Their programming skills didn’t </span><i><span>hurt</span></i><span> their testing – their programming skills </span><i><span>enhanced</span></i><span> their testing. The idea of a skewed mindset was a myth.</span></p><p><span>For the last several years, I’ve been working on teams without dedicated testers. While these teams often have a few folks (including myself) who have some responsibility for helping the development team do better testing, the developers are responsible for fully testing their code – not just for functional correctness, but for all aspects of quality.</span></p><p><span>A few people have stated to me recently that developers are unable to perform testing because “they lack the mindset for skilled testing”. This statement – like the statement I heard many years ago about skewed mindsets is flawed and incorrect.</span></p><h2><strong>Mindsets and Skill Sets</strong></h2><p><span>Some voices in software development believe that building a product demands a certain mindset, while testing it demands a different mindset.</span></p><p><span>The book, </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mindset-Psychology-Carol-S-Dweck/dp/0345472322"><i><span>Mindset</span></i></a><span> by Carol S. Dweck says that mindset shapes how you learn and relate to others – and states that you have one of two mindsets – a </span><i><span>fixed</span></i><span> mindset, where you believe your abilities are unchangeable, and a </span><i><span>growth</span></i><span> mindset, where you believe the abilities you’re born with are a starting point for learning and advancing.</span></p><p><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Drucker">Peter Drucker</a> coined the term, </span><i><span>knowledge work</span></i><span> to differentiate work that requires problem-solving and critical thinking from rote factory work. Authors such as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Whole-New-Mind-Right-Brainers-Future/dp/1594481717">Daniel Pink</a> (</span><i><span>A Whole New Mind</span></i><span>) have elaborated on the impact of creative thinking in knowledge workers.</span></p><p><span>Software development and software testing are knowledge work. Both require multiple skillsets, constant learning, and problem-solving. While developing and testing software may require different problem-solving approaches or skill sets, they are both part of </span><i><span>the same (growth) mindset</span></i><span>, and the best people I know in software can switch between their development/builder and tester/investigator </span><i><span>skill sets </span></i><span>rapidly and fluidly. While I agree that it’s not </span><i><span>easy</span></i><span> – with <a href="https://blog.testproject.io/2021/01/14/habits-plus-deliberate-practice-equals-mastery/">deliberate and frequent practice</a> shifting between these skill sets, most knowledge workers I’ve worked with can – and have become quite successful in developing this flow.</span></p><h2><strong>The Creators Skill Set&nbsp;</strong></h2><p><span>I studied music composition as both an undergraduate and graduate student 🎶 Like building applications and writing, composition requires creation, bound by rules – which are sometimes intentionally broken in order to achieve the creator’s intent – as well as deep analysis and evaluation. As a composer, I constantly had to switch from putting notes on the page to looking at the passage or entire piece as a whole to make sure it achieved my intent. This analysis ranged from verifying notes and voicing were correct to examining every nuance of dynamics and orchestration. Like all metaphors, this one breaks down at some point, but composition skills require both creative (builder) and analysis skill sets (I took multiple courses in each), and the act of composition includes ample amounts of both.</span></p><p><span>For most of the last decade, I’ve spent a significant amount of my time helping developers expand their testing knowledge. I’ve watched hundreds of developers grow their knowledge about testing, and then almost immediately apply what they have learned. To be fair, I’ve also seen them make many of the same mistakes that new testers also make, but they’re eager to learn and constantly adjust. Many of these developers are at least as good at <a href="https://testproject.io/">testing</a> as the best testers I know. With no prompting or mindset shifts, most find a way to fluidly shift from the microscope view to the 10,000-foot view and back again.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>What I’ve found in nearly every case is that initially, developers lack the skill sets that experienced testers have mastered. I’ve also seen that developers are completely capable of learning a wide variety of deep testing and investigation skills. I’ve also found that teams where developers have testing skills deliver more quickly, more predictably, and with higher quality.</span></p><h2><strong>Making the Shift</strong></h2><p><span>I’m not advocating for any software team to eliminate the testing role (although I believe testing expertise is much more suited embedded into the team than in a dedicated test team). But I am firmly against the idea that developers <a href="https://blog.testproject.io/2020/12/09/quality-assurance-is-everyones-responsibility/">shouldn’t do testing</a> or can’t be good testers. I’ve proved that myth wrong dozens if not hundreds of times and colleagues in the industry have shared at least as many examples. <strong>Developers are </strong></span><strong><i>capable</i> of testing, can do testing and we should <i>expect</i></strong><span><strong> them to do testing</strong>. The expert testers of today would be well served by helping them learn and improve these skills.</span></p><p><span>We can start by recognizing that we’re all knowledge workers and that a big part of our job satisfaction and growth comes from learning and taking on harder and more challenging tasks. We should also recognize that software development requires a variety of unique skills</span><span>, but not a change in mindset. <strong>We don’t all have to master every skill, but learning, growth, and skill development is something we all can do</strong>.</span></p><p><span>We just have to put our minds to it 😉</span></p></div></div>]]>

      The Duck Hunt gun, officially called the NES Zapper, seems downright primitive next to today’s technology. But in the late ’80s, it filled plenty of young heads with wonder.</p>

                            For many children of the '80s, a good portion of your childhood probably revolved around sitting too close to the TV, clutching a plastic safety cone-colored hand gun and blasting waterfowl out of a pixilated sky in <em>Duck Hunt </em>(also, trying to blow that dog’s head off when he laughed at you). The <em>Duck Hunt</em> gun, officially called the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) Zapper, seems downright primitive next to the Nintendo’s Wii and Microsoft’s Kinect, but in the late 80s, it filled plenty of young heads with wonder. How did that thing work?
                        
</p><h4>Annie Get Your Zapper</h4><p>
    
                            The Zapper’s ancestry goes back to the mid 1930s, when the first so-called “light guns” appeared after the development of light-sensing vacuum tubes. In the first light gun game, <a href="http://www.pinrepair.com/arcade/rayolit.htm">Ray-O-Lite</a> (developed in 1936 by Seeburg, a company that made parts and systems for jukeboxes), players shot at small moving targets mounted with light sensors using a gun that emitted a beam of light. When the beam struck a sensor, the targets – ducks, coincidentally – registered the “hit” and a point was scored.
                        
</p><p>
    
                            Light guns hit home video game consoles with <em>Shooting Gallery</em> on the Magnavox Odyssey in 1972. Because the included shotgun-style light gun was only usable on a Magnavox television, the game flopped. The Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) Zapper then fell into the hands of American kids in October 1985, when it was released in a bundle with the NES, a controller and a few games. Early versions of the peripheral were dark gray, but the color of the sci-fi ray gun-inspired Zapper was changed a few years later when a federal regulation required that toy and imitation firearms be “blaze orange” (color #12199, to be exact) so they wouldn’t be mistaken for the real deal.
                        
</p><p>
    
                            While there were a number of Zapper-compatible games released for the NES (when I was a kid and my dad worked from home, we wasted plenty of afternoons away playing <em>Hogan’s Alley</em>), most lived in the shadow of the iconic <em>Duck Hunt</em>, the most recognizable and popular Zapper game.
                        
</p><h4>Gone in a Flash</h4><p>
    
                            While older light guns like the Ray-O-Lite rifle emitted beams of light, the Zapper and many other recent light guns work by receiving light through a photodiode on or in the barrel and using that light to figure out where on the TV screen you're aiming.
                        
</p><p>
    
                            This target flashing method helped Nintendo overcome a weakness of older light gun games: cheaters racking up high scores by pointing the gun at a steady light source, like a lamp, and hitting the first target right out of the gate.

He gained entrance to Harvard at eleven, and gave a lecture on four-dimensional bodies to the Harvard Mathematical Club his first year. He graduated cum laude at sixteen, and became the youngest professor in history. He deduced the possibility of black holes more than twenty years before Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar published An Introduction to the Study of Stellar Structure. His life held possibilities for achievement that few people can imagine. Of all the prodigies for which there are records, his was probably the most powerful intellect of all. And yet it all came to nothing. He soon gave up his position as a professor, and for the rest of his life wandered from one menial job to another. His experiences as a child prodigy had proven so painful that he decided for the rest of his life to shun public exposure at all costs. Henceforth, he denied his gifts, refused to think about mathematics, and above all refused to perform as he had been made to do as a child. Instead, he devoted his intellect almost exclusively to the collection of streetcar transfers, and to the study of the history of his native Boston. He worked hard at becoming a normal human being, but never entirely succeeded. He found the concept of beauty, for example, to be completely incomprehensible, and the idea of sex repelled him. At fifteen he took a vow of celibacy, which he apparently kept for the remainder of his life, dying a virgin at the age of 46. He wore a vest summer and winter, and never learned to bathe regularly. A comment that Aldous Huxley once made about Sir Isaac Newton might equally have been said of Sidis.</p>
<blockquote><p>For the price Newton had to pay for being a supreme intellect was that he was incapable of friendship, love, fatherhood, and many other desirable things. As a man he was a failure; as a monster he was superb [5, p. 2222].</p></blockquote>
<p>There was a time when all precocious children were thought to burn out the same way that Sidis did. The man most responsible for changing this belief was Lewis M. Terman. Between 1900 and 1920 he was able to carry out a study of about a hundred gifted children, and his observations convinced him that many of the traditional beliefs about the gifted were little more than superstitions. To confirm these observations, he obtained a grant from the Commonwealth Fund in 1922, and used it to sift a population of more than a quarter of a million children, selecting out all those with IQs above 140 for further study. That group has been monitored continuously ever since. Many of the previously held beliefs about the gifted did indeed turn out to be false. The gifted are not weak or sickly, and although the incidence of myopia is greater among them, they are generally thought to be better looking than their contemporaries: They are not nerds.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in his rush to dispel the erroneous beliefs about the gifted, Terman sometimes made claims not supported by his own data. In fact, in some cases, the data suggests that exactly the opposite conclusion should have been drawn. Terman’s own data shows that there is a definite connection between measured intelligence and mental and social maladjustment. The consequences of misinterpreting these data are so grave that it will pay to re-examine them in some detail.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160422152937im_/http://216.224.180.96/~prom/oldsite/images/gof/terman.jpg" width="294" height="466"></p>
<p>Terman’s longitudinal research on the gifted included a constant assessment of mental health and social adjustment. Subjects were classified into three categories: satisfactory adjustment, some maladjustment, and serious maladjustment. Terman defined these categories in the following way.</p>
<p>1. Satisfactory. Subjects classified in this category were essentially normal; i.e., their “desires, emotions, and interests were compatible with the social standards and pressures” of their group. Everyone, of course, has adjustment problems of one kind or another. Satisfactory adjustment as here defined does not mean perfect contentment and complete absence of problems, but rather the ability to cope adequately with difficulties in the personal make-up or in the subject’s environment. Worry and anxiety when warranted by the circumstances, or a tendency to be somewhat high strung or nervous–provided such a tendency did not constitute a definite personality problem–were allowed in this category. 2. Some maladjustment. Classified here were subjects with excessive feelings of inadequacy or inferiority, nervous fatigue, mild anxiety neurosis, and the like. The emotional conflicts, nervous tendencies and social maladjustments of these individuals, while they presented definite problems, were not beyond the ability of the individual to handle, and there was no marked interference with social or personal life or with achievement. Subjects whose behavior was noticeably odd or freakish, but without evidence of serious neurotic tendencies, were also classified in this category. 3. Serious maladjustment. a.) Classified as 3a were subjects who had shown marked symptoms of anxiety, mental depression, personality maladjustment, or psychopathic personality. This classification also includes subjects who had suffered a “nervous breakdown,” provided the condition was not severe enough to constitute a psychosis. Subjects with a previous history of serious maladjustment or nervous breakdown (without psychosis) were included here even though their adjustment at the time of rating may have been entirely satisfactory. b.) Classified as 3b were those subjects who had at any time suffered a complete mental breakdown requiring hospitalization, whatever their condition at the time of rating. In the majority of cases the subjects were restored to reasonably good mental health after a brief period of hospital care [6, pp. 99-101].</p>
<p>In 1940, when the group was about 29 years of age, a large scale examination was carried out. Included in that examination was a high level test of verbal intelligence, designated at that time the Concept Mastery, but later re-named the Concept Mastery test form A. Terman found the following relationship between adjustment and verbal intelligence. (These are raw scores, not IQs.)</p>

<p>The data show three things. First, that there is a definite trend for the maladjusted to make higher scores on the Concept Mastery test. Second, that women show symptoms of maladjustment at lower scores than men. And third, that 21 percent of the men and 18 percent of the women showed at least some form of maladjustment.</p>
<p>During 1950-52, when the group was approximately 41 years old, another examination was made using a new test, the Concept Mastery test form T. Test scores were again compared to assessments of adjustment. (CMT-T scores are not interchangeable with CMT-A scores. They have different means and standard deviations.)</p>

<p>Similar conclusions can be drawn from these data as well. Again, there is a definite trend shown for the maladjusted to make higher scores than the satisfactorily adjusted. Again, women show symptoms of maladjustment at lower scores than men. But the most alarming thing of all is that the percentage of maladjustment shown for both sexes rose in the 12 years since the previous examination. The percentage of men showing maladjustment having risen from 21 percent to 29 percent, and the figure for women having risen from 18 percent to 33 percent! Nearly double what it was before!</p>
<p>How did Terman interpret these data? Terman states:</p>
<blockquote><p>Although severe mental maladjustment is in general somewhat more common among subjects who score high on the Concept Mastery test, many of the most successful men of the entire group also scored high on this test [7, p. 50].</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, Terman deliberately tried to give the impression that the relationship between verbal intelligence and mental and social maladjustment was weak and unreliable. He did this by misdirection. He gave a truthful answer to an irrelevant question. Terman failed to realize that a small difference in means between two or more distributions can have a dramatic effect on the percentage of each group found at the tails of the distribution. The relevant questions should have been “what is the percentage of maladjustment found at different levels of ability, and does this show a trend?” Terman’s data can be used to find answers to these questions.</p>
<p>The method used to solve this problem is a relatively simple one but tedious in detail. (See appendix.) The results, however, are easy to understand. Using CMT-T scores for men as an illustration, and pooling the data for some maladjustment and serious maladjustment, the following percentages can be obtained.</p>

<p>By comparison, the Triple Nine Society averages 155.16 on the CMT-T, and the average score for Prometheus Society members is 169.95 [1, 2]. The implications are staggering, especially when it is realized that these percentages do not include women, who show more maladjustment at lower CMT-T scores than men do. Perhaps this is one of the reasons why super high IQ societies suffer so much from schisms and a tendency towards disintegration. In any event, one thing is certain.

<p><span>March 17, 2014</span>
</p>
<p>Remember <a href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/lw/dr/generalizing_from_one_example/" rel="nofollow">Galton’s experiments on visual imagination?</a> Some people just don’t have it. And they never figured it out. They assumed no one had it, and when people talked about being able to picture objects in their minds, they were speaking metaphorically.
</p>
<p>And the people who <em>did</em> have good visual imaginations didn’t catch them. The people without imaginations mastered this “metaphorical way of talking” so well that they passed for normal. No one figured it out until Galton sat everyone down together and said “Hey, can we be really really clear about exactly how literal we’re being here?” and everyone realized they were describing different experiences.
</p>
<p>I thought about this recently during a conversation with Ozy:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ozy:</strong> I am currently eating chickpeas and rice and I am <em>delighted</em> by the fact that I can eat this <em>whenever I want</em>. The nice thing about DISCOVERING YOUR FOOD PREFERENCES is that suddenly all the food in my cupboards is food I like and am looking forward to eating. And usually I get food I like by, like, luck? So this is excitement.
</p>
<p><strong>Scott:</strong> I don’t understand, why didn’t you buy things like that before?
</p>
<p><strong>Ozy:</strong> It took me a while to have enough of a sense of the food I like for “make a list of the food I like” to be a viable grocery-list-making strategy.
</p>
<p><strong>Scott:</strong> I’ve got to admit I’m confused and intrigued by your “don’t know my own preferences” thing.
</p>
<p><strong>Ozy:</strong> Hrm. Well, it’s sort of like… you know how sometimes you pretend to like something because it’s high-status, and if you do it well enough you <em>actually believe</em> you like the thing? Unless I pay a lot of attention <em>all</em> my preferences end up being not “what I actually enjoy” but like “what is high status” or “what will keep people from getting angry at me”
</p>
<p><strong>Scott:</strong> How does that apply to food?
</p>
<p><strong>Ozy:</strong> Well, sometimes people will tell you a certain food is high-status or healthy or a thing that everyone enjoys, and then I would like it. And a lot of times I just ate whatever was in front of me or ordered whatever the cheapest vegetarian thing on the menu was. And I… sort of vaguely had a sense that some things were more pleasurable to eat than other things but I didn’t like <em>keep track</em> of what they were or anything. Because if I knew I might like the <em>wrong things</em>. And also because I didn’t intuitively grasp that the “liking” thing everyone was talking about was related to pleasure and not to like popularity/status.
</p></blockquote>
<p>So the fact that people talk about what foods they like about a zillion times a day isn’t enough to make everyone realize liking foods is a thing.
</p>
<p>But it gets worse. A high school friend posted on Facebook a link to <a href="http://www.quora.com/Graduate-School/Is-going-for-a-Ph-D-worth-it-if-Im-extremely-passionate-about-a-field-but-dont-really-want-to-spend-my-20s-poor-toiling-away-in-a-lab-and-living-in-a-city-that-I-dont-particularly-want-to-live-in/answer/Mark-Eichenlaub?srid=slK&amp;share=1" rel="nofollow">a really interesting answer on Quora</a>. It makes you log on, so I’ll copy the relevant part below:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have anosmia, which means I lack smell the way a blind person lacks sight. What’s surprising about this is that I didn’t even know it for the first half of my life.
</p>
<p>Each night I would tell my mom, “Dinner smells great!” I teased my sister about her stinky feet. I held my nose when I ate Brussels sprouts. In gardens, I bent down and took a whiff of the roses. I yelled “gross” when someone farted. I never thought twice about any of it for fourteen years.
</p>
<p>Then, in freshman English class, I had an assignment to write about the Garden of Eden using details from all five senses. Working on this one night, I sat in my room imagining a peach. I watched the juice ooze out as I squeezed at the soft fuzz. I felt the wet, sappy liquid drip from my fingers down onto my palm. As the mushy heart of the fruit compressed, I could hear it squishing, and when I took that first bite I could taste the little bit of tartness that followed the incredible sweet sensation flooding my mouth.
</p>
<p>But I had to write about smell, too, and I was stopped dead by the question of what a peach smelled like. Good. That was all I could come up with. I tried to think of other things. Garbage smelled bad. Perfume smelled good. Popcorn good. Poop bad. But how so? What was the difference? What were the nuances? In just a few minutes’ reflection I realized that, despite years of believing the contrary, I never had and never would smell a peach.
</p>
<p>All my behavior to that point indicated that I had smell. No one suspected I didn’t. For years I simply hadn’t known what it was that was supposed to be there. I just thought the way it was for me was how it was for everyone. It took the right stimulus before I finally discovered the gap.
</p></blockquote>
<p>So I guess you can just <em>not be able to smell</em> and not know it.
</p>
<p>This makes me wonder what universal human experiences I and my friends are missing out on without realizing it.
</p>
<p>I know one friend’s answer. He discovered he was color-blind sometime in his teens. This still surprises me. People are always taking Ishihara tests (those colorful dotted circles with numbers inside of them) and discovering they’re color blind. Going through life with everyone else saying “The light was red, but now it’s green” and thinking it was weird that they were making such a big deal about subtle variations in shades of brownish-gray, but it was probably one of those metaphors.
</p>
<p>As for me? I took a surprisingly long time to realize I was asexual. When I was a virgin, I figured sex was one of those things that seemed gross before you did it, and then you realized how great it was. Afterwards, I figured it was something that didn’t get good until you were skilled at it and had been in a relationship long enough to truly appreciate the other person. In retrospect, pretty much every aspect of male sexual culture is a counterargument to that theory, but I guess it’s just really hard for my brain to generate “you are a mental mutant” as a hypothesis.
</p>
<p>But even bigger than that, I think I might not have had emotions, at least not fully, for about five years as a teenager when I was on SSRIs. I even sort of noticed myself not having emotions, but dismissed that as an odd thing to happen and probably other people were just being really overexuberant about things. Later I learned emotional blunting is a commonly reported side effect of SSRIs and I was probably just really not experiencing emotions. When I came off them it took me several years to get used to having normal-intensity feelings again, but it wasn’t a sudden revelation, like “Wow, I was missing a fundamental human experience for the past several years!” Just a sense of things being different which was hard to cash out.
</p>
<p>As always, I wonder if a lot of what other people interpret through vague social things might be biological, or at least more <em>complicatedly</em> social. I can’t enjoy jazz music even a little – the best I can do is pick up something sort of like a beat and half-heartedly feel like maybe I could snap my fingers to it if I could build up the energy. My brother fell in love with jazz as soon as he heard it and is now a professional jazz musician who has dedicated his life to it. Are we listening to the same thing when we hear a jazz tune? Or am I like a guy who can’t smell trying to appreciate perfume?

            This documentation presents the UNIX kernel I wrote
            in 1994-1995.  It's an almost complete implementation of the
            POSIX.1 standard (IEEE Std 1003.1-1988).  My main motivation
            was learning about operating systems design and
            architecture, kernel algorithms, resource allocation,
            process scheduling, memory management policies, etc.  The
            result is a new POSIX compliant UNIX kernel with many
            features real operating systems have: virtual memory, demand
            paging, protection, swapping, etc.  It is not perfect, it
            probably has bugs, but in time they will get fixed and the
            kernel will become more stable.  Since many high-quality
            free software packages are available on the Internet, coming
            especially from the GNU project, I have ported many of them
	    to my system, with the idea of getting real functionality.

	  As of December 2007, Thix has been taken over by 
	  <a href="mailto:paulhulme@thix.eu">Paul Hulme</a>.  His work
       	  will be distributed through <a href="http://thix.eu/">thix.eu</a>.

            The Thix Operating System is fully functional at this time.
            Many free software packages have been succesfully
            compiled/run under it, including development tools such as
            the GNU C/C++ Compiler suite.  However, there is no
            networking support and the only drivers available are for
            floppy disks, (E)IDE hard disks, printers, virtual
            terminals, mem, kmem and null.
          </p>
          <p>
            The format of the executable is still a.out which is very
            hard to maintain due to its so many variants.  Maybe I'll
            switch to ELF one day.

            Thix has been developped under Linux with GCC.  Many thanks
            to all the people that made this possible.

          <p>
            December 2006, i.e. 10 years later...  Yeah, it's been
            <em>that</em> long since I touched this stuff.  I could
            never get Thix to work in VMware, not straight out of the
            box anyway, but now that I got a Mac and <a href="http://parallels.com/" rel="external-parallels" title="Parallels">Parallels</a> seems to handle it quite
            well (minor keyboard issues notwithstanding), I figured I'd
            put an image out there for people to play with.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have created 3 images that can be useful for a number of
            things (development, study, or plain curiosity).  The first
            one is a <a href="http://vmware.com/" rel="external-vmware" title="VMware">VMware</a> image with an old distribution of
            S.u.S.E Linux (circa 1996).  This distribution has the old
            versions of GCC and binutils required to compile Thix.  I've
            set up two accounts, <em>root</em> and <em>tudor</em>, both
            using the account name as the password.  The <em>tudor</em>
            account contains the sources for the kernel and all the tools
            that have been ported to Thix.  I tried getting the same Linux
            version to install in Parallels under Mac OS X (Tiger) as well
            as convert the VMware image to Parallels once installed, and
	    failed miserably in both cases, so for now development is under
	    VMware and testing under Parallels.
          </p>
          <p>
            The more exciting part though are the other two images, one
            which is a full installation of Thix complete with a rescue
            floppy disk.  These are raw images (the disk one corresponds
            to an IDE disk with C/H/S=163/16/63 geometry).  Unfortunately,
            I couldn't get Thix to work in VMware, so these images, as you
            can tell from the file extensions, are for Parallels.

            ... now back to the old stuff.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thix is distributed under the GNU Public Licence.  You can
            download the <a href="http://www.hulubei.net/tudor/thix/download/src/thix-0.3.7.tar.gz"> Thix
            kernel sources</a> and the <a href="http://www.hulubei.net/tudor/thix/download/src/tfs-0.2.1.tar.gz">sources of the fsck</a>
            utility, a great tool in repairing damaged Thix File
            Systems.  To get an idea of how Thix works, you can download
            the raw compressed image of a 3.5" bootable <a href="http://www.hulubei.net/tudor/thix/download/demo/thix-demo.bin.gz">demo floppy</a>.
            Uncompress it with gunzip, dump it on a formatted 3.5"
            floppy and boot from it.  At the login prompt type
            <em>root</em> to enter as superuser or <em>guest</em> to log
            in as an ordinary user.  The <em>root</em> password is
            <em>root</em> and the <em>guest</em> password is
            <em>guest</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are curious and want to install the entire Thix
            distribution (including the GNU C compiler and the related
            utilities), just download the sources (you will need them
            anyway), and read the installation instructions in the
            INSTALL file.
          </p>
          <p>
            Basically, you will have to download the <a href="http://www.hulubei.net/tudor/thix/download/dist/thix-install.bin.gz"> install floppy</a>
            and the packages in the distribution:

<p>One of the central challenges in data science (DS) and machine learning (ML) is
managing and maintaining data quality. As an ML engineer and  practitioner who
frequently constructs, cleans, explores, and models proprietary (i.e. non-benchmark)
datasets, "bad data" makes all the difference between accurate versus misleading
data visualizations, statistical inferences, and models. In this article I want
to hone in on three problems that are fairly unique to DS/ML practice when it comes to
dealing with tabular data in the Python ecosystem using <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/https://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas</a>,
which is one of the de facto tools for data manipulation in the DS/ML toolchain.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<p>Tooling for type safety is improving in the Python ecosystem with the broad adoption
of the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html">typing</a> module and
projects like <a href="http://mypy-lang.org/">mypy</a>, which eases the developer
experience for writing readable, reliable code.</p>
<p>However, for most DS/ML work, this isn't quite sufficient. This is because
logical data types don't always capture the statistical distributions of the
variables under study, which is a key thing to do when, for example, your data
distribution shifts as a result of a world-wide pandemic,
<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/05/11/1001563/covid-pandemic-broken-ai-machine-learning-amazon-retail-fraud-humans-in-the-loop/">causing ML models to break</a>
in unexpected ways.</p>
<p>Having systems in place that fail early (and loudly 🔊) when the data distribution
is not what you assumed is one of the critical pieces to building reliable
production systems, and we need better tooling for this.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<p>Another important tool in the developer's arsenal is testing. There are many
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1617296279">books</a>, <a href="https://kentcdodds.com/blog/write-tests">articles</a>, and
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5357601/whats-the-difference-between-unit-tests-and-integration-tests">discussions</a>
available online about different types of testing techniques and how to put them
into practice. I won't dive deeply into it here, but in short, testing your code
makes it easier to change it and know when you've broken something while at the same time serving as
documentation.</p>
<p>Even in exploratory or research contexts, it's a good idea to write tests for your
code because it strengthens your confidence in the robustness of the insights that
you're taking away from your analysis.</p>

</div><div><div>
<div>
<p>The challenge with testing software compounds when processing data for the
purpose of statistical analysis and modeling.</p>
<p>Consider a machine learning pipeline that creates a predictive model from
survey responses. The barriers to testing data and transformation code
tends to be much higher than the business logic that processes survey responses
and stores raw values in a database because the latter tends to be simpler
and more atomic by design.</p>
<p>By <em>atomic</em> ⚛ I mean that each piece of data that's filled out by respondents
and stored in the database can be tested in isolation without having to
analyze the aggregate statistical patterns across a larger sample of responses.
On the other hand, for my statistical analysis to make sense, the overall
integrity of the statistical distribution 📊 of the responses needs to be taken
into account.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<p>Because the effort that goes into exploring, cleaning, and figuring out how to
test my dataset is so high, I'm discouraged from writing tests for my pipeline
code. As the famous software development quip goes:</p>
<blockquote><p>"legacy code is code without tests"</p>
<ul>
<li>Michael C. Feathers, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Working-Effectively-Legacy-Robert-Martin/dp/0131177052">Working Effectively with Legacy Code</a></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>But you might think: "but when I put my code in production, surely I
– or one of my collaborators – will write tests then?". The thing is,
regardless of who writes those tests or when they're written, someone'll have to
do it at some point, so the sooner and more quickly you can climb
the technical debt mountain 🏔 the better!</p>
<p>In the rest of this post I'll try to convince you that statistical typing gives
us the tools we need to do just that.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<p>If you've used strong, statically-typed languages before, or the <a href="http://mypy-lang.org/">mypy</a>
static type checker with type-hinting in Python, you may have noticed that type definitions can
often catch nasty type-related bugs 🐞 that render certain kinds of unit tests unnecessary. Other
tools, like <a href="https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/">pydantic</a>, enforce types at runtime via a
data parsing model.</p>

<p>Statistical typing extends the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_type">logical data types</a>
to the class of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_data_type">statistical data types</a>
and, ultimately, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_probability_distributions">probability distributions</a>.
Statistical data types builds on top of logical data types, and in fact there's considerable overlap between the two.</p>
<p>For example, the <em>binary</em> logical data type is also a statistical data type. The key
difference is that statistical data types hold additional semantics that govern the kinds
of statistical operations that we can perform on variables of a particular type and
probability distributions that describe those variables.</p>

</div>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<p>What if you can specify the set of acceptable values that a variable can take,
from the data type, set/range of values, or even what distribution a particular
variable is drawn from? This is the goal of statistical typing: to enumerate a
practical set of constraints that specify what should be considered valid data for
a particular dataset.</p>
<p>For example, we might want a <em>categorical</em> variable to be drawn <em>somewhat</em> uniformly
from a set of values <code>{A, B, C}</code>. We can express this as a hypothesis test that
causes our pipeline to fail if any one of the values occurs significantly more
frequently than the others, given a pre-defined level of statistical significance.</p>
<p>Or we may want a <em>real-valued</em> variable to be drawn roughly from a normal
distribution with mean <code>µ</code> and variance <code>σ</code>, which can also be specified with an
alpha value that we deem acceptable for a particular analysis.</p>
<p>In essence, a statistical typing implementation involves specifying three kinds
of metadata for a given set of variables:</p>
<ol>
<li>logical data types, e.g. <code>int</code>, <code>str</code>, <code>float</code>, etc.</li>
<li>deterministic properties, e.g. <code>categorical</code> values and <code>real-valued</code> ranges</li>
<li>probabilistic properties, e.g. sufficient statistics like <code>mean</code> and <code>standard deviation</code></li>
</ol>
<p>The challenge presented by item <em>3</em> is obvious: discovering the underlying
probability distributions of real-world data is often non-trivial. However,
even if we can only express or automatically infer these metadata up to point
<em>2</em>, we can still get something quite powerful 💪: <strong>property-based testing of statistical
analysis code</strong>.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>With a statistically-typed dataframe, not only can we validate real-world data to
ensure that our assumptions about them hold up, but we can also test our data
transformation, analysis, and modeling code <em>given valid samples</em> according to
our schema definition. Statistical typing effectively gives DS/ML practitioners
the tools to easily isolate their code from real-world data, providing a convenient
way of implementing unit tests.</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<p>Let me illustrate how these concepts would work in practice with a toy problem using
<a href="https://github.com/pandera-dev/pandera">pandera</a>, a runtime data validation library
for <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas dataframes</a> that I've been developing over
the last few years.</p>
<p>Suppose you're building a predictive model of house prices given features about
different houses:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<p>In the raw data above you can see that we have the following columns:</p>
<ul>
<li>feature 1: <code>square_footage</code></li>
<li>feature 2: <code>n_bedrooms</code></li>
<li>feature 3: <code>property_type</code></li>
<li>target: <code>price</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Our modeling pipeline will involve two steps:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<h3 id="Defining-Schemas-with-pandera">Defining Schemas with <code>pandera</code><a href="#Defining-Schemas-with-pandera"> </a></h3>
</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>At its core, <code>pandera</code> provides a flexible and expressive API for defining
dataframe schemas and seamlessly integrating data validation logic into your
data analysis pipelines, all while separating the concerns of data cleaning
and validation.</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<p>In the code above, we can see that we're defining a <code>BaseSchema</code>, which shares
columns that are common between the raw and processed data. We're also making
sure that the columns are coerced to the expected data types during validation.</p>
<p><code>RawData</code> and <code>ProcessedData</code> inherit from <code>BaseSchema</code>, and just by looking
at them we can see the difference that we expect between the raw and processed data:
our <code>process_data</code> function should convert the <code>property_type</code> categorical
variable into a set of dummy variables.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<h3 id="Runtime-Data-Testing">Runtime Data Testing<a href="#Runtime-Data-Testing"> </a></h3><p>Now we use python's type-hinting syntax to annotate the <code>process_data</code> and
<code>train_model</code> functions, decorating them with <code>@pa.check_types</code> to make sure
that the inputs and outputs are validated at runtime:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>Now every time we run our pipeline our data is validated as it passes through
the various transformations:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>So if we pass invalid data into <code>run_pipeline</code>, we should get an error:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>Here, <code>pandera</code> tells exactly what went wrong: the <code>property_type</code>
column has an invalid category <code>unknown</code> at the 0th entry.</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<h3 id="Property-based-Testing">Property-based Testing<a href="#Property-based-Testing"> </a></h3><p>But wait, there's more! Since we've already defined our schemas, we can isolate
the processing and model-training code from real-world data to test that
each component in your pipeline is functioning as expected.</p>
<p><code>pandera</code> builds on top of the <a href="https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/">hypothesis</a>
package to generate synthetic data from search strategies that try to find
the simplest case that would falsify your tests:</p>

<p>We could run this as a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html">unittest</a>
or <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/">pytest</a> suite, but for now we can just run the
tests manually like so:</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>So if we were to incorrectly implement any of the components in our pipeline,
we'd see errors early on. In this case, we're just going to return the raw data
without the dummified <code>property_type</code> variable.</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>Here, our test suite catches the fact that <code>property_type_condo</code> doesn't exist
in our processed data output.</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>We can get some more intuition about what's going on with the data synthesis
strategies by interactively generating data using the <code>example</code> method.</p>
</div>

<p>Under the hood, <code>pandera</code> is collecting all of the schema properties and
converting it into a search strategy using the
<a href="https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/numpy.html#pandas">pandas-supported hypothesis strategies</a>.
Currently, one limitation that you can see from the <code>ProcessedData</code> example above is that the
generated data doesn't quite capture the joint distribution between the <code>property_type_*</code> dummy
variables, as the second row contains <code>1</code>s for all of the property types. Depending on</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div id="articleBody"><p dir="ltr"> workers with a universal basic income did not reduce the amount of effort they put into their work, according to an experiment conducted by Spanish economists, a sign that the policy initiative could help mitigate inequalities and debunking a common criticism of the proposal.</p><p dir="ltr">Examining a universal basic income worth about one-fifth of workers' median wages, the researchers also found that the threat of being replaced by robots did not impact workersâ€™ productivity, nor did a tax on firms when they replace a worker with a robot or automated process, though the latter successfully created a disincentive for managers.</p><p dir="ltr">Their <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-020-00676-8">research</a>, published last month in <em>Humanities and Social Sciences Communications</em>, utilized a behavioral economics lab set up by FundaciÃ³n COTEC, a nonprofit organization honorarily led by the king of Spain that promotes innovation as a driver of economic and social development. The foundation aimed to understand how automation and universal basic income may impact entrepreneurs, companies and the public sector.</p><p dir="ltr">Researchers recruited 900 individuals to take part in the experiment, 59% of whom were female and 98% of whom were university students. The average age was 21, with a minimum age of 19 and a maximum age of 30. Participants were asked to work on a set of tasks and were paid based on their performance. Researchers then introduced several different scenarios, such as replacing certain participants with robots and creating a universal basic income worth about one-fifth of the workersâ€™ median pay, to see how worker productivity was impacted.</p><p dir="ltr">Though it was a laboratory experiment, Angel SÃ¡nchez, a co-author of the research and professor at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, said the researchers wanted to ensure their findings would be applicable in real-world situations, so the money given to participants had to be earned.</p><p dir="ltr">â€œItâ€™s not like I just give you money and then you donâ€™t feel you should care much about what to do with it,â€� SÃ¡nchez said. â€œNo â€” you earned it and youâ€™re going to feel itâ€™s yours and you donâ€™t want to throw it away. And thatâ€™s key in the experiment because thatâ€™s what we think gives external validity to the experiment.â€�</p><p dir="ltr">The researchers also vetted their experiment with the FundaciÃ³n COTEC board of trustees, many of whom are part of Spainâ€™s largest companies, â€œand they think this experiment made perfect sense, of course as a stylization of real life,â€� SÃ¡nchez said.</p><p dir="ltr">Though most of the experiment participants were university students, SÃ¡nchez said this, too, adds to the robustness of their methods â€” 40.9% of people under 25 in Spain are unemployed, according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, the highest youth unemployment rate for OECD companies.</p><p dir="ltr">â€œSo we thought that they would be, for this particular problem, a very good audience because this is something that touches upon what they are going through now,â€� SÃ¡nchez said. â€œSo in that respect, Iâ€™m more confident.â€�</p><p dir="ltr">He added, though, that the results of the experiment are likely applicable outside Spain. Finland, for example, experimented in 2017 and 2018 with a universal basic income and <a href="https://www.kela.fi/web/en/news-archive/-/asset_publisher/lN08GY2nIrZo/content/results-of-the-basic-income-experiment-small-employment-effects-better-perceived-economic-security-and-mental-wellbeing">found</a> that it improved individualsâ€™ mental and economic well-being, though the employment effects were small, which SÃ¡nchez said disproves the common argument that a universal basic income would cause fewer people to work.</p><p dir="ltr">The Spanish government, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, has <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-52707551">begun</a> its own nationwide experiment with a monthly basic income, providing approximately $500 to each adult in the program. Spain is prioritizing families, including single-parent households, and hopes to reach 1 million homes with the initiative.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, SÃ¡nchez said he hopes to see more research done on robots and automation, especially around how a tax on substituting a human with a robot might impact the economy.</p><p dir="ltr">â€œItâ€™s probably something governments could try at least on a smaller scale for some sectors and see what happens,â€� he said. â€œBecause this is something that, outside of this experiment, I havenâ€™t seen.â€�</p><p dir="ltr">Though a worker-replacement tax could help pay for a universal basic income, SÃ¡nchez and his colleagues also wrote in their research that an automation tax might impede technical change, which could pose long-term problems for society.</p><p dir="ltr">â€œSo other theoretical studies would be useful, too, in whatâ€™s the way to either prevent workers from being substituted by machines or to get money from the guys that are now using machines to compensate the workers that are laid off,â€� SÃ¡nchez said. â€œThese two schemes need a lot of research. Thereâ€™s very little done there.â€�</p><p dir="ltr"><em>The study â€œRobots, labor markets, and universal basic income,â€� published Dec. 16, 2020, in Humanities and Social Sciences Communications, was authored by Antonio Cabrales, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid; PenÃ©lope HernÃ¡ndez, Universitat de ValÃ¨ncia; and Angel SÃ¡nchez, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid.</em></p></div></div></div>]]>

<p><strong>Abstract.</strong> It is a mystery often mentioned in the foundations of mathematics that our best and strongest mathematical theories seem to be linearly ordered and indeed well-ordered by consistency strength. Given any two of the familiar large cardinal hypotheses, for example, generally one of them proves the consistency of the other. Why should this be? The phenomenon is seen as significant for the philosophy of mathematics, perhaps pointing us toward the ultimately correct mathematical theories. And yet, we know as a purely formal matter that the hierarchy of consistency strength is not well-ordered. It is ill-founded, densely ordered, and nonlinear. The statements usually used to illustrate these features are often dismissed as unnatural or as Gödelian trickery. In this talk, I aim to overcome that criticism—as well as I am able to—by presenting a variety of natural hypotheses that reveal ill-foundedness in consistency strength, density in the hierarchy of consistency strength, and incomparability in consistency strength. </p>



<p>The talk should be generally accessible to university logic students, requiring little beyond familiarity with the incompleteness theorem and some elementary ideas from computability theory.</p>

    <p>I am worried about progressive perceptions of carbon pricing.</p>
<p>But first, a word from our sponsor.</p>
<p><em>“A carbon tax is the most straight-forward and efficient strategy for quickly
reducing greenhouse gas emissions”</em> - Senator Bernie Sanders (D-VT)<label for="b1f4d654302ad3f9065ea4f63103ba604fdb4ad6f1809e4488b966a398d887e8"></label><span>This quote is from his <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/why-we-need-a-carbon-tax_b_5571408" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2014 op-ed in the
HuffPost</a>.
Senator Sanders’ had previously proposed a bill that priced carbon emissions at
$20 a ton, and returned 60% of the income to Americans.
</span></p>
<p>Thank you Senator Sanders! Stay warm out there.</p>
<p>Like I said, I am worried about progressive perceptions of carbon pricing. It
used to be the policy issue that could get Bernie Sanders and <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/26082018/john-mccain-climate-change-leadership-senate-cap-trade-bipartisan-lieberman-republican-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John
McCain</a>
rubbing ideological elbows, but no more, and not because conservatives left the
table. As carbon pricing has gained purchase with <a href="https://www.clcouncil.org/media/2017/03/The-Conservative-Case-for-Carbon-Dividends.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moderate
conservatives</a>,
it seems to have lost even more among progressives.</p>
<p>Some evidence for my concern:</p>
<h4 id="I"><a href="#I" title="I."></a>I.</h4><p>At the start of this essay, I quoted Bernie Sanders’ full throated support of a
carbon tax. That was 2014. Two years later, Senator Sanders hammered Hillary
Clinton in primary debates for her reticence to back a carbon tax. And then
after losing the nomination, he semi-successfully lobbied to give emissions
pricing a mention in the party platform. And then the 2020 Democratic primary
rolled around and…nothing? His campaign was completely silent on emissions
pricing. No mention of it in his <a href="https://berniesanders.com/issues/green-new-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">14,000+ word climate
plan</a>.</p>
<h4 id="II"><a href="#II" title="II."></a>II.</h4><p>Whenever discussion around a Green New Deal gets into specifics, some of its
supporters seem to lightly chafe against emissions pricing, usually by omission
but sometimes outright.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-resolution/109/text" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HR
109</a> and
<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-resolution/59/text" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SR 59</a>,
the pair of congressional resolutions which establish the spirit of the Green
New Deal, don’t mention any form of emissions pricing. Critiques of the language
of these resolutions have been met with the gentle reminder that they’re
resolutions, not specific plans. They’re meant to establish urgency and vision,
not get into details. And yet, into detail they get! Surely if “<em>‘smart’ power
grids”</em> and “<em>proven low-tech solutions that increase soil carbon storage, such
as land preservation and afforestation”</em> are not too granular to mention,
something as simple as a price on carbon might merit a bullet point?</p>
<p>This is especially true as carbon pricing schemes that direct their revenue
towards green investments or return them to Americans as checks fit very well
into the key insight of the Green New Deal: to focus not on obscure climate
policy, but on tangible markers of prosperity like jobs and growth.</p>
<p>Likewise, the Sunrise Movement gets a lot of press as a prominent, young
advocacy group who’ve basically staked their entire platform on the principles
laid out in HR 109. They don’t seem to prioritize carbon pricing much. For
example, their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200317124840/https://scorecard.sunrisemovement.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020 Democratic primary
scorecard</a>
chiefly rated candidates on how their climate plan aligned with the tenets of a
Green New Deal. Out of the many specific policy dimensions candidates were
ranked against, no mention of emissions pricing<label for="61b6a510e04d569dd009f697e716ddae2825deb0dbaa0ca724e29aa589c6da5c"></label><span>Actually, they did have one dimension in the “How They Talk About It”
section: “Proposes solutions beyond taxes and regulation” which seems…kind of
anti-carbon-pricing? Warren and Sanders got 4/4, Biden got 2/4. Out of those
three, Biden is the only to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/policy-2020/climate-change/carbon-tax/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">openly support carbon
pricing</a>.
Warren is “open to it” and Sanders is a no. The analysis on Biden’s score was
that his “plan relies heavily on market-mechanism solutions such as tax
incentives and regulations” while Senator Warren’s plans are “are not unduly
limited to reliance on traditional market mechanisms” and Senator Sanders’
“plans rely heavily on direct investment and direct intervention at the federal
level through a total of $16.3 trillion of federal funding.”
</span>.</p>
<h4 id="III"><a href="#III" title="III."></a>III.</h4><p>There’s fatigue from weak and byzantine carbon pricing schemes like
<a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/cap-and-trade-is-supposed-to-solve-climate-change-but-oil-and-gas-company-emissions-are-up" target="_blank" rel="noopener">California’s cap-and-trade
system</a>.
And there’s a wariness among the progressive left towards anything market based
in general.</p>
<p>Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez captures this mix of fatigue and anti-market
sentiment pretty well,
<a href="https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1094623850141224962?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeting</a>,</p>
<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>For far too long, ideas
like a carbon tax or cap-and-trade were touted as the premier solutions to
climate change.</p><p>While those things could be *part* of a solution, the GND
resolution says they are inadequate as the whole answer.</p><p>The pipes in
Flint weren’t a “market failure.”</p></div>— Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) <a href="https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1094623850141224962?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February
10, 2019</a></blockquote> 


<p>It is a long road from Bernie Sanders’ centerpiece climate policy to “could be
part of a solution”. Bewilderingly, this fall from grace is set against a
backdrop of consistent support from the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/08/climate/carbon-tax-united-nations-report-nordhaus.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scientific and economic
communities</a>.</p>
<p>I think this is not good. In moving away from emissions pricing, we are
discarding one of our most valuable tools, not just for combating climate
change, but for building the political will needed for the fight.</p>
<p>In the following, I’ll make the case that emissions pricing—in the form of a
carbon dividend—is good policy, in a climate sense, in a progressive sense, and
in a political economy sense. This is true for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>At the <em>very</em> <em>least</em>, a carbon dividend can be thought of as a wealth
transfer from the fossil fuel industry and the wealthy to low and middle
income households, and one that also reduces emission by anywhere from a
little to a lot.</li>
<li>There is no better policy for getting people invested in climate change than
to compensate them directly for the damage fossil fuels are doing to their
world.</li>
</ol>
<p>We should establish common ground on what a modern plan for carbon pricing looks
like. The state of the art has moved well past cap-and-trade systems, and
real-world data from other countries is giving us a better idea of what works
and what doesn’t.</p>
<p>Vast oceans of argument rise or fall on fairly technical policy choices, so we
want to be precise here. The more correct term is probably emissions pricing, as
what we’re talking about is raising the cost of emitting a whole host of
greenhouse gases<label for="e10a095059e8611aa37caae4ab96865b5846538baf7f378a7a68f962e3ebea5a"></label><span>For example, we want it to be very expensive to emit methane, which the
IPCC highlights as a critical target for reduction.
</span>, but because of carbon’s existence as a shorthand for many
pollutants, I’ll use emissions and carbon pricing interchangeably.</p>
<p>There are many policies that fall under emissions pricing. For example,
California has a cap and trade policy, which sets a cap on statewide emissions
and then lets companies trade permits that represent their slice of the
emissions pie. In a somewhat roundabout way, this effectively sets a price on
carbon. However, for a myriad of reasons, cap and trade is <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/cap-and-trade-is-supposed-to-solve-climate-change-but-oil-and-gas-company-emissions-are-up" target="_blank" rel="noopener">really hard to get
right</a>,
especially with the ever present lobbying of Oil and Gas. Another common policy
is a carbon tax, though for reasons we’ll get to, it has some politically
pernicious effects. What I describe in the following paragraphs are the
fundamentals of a <em>carbon dividend</em>, a radically effective approach to emissions
pricing.</p>
<h4 id="I-1"><a href="#I-1" title="I."></a>I.</h4><p>First and foremost, emissions pricing is not a cure-all. But it sits at the
heart of pretty much everything.</p>
<p>Climate change is a many-headed hydra. We need<label for="b8d55523d6a79612bdd6b30e5246de1e8b8fd158451e5a633fea885620a0e88e"></label><span>Non-exhaustive list incoming, but loosely sourced from some of the top
solutions from <a href="https://drawdown.org/solutions/table-of-solutions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Project
Drawdown</a>.
</span> reliable, renewable energy at
a competitive price, we need to reduce emissions from agriculture, transit,
housing, and refrigeration, and at the same time, keep people fed, employed,
housed, and cool in ever-hotter summers. And while the suburban homeowner might
be the first to install solar panels and better insulation, she’ll fight you on
density and transit. And while France promises to decarbonize, her former
colonies, reliant on colonially-imposed, export-oriented monocultures, have
inherited colonialism’s plunderous economic model.</p>
<p>No, there is no silver bullet for this. But there is a common thread. It is
cheap to emit. But emission itself is not cheap—hurricanes and wildfires
supercharged by a changing climate are testament to that. This disparity
underlies virtually all the facets of the climate crisis. The suburbs can
sprawl, because it is cheap to drive everywhere and heat huge homes. We can have
our grass-fed<label for="6c3e273de5c1427c5f55beb6db4d797da0c0bd0aac7cf8729737d7d1392843ff"></label><span>Grass fed cows <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2019/08/13/746576239/is-grass-fed-beef-really-better-for-the-planet-heres-the-science#:~:text=A%20number%20of%20past%20studies,belches%20over%20their%20longer%20lifespans." target="_blank" rel="noopener">produce more methane over their lifetime than feedlot
cows</a>
since they take longer to grow to full size. However, the grasslands they graze
on sequester a lot of carbon. So if you’re creating or preserving grass for the
cows, grass-fed might actually emit less. But, if the grasses were already going
to be there, grass-fed seems worse. It’s not super clear.
</span> steaks and eat them too, because California wildfire victims
don’t get to collect on cow burps<label for="bd3632af708cb83cfe141b2b9463e4fd352d0bbd4c4770066310ec89011ec4e0"></label><span>They do, however, get to collect on Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, whose
equipment started the fire. Except, that’s really expensive, so PG&amp;E goes
bankrupt. And as part of that bankruptcy, they agree to pay the wildfire victims
with <em>shares of PG&amp;E</em>. On this topic, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-02-13/it-s-good-if-people-want-tesla-stock" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg’s Matt
Levine</a>
writes, “In the ordinary course, the way U.S. bankruptcy and corporate law works
is that if a company owes people more money than it can pay, those people get to
own the company instead. Thus, if a company does bad enough things to enough
people, the remedy is that those people end up owning the company.” Except, not
starting wildfires as a power company in California is pretty hard, and so it’s
pretty likely that PG&amp;E, who is now actually just the victims of last year’s
wildfire, will get sued by the victims of <em>this year’s</em> wildfires. “The rule is
the rule: If you own a company and it does a lot of harm, you have to give the
company to the people it harmed, even if you only own the company because you’re
one of the people it previously harmed.”

      <h3 id="accidental-habit-development-a-year-of-walking">Accidental Habit Development: A year of walking</h3><p>I'm terrible at setting new habits. I've tried every habit app, journal method, hiding things, etc and I'm still at around 10% success rate of choosing a new habit and sticking to it.</p><p>One thing I've learned: I'm equally terrible at the habit of using habit apps.</p><p>Nearly by accident, I set a new habit in 2020 that has been consistent for 320 straight days: taking a walk. February last year, I set a (tiny) goal of walking for at least 10 minutes. Every day. I used the Streaks App, but connected to Apple Heatlh. Any time I started a walk on the Apple Watch, the time was automatically tracked in Streaks. No manual tracking required. Any time I completed a walk of 10 minutes or more, I'd get a push notification from Streaks happily encouraging me for completing my task and updating my progress.</p><p>When I first started, I was consistent because of a nascent willpower. I'd set a goal in a moment of aspriation and wanted it done. Walking 10 minutes was also <strong>easy</strong>: if I was close to missing a day, I'd feel silly not to walk 5 minutes away from my house and back. The Streaks app also acted as a safety net. If I hadn't completed a walk, I'd get a notification <strong>prompt</strong> that I was about to "break the streak". FOMO kicked in and I'd dutifully get up and start a brisk walk. It was also <strong>automated</strong>, I didn't have to build the habit of using a habit app, everything just worked. </p><p>Here's why:</p><ul><li><strong>Ease:</strong> Instead of trying to make a big change, the task was very achievable, even when motivation was low. It's more important to build consistency. The snowball rolling down the top of the mountain.</li><li><strong>Automated:</strong> The main value of a habit app is showing progress and keeping you honest (see prompts below). The problem is they require a separate behavior: tracking if your goal is done! Because the tracking is coupled with the behavior (taking a walk updates the Streaks app), all the value is received with no extra effort.</li><li><strong>Prompts: </strong>The system defaults to "internal" prompts: I should walk because I want to. But, if it's an off day or motivation is low, the Streaks app detects when a miss is imminent and sends a notification. It's like a safety net for habit development.</li></ul><p>Over time something changed... I wasn't doing the walk because it was easy. I was walking because it was just something I did."You're awake, time to walk." Walks became more than just a basic way to improve fitness. They became thinking time, time to call my Dad, or jot notes and thoughts. Now I walk 1-2 hours every morning (have had to wake up earlier for this) and can't imagine giving it up.</p><figure><img src="https://kylewill.blog/content/images/2021/01/Slice-1--52-.png"></figure><h3 id="how-does-behavior-science-explain-why-this-works">How does behavior science explain why this works?</h3><p>BJ Fogg founded the Behavior Design Lab at Stanford and has popularized the <a href="https://behaviormodel.org/">"Fogg Behavior Model" (FBM)</a>. The FBM states that each <strong>behavior</strong> consists of: sufficient <strong>motivation</strong>, sufficient <strong>ability</strong>, and the presence of a <strong>prompt</strong>. Without all three, the behavior doesn't happen. </p><figure><img src="https://kylewill.blog/content/images/2021/01/image.jpeg"><figcaption>Credit: BJ Fogg (behaviormodel.org)</figcaption></figure><blockquote>Behavior = Motivation + Ability + Prompt</blockquote><p>This explains why the walking habit stuck while others have not. The behavior required very little motivation or ability. Most importantly, loading the next prompt required zero behavior. The act of walking loaded up the next prompt and Streaks could know whether to alert to a potential miss. </p><p>What if I could apply the same principles to other habits? A system to <strong>automatically prompt</strong> <strong>easy</strong> habits?</p><h3 id="automated-information-diet-habits">Automated Information Diet Habits</h3><p>One key 2021 focus for me is my information diet. There's a glut of urgent, must-know-now, break-neck-paced news coming out the past year. And it's not slowing down. I want to stay informed, but doom-scrolling doesn't help.</p><p>The first part of improving my information diet involved setting limits on <strong>neutral-bad inputs: </strong>increase social media (Twitter/LinkedIn for me) use, mindless reddit browser, etc. h/t to Brendan Short's "<a href="https://whatilearned.substack.com/">What I Learned</a>" Substack for ideas to limit Screen Time. </p><p>The second part involves increasing input of <strong>good inputs.</strong> I'm trying to increase the time I spend reading books and long form articles. And I've found a system (10 days in) that uses the same principle as the walk habit.</p><p><strong>Here's how the system works high-level:</strong></p><figure><img src="https://kylewill.blog/content/images/2021/01/Slice-2--10-.png"></figure><ol><li>Whenever I open an app for long-form articles or books (Pocket, Kindle) a timer is started in Streaks automatically</li><li>When I close the app, the timer is stopped</li><li>When the cumulative goal time (10 minutes for now) is reached, the daily Streak is marked complete</li></ol><p>That's it. That's the system. It hits all the necessary ingredients:</p><ul><li><strong>Ease:</strong> The goals are simple 10 minutes reading a book and 10 minutes reading for learning. And since the goal is cumulative time, dropping into a book for 2 minutes still has positive reinforcement. </li><li><strong>Automatic: </strong>No need to separately track the goal. The act of doing the task is coupled with tracking the goal.</li><li><strong>Prompts:</strong> The Streaks app notifies externally if I'm about to miss a streak. But I'm also testing a new passive prompt: app recommendations. I've replaced half my home screen with a widget that displays "Siri recommended apps". Based on how you use your phone, apps are suggested to open. I'm noticing Kindle and Pocket showing up in this list more and more over the past ten days. </li></ul><p>So far, I'm 100% covering every day (even though not every day has been high motivation). Excited to share more as the habits build momentum.</p><hr><h3 id="how-exactly-the-system-works-and-how-you-can-use-it-too-">How exactly the system works. And how you can use it too.</h3><p>The secret to automatically tracking my reading involves the Streaks habit app, and Apple's built-in Shortcuts app. </p><p>Shortcuts allow for setting up workflows on your iPhone/iPad similar to IFTTT or Zapier but for apps. They also include "Personal Automations" that automatically run shortcuts when certain conditions are true: connecting to WiFi, arriving home, or (importantly) when certain apps are opened or closed. </p><p>I created two shortcuts that accept the name (or keyword) of a Timed Task in Streaks, and start or stop respectively the timer for that task. </p><p>For each app I want to trigger a Timed Task, I create a "Start" and "Stop" Personal Automation that includes the name (or keyword) of the desired Task and starts when a given app is opened or closed. </p><h3 id="running-this-yourself-">Running this yourself. </h3><figure><iframe width="356" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Ak0p6VFDT4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><figcaption>How the automatic tracking looks at the end.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong></p><ul><li>Install the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/streaks/id963034692?mt=8&amp;ign-mpt=uo%3D4">Streaks App</a> and setup at least one <em>timed </em>task.

Something that would feel silly <em>not</em> to do if you missed it. </li><li>Open the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shortcuts/id915249334">Shortcuts</a> app on your phone (built-in) and run at least one of the Shortcuts in the gallery. <em>Apple will not let you follow the below process until you've run at least one Shortcut.</em></li><li>Open Settings &gt; Shortcuts and select "Allow Untrusted Shortcuts".

    <p><a href="https://github.com/hermitcore/rusty-hermit">RustyHermit</a> is a unikernel, which is completely written Rust. <a href="http://unikernel.org/">Unikernels</a> are application images that directly contain the kernel as a library, so they do not require an installed operating system (OS).&nbsp;They are typical used in virtualized environments, which build the backbone of typical cloud / edge infrastructures.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>


<h2 id="virtualization-designs">Virtualization Designs</h2>
<p>Common virtualized environments are based on classical <strong><em>virtual machines</em></strong>. In this case, complete machines are emulated or virtualized and common operating systems are running on both host and guest site:</p>
<p><img src="https://rust-osdev.com/showcase/rusty-hermit/common_vm.png" alt="Structure of a common virtualitation environment"></p>
<p>This technique is established (VMware, Hyper-V, etc.) and widely used. However, it introduces additional overhead especially regarding memory consumption and performance.</p>
<p>An alternative approach to common virtual machines is <strong><em>OS-level
virtualization</em></strong>, where the&nbsp;kernel&nbsp;allows the existence of multiple
isolated&nbsp;user space&nbsp;instances. These isolated instances are also known
as container. A typical representative is LXC or Docker and promise less
overhead in comparison to common virtual machines. However, the
isolation between the processes is weaker and may provide less security.</p>
<h2 id="unikernels">Unikernels</h2>
<p>Often only one application (e.g. a web server) is running in the container or the virtual machine. In this case, a <em>unikernel</em> is an attractive solution. The kernel is provided as static library and linked to the application. As the images directly contain the OS kernel, unikernels can directly be booted inside a virtual machine and do not require the typical software stack containing a Linux kernel and its userland within the VM.</p>
<p>Unikernels do not provide system calls in the classical sense, as everything is running with the privilege level of a kernel and what is typically done via system calls is provided via a common function call. At first glance, this sounds more insecure than previous approaches. However, these kernels are expected to run within a virtual machine, which isolates the application from the real system. In addition, common compiler analysis is used to check the complete software stack and unneeded components can even be removed, which can reduce the attack surface of the application.</p>
<p><img src="https://rust-osdev.com/showcase/rusty-hermit/libos.png" alt="Structure of a library operating system"></p>
<p>Well known unikernels are kernels such as <a href="https://mirage.io/">MirageOS</a>
and <a href="http://www.unikraft.org/">Unikraft</a>. MirageOS is written in OCaml,
while Unikraft still uses C as programming language. In contrast to these
kernels, RustyHermit is completely written in Rust to benefit from
Rust's performance and security behavior.</p>
<h2 id="rustyhermit">RustyHermit</h2>
<p>In principle, every existing
Rust application can be built on top of RustyHermit. However, unikernels
are a single tasking operating system. Consequently, the support of the
system call <code>fork</code> and inter-process communication are missing. In
addition, a classical C library is missing, which is typical used as
interface to the operating system. Every crate, which bypasses the
standard runtime and tries to communicate directly to operating system
does not work without modifications. However, many applications do not
depend on these features and work on RustyHermit.</p>
<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>
<p>Unikernels can be highly optimized. For instance, we optimized the
network stack of RustyHermit. RustyHermit uses
<a href="https://github.com/smoltcp-rs/smoltcp">smoltcp</a> as network stack, which
is completely written in Rust. As interface between guest and host
operating system, we use
<a href="https://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Virtio">Virtio</a>, which is in a
para-virtualized driver for KVM and widely used in virtualized Linux
environments.</p>
<p>The following figure compares Linux with RustyHermit,
where both are running as guests inside a virtual machine running on top
of a Linux-based host system:</p>
<p><img src="https://rust-osdev.com/showcase/rusty-hermit/bandwidth.png" alt="Bandwidth of the RustyHermit's exerimental network interface"></p>
<p>Especially for small messages RustHermit
is faster in than Linux.</p>
<h3 id="research">Research</h3>
<p>RustyHermit is also a research project to evaluate new operating
system designs, which improves the scalability and the security of operating systems in cloud environments. For instance, RustyHermit provides classical
techniques to improve the security behavior like stack guards and
separating the application stack from the libOS stack. However, a
library operating system typically uses a common function call to enter
the kernel. A classical separation of user- and kernel space by
entering a higher privilege level is missing.</p>
<p>We presented in a
<a href="https://www.ssrg.ece.vt.edu/papers/vee20-mpk.pdf">paper</a> a modified
version of RustyHermit, which provides an intra-unikernel isolation with
<em>Intel Memory Protection Keys</em> (MPK). MPK is a relatively new hardware
primitive that provides per-thread permission control over groups of
pages in a single address space with <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc19/presentation/park-soyeon">negligible switching overhead</a>,
making it a compelling candidate for use in unikernels.</p>
<p>MPK is requiring modification of page tables at a small performance cost. Four previously-unused bits of each page table entry (the 62nd to the 59th on x86-64) are exploited by MPK. Since MPK exploits four bits of the page table entry, it supports up to 15 protection keys.
MPK controls per-thread permission on groups of pages. Each core has a PKRU register (32 bits) containing a permission value. The value of the PKRU register defines the permission of the thread currently running on that core for each group of pages containing a protection key in their page table entries. Unlike page-table-level permission, MPK provides thread-local memory permission.</p>
<p>We provide user / kernel separation so we simply see the entire application as an untrusted component, independently of application-specific characteristics such as the language it is written in or the level of skill of the application’s programmer. In addition, we divide the kernel code into trusted and untrusted components. Trusted kernel components represent pieces of code written with a memory-safe language, i.e., offering strong security guarantees. Untrusted kernel components correspond to code written either in memory-unsafe languages or in unsafe Rust code blocks.</p>
<p>By entering the library operating system through the application binary interface the protection keys will be automatically changed, which allows access to the kernel stack and the kernel heap. Unauthorized access from within the application will trigger a pagefault, which will be handled by the library operating system.</p>
<h3 id="example-project">Example Project</h3>
<p>To give you an example on how to build an RustyHermit application, lets create a new cargo project:</p>
<pre><code><span>cargo</span><span> new hello_world
</span><span>cd</span><span> hello_world
</span></code></pre>
<p>RustyHermit currently requires the nightly versions of the Rust toolchain.
To simplify the workflow, we recommend to create the configuration
<em>rust-toolchain</em> as follows to define the required components and to
tested version of nightly compiler:</p>
<pre><code><span>[toolchain]
</span><span>channel </span><span>= "</span><span>nightly-2020-12-23</span><span>"
</span><span>components </span><span>= [ "</span><span>rustfmt</span><span>", "</span><span>rust-src</span><span>", "</span><span>llvm-tools-preview</span><span>"]
</span><span>targets </span><span>= [ "</span><span>x86_64-unknown-hermit</span><span>" ]
</span></code></pre>
<p>The configuration file specifies the required components and the version of the nightly compiler to use.</p>
<p>The RustyHermit's target <code>x86_64-unknown-hermit</code> is part of Rust
supported platforms, but doesn't belong to the <em>tier 1</em> platforms,
which means that official binary releases aren't available and the
standard runtime must be build from scratch.
To simplify this build process, we recommend to create the configuration
file <code>.cargo/config</code> as follows:</p>
<pre><code><span>[unstable]
</span><span>build-std </span><span>= ["</span><span>std</span><span>", "</span><span>core</span><span>", "</span><span>alloc</span><span>", "</span><span>panic_abort</span><span>"]

[build]
</span><span>target </span><span>= "</span><span>x86_64-unknown-hermit</span><span>"
</span></code></pre>
<p>To bind the library operating system to the application, we have to add the crate <a href="https://crates.io/crates/hermit-sys"><code>hermit-sys</code></a> to the dependencies in the file <code>Cargo.toml</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span># Cargo.toml

</span><span>[target.'</span><span>cfg(target_os = "hermit")</span><span>'.dependencies]
</span><span>hermit-sys </span><span>= "</span><span>0.1.*</span><span>"
</span><span>features </span><span>= ["</span><span>smoltcp</span><span>"]
</span></code></pre>
<p>The feature <code>smoltcp</code> is required if your application tries
to establish a TCP connection. In this case, the library operating systems
includes the TCP/stack <a href="https://github.com/smoltcp-rs/smoltcp">smoltcp</a>.
In addition <em>hermit-sys</em> depends on the tool <a href="https://crates.io/crates/cargo-download">cargo-download</a> to download required components and must be installed with the command <code>cargo install cargo-download</code>.
Finally, the application can be build with the common command <code>cargo build</code>.</p>
<p>The result is a 64-bit excutable in the <a href="https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/elf/elf.pdf">executable link format</a> (ELF).
To start the application within a common virtual machine, a loader is required, which initialize the processor and start the applications.
We provide a simple loader on <a href="https://github.com/hermitcore/rusty-loader">GitHub</a>.
A makefile to build the loader is part of the project.
After that, Qemu can be used to start RustyHermit in a VM as follows:</p>
<pre><code><span>qemu-system-x86_64 -display</span><span> none</span><span> -smp</span><span> 1</span><span> -m</span><span> 64M</span><span> -serial</span><span> stdio</span><span>  -kernel</span><span> path_to_loader/rusty-loader</span><span> -initrd</span><span> path_to_app/app</span><span> -cpu</span><span> qemu64,apic,fsgsbase,rdtscp,xsave,fxsr
</span></code></pre>
<p>To improve the performance, KVM can be used to use the virtualization extension of modern processors.</p>
<pre><code><span>qemu-system-x86_64 -display</span><span> none</span><span> -smp</span><span> 1</span><span> -m</span><span> 64M</span><span> -serial</span><span> stdio</span><span>  -kernel</span><span> path_to_loader/rusty-loader</span><span> -initrd</span><span> path_to_hello_world/hello_world</span><span> -enable-kvm -cpu</span><span> host
</span></code></pre><h3 id="roadmap">Roadmap</h3>
<p>For the near future, we plan to stabilize the interface to the hardware.
For instance, the support of <a href="https://virtio-fs.gitlab.io/">Virtio-fs</a>
is in an early stage. In addition, the integration into Rust standard
library isn't finalized yet and the current version runs only on x86. In the
future, we want to also support aarch64 as processor architecture.</p>

				<p>I consider myself a software craftsman. As every craftsman, I take good care of my craft. I create it, I augment it, and occasionally I reduce it. </p><p>Adding new features always makes me happy and I can understand why. I augment something that I really care about, making it even better. What I find difficult to understand is why I take so much joy when I am deleting code.</p><p>It just doesn't make sense. Every line of code I wrote has cost me time and/or mental effort. Sometimes a significant amount of both. I should feel bad when I figure out that I don't need this massive block of code or this feature is just useless and needs to be removed. </p><p>My only explanation is that it has to do with my mental model when building and understanding software. By default, I try to fit the entire program I am working on in my mind. By fit, I mean that, at some capacity, I try to be able to "dry run" the program myself. I can "calculate" what output the program might produce when certain inputs are given. </p><p>And I do this almost all the time while developing. When modifying a method, when refactoring some part of the code, when moving variables around. I quickly perform "tests" to ensure that I am not breaking anything.</p><p>(Ideally, software is split into self-contained modules for this exact reason: to be able to work on a module without the need to understand almost anything outside of it. But in reality, this rarely happens. Modules are rarely self-contained and small enough projects are not split into modules at all. Anyway, this is a subject for another time.)</p><p>Therefore, I suspect that the joy I get when I have to delete some code is not for the deletion per se. The joy comes from the simplification. If the codebase is reduced then it will be easier to "fit" it in my mind when trying to "dry run" it.</p><p>This better understanding leads to increased happiness when working on the codebase and the joy I am referring to. I am not happy about getting rid of something I spend time and energy on in the past. I am happy because the reduced code size will require less mental effort when working on that project.</p><hr><p><a href="https://www.rockandnull.com/subscribe/"><strong>Subscribe to our non-annoying-once-a-month digest :)</strong></a></p><hr><p>So there you go. Go and delete that unneeded feature without feeling guilty about the joy you get. Until another feature takes its place and you are back to square 0 :)</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">  <section itemprop="articleBody"> <p>SwiftUI was introduced to the world at WWDC in June 2019. While the main goal for SwiftUI is to build rich user interfaces on iOS and other Apple platforms, it can also be used to do other fun things.</p> <p>I couldn’t resist using SwiftUI from the command line, and I wrote about it in <a href="https://medium.com/@eneko/rasterizing-swiftui-views-from-the-command-line-80d974356c4a">Rasterizing SwiftUI views from the command line</a> to showcase how to generate static images (PNG, JPEG, etc). I published the code in GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/eneko/ConsoleUI">ConsoleUI</a>.</p> <p>Last December I used this same technique to generate social media preview images for this blog. I wrote <a href="https://www.enekoalonso.com/articles/issue-13">Generating Social Media preview images with SwiftUI and GitHub Actions</a> so other people like you could do it too.</p> <p>Today, I’m writing about generating application icons for iOS with SwiftUI. You guessed it: from the command line.</p> <h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2> <p>You can start by cloning my <a href="https://github.com/eneko/ConsoleUI">ConsoleUI</a> repo, which I have updated today to run on Xcode 12.4 with the latest SwiftUI available. Feel free to begin with an empty project too. If you do this, you’d probably want to follow the steps on the README file from that repo, or refer back to my first article on this topic.</p> <p>Xcode does not support live previews on Swift packages yet (FB8979344). To allow for realtime previews follow these steps:</p> <ol> <li>Generate an Xcode project (<code>swift package generate-xcodeproj</code>)</li> <li>Add a macOS target to the project</li> <li>Add your view to the macOS target (target <code>Foo</code> on the screenshot below)</li> </ol> <p>The generated project and target files don’t need to be committed to your repository, but you can do it if that makes it easier for later use.</p> <p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32922/105608907-b6c90800-5d5a-11eb-80d9-32de73138e75.png" alt="MySwiftUIView"></p> <p>If you cloned <code>ConsoleUI</code>, at this point you should be able to run the following commands:</p> <div><div><pre><code>swift build                  <span># build project</span>
swift run <span>&amp;&amp;</span> open test.png   <span># rasterize image and open in Preview app</span>

First, it implies that the latter is an external invader that bears no essential relation to the liberal society that they believe it threatens, even though their own account suggests otherwise: that critical theory is an exaggerated version of the virtues (such as “skepticism”) they attribute to liberalism. Second, their reliance on metaphor is in tension with their assertion that language can straightforwardly characterize reality.</p><p>In the <a href="https://outsidertheory.com/metanarrative-obsolescence-on-cynical-theories-part-2/">second installment</a>, I noted that despite their objection to the “postmodern theme” of the “power of language,” they attribute a great deal of power to language, since they believe that a handful of not particularly widely read books have single-handedly undermined the basis of liberal democracy. Returning to the seminal account of the “postmodern condition” elaborated by Jean-François Lyotard, I attempted to offer a more materially grounded account of the rise of the body of thought Pluckrose and Lindsay are describing. In the process, I challenged their assumptions about the process by which “postmodern” ideas have spread.</p><p>Here, I will continue to make the case that the “postmodern principles” and “themes” Pluckrose and Lindsay are targeting derive directly from the internal evolution of the scientifically and technologically advanced liberal capitalist societies they set out to defend. I will begin by returning to one of their “postmodern themes,” which I also addressed previously: “the power of language.”</p><p>“Under postmodernism,” they state, “many ideas that had previously been regarded as objectively true came to be seen as mere constructions of language.” They appear to be bemused and baffled by the “reject[ion of] the commonsense idea that words refer straightforwardly to things in the real world,” and make no effort to understand why anyone might come to question this idea, much less why it might lose traction more broadly. Instead, they resort to pathologization, attributing to postmodern thinkers like Jacques Derrida an “obsession with language” and a “neurotic postmodern fixation upon words.” Again, their indifference to causal explanation is striking: given that such an emphasis on language has become widespread, one might imagine that, even if it is as delusional as they say, they would be interested in the conditions that have made people embrace it. But no such curiosity is evident in their account.</p><p>A more precise term for the emphasis on the “power of language” Pluckrose and Lindsay are describing is “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_turn">the linguistic turn</a>,” a phrase popularized by the philosopher Richard Rorty. Numerous disciplines, beginning with philosophy and spreading across the humanities, became increasingly focused on language over the course of the twentieth century, especially its latter half. Yet this shift in emphasis did not begin with postmodern thought, but with philosophers like Frege and Russell, and somewhat later in French structuralism, which attempted to apply the scientific advances achieved in modern linguistics to a broad array of cultural phenomena by way of various disciplines. The centering of language, then, began not with skeptics and relativists, but with thinkers who viewed the systematic study of language as a means of elaborating a more rigorous methodology in philosophy and the “human sciences.”</p><p>This fact is significant because the “linguistic turn” also closely tracks the scientific and technological advances of the twentieth century and the broader economic and social changes they enabled. As discussed previously, Lyotard refers to the “computerization” of knowledge and the economy over the course of postwar period the main source of the “postmodern condition.” In essence, the latter phrase is another way of referring to what others have dubbed the “information society.” As Lyotard writes: “in a society whose communication component is becoming more prominent day by day, both as a reality and as an issue it is clear that language assumes a new importance.” This development, he says, is closely related to the expansion of language-oriented fields of research, including “phonology and theories of linguistics, problems of communication and cybernetics, modern theories of algebra and informatics, computers and their languages, problems of translation and the search for areas of compatibility among computer languages, problems of information storage and data banks, telematics and the perfection of intelligent terminals…”</p><p>The “linguistic turn,” then, has its basis in shifts in social and economic relations, and has far broader intellectual effects than the emergence of the specific academic theories that usually fall under the heading of “postmodernism.” The “power of language” has become a central theme in an era when language, in the general sense of the term, plays a key role in the production process. To regard a thinker like Derrida’s preoccupation with language as a personal idiosyncrasy, as Pluckrose and Lindsay seem to do, is to ignore this context.</p><p>We do not need to look to a “postmodern” thinker like Lyotard to find versions of this observation. Back in 1991, the liberal economist and Robert Reich coined the term “symbolic analysts” to describe the rising white-collar workforce of the post-industrial economy. The point of Reich’s use of this term is that a variety of professions, from graphic designers to engineers to lawyers to financial analysts to newspaper editors, centrally involve the manipulation of symbols. In a computerized society oriented toward the production and circulation of information, Reich argued, those who acquired symbol-manipulation skills would be rewarded, while those engaged in manual work would decline in status. Furthermore, as the acceleration of these trends magnified inequality, these skilled workers would pull away more and more from the rest of the population, economically and culturally. Reich called this the “secession of the symbolic analysts.”</p><p>In his 1994 book <em>The Revolt of the Elites</em>, historian and cultural critic Christopher Lasch builds on Reich’s analysis of this class. He writes that “[t]hey live in a world of abstractions and images, a simulated world that consists of computerized models of reality—’hyperreality,’ as it has been called.” In a brief but suggestive passage, Lasch links the popularization of “postmodernist thought” to “the experience of living in an artificial environment from which everything that resists human control (unavoidably, everything familiar and reassuring as well) has been rigorously excluded.” He writes that as a result, “the thinking classes have seceded not just from the common world around them but from reality itself.” Lasch’s diagnosis roughly accords with that of “postmodernists” like Lyotard and especially Baudrillard, who was not attempting to promote “hyperreality” but to chart its emergence out of a specific set of economic and technological arrangements. Lasch, however, was perhaps too certain that those outside of the elite sphere would avoid being subsumed within this “artificial environment.”</p><p>Since Lasch’s death in the same year <em>Revolt</em> appeared, two developments have made his book prophetic in unanticipated ways. First of all, almost all of us have become “symbolic analysts” in our free time even if not in our working lives. That is, the computerized environment that was largely restricted to white-collar offices in the 1980s and early 1990s has become the universal domain of the screen, in which we all exist during work, leisure, or both. Second, the prospects of younger entrants to the “symbolic analyst” class have declined. As Julius Krein <a href="https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2019/11/the-real-class-war/">documents</a>, this decline correlates with the increasing radicalization of political discourse among the highly educated. Unsurprisingly, if we take seriously Lasch’s account of the submersion in artificiality the computerization of experience entails, this radicalization has been inflected by the “postmodern themes” Pluckrose and Lindsay document. This is not simply because these ideas have been widely taught in universities, as they seem to think, but because they are intuitive to people whose lives take place online.</p><p>In <em>Life on the Screen</em>, a prescient book that appeared just a year after Lasch’s <em>Revolt</em>, sociologist Sherry Turkle anticipated this ongoing process. Her book was one of the first to focus on how the internet was shifting people’s experiences of social life and individual identity. She was writing a decade before the mass adoption of social media, but her analysis centers on one of its forerunners, Multi-User Domains (MUDs). She writes that in such spaces, “technology is bringing a set of ideas associated with postmodernism . . . into everyday life.” Echoing the link between computerization and the linguistic turn proposed previously, she states: “In my computer-mediated worlds, the self is multiple, fluid, and constituted in interaction with machine connections; it is made and transformed by language.” “Computers,” she concludes, “embody postmodern theory and bring it down to earth.” When Turkle wrote these statements in 1995, she was describing what were still relatively niche experiences. Today, what Turkle calls the “multiple, fluid self made by language” is the main forms in which most of us present ourselves to the world.</p><p>With this background in mind, the emergence of the “postmodern themes” documented by Pluckrose and Lindsay looks more like an effect of profound material, social, and economic changes than of the influence of a few dozen philosophers. The wide resonance of those themes helps account for the popularity of those philosophers’ ideas, which have furnished a portion of the educated class with a kind of mythology of the information age. However, the same themes have also pervaded …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>On January 14 this year, Google bought Fitbit (a &nbsp;wearables company) for 2.1 billion dollars!</p><p>The question is why a big name like Google buy a smaller company like Fitbit and such an acquisition is worth billions of dollars?!</p><p>The same question goes for many big names and another question comes up because these big companies have very talented engineers who are able to replicate what small ones can do. So what makes big companies think about buying more in the first place?</p><p>Reasons may differ from one company to another; it may also interchange with another reason, but we can distill some important reasons why acquisitions can happen to small brilliant startups.</p><h2>Increasing market share</h2><p>Acquiring a startup from a big company point of view can make the big one have the small company’s clients hence its market share will increase. That’s what happened when Uber acquired Careem for $3.1B to <a href="https://www.uber.com/newsroom/uber-careem/" target="_blank">expand the greater Middle East region</a></p><h2>Geographical diversification</h2><p>When a dominant company sees potential in a specific geographic region, it looks for a rising startup that has a strong chance of growth.</p><p>However, this is the riskiest reason for acquisition because of the differences in culture, management, marketing, and sales between the acquired company and the corporate.</p><p>Example: Amazon acquiring Souq.com (<a href="https://www.cmswire.com/digital-experience/why-amazon-acquired-souqcom/" target="_blank">the biggest e-commerce player in the Middle East</a>) for $580M in cash</p><h2>Product diversification</h2><p>Companies develop their businesses by diversifying their products into new ones to expand their sales from new products and acquire new customers.</p><p>Examples: </p><ul role="list"><li>Acquiring Google to many small companies that are not in its primary market (search engines)</li><li>Facebook acquiring Oculus (the Virtual Reality company) as Mark Zuckerberg <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-facebook-bought-oculus-2014-11" target="_blank">reported</a>, “a new communication platform.”</li><li>Amazon acquiring Twitch (the video live streaming service)</li></ul><h2>Eliminating potential competition</h2><p>In 2012, Facebook bought Instagram — the 13-employee company that time which had 15 million users. Acquired for 1 billion dollars.</p><p>Two years later, Facebook bought WhatsApp — a 50-employee company that had 450 million active users at that time. The acquisition was worth $19B!</p><p>Eliminating a potential competition for Facebook in the long-term was a big reason why the acquisitions for WhatsApp and Instagram happened. It’s quite intuitive that we use our phones, the more data the platform collects, so the more money!</p><p>On the other hand, Blockbuster — an 84,300-employee company in 2004 founded in 1987 which could have bought Netflix for $50 million but the CEO considered that as a joke. </p><p>Blockbuster had 400+ stores and was dominating in the video rental industry until Netflix left it behind and now Blockbuster has just 3 employees and 1 store in Dallas!</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Reasons vary when a big firm acquires a startup whether to increase their market share, enter a new market region, diversify their products, or eliminate potential competition.</p><p>Whatever the reason is, it should always end up with high profitability to the acquirer in the long run and an instant revenue to the acquired one.</p><h2><a href="http://bit.ly/3mneyrK" target="_blank">Click here</a> to get fresh content to your inbox</h2><h2>Resources</h2><ul role="list"><li><a href="https://www.inc.com/minda-zetlin/netflix-blockbuster-meeting-marc-randolph-reed-hastings-john-antioco.html" target="_blank">Blockbuster Could Have Bought Netflix for $50 Million, but the CEO Thought It Was a Joke</a></li><li><a href="https://ar.quora.com/%D9%84%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B0%D8%A7-%D8%AA%D8%B4%D8%AA%D8%B1%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D8%A8%D8%B1%D9%89-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%AA" target="_blank">لماذا تشتري الشركات الكبري الشركات الناشئة</a></li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mergers_and_acquisitions_by_Alphabet" target="_blank">List of companies acquired by Google</a></li><li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/02/19/crazy-like-a-facebook-fox/" target="_blank">A Year Later, $19 Billion For WhatsApp Doesn’t Sound So Crazy</a></li><li><a href="https://www.uber.com/newsroom/uber-careem/" target="_blank">Uber to Acquire Careem To Expand the Greater Middle East Regional Opportunity Together</a></li><li><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-facebook-bought-oculus-2014-11" target="_blank">The Real Reason Facebook Bought Oculus</a></li><li><a href="https://www.cmswire.com/digital-experience/why-amazon-acquired-souqcom/" target="_blank">Why Amazon Acquired Souq.com</a></li><li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/03/amazon-souq-com-completed/" target="_blank">Amazon completes its acquisition of Middle Eastern e-commerce firm Souq</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/amazon-nears-deal-to-acquire-twitch" target="_blank">Amazon to Acquire Twitch for $970 Million — The Information</a></li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockbuster_LLC" target="_blank">Blockbuster | wiki</a></li><li><a href="https://www.gazprom-energy.co.uk/blog/diversifying-and-entering-new-markets-how-to-plan-for-success/" target="_blank">Diversifying and entering new markets: How to plan for success</a></li></ul><p>Published on my new medium publication:&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/the-brainwave/why-big-companies-buy-small-ones-be95211b29a6?sk=bac17084562fedf6550f86504955921e">Brainwave</a>, make sure to follow it!<br></p></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
 		
<p><span>01</span> Intro</p>



<p>Sparked by <a href="https://twitter.com/dwr/status/1273307320911450112">an interesting Twitter discussion</a>, I’ve spent a lot of time recently thinking about different proof-of-work mechanisms. </p>



<p>When I say proof-of-work, I’m not talking about consensus algorithms like the ones that some crypto currencies use. I’m talking about social networks.</p>



<p>At their core, social networks are primarily about one thing: Building social capital through signaling. As I wrote in <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/03/28/signaling-as-a-service/">Signaling as a Service</a>, signaling can be broken down into three different components:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Signaling Message</strong><br>A hidden status subtext you’re trying to convey about yourself</li><li><strong>Signaling Distribution</strong><br>The channel through which you’re communicating your signaling message</li><li><strong>Signaling Amplification</strong><br>Ways to boost your signaling message to compete against status rivals</li></ul>



<p>For example: A Patagonia vest signals both a prosocial attitude (<em>“I care about the environment</em>“) as well as wealth (“<em>I can afford to spend $500 on a jacket</em>“). Depending on where you live, it might also signal something about <a href="https://vcstarterkit.com/">your occupation</a>.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/patagucci.png"></p><p>In order to signal these messages to others and build actual social capital you need a signaling distribution channel. One option would be to wear the vest in public where others can see it – but there are obvious physical constraints to the size of the audience you’d be able to reach.</p>



<p>This is where social networks come in.</p>



<p>Their primary role is to distribute signaling messages at scale and transform them into quantifiable social capital (in the form of likes and followers).</p>



<p>As social networks grow, they increase the potential reach of your signaling messages – but they also get crowded with status rivals. This is why social networks typically provide you with a set of signaling amplification tools. These tools help you boost your signaling messages and stand out from the crowd.</p>



<p>In <a href="http://julian.digital/2020/03/28/signaling-as-a-service/">Signaling as a Service</a> I compared signaling amplification to <a href="https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2019/2/19/status-as-a-service">Eugene Wei’s idea of proof-of-work hurdles</a>, which he describes as follows:</p>



<p><i>Almost every social network of note had an early signature proof of work hurdle. For Facebook it was posting some witty text-based status update. For Instagram, it was posting an interesting square photo. For Vine, an entertaining 6-second video. For Twitter, it was writing an amusing bit of text of 140 characters or fewer. Pinterest? Pinning a compelling photo. You can likely derive the proof of work for other networks like Quora and Reddit and Twitch and so on. Successful social networks don’t pose trick questions at the start, it’s usually clear what they want from you.</i></p>



<p>But the more I think about it, the less I like the comparison. I actually think that Eugene’s proof-of-work theory only scratches the surface of what social networks actually do.</p>



<p>Let me explain.</p>



<p><span>02</span> A closer look at proof mechanisms</p>



<p>Take a look at this very cliché Instagram picture. The photographer clearly put a lot of thought and effort into its composition and applied different filters and editing tools to make it look nicer.</p>



<figure>
<img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/creativework.png">
<figcaption><span>Full disclosure: I actually took this picture from Unsplash. No influencers were harmed during the production of this blog post.<br></span>
</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s a perfect example of Eugene’s definition of proof-of-work. <br>Proof-of-<strong><em>creative</em></strong>-work, to be more exact. </p>



<p>Editing your photo helps to amplify your signaling message and sets you apart within Instagram’s status arena (aka the newsfeed). It also adds additional signaling messages to your post: <em>“Look how great a photographer I am”</em> or <em>“I’m a creative person”</em>.</p>



<p>But those are not the main signaling messages you are communicating here. What you really want to tell your followers with this photo is something along the lines of <em>“I’m a world-traveler”</em> and <em>“I’m in a happy relationship”</em> <span>(which in turn are also just signaling proxies for wealth and mating worthiness)</span>. </p>



<p>The photo and the location tag are your proof points.</p>



<figure><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/igexample02-1.png">
<figcaption><span>If you look closely, you’ll notice additional hidden signaling messages in the form of Allbirds sneakers and what’s most likely a Patagonia vest → proof-of-ownership<br></span>
</figcaption></figure>



<p>Social networks are therefore not only signaling distribution (and amplification) networks – they also allow users to prove their signaling messages. </p>



<p>The creative proof-of-work is just pretext and helps to boost your post. What’s more important are the additional proof mechanisms that social networks provide. In the case of Instagram those are photos and location tags.</p>



<p>Instagram is essentially “pics or it didn’t happen”-as-a-service.</p>



<p><span>03</span> Implications for new social networks</p>



<p>When new social networks emerge they have to introduce new proof mechanisms to differentiate themselves from existing incumbents. These can either be novel proof-of-creative-work hurdles or completely new proof-of-x mechanisms.</p>



<p>TikTok is a good example for proof-of-<em>creative</em>-work innovation. The app provides creators with a powerful set of video editing tools that have opened a whole new level of creativity. </p>



<p>The cost to participate in TikTok’s status game is a lot higher than Instagram’s <span>(compare a well-made dance choreography on TikTok to your median Instagram travel post)</span> – but its powerful feed algorithms also make discovery easier and thus reward users faster and with more social capital. </p>



<p>TikTok doesn’t add any new proof points beyond its novel creative work hurdle though. You can signal and prove your creativity but you could achieve the same by uploading your video to Instagram.</p>



<p>Strava, on the other hand, introduced an entirely new proof mechanism: Proof-of-physical-activity. By using your phone’s GPS sensor (or a 3rd-party fitness tracker), users can actually prove how much and fast they ran or cycled. In contrast to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/10/20/grounded-private-jet-hire-helps-russians-fake-lavish-lifestyles/">Instagram</a> <a href="https://www.vice.com/da/article/wdaqgw/instagrams-ballers-discount-private-jets-324">photos</a>, Strava’s proof mechanism is a lot harder to fake <span>(though there are <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=fake+strava+5k+downhill&amp;oq=fake+strava+5k+downhill">exceptions</a>)</span>.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/stravaproof.png"></p><p>What’s great about Strava is that it reinforces a behavior that’s actually good for you: While the status game that initially got you into the app might be zero sum, the actual physical exercise you have to put in to compete has a very positive, compounding effect.</p>



<p>The question is: What other social networks should we build that could have similar positive feedback loops? And what are their proof mechanisms?</p>



<p><span>04</span> Strava for X</p>



<p>Let’s start with the two examples in <a href="https://twitter.com/dwr/status/1273307320911450112">this tweet</a>.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/tweetstrava.png"></p><p>I love the idea of a <strong>Strava for Cooking</strong> – but I’m very skeptical that it can be built. Why? Because the necessary proof mechanisms don’t exist.</p>



<p>The primary metric you optimize on when cooking is taste. But how would you measure or quantify taste? The closest proxy to taste that we have is optics: How good does the meal that you cooked look? This can easily be proved with a photo .. but that’s a proof-of-work mechanism that Instagram already offers (including filters to make your food look nicer). As long as no one comes up with a better proof mechanism for cooking, I think it’s unlikely that we will see a successful social network in the space.</p>



<p>I’m more optimistic about <strong>Strava for Learning</strong>.</p>



<p>While the activity of learning itself might be hard to quantify, you can measure the outcome of learning: knowledge. Has anyone built a multiplayer version of <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> yet? Flash cards would be a perfect proof-of-knowledge mechanism and could easily be turned into a game where you compete against friends.</p>



<p>Similar to physical activity in the Strava example, learning is not something that most people enjoy doing. As TikTok founder <a href="https://youtu.be/wTyg2E44pBA?t=245">Alex Zhu points out</a>, education goes a little against human nature. In combination with a strong enough signaling mechanism however, you can get users to participate. It’s kind of the opposite of <a href="https://cdixon.org/2015/01/31/come-for-the-tool-stay-for-the-network">Chris Dixon’s famous “Come for the tool, stay for the network” strategy</a>. Come for the status, stay for the tool.</p>



<p>A related product I’d love to see is <strong>Strava for Reading</strong>. Imagine an eBook reader that not only tracks how much time you spend reading but also *what* you are reading. Based on these proof-of-(reading)-work mechanisms you could build streaks or GitHub-contributions-like visualizations that incentivize users to read more (and more regularly).</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/githubforreading.png"></p><p>You could even build leaderboards for different topics based on the content of the books and articles you read. Or think about a score that indicated how balanced your reading behavior per topic was (to incentivize users to read takes on political topics from different perspectives).</p>



<p>Unfortunately, I think it’s unlikely that we will see a product like I described anytime soon. <a href="https://twitter.com/lehrjulian/status/1086659965719404544">The world’s largest bookstore, most popular eBook reader, and biggest social network for books</a> are all owned by a company that has very little competency in design and user-facing product innovation.</p>



<p>(Side note: Amazon’s monopoly on books might be the most underrated sub-optimal equilibrium in tech.)</p>



<p>Another app that would be interesting is a social investing app. Think “Robinhood but as a social network”. It seems like investing is already quite a social activity – just look at <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-26/reddit-s-profane-greedy-traders-are-shaking-up-the-stock-market">communities like r/wallstreetbets</a>. As <a href="https://twitter.com/patio11/status/1250703738634829824">patio11 pointed out</a>, Robinhood already feels more like a game than a finance app.</p>



<p><img src="https://julian.digital/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/robinhood.png"></p><p>So why not build an investing app that opens with a feed of all your friends’ investments and their returns over time? Instead of sharing screenshots on Reddit and Instagram you could prove your investments right in the app.</p>



<p><strong>Note that an app like this would not be about signaling wealth. It’s about signaling <em>being right</em> and the ability to prove it</strong>. This is probably an even stronger and more engaging mechanism than signaling wealth – and the reason why I’m still bullish on prediction markets.</p>



<p>Perhaps a well-designed, consumer-friendly prediction market app would be the ultimate proof-of-x social network. <strong>Strava for being right.</strong></p>



<p><span>05</span> A Closing Ask</p>



<p>While we are on the topic of being right: Do you agree with my thoughts in this post? What other social networks and proof-of-x mechanisms would you like to see?</p>

					<span>UPDATE JAN 24, 2021:</span><br>Over the weekend Moderna announced the release of lot number 013M20A, manufactured approximately January 21st (according to our estimate based on each lot's expiration date). For more on how we arrive at these estimates, see <em>Where The Data Comes From</em>, below.
					
					Moderna's U.S. COVID-19 vaccine delivery rate averaged 476,000 doses per day during the latter half of December, but has dropped substantially in the new year, currently averaging just 301,000 doses per day since January 1. To put this in perspective: the company would need to sustain a manufacturing rate of 1.1 <em>million</em> doses per day in order to fulfill its commitment to deliver 100 million doses by the end of March...a goal that currently looks unachievable.
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>TECH NOTE: A LOT OF TROUBLE</span><br>
					Moderna's vaccine lot number 041L20A <a target="_blank" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-01-18/moderna-vaccine-allergic-reaction-california-batch">made the news</a> last week when a cluster of 6 vaccine recipients in San Diego developed severe allergic reactions, prompting the state of California to place a temporary hold on vaccinations using that lot. Moderna and the FDA are currently investigating the issue.
				</p>
				<p>
					From our perspective as dose-trackers, that event provided both some new information <em>and</em> some additional uncertainty. Our estimates of the number of US doses delivered by Moderna hinge on our assumption regarding lot sizes - how many doses of vaccine bear the same lot number. We base our estimate of that number on <a target="_blank" href="https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-provides-covid-19-vaccine-supply-update">Moderna's own statement</a>, on January 4, that <em>"approximately 18 million doses have been supplied to the U.S. Government to date,"</em> plus its report of 26 lots delivered up to that time, enabling us to calculate an average of 692,000 doses delivered to the US government per lot.
				</p>
				<p>
					Last week's news regarding lot 041L20A thus surprised us, when <a target="_blank" href="https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/statement-california-department-public-health-cdph-report">Moderna revealed</a> that the lot in question comprised 1.27 million doses, of which 964,900 had been delivered to the government.
				</p>
				<p>
					For the moment we have chosen to stick with our initial estimate of an average of 692,000 doses delivered to the government per lot, rather than the number revealed this week for lot 041L20A (965,000 doses) because the former is based on the average of 26 lots, whereas the latter is based on a single lot. We will continue to monitor information from several sources, including Moderna itself, and may adjust our lot size estimate in future, as warranted by available evidence.
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>WHY THE SLOWDOWN?</span><br>Moderna has not yet publicly discussed the dial-back in its U.S. manufacturing rate, so we're left to speculate. Our best guess is supply chain issues.
				</p>
				<p>
					Previously, Moderna's vaccine was produced exclusively by contract manufacturer <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lonza.com/">Lonza</a> at its Portsmouth NH facility. But that changed this week when Lonza gained <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-swiss/lonza-gets-swiss-ok-to-start-moderna-vaccine-production-paper-idUSKBN29808X">approval</a> from Switzerland's regulatory agency, Swissmedic, to begin manufacturing at its huge Visp, Switzerland facility as well. Lonza's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1682852/000168285220000023/lonzamodernagltafullye.htm">contract</a> with Moderna stipulates that <em>"In no event will LONZA or its Affiliates ship, or be instructed to ship, to the United States any Product Manufactured at any Facility outside of the United States."</em> That means that raw materials like the specialty lipids that go into Moderna's vaccine, which may be in short supply, are now needed by two facilities, only one of which makes vaccine for the U.S. market. The data we report here reflects only U.S. production.
				</p>
		
				<p><span>WHERE THE DATA COMES FROM:</span><br>Pharmaceutical companies normally treat their manufacturing data like state secrets, sharing them with the FDA only because they are required to, and even then only in strictest secrecy, out of the public eye. But these aren't normal times, and so the public has an unusual opportunity to track <a target="_blank" href="https://www.modernatx.com/">Moderna Therapeutics</a>' COVID-19 vaccine production rate with unprecedented clarity.</p>
			
				<p>The company's RNA-based COVID-19 vaccine, authorized by the FDA on December 20th of last year, was rushed to market long before the company knew for sure just how long the product's shelf life would be. At the time, ongoing testing had already established that its shelf life was <em>at least</em> 6 months, but still more testing would be required to reveal how much <em>longer</em> than that it might be safely stored before losing potency. That's a critical void in our knowledge for a vaccine that is America's best hope (so far) for stemming the pandemic that has already killed more than a third of a million Americans. So Moderna took the unusual step of printing no expiration dates on its vaccine vials, instead providing <a target="_blank" href="https://www.modernatx.com/covid19vaccine-eua/providers/vial-lookup">a page on its web site</a> where pharmacists and other interested parties can search for a vial's lot number and learn the company's current best guess regarding its expiration date. That's helpful because the product's current six month shelf life is likely to be found in the near future to be considerably longer than that, so this web page enables the company to revise each production lot's expiration date as future data provides deeper insight.</p>
			
				<p>But that same expiration look-up page also (and apparently unwittingly) reveals to the educated eye everything we need to know in order to track Moderna's vaccine manufacturing pace <em>in real time</em>, eliminating our dependence on the company or the federal government for answers to the critical question of how rapidly it is is cranking out the life-saving vaccine doses that will ultimately bring this deadly pandemic to an end. When you type in a vaccine lot number and click the page's 'Submit' button, Moderna's web server (housed by Amazon Web Services) replies to that query with <a target="_blank" href="https://lnl-dl.s3.amazonaws.com/Moderna/expiry.json">a JSON file</a> listing every lot of vaccine the company has released so far, along with each lot's current expiration date. Back-calculating from that expiry date, using the current 6-month shelf life figure for the vaccine, thus enables us to determine each lot's manufacturing date. And finally, we know how many doses an average lot of vaccine includes, based on the company's <a target="_blank" href="https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-provides-covid-19-vaccine-supply-update">January 4th announcement</a> that <em>"approximately 18 million doses have been supplied to the U.S. Government to date."</em> The company had produced 26 lots of vaccine in the U.S. by that date, thus allowing us to calculate that an average production lot amounts to about 692,000 doses.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Web technologies have evolved a lot in the past few years, both on the server-side as well as on the client’s side. There are many web frameworks, UI kits, JavaScript libraries and everything you need to easily and rapidly develop a website or web application. JavaScript libraries have matured and gotten very powerful and processing power, even on low-end computers, does not really pose a problem nowadays for most web-apps. Because of this, web applications have gotten more complex, user interfaces fancier and… programmers lazy.</p><p>Because JavaScript frameworks are so powerful, many are tempted to write business logic in the client-side part of the application. While this can save processing power for the server by unloading computational tasks to the user, and is highly recommended when ever possible, it may pose some security problems. This is especially true if the user can submit data to the server via forms or other input method.</p><p>Because of this, always perform server-side validation of any request, even if you (usually) have a client between the server and the user. Let us look at three scenarios and how failing to validate the input received poses a security vulnerability. Furthermore, even though it may seem obvious that there is a problem, this is not always the case and variations from all three scenarios were real problems I saw in real products.</p><h4>Scenario 1: Privilege escalation by altering user role</h4><p>For the first scenario we will be looking at an application that has different roles for registered user. It can be any such web-app, but I will consider it a content management system like WordPress. Here, users can have different roles: Administrator, Editor, Contributor, Normal User. Any user that is Contributor or above can change the role of another user, but he can’t grant higher privileges than what he has. For example, an Editor can’t make somebody else an Administrator.</p><p>To achieve this, the user edit page has a form with the user’s information and a drop-down with the possible user roles. The page is rendered using the template engine (in this example I will be using Twirl from Play Framework) and the acceptable values are indeed supplied by the server. Our malicious user is a ‘Contributor’, so only two roles should be available for him.</p><div><div><pre><code lang="dart">&lt;select&gt;
@for(role&lt;-acceptableUserRoles) {
  &lt;option value="@role.getIdHash()"&gt;@role.getName()&lt;/option&gt;
}
&lt;/select&gt;</code></pre></div><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="388" height="116" src="https://petrepopescu.tech/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://petrepopescu.tech/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1.png 388w, https://petrepopescu.tech/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1-300x90.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 388px) 100vw, 388px"></figure></div></div><p>Now, our programmer thought that he is smart and, for the value, he explicitly set it to an ID Hash. This is the hash of the ID of the role in the database since the app is quite complex and new roles can be added if needed. He even makes sure that the has received when a user is saved is valid and corresponds to an actual role. The method that handles the request looks something like this.</p><pre><code lang="java">public Result saveUserRole(Http.Request request) {
    Form&lt;UserInfoDTO&gt; form = formFactory.form(UserInfoDTO.class).bindFromRequest(request);
    if (form.hasErrors()) return badRequest();
    
    List&lt;Role&gt; roles = rolesDao.getRoles();
    Role submitedRole = null;
    for (Role role:roles) {
        if (role.getIdHash() == form.get().role()) {
            submitedRole = role;
            break;
        }
    }

    if (role == null) return badRequest();

    UserDO user = userDao.find(form.get().userId());
    if (user == null) return notFound();

    user.setRole(role);
    userDao.update(user);

    return ok();
}</code></pre><p>At first glance, everything seems to be ok. The form is validated, the role is validated, the user is requested from the database, and let’s even assume that there is a CSFR token that protects from malicious submits. Can you spot the problem? The server assumes that because the UI code was generated on the server, the role received is one of the roles that the user has permission to offer. There is no check to see if the role that is being attributed is not higher than what the current user has.</p><div><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="542" height="85" src="https://petrepopescu.tech/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://petrepopescu.tech/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-2.png 542w, https://petrepopescu.tech/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-2-300x47.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 542px) 100vw, 542px"></figure></div><p>Our malicious user can simply open the inspector in the browser and edit the HTML to add a new value to the &lt;select&gt;</p></div><p>Yes, he must know the hash, but if other protection mechanisms aren’t in place, he can just brute-force it since he knows the format. If these are default values and not randomly generated at each install, the task can be even easier since the user can install a dummy application on his computer and find the hash this way.</p><h4>Scenario 2: Access to confidential pages by knowing/guessing the URL</h4><p>Another common mistake is failing to check if a user has access to a page or not. There are multiple variations on this, either by failing to validate that a page is accessible to a specific role or by failing to validate the visibility of a page. We will look at both cases here.</p><p>This time we will be dealing with the presentation website for a company and they are about to launch a new product. The editors write the needed materials, prepare the new product page and wait for the product to be revealed in a few days so they can publish the page. Everything is ready, including final URL for the new product page, since it had to be sent to news outlets beforehand.</p><p>One such outlet was not included in the original press release, but because it is a high-profile company and there are rumors about the new product, they want all the juicy info as well. So they begin to try and guess the URL of the new product page. They know the name of the product and based on passed products, have an idea of how the new page’s URL may look like. Since the CMS fails to validate that an article was actually published or not, by accessing the URL the news outlet has all the information they need and can freely publish them faster than any other news site.</p><p>A variation on this can happen in complex systems as well. It is not uncommon for some functionalities or pages of a site to be inaccessible if the user does not have the right role. The developer made a list of pages that are visible for each user and based on that list and the currently logged in user, it builds the menu in the HTML file. This is done in a similar fashion to the select form from the first scenario. If the developer assumes that the user will navigate only by clicking the menu items in the UI, he may oversee server-side validation. This way, an user can access a page that he is not supposed to simply by entering the correct URL. This is a problem quite frequently encountered in web-apps that are not mature or still undergoing development, but with a public version already released.</p><h4>Scenario 3: Server overload by abusing API calls</h4><p>In the next scenario, the problem is not only server-side validation but multiple coding decisions that together caused a server outage. It all started with a reverse-lookup for the coordinates (latitude and longitude) of an address using Google Maps API. The server was to place points on a city based on the address (Country, State/County, City only). The more addresses at a specific location, the bigger a dot would be on the map. If coordinates for the full address could not be found, it would drop the city and try for the State/County, and if that also fails, only for the country.</p><p>Now, for each new address, there would be a call to the Maps API after which the coordinates would be cached so that there won’t be a new call. This was done both for efficiency and for cost reduction since the API calls are taxed. The problem was that if the address was incorrect, nothing would be cached. It was assumed that, since the UI has drop-downs for all three input fields, the values would be correct.</p><p>Now, let’s change the scenario a bit and assume that instead of one user doing POSTs from a web page (something easily manageable via rate limiters), our server actually processes large files with thousands of entries. A typo in one of the countries caused each look-up to fail and as a result, a new call to the API for each entry in the file, rapidly rising costs, slowing down processing, and eventually putting a halt since all tokens available to the API were consumed.</p><p>Was the server-side validation the only culprit? Definitely not, but doing at least basic validations would have helped drastically reduce the number of calls. The list of valid countries is easy to include and even states/counties are doable without a lot of effort.</p><h4>Conclusions</h4><p>At this point, I hope it is obvious why server-side validation of input data is always needed. It may not always be enough to prevent a problem, but it will at least make it more manageable. In some cases, it can only cause minor inconveniences, but it most scenarios it can have serious consequences, data leaks or higher cost for the company.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>The Embroidered Computer is an exploration into using historic gold embroidery materials and knowledge to craft a programmable 8 bit computer.<br>
Solely built from a variety of metal threads, magnetic, glas and metal beads, and being inspired by traditional crafting routines and patterns, the piece questions the appearance of current digital and electronic technologies surrounding us, as well as our interaction with them.</p>
<p>Technically, the piece consists of (textile) relays, similar to early computers before the invention of semiconductors. Visually, the gold materials, here used for their conductive properties, arranged into specific patterns to fulfill electronic functions, dominate the work. Traditionally purely decorative, their&nbsp;pattern here defines they function. They lay bare core digital routines usually hidden in black boxes. Users are invited to interact with the piece in programming the textile to compute for them.</p>

January 24, 2021 | https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/a-new-newsletter/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/a-new-newsletter/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p>Dan Luu has been trying for months to persuade me that I should start a paid newsletter so that I can spend more time researching and writing interesting things. He hardly ever even mentions the existence of his own <a href="https://www.patreon.com/danluu/posts">private patreon posts</a> and still manages to make decent pocket money out of them, so this doesn't seem like an unreasonable idea.</p>
<p>I produce a lot of writing that mostly just gets sent to friends or left to rot on my hard drive. When I get around to turning something into a blog post it <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/from?site=scattered-thoughts.net">tends to end up on the Hacker News front page</a>. It still seems kind of crazy to me that anyone might want to pay for my writing, but it also used to seem crazy to me that people would pay for my code. Maybe I'm just not very good at capitalism.</p>
<p>So I'm going to give this a go - any <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/jamii/card">github sponsors</a> at any tier will get access to all the new posts. Using github instead of substack is maybe a weird choice, but I want to be able to embed katex and interactive demos in the posts and provide code alongside for examples and case studies. I also expect to be releasing more open-source software this year as a side-effect of doing less consulting.</p>

<p>Here are the kinds of things that I might be working on and writing about this year:</p>
<ul>
<li>Big projects 
<ul>
<li>Past examples - <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/a-practical-relational-query-compiler-in-500-lines/">A practical relational query compiler in 500 lines of code</a>, <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/relational-ui/">A UI library for a relational language</a>, <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/julia-as-a-platform-for-language-development/">Julia as a platform for language development</a>, <a href="https://kevinlynagh.com/reltron/">A UI for exploring relational databases</a></li>
<li>Designing a database query language that supports abstraction. An <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/imp-intro/">ongoing</a> project which is 80% done and just needs a sustained slog to finish the last 80% and produce a clear writeup and demo.</li>
<li>Building a text editor from scratch. An <a href="https://git.sr.ht/%7Ejamii/focus">existing project</a>, already in daily use. Posts will start with absolute basics (eg how to render simple UI in opengl) and eventually catch up to ongoing development (currently working on editing 1gb files at 60 fps without dropping frames).</li>
<li>Benchmarking streaming systems. A new project for 2021. Existing streaming benchmarks suffer from problems like <a href="https://github.com/frankmcsherry/blog/blob/master/posts/2015-01-15.md">measuring how well they can parallelize the overhead they added to the original problem</a>, <a href="https://github.com/frankmcsherry/blog/blob/master/posts/2018-02-11.md">mostly measuring distributed json de/serialization</a> or even just <a href="http://highscalability.com/blog/2015/10/5/your-load-generator-is-probably-lying-to-you-take-the-red-pi.html">quietly ignoring pauses</a>. I want to figure out how to measure these systems correctly, begin to map out the space of engineering tradeoffs and try to extract some lessons for designers of future systems.</li>
<li>Building an embedabble relational database with incrementally maintained views. Another new project for 2021. An attempt to place the ideas from <a href="https://github.com/TimelyDataflow/differential-dataflow/">differential dataflow</a> into a <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/why-isnt-differential-dataflow-more-popular/">more accessible</a> form.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Little projects
<ul>
<li>Past examples - <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/staged-interpreters-in-rust/">Staged interpreters in Rust</a>, <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/zero-copy-deserialization-in-julia/">Zero-copy deserialization in Julia</a>, <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/open-multiple-dispatch-in-zig/">Open multiple dispatch in zig</a>, <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/pinephone-first-steps/">Writing a simple app for the pinephone</a>, <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/vive-experiments/">Vive experiments</a></li>
<li>Ideas for 2021:
<ul>
<li>See if the <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9152719">IJON fuzzer</a> can discover new planning bugs in SQL databases</li>
<li>Record my screen for an entire week long coding project. Find out where the time goes and what the bottlenecks are.</li>
<li>Figure out how to measure the battery usage of desktop programs on linux, and find the biggest offenders.</li>
<li>Figure out how to execute arbitrary zig expressions when debugging a running program. Maybe <a href="https://frida.re/">frida</a> can inject them?</li>
<li>There's some folk wisdom that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09930">multiway join algorithms</a> are more robust to planning errors than traditional binary joins. Is this true? Why?</li>
<li>Experiment with using <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2020/02/securing-firefox-with-webassembly/">embedded wasm sandboxes</a> to prevent memory safety bugs from escalating into vulnerabilities.</li>
<li>Figure out how to systematically avoid common benchmarking mistakes eg is it possible to eg combine <a href="https://github.com/plasma-umass/coz">coz</a> and <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/%7Eemery/pubs/stabilizer-asplos13.pdf">stabilizer</a> or will they interfere with each other?</li>
<li>Can differential dataflow handle late-arriving data by using bitemporal timestamps?</li>
<li>Document how to use the <a href="https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy">tracy profiler</a> via C bindings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://distill.pub/2017/research-debt/">Distilling</a> existing research in my own field eg:
<ul>
<li>Why don't existing query planners work well for streaming systems?</li>
<li>How can we optimize query plans for worst-case performance over a range of input sizes, rather than best-case performance over the current input sizes?</li>
<li>Why do modern databases contain compilers?</li>
<li>How does <a href="https://github.com/TimelyDataflow/differential-dataflow/">differential dataflow</a> work? How does it differ from <a href="https://github.com/janestreet/incremental">Incremental</a>? Which approach is better for which problems?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reading
<ul>
<li>Literature reviews, mostly focused on databases, query languages, query planning (especially in streaming systems), compilers, incremental view maintenance, self-adjusting computation</li>
<li>Book summaries. I <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/notes.html">used to publish</a> summaries of everything I read. Even though they aren't linked from anywhere anymore google still sends a few thousand people to them each month, so I guess they must be useful. I typically read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/scattered-thoughts">~100 books</a> per year, of which ~25 are non-fiction, mostly tech, cognitive science, economics, sociology etc. </li>
<li>Other curiosity-driven binges eg <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/qnd-review-of-ppig-1989-2015/">reading every paper ever published in the Psychology of Programming Interest Group</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Random musings eg <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/small-tech/">Small tech</a>, <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/frugality-is-non-linear/">Frugality is non-linear</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I've spent the last 7 years building database engines, query planners, compilers, developer tools and interfaces for <a href="https://materialize.com/">Materialize</a>, <a href="https://www.relational.ai/">RelationalAI</a>, <a href="https://developer.logicblox.com/technology/">LogicBlox</a> and <a href="http://witheve.com/">Eve</a>, as well as various smaller consulting gigs and personal research projects. I expect to be informative when talking about those subjects, and at least entertaining when talking about other subjects.</p>
<p>Some of the posts will also be published on this blog. Others will be exclusive to the newsletter. I expect the schedule to consist of bursts of activity interspersed with weeks of frustrated silence.</p>
<p>It may seem strange, but this is one of the most frightening things I've done in years. I can only see that as a good sign.</p>

The quality and completeness of data has greatly improved at TMDB over the years and we think with some re-alignment of community resources, it can work really well as Trakt’s primary TV data source.</p><p id="4e87">What it really boils down to is a moral opposition to taking in data from a community and then trying to sell it back to them. We believe when a user contributes to an online data source, they mean for that work to be shared with everyone around them. Both TMDB and Trakt have open and free APIs for developers to build upon that hard work.</p><p id="fded">TVDB is enforcing a commercial paid model to get access to their community moderated data. The first option is a commercial agreement with an app directly, but we’ve heard TVDB is asking for unrealistic licensing fees compared to an app’s revenue. The second option is charging users directly to access TVDB data. That doesn’t really work either, since that means an app is dependent on users paying a 3rd party service to work.</p><ol><li id="938a">New TV shows are imported using TMDB as their data source <em>(all new shows since November 2020 already use TMDB)</em></li><li id="5713">When we do nightly data refreshes, we compare TMDB with TVDB to determine if the seasons and episodes match up. <em>(we’ve gathered data on over 20,000 shows since November 2020)</em></li><li id="9fe3">We created a <a href="https://trakt.tv/transition/tmdb/updates" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>comparison page</strong></a> for TMDB and TVDB data.

We’re also working on tools to help Trakt users verify and indicate a show can be switched to TMDB. <em>(this will happen soon)</em></li></ol><p id="ac2a">Many of you help moderate TVDB and TMDB, and we can’t thank you enough for doing that! It helps Trakt and the thousands of other apps that use metadata from both sources.</p><p id="e53b">We need your help to ensure TMDB data is complete and ready for the transition. This means keeping TV shows updated with new episodes as they air and backfilling old shows with incomplete seasons and episodes.</p><blockquote><p id="474d">Please read the <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/bible" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>TMDB Contribution Bible</strong></a> and follow all the rules for contributing data. Our goal isn’t to simply replicate TVDB data over, but rather update TMDB using their rules and standards.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>January 24, 2021</p>
      <p>Clubhouse is moving quickly today, but in some ways it feels like the journey started a long time ago. The two of us met back in 2011 through a mutual friend, and we connected over a shared love of social products. Back then, Rohan had been working on ways to help friends find each other in cities, and Paul was building an app called Highlight to help people form friendships with others around them. Over the next ten years we both kept working on social products—experimenting with new apps, failing, and starting again.</p>
      <p>In the fall of 2019, we reconnected over some work that Rohan was doing to help his daughter Lydia, who was born with a rare genetic disease, and eventually that reconnection led to us finally teaming up to work together. Against our better judgment, and with the support of two very patient spouses, we decided to give social apps one last try.</p>
      <p>After a lot of iteration in the audio space, we launched Clubhouse in March of last year. Our goal was to build a social experience that felt more human—where instead of posting, you could gather with other people and talk. Our north star was to create something where you could close the app at the end of the session feeling better than you did when you opened it, because you had deepened friendships, met new people and learned.</p>
      <p>· &nbsp; · &nbsp; ·</p>
      <p>Unlike our other attempts, Clubhouse seemed to strike a real chord with people, and it has accelerated quickly over the past ten months—from a small handful of beta testers into a diverse and growing network of communities. This past week, two million people around the world—musicians, scientists, creators, athletes, comedians, parents, entrepreneurs, stock traders, non-profit leaders, authors, artists, real estate agents, sports fans and more—came to Clubhouse to talk, learn, laugh, be entertained, meet and connect. It’s the most exciting thing we’ve ever been a part of.</p>
      <p>The thing we love most is how voice can bring people together. No matter where you live in the world or what networks you have access to, in Clubhouse you can be in the room—often with people whose lived experience has been very different from your own. In one of the most turbulent and troubled years many of us have experienced, people on Clubhouse have come together for important and nuanced conversations on topics of social justice reform, BLM and anti-racism. When Ruth Bader Ginsburg died, room after room filled the hallways with people discussing constitutional law, sharing stories about RBG’s childhood, and praying in silence together. Each week, parents of children with genetic diseases gather in Clubhouse to discuss medical developments with doctors, researchers and other parents—talking, debating and learning.</p>
      <p>We’ve also been blown away by the brilliance and creativity of the Clubhouse community. Each night in Clubhouse, there are now thousands of rooms filled with people hosting game shows, recapping NBA games, singing opera, discussing philosophy, meeting other musicians, sharing travel tips, running support groups, and meditating together. They’re hosting daily talk shows, performing standup comedy, playing guitar and giving history lectures. In December, forty strangers who met on Clubhouse auditioned, rehearsed, and hosted a full-blown musical production for thousands of people that made national headlines. They are creating entirely new ways for people to come together, all through the power of voice.</p>
      <p>· &nbsp; · &nbsp; ·</p>
      <p>Our focus now is on opening up Clubhouse to the whole world. With that goal in mind for 2021, we have secured a new round in funding, led by Andrew Chen at a16z, who also led our Series A. It’s always been important to us to have investors who care deeply about diversity, and who will work hard to help us make Clubhouse a welcoming and inclusive community. We now have over 180 investors in Clubhouse—large and small, spanning many different races, genders, and areas of expertise, and including many members of our early community. While we’ve never felt that fundraising itself is a milestone, we wanted to share how we plan to use these funds to make the product better each day and to help creators on Clubhouse thrive:</p>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Welcoming more amazing people 🎉</strong> &nbsp; From the earliest days, we’ve wanted to build Clubhouse for everyone. With this in mind, we are thrilled to begin work on our Android app soon, and to add more accessibility and localization features so that people all over the world can experience Clubhouse in a way that feels native to them.</li>
          <li><strong>Keeping the servers up 👩🏽‍💻</strong> &nbsp; We’ve grown faster than expected over the past few months, causing too many people to see red error messages when our servers are struggling. A large portion of the new funding round will go to technology and infrastructure to scale the Clubhouse experience for everyone, so that it’s always fast and performant, regardless of how many people are joining.</li>
          <li><strong>Ensuring you get fast support ⚡️</strong> &nbsp; User safety has always been a top priority for us, and as we welcome more people, it will remain one. This means scaling up our Trust &amp; Safety and Support teams as we grow, continuing to invest in advanced tools to detect and prevent abuse, and increasing the features and training resources available to moderators. We’ll also be aggressively growing our support team so that everyone’s clubs can get same-day approval. :)</li>
          <li><strong>Improving ranking and discovery 🌍</strong> &nbsp; As we’ve grown, the number of conversations happening on Clubhouse has skyrocketed, and it’s our job to help you find the right ones each time you open the app. With this new round of funding we’ll be investing heavily in discovery so that we can show you people, clubs, and rooms that are perfectly tailored to your interests—and help you discover new rooms you never would have thought to look for.</li>
          <li><strong>Investing in creators 👨🏽‍🎤</strong> &nbsp; Creators are the lifeblood of Clubhouse, and we want to make sure that all of the amazing people who host conversations for others are getting recognized for their contributions. Over the next few months, we plan to launch our first tests to allow creators to get paid directly—through features like tipping, tickets or subscriptions. We will also be using a portion of the new funding round to roll out a Creator Grant Program to support emerging Clubhouse creators.</li>
        </ul>
      
      <p>We know we have said this before, but we are so incredibly grateful to everyone who has joined Clubhouse, given us their feedback during Town Halls, shared their stories, and been part of the journey so far. We built Clubhouse to be a blank canvas filled with amazing people, and it is nothing without the incredible people who fill the rooms each day.</p>
      <p>We’re working hard to scale Clubhouse as fast as we can and open it up to everyone soon. In the meantime, anyone can join with an invite from an existing user, or sign up for the <a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com/">waitlist</a> so we can welcome you in soon. We are also <a href="https://jobs.lever.co/joinclubhouse" target="_blank">hiring in all areas</a>, so if you are excited about our mission, we would love to talk with you.</p>
      <p>Thank you again. It means so much to us to be able to build this product for you, and we’re so excited for this next chapter.</p>
      <p>- Paul, Rohan and the Clubhouse team</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A few months ago, I received an email from Revolut (a British fintech company) in which they proudly unveiled their new logo. Previously, Revolut had a distinct and instantly recognizable logo. They replaced it with… something I was sure I had seen before.</p><figure id="w-node-3786e8b28af7-27e1f180"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1b01fee505292d2d6a6979/5fb51cf030355219306e8edf_revolout-logo-old-new.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>The previous Revolut logo had a unique font, a recognizable color gradient, and it was slanted. If you were to put 100 financial or tech companies’ logos next to each other, the old logo would be easy to find at a glance.</p><p>If you put the new one in the same 100 logos pile, it would drown in the sea of sameness.</p><h2>Sans serif invasion</h2><p>There is a trend in logo design that started around 2017-2018. It’s as if many companies decided that being unique was a handicap and that it was better to be like everyone else. Or at least, that’s how it feels to me.</p><p>The trend started with fashion logos. Many iconic fashion companies ditched their recognizable logos and switched to a bland and very similar version of a sans serif font.</p><p>The technology sector followed soon after.</p><figure id="w-node-519323ea72d8-27e1f180"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1b01fee505292d2d6a6979/5fb51d96d2b8eae559c71d90_tech-fashion-logos-sans-serif.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>All the quirks, peculiarities, and idiosyncrasies of both tech and fashion logos were dropped and replaced with a simple sans serif font.</p><p>It looked like two huge industries decided to use the services of one designer, and not a particularly inventive one at that.</p><p>The tech industry is in slightly better shape because they didn’t go all in, and at least they kept the colors. With the colors, there’s at least <em>some </em>variability:</p><figure id="w-node-1efc3a7d060a-27e1f180"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1b01fee505292d2d6a6979/5fb51dc4daea171c45c758db_tech-logos-color.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Variability in new fashion logos, in full color:</p><figure id="w-node-b31dea70a84e-27e1f180"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1b01fee505292d2d6a6979/5fb51dd2ab19486dcee8bcea_fashion-logos-color.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h3>Serif and sans serif—what’s the difference?</h3><p>First, what’s the difference between serif and sans serif fonts?</p><figure id="w-node-7e6a894d6cf3-27e1f180"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1b01fee505292d2d6a6979/5fb51e06556217fb8d809964_serif-sans-serif.gif" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>The small features on the ends of strokes in some fonts are known as ‘serifs’.</p><p>Fonts without those small features are called ‘sans serif’ (<em>‘sans’</em> means <em>‘without’</em> in French).</p><p>Sans serifs are missing a few of the typical anatomical features (serifs, spurs, swashes and other flourishes). Because of that, this typeface lacks the level of detail and design differentiation that serif typefaces can have.</p><p>While the simplicity of sans serif fonts makes them readable and versatile, it has its drawbacks. Without additional details and features, sans serif fonts have far fewer options for differentiation. While you can vary things like the height, weight, and slant, sans serif fonts simply have fewer features to work with than their more intricate fellow fonts.</p><p>This results in logos that look very similar. Gone are all the elaborate little details of the previous era.</p><p>When you add brands’ tendency to go black-and-white, you end up with a sea of logo sameness which is the opposite of what logos should be.</p><p>The purpose of a logo is to be instantly recognizable, different, memorable, and, if possible, to refer to the brand’s values. Blending into everyone else’s achieves none of these things.</p><h3>Sans serif history</h3><p>Sans serif lettering and fonts, first created in 1816, were popular for their clarity and legibility at a distance in advertising and display use when printed very large or small.</p><p>Because sans serif type was often used for headings and commercial printing, many early sans serif designs did not feature lowercase letters.</p><p>Simple sans serif capitals, without the use of lowercase, became very common in uses such as tombstones of the Victorian period in Britain.</p><p>Also, a significant reason for serif faces in the older days of imprecise letterpress and less consistent paper surface sizing was to compensate for ink spread and aberrations. Serifs on the fonts helped in cases where corners would otherwise fail to fully imprint.</p><h2>Possible reasons</h2><p>What are the possible reasons for this sans serif trend taking over? And why do hardly any of them matter?</p><h3>‘Modern utility’</h3><p>Branding specialists point to the practical benefits of what they call the ‘modern utility’ of sans serif typefaces. Cleaner and more legible, they are better suited to a variety of media and work particularly well online. The purity of these fonts allows the brands to be an empty vessel, ready to accommodate rapidly shifting trends.</p><p><strong>Counterpoint:</strong> That may be true, but isn’t the whole value of a brand to <em>not</em> be an empty vessel? The big brands have worked decades for their identity and recognition, only to throw most of it away?</p><h3>Simplification</h3><p>Another reason cited by brand specialists is that it’s a natural step for brands to take as they grow from scrappy startups into established brands. The goals have shifted from making noise and standing out to being a trusted, dependable part of people’s everyday lives. That heartfelt personality and idiosyncrasy that defined a brand as they started out, and won over their early adopters, can be a limitation as they aim for broad appeal and bigger revenue.</p><p><strong>Counterpoint:</strong> Simplification as a reason to blend in for broad appeal? I don’t buy it. Logos should be simple, yes, but they should be simple in a memorable way. Think more in terms of Nike swoosh (simple, memorable),&nbsp; and less in a one-size-fits-all sans serif font.</p><h3>Brands are more than logos now</h3><p>People at the head of these powerful brands know that they are not defined by their logo anymore but by the product or service they provide. They are strong thanks to what they allow <em>you</em> to do with them.</p><p>Before, logo designers would look for a ‘concept’ when designing a logo. That is not necessary anymore: <em>The brand is the concept</em>.</p><p>Their thinking goes that logos may look similar, but what they offer is completely different and effective, and that’s what ultimately counts for the consumer.</p><p>As some brands become words (or even better, verbs) in our daily language (to Google, to Uber, to Skype), they have a lesser need for a recognizable logo. Many of those brands now spend on designing custom typefaces instead of logos: a custom typeface becomes their recognizable voice on every platform or device.</p><p><strong>Counterpoint:</strong> Some big brands may indeed have a lesser need for a very distinct logo but that doesn't mean that they should get rid of an important differentiator. You don’t see Nike replacing their swoosh logo with sans serif <strong>NIKE</strong> text. If you have something valuable that you <em>can</em> live without, it doesn’t mean that you <em>must</em>.</p><h3>Readability</h3><p>One of the main reasons for the sans serif logo trend is readability. Especially on mobile, but everywhere else as well: from huge billboards to tiny footer links at the bottom of mobile websites.</p><p>After all, that’s the very reason why sans serif fonts were invented: for better readability in advertising headlines.</p><p><strong>Counterpoint:</strong> Readability is obviously important. Mobile too—it’s where everything happens nowadays. But this is becoming less of an issue with improvements in technologies like retina displays and 4k screens becoming popular.</p><figure id="w-node-38988d1753c7-27e1f180"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1b01fee505292d2d6a6979/5fb51e96e07b893538cbb00b_sans-serif-logos-on-iphone-11.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Here’s how a bunch of logos looks on my iPhone 11</figcaption></figure><p>If it’s easy to fit 30 decently looking logos on one-third of a phone screen, it should be trivial to make one logo, however quirky, look perfect on mobile.</p><p>Revolut seems to be torn here. They did replace the logo everywhere inside the app, but how does their new app icon look like?</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1b01fee505292d2d6a6979/5fb51ed3fd0200eeffdc690d_revolut-app-icon.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>What next?</h2><p>There’s nothing bad in wanting your logo to look simpler, better, mobile-ready, or universal enough to appeal to the broadest possible audience.</p><p>But don't throw the baby out with the bathwater.</p><p>Shoot for simplicity and legibility, but keep your distinguishing features. Don’t throw away what the brand has been working on for decades.</p><p>Otherwise, you may end up in a situation where you could slap any logo on any product and hardly anyone would notice a difference:</p><figure id="w-node-01df0773e426-27e1f180"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1b01fee505292d2d6a6979/5fbf32ea6160018ba6a9cb84_sans-serif-bags.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>One of these bags is real.</figcaption></figure></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>The “Fediverse” is a loose aggregation of federated servers that mainly speak the ActivityPub protocol. One of the most famous services in the Fediverse is “Mastodon.” We joined the Fediverse in the early days of Mastodon to share short-lived information that didn’t fit into a separate article on our website.</p><h2 id="the-issues-that-we-discussed-earlier-this-year">The issues that we discussed earlier this year</h2><p>In May, <a href="https://infosec-handbook.eu/news/2020-05-31-monthly-review/#fediverse">we reconsidered our presence in the Fediverse</a>. Back then, the main issues for us were:</p><ol><li>You can’t migrate your posts if you need to migrate to another Mastodon server.</li><li>You can’t update your posts without losing shares and comments.</li><li>All posts have a character limit, so we can’t say everything we want in a single post.</li><li>Many Fediverse users claim to be the “better and open-minded alternative to Twitter.” We think that this doesn’t reflect reality, as explained below.</li></ol><p>In June, we addressed issues 1 to 3 by introducing a “News” section on our website.</p><h2 id="further-issues-in-the-fediverse-and-other-social-networks">Further issues in the Fediverse and other social networks</h2><p>We also participated in discussions and tried to encourage dialogs in the Fediverse and other forums instead of only posting information. However, these discussions revealed consistent issues:</p><h3 id="the-toxic-us-vs-them-ideology">The toxic “us vs. them” ideology</h3><p>For some groups, it is vital to make a bogeyman out of opposing parties. In the Fediverse, some individuals and groups continuously spread misinformation about “the others” to gain likes and followers. While most of the toxic behavior targets the big tech companies in the USA, some individuals targetting us.</p><h3 id="the-reverse-burden-of-proof">The “reverse burden of proof”</h3><p>When discussing with others, we often encountered the “reverse burden of proof.” Somebody posts negative claims about a product or service. Instead of providing (technical) proof for the claim, the only supporting “fact” is, “everybody knows that this is true.” On the contrary, this person doesn’t accept any (technical) proof that debunks their initial claim. For us, it looks like you don’t need to provide any real facts as long as you satisfy the ideology of some people.</p><h3 id="the-i-read-headlines-only-problem">The “I read headlines only” problem</h3><p>Many people read the headlines of a post and then guess what is written in the remaining article. Such behavior results in misinterpreted information and persistent myths. On the other hand, it became a standard tool for some blogs to gain more readers: Writing, “Critical security vulnerability could leak all of your data” results in more clicks and shares than, “Company fixed potential security vulnerability months ago, which could have leaked some of your data if ever exploited.” This problem kills meaningful discussions instantly.</p><h3 id="the-security-and-privacy-by-assumption-problem">The “security and privacy by assumption” problem</h3><p>Most of you know “security by obscurity,” when security relies on keeping the implementation secret. We see another common issue: “security and privacy by assumption.” Many people share security and privacy tips without ever checking whether these tips work. They just assume that somebody else checked it before.</p><h3 id="and-finally-comparing-apples-to-oranges">And finally, “comparing apples to oranges”</h3><p>For instance, some people claim the Signal messenger became insecure after introducing the Signal PIN because a server-side attacker could now access your data. The base for this claim is the assumption that a server-side party extracts encrypted information from the volatile main memory of a server, exploits an unpatched security vulnerability in Intel CPUs to extract a key, and successfully guesses a user-provided password.</p><p>While the attack looks anything but trivial as these people describe it, they then argue that their favorite messenger is far more secure due to being decentralized. They compare the encryption mechanism of instant messenger A with something else. Suppose you look at the same feature of their favorite messenger. In that case, you see that their messenger doesn’t offer any server-side protection. In their case, a server-side party can directly access your data in cleartext—this is trivial.</p><h3 id="im-privacy-friendly-please-donate">“I’m privacy-friendly; please donate”</h3><p>The issues mentioned above are also prevalent on other social networks like Twitter. Just like on Twitter, you see “privacy-friendly” companies trying to gain more paying customers or some bloggers heavily involved in influencer marketing. While most of them claim that this is for a “good cause,” it is ultimately all about money.</p><h3 id="decentralization-still-isnt-a-privacy-feature">Decentralization still isn’t a privacy feature</h3><p>Now, some people may insist that at least security and privacy are far better “due to the decentralized nature” of the Fediverse. As we wrote several times before, “decentralization” isn’t a privacy feature.</p><p>Search engines like Google can discover and index all of your public posts in the Fediverse. By default, you can see the social graphs of all accounts, as followers are public. Especially Mastodon servers come with privacy policies that don’t meet the European GDPR requirements. Many (Mastodon) servers seem to run an outdated version, indicating inadequate security practices.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Should you become part of the Fediverse by creating an account? It isn’t up to us to decide this, of course.</p><p>If you only want to read the content of others, we recommend subscribing to their RSS feeds. Your RSS subscriptions are private and more decentralized than any Fediverse account. And you need to manage one account less on the internet.</p><p>If you want to be an active part of the Fediverse, be prepared for the same problems as on any other social network. We decided to leave the Fediverse for now.</p><h2>Read also</h2><ul><li><a href="https://infosec-handbook.eu/news/2020-12-20-contact-and-feed/">On contacting us, and subscribing to our RSS feed</a></li><li><a href="https://infosec-handbook.eu/news/2020-11-08-rss-update/">Update of our RSS/Atom feed</a></li><li><a href="https://infosec-handbook.eu/news/2020-08-02-tls-insights/">TLS usage of InfoSec Handbook readers</a></li><li><a href="https://infosec-handbook.eu/news/2020-08-01-introducing-the-news-section/">Introducing the 'News' section</a></li></ul></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>MONTREAL -- 
	A team of researchers from the Montreal Heart Institute believe they have found an effective weapon against COVID-19: colchicine, an oral tablet already known and used for other diseases.</p>
<p>
	For Dr. Jean-Claude Tardif, who led the study, this is a "major scientific discovery," he said. Colchicine is the first "effective oral drug to treat out-of-hospital patients."</p>
<p>
	"To be able to offer this, from Quebec, and for the planet, we are very happy," said Tardif.</p>
<p>
	<a href="https://www.colcorona.net/" target="_blank">The ColCorona study</a> involved 4,159 patients whose diagnosis of COVID-19 had been confirmed by a nasopharyngeal test (PCR).</p>

<p>
	Analysis of the study found that colchicine resulted in reductions in hospitalizations by 25 per cent, the need for mechanical ventilation by 50 per cent, and deaths by 44 per cent.</p>
<p>
	"This is the first hope for patients who have COVID, who are worried and who hope that they will not have complications," said Tardif. Previously, "there were no tablets that could be taken by mouth and reduce the risks."</p>
<p>
	Tardif said he believes that prescribing the drug could help reduce congestion in hospitals quickly and reduce health-care costs in Quebec and elsewhere.</p>
<p>
	"Our study showed the effectiveness of treatment using colchicine to prevent the phenomenon of the major inflammatory storm and reduce complications related to COVID-19," he said.</p>
<p>
	As colchicine is a well-understood drug, it could be used very quickly to treat people with COVID-19, the researcher says.</p>
<p>
	"Colchicine is old as it is -- we've been treating gout with it for hundreds of years -- so it's available in pharmacies," Tardif said, speaking in French.</p>
<p>
	"So any doctor, tomorrow, who reads this can definitely decide to prescribe if he wants."</p>
<p>
	On Friday evening, Quebec Premier Francois Legault called the study "big news" on social networks.</p>
<p>
	In the spring, Legault said the Colcorona study was one of the largest studies in the world researching ways to fight the virus.</p>
<p>
	The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was deployed in Canada, the United States, Europe, South America and South Africa.</p>
<p>
	"It was a double-blind study, meaning neither the patient, nor the team that ran the study, including me, knew whether the patient was taking the placebo or the drug," explained Tardif.</p>
<p>
	"There was just one group, independent from us, which was aware."</p>
<p>
	He said the team is "very proud of the work accomplished -- it is a clinically convincing result," adding that he assembled a spectacular team from all over Quebec including microbiologists, intensive care specialists, statisticians, computer scientists and epidemiologists.</p>
<p>
	The Centre de Coordination des Essais Cliniques de Montréal (MHICC) of the Montreal Heart Institute coordinated the study.</p>
<p>
	<em>This report by The Canadian Press was first published Jan. 23, 2021.</em></p>

As January 6 unfolded on Capitol Hill, there was a rapid shift in language, from “<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/gop-senators-reverse-objections-electoral-college-certification-protesters/story?id=75099780" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>protesters</span></a>,” “<a href="https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2021/0112/How-a-mob-stormed-the-Capitol-and-how-to-stop-another-assault" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>supporters</span></a>,” and “<a href="https://theconversation.com/nonprofits-helped-organize-the-pro-trump-rally-before-the-capitol-siege-but-they-probably-wont-suffer-any-consequences-153271" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>rally</span></a>” to “<a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/congress-combat-veteran-military-experience" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>siege</span></a>,” “<a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/ex-firefighter-robert-sanford-arrested-for-allegedly-hurling-fire-extinguisher-at-cops-during-capitol-riots" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>rioters</span></a>,” and “<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/01/08/1015929/archive-capitol-insurrection-trump-maga-footage/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>insurrection</span></a>.” These choices — on the day of the attack and in its aftermath — matched the descent of a seemingly peaceful protest into a violent and dangerous attack on the seat of the U.S. federal government.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Using 5,057 article titles about the Capitol Riot from 398 sources across the political spectrum, The Factual examined how the events and aftermath of January 6 are most commonly described in U.S. and global media. This includes the differences in language between left- and right-leaning publications, as well as how the terminology used compares to <a href="https://blog.thefactual.com/protest-riot-headlines-george-floyd" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>our analysis</span></a> of coverage of the George Floyd protests this summer.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Note: An article’s title is not always a perfect representation of its content, but titles matter deeply in shaping readers’ perceptions of what media outlets are writing, whether there are contrasting views between political parties, and whether/how an event matters — especially in the social media era.</em></p>
<h4><strong>The Words Used to Describe January 6</strong></h4>
<p>The U.S. media ecosystem includes hundreds of outlets, reflecting the myriad ideologies, political alignments, and niche areas of interest that motivate the American populace. They help define the core issues that drive American political and social discourse, and the words they use are central to how Americans understand current events. It should be no surprise, then, that the ways the media talks about the events of January 6 are key to building a consensus about what happened and unpacking how such an event may impact the U.S. going forward.</p>
<p>While there are some clear differences in the way the left and right talk about the Capitol Riot, instances of agreement are a good place to start. For example, there seems to be broad consensus that January 6 constituted a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/capitol-police-intelligence-report-before-capitol-breach-warned-congress-itself-could-be-targeted" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>riot</span></a>, not something less intense like a <a href="https://theprint.in/world/terrorism-or-protest-how-the-us-media-saw-the-siege-of-the-capitol/582443/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>protest</span></a> or something more intense like a <a href="https://theconversation.com/was-it-a-coup-no-but-siege-on-us-capitol-was-the-election-violence-of-a-fragile-democracy-152803" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>coup</span></a>. Around 40% of article titles from both left-leaning (41.3%) and right-leaning (38.2%) outlets in our sample used the term “riot.” While the term “protest” was twice as likely to appear in titles from the right, the term appeared in just 5.5% of all articles, demonstrating that the term was inadequate to capture the day’s events. Meanwhile, “rally,” the purported nature of the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/stop-the-steal-organizer-gop-members-helped-him-plan-rally-2021-1" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>pro-Trump gatherings</span></a> prior to the riot, appeared in just 1.2% of titles.</p>

<p>Other words were used with roughly similar frequency regardless of the publisher’s political bias. Reporting from across the political spectrum mentions “violent” or “violence,” “siege,” and “police” about the same amount, reflecting at least a partial shared understanding of the lengthy clashes between police and the numerous rioters. Further, just 16 of the 5,057 article titles included the word “peaceful.”</p>

<p>A third of article titles on the left (33%) and a quarter of those on the right (26%) mention Trump, highlighting a shared understanding of his proximity to the events of January 6. However, there are some clear differences in usage. While many of the article titles from the right are <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/donald-trump-pressure-condemn-violence-capitol-twitter-rage" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>ambiguous</span></a> about Trump’s role, articles from the left directly accentuate his <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-55574780" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>connection</span></a> to the riot, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/13/us/politics/trump-video-capitol-riot.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>slow condemnation</span></a> of the violence, and <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2021/01/trump-capitol-attack-impeachment-evidence-insurrection.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>culpability</span></a> in the aftermath.<img src="https://blog.thefactual.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.26%20PM.png?width=403&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.26%20PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2021-01-23 at 6.34.26 PM" width="403" srcset="https://blog.thefactual.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.26%20PM.png?width=202&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.26%20PM.png 202w, https://blog.thefactual.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.26%20PM.png?width=403&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.26%20PM.png 403w, https://blog.thefactual.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.26%20PM.png?width=605&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.26%20PM.png 605w, https://blog.thefactual.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.26%20PM.png?width=806&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.26%20PM.png 806w, https://blog.thefactual.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.26%20PM.png?width=1008&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.26%20PM.png 1008w, https://blog.thefactual.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.26%20PM.png?width=1209&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.26%20PM.png 1209w" sizes="(max-width: 403px) 100vw, 403px"></p>
<div><p>Language also varied when discussing the behavior of the rioters. Article titles on the left were more likely to mention “mob,” “attack,” and “insurrection,” zeroing in on how pro-Trump supporters engaged in <a href="https://www.axios.com/mob-violence-trump-republicans-condemn-d508f105-aa77-435f-bd81-f4e74b011694.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>violent action</span></a> against DC Capitol Police and invaded the Capitol building.</p><p><img src="https://blog.thefactual.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.33%20PM.png?width=409&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.33%20PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2021-01-23 at 6.34.33 PM" width="409" srcset="https://blog.thefactual.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.33%20PM.png?width=205&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.33%20PM.png 205w, https://blog.thefactual.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.33%20PM.png?width=409&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.33%20PM.png 409w, https://blog.thefactual.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.33%20PM.png?width=614&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.33%20PM.png 614w, https://blog.thefactual.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.33%20PM.png?width=818&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.33%20PM.png 818w, https://blog.thefactual.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.33%20PM.png?width=1023&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.33%20PM.png 1023w, https://blog.thefactual.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.33%20PM.png?width=1227&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202021-01-23%20at%206.34.33%20PM.png 1227w" sizes="(max-width: 409px) 100vw, 409px"></p></div>
<div><p>Overall, these differences in terminology reflect the political landscape in the aftermath of January 6 in two ways: (1) a central consensus clearly labels the event as a riot and shares some broad interpretations of the day’s events, and (2) on average, left-leaning interpretations accentuate the violent, seditious nature of events while right-leaning publications take a softer tone.</p></div>
<h4><strong>How These Words Compare to the George Floyd Protests</strong></h4>
<p>Just as many saw fundamentally different responses to the George Floyd protests and the Capitol Riot, The Factual’s data reveals a few differences in the way these events were described in the media. (This analysis uses an <a href="https://blog.thefactual.com/protest-riot-headlines-george-floyd" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>earlier study</span></a> we conducted based on a similarly sized dataset of 4,958 article titles from the 10 days following George Floyd’s killing.)</p>
<p>Most prominently, the George Floyd protests were far more likely to be described using the word “protest” (44.9%) and far less likely to involve “riot” (2.9%) than the Capitol Riot. The events on Capitol Hill were 10 times as likely to be described as an “attack,” while the George Floyd protests were 5 times more likely to be described as “peaceful.” This makes intuitive sense since the George Floyd protests encompass hundreds of separate events and were <a href="https://time.com/5886348/report-peaceful-protests/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>93% peaceful</span></a>. The Capitol Riot, on the other hand, refers specifically to a single event where numerous <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/injured-police-officers-were-evacuated-from-capitol-hill-protests-2021-1" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>violent incidents</span></a> took place. Importantly, however, this highlights that efforts to equate the Capitol Riot with the George Floyd protests — for whatever purpose — are of <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/false-equivalency-black-lives-matter-capitol-siege-experts/story?id=75251279" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>limited use</span></a>.</p>

<p>There is also generally more agreement between left- and right-leaning outlets about what terminology to use to describe the Capitol Riot. <a href="https://blog.thefactual.com/protest-riot-headlines-george-floyd" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Our analysis</span></a> of coverage of the George Floyd protests showed larger divergences between left and right, for example, in terms of usage of “protest” or “riot”:</p>
<p>[A]rticles from outlets on the right featured “riot,” “riots,” or “rioting” in 12.9% of all article titles, while only 2.6% of article titles on the left featured those terms. Similarly, article titles on the right were twice as likely (8.1%) to use some variation of the word “loot” than the left (3.8%). Conversely, articles on the left were 10% more likely (43.7%) to feature a variation of the term “protest” than those on the right (33.8%), and 7.8% of articles on the left featured the term “non-violent,” which didn’t appear in any article titles on the right.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Though Trump played a prominent role during the George Floyd protests, particularly relating to his use of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/02/us/politics/trump-walk-lafayette-square.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>federal forces</span></a> like the National Guard, he was in retrospect a secondary player in the national upheaval over institutional racism and police brutality; he was mentioned in 9.4% of article titles from that period. By contrast, he was three times as likely to be mentioned in titles related to the Capitol Riot (31.1%). Conversely, the police were mentioned repeatedly during the George Floyd protests (40.5%), unsurprising given their centrality to the upheaval, but were mentioned with less frequency in relation to the Capitol Riot. Despite their varied interactions both <a href="https://reason.com/2021/01/07/capitol-police-failed-to-contain-a-riot-then-killed-a-woman-in-the-chaos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">fighting</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/capitol-police-chief-several-officers-suspended-siege" rel="noopener" target="_blank">assisting</a> the rioters, “police” only appeared in 10.9% of all articles related to the events in DC.&nbsp;</p>

<div><p>A further way media coverage has differed is through the words that fail to appear in coverage of the events on Capitol Hill. For example, instances of looting during this summer’s protests were used by some to try to delegitimize the entire Black Lives Matter movement. In our sample about the George Floyd protests, “looting” — to "steal goods from (a place), typically during a war or riot"<span>&nbsp;—</span> was mentioned in 3.4% of article titles, slightly more than the 2.9% of articles that mentioned “riot.” By contrast, though 39.1% of article titles about January 6 included the word “riot” and even as assailants broke into the Capitol building, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackbrewster/2021/01/08/clyburns-ipad-laptop-from-pelosis-office-items-stolen-destroyed-in-capitol-attack/?sh=37d9d46d5963" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>stole government property</span></a>, and evidence was <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2021/jan/9/horned-man-west-va-lawmaker-man-holding-pelosis-le/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>widely published</span></a> of them doing so, there wasn’t a single mention of “looting” in the 5,057 article titles in our sample.&nbsp;</p></div>

<h4><strong>How Far Apart</strong></h4>
<p>Regardless of the words one uses to describe the political division in the U.S., it is apparent that there is some distance between the left and right on the future of the country, the optimal direction for policy, and especially how to think about the last four years. However, the words used to describe the Capitol Riot suggest more unity than one might expect, at least in terms of the media’s portrayal of what will likely be the most memorable day of the Trump administration. Media coverage from across the political spectrum is certainly in greater agreement about the character of events in DC than it was about the George Floyd protests this summer. If the desire is to rein in partisan division, coming to a set of common terms to describe the events of January 6 is a good start.</p>

<p>We are happy to announce the fifth pre-release of Nyxt version 2.0.0. If you missed the previous pre-release announcement, see <a href="https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/article/release-2-pre-release-4.org">here</a>.</p>
<p>Nyxt 2 is a massive overhaul of the Nyxt 1 series. A lot of effort has been geared towards improving the code quality under the hood which should reflect on the overall user experience with better performance, increased stability and better accessibility.</p>
<p>This is a test release for everyone to try out before the final release. It contains experimental features and some parts are still unfinished. Please feel free to share your feedback on our <a href="https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt/issues">GitHub issue tracker</a>!</p>
<p>Notable highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Added a dashboard function to Nyxt. It can be used as a startup-buffer. It can display display recent URLs, bookmarks, etc.</p></li>
<li><p><code>reduce-to-buffer</code> includes a summary of each buffer (powered by our Text Rank implementation).</p></li>
<li><p>Improved <code>buffer-history-tree</code> presentation. It is now easier to visualize the tree as there are lines drawn between nodes.</p></li>
<li><p><code>analysis</code> library:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Add support for DBSCAN algorithm. DBSCAN is a clustering algorithm used to classify vectors as being related.</p></li>
<li><p>Improve Text Rank algorithm implementation. This results in better summarization.</p></li>
</ul></li>

January 24, 2021 | https://tannguyen.dev/2018/05/use-postgresql-for-authorization-layer/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://tannguyen.dev/2018/05/use-postgresql-for-authorization-layer/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div>
        <p>Postgresql is my favorite relational database. There are a lot of cool things that Postgresql can do and one of those is to handle the authorization layer. Some people argue that putting authorization logic into the database makes the application code harder to read, and that’s actually true if there is only 1 code base connecting to a database. However, if there are more than 1 code bases communicating with a database, having a centralized authorization logic starts to make more sense. In this blog post, I am not going to discuss the pros and cons of having the authorization logic inside the database, but instead I am going to describe how I put all my authorization logic into postgresql.</p>
<p>This blog post assumes that you have prior knowledge about postgresql and SQL in general.</p>
<h2 id="basic-concepts">Basic concepts<a href="#basic-concepts" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>There are some basic concepts that we need to know before continuing</p>
<h3 id="role">Role<a href="#role" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h3>
<p>A role in postgresql can mean many things. It can be an user, a group of users. I usually think role as a group of users. For example, in a forum, there are normal users, moderators and admins. A new role can be created by <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-createrole.html">CREATE ROLE</a>. For example</p>
<p>Then, to change the role of the current connection, simply call</p>
<h3 id="table-privileges">Table privileges<a href="#table-privileges" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h3>
<p>In postgresql, we can control which role can access which table. This is done via <code>GRANT</code>. For example</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>GRANT</span> <span>ALL</span> <span>ON</span> forum <span>TO</span> <span>admin</span>;
</code></pre></div><p>This allows admin to do ALL operations on <code>forum</code> tables.</p>
<h3 id="column-privileges">Column privileges<a href="#column-privileges" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h3>
<p>Next we have column privileges. These are more granular and for controlling how roles can access columns in a table. This is also done via <code>GRANT</code>. For example</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>GRANT</span> <span>SELECT</span>(name) <span>ON</span> forum <span>TO</span> anonymous;
</code></pre></div><p>This restricts <code>anonymous</code> role from accessing other columns in <code>forum</code> than <code>name</code>. So doing <code>SELECT * FROM forum</code> will return an error.</p>
<h3 id="row-level-security">Row-level security<a href="#row-level-security" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h3>
<p>This is the lowest (and most powerful) level that controls the access to a specific row. This is called <code>policy</code> in postgresql and can be created by <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-createpolicy.html">CREATE POLICY</a>. However, row-level security is not enabled by default, so we need to manually enable it if we want to use it</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>ALTER</span> <span>TABLE</span> forum ENABLE <span>ROW</span> <span>LEVEL</span> <span>SECURITY</span>;
</code></pre></div><p>Row-level security is a bit more complicated subject. For the sake of this post, I am not going to explain every bit of the syntax but instead just show the queries and explain what they do.</p>
<p>A policy is tied to a role, and defines what that role can do (SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT) to a row. For example</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> POLICY moderator_can_update_forum <span>ON</span> forum  
<span>FOR</span> <span>UPDATE</span>
<span>WITH</span> <span>CHECK</span>(<span>current_user</span> <span>=</span> <span>'moderator'</span>);
</code></pre></div><p>This allows <code>moderator</code> to do <code>UPDATE</code> operations, all other roles can’t do that if not specifically set so. However, <code>moderator</code> still needs to be granted <code>UPDATE</code> on <code>forum</code> table</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>GRANT</span> <span>UPDATE</span> <span>ON</span> forum <span>TO</span> moderator;
</code></pre></div><h2 id="putting-everything-together">Putting everything together<a href="#putting-everything-together" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>I am going to design a database schema for a simple project where you can create your own store and display some products on your store. Here is the database schema</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> account (
  id SERIAL <span>PRIMARY</span> <span>KEY</span>,
  username VARCHAR(<span>32</span>) <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span>,
  password TEXT <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span>,
  phone_number TEXT <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span>,
  <span>role</span> VARCHAR(<span>16</span>) <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span>
);

<span>ALTER</span> <span>TABLE</span> account <span>ADD</span> <span>CONSTRAINT</span> unique_username <span>UNIQUE</span>(username);
<span>ALTER</span> <span>TABLE</span> account ENABLE <span>ROW</span> <span>LEVEL</span> <span>SECURITY</span>;

<span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> store (
  id SERIAL <span>PRIMARY</span> <span>KEY</span>,
  name VARCHAR(<span>64</span>) <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span>,
  description TEXT,
  rank INT <span>DEFAULT</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>,
  owner_id INT <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span> <span>REFERENCES</span> account(id) <span>ON</span> <span>DELETE</span> <span>CASCADE</span>
);
<span>ALTER</span> <span>TABLE</span> store ENABLE <span>ROW</span> <span>LEVEL</span> <span>SECURITY</span>;

<span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> product (
  id SERIAL <span>PRIMARY</span> <span>KEY</span>,
  name VARCHAR(<span>128</span>) <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span>,
  stock INT <span>DEFAULT</span> <span>0</span>,
  description TEXT,
  store_id INT <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span> <span>REFERENCES</span> store(id) <span>ON</span> <span>DELETE</span> <span>CASCADE</span>
);
<span>ALTER</span> <span>TABLE</span> product ENABLE <span>ROW</span> <span>LEVEL</span> <span>SECURITY</span>;
</code></pre></div><p>Next, we need to have some roles for the project</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>ROLE</span> super_admin;
<span>CREATE</span> <span>ROLE</span> store_owner;
<span>CREATE</span> <span>ROLE</span> normal_account;

<span>GRANT</span> normal_account <span>TO</span> store_owner;
<span>GRANT</span> store_owner <span>TO</span> super_admin;
</code></pre></div><ul>
<li><code>normal_account</code> is … just a normal account in our app</li>
<li><code>store_owner</code> is the creator of a store. So for the sake of simplicity, any normal account who created a store is automatically promoted to a <code>store_owner</code></li>
<li><code>super_admin</code> can basically do anything, it’s usually us who manages the project</li>
</ul>
<p>The last 2 <code>GRANT</code> queries establish a chain of privileges, <code>store_owner</code> can do anything that <code>normal_account</code> can do. And <code>super_admin</code> can do anything that <code>store_user</code> can do. In reality, it might be possible to have a deeper user role hierarchy.</p>
<p>Now, let’s define the permissions for each role. Let’s do it for <code>normal_account</code> and <code>store_owner</code> because <code>super_admin</code> can do absolutely anything. In addition to explicitly define the permissions for <code>super_admin</code>, I can also set <code>BYPASSRLS</code> when creating the role in order to bypass all the row-level security.</p>
<h3 id="account">account<a href="#account" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h3>
<p>For this table, no one can INSERT or DELETE except <code>super_admin</code> and since <code>store_owner</code> is also a <code>normal_account</code>, let’s define what a <code>normal_account</code> can do.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>GRANT</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>ON</span> account <span>TO</span> normal_account;
<span>GRANT</span> <span>UPDATE</span> <span>ON</span> account <span>TO</span> normal_account;
</code></pre></div><p>This allows <code>normal_account</code> to SELECT and UPDATE all columns in <code>account</code> table. But it’s not enough, we must limit it so that an account can only UPDATE their own data and not everyone else’s. For SELECT, we probably want the same limitation because leaking other people data is obviously bad.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> POLICY normal_account_can_update_their_account <span>ON</span> account
<span>FOR</span> <span>UPDATE</span>
<span>TO</span> normal_account
<span>WITH</span> <span>CHECK</span> (is_current_account(id));

<span>CREATE</span> POLICY normal_account_can_select_their_account <span>ON</span> account
<span>FOR</span> <span>SELECT</span>
<span>TO</span> normal_account
<span>USING</span> (is_current_account(id));
</code></pre></div><p>The 2 queries are straightforward, we have just created 2 policies in <code>account</code> table to control the visibility of its rows. The only new bit here is <code>is_current_account(id)</code> function. First, let’s take a look at its source code.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>OR</span> <span>REPLACE</span> <span>FUNCTION</span> is_current_account(account_id integer)
<span>RETURNS</span> BOOLEAN
<span>AS</span> <span>$$</span>
<span>DECLARE</span>
  current_account_id INT;
  owner_id INT;
<span>BEGIN</span>
  <span>SELECT</span> current_setting(<span>'auth.current_account_id'</span>, <span>true</span>)::int <span>INTO</span> current_account_id;
  <span>RETURN</span> current_account_id <span>=</span> account_id;
<span>END</span>;
<span>$$</span> <span>LANGUAGE</span> plpgsql;
</code></pre></div><p>For those who don’t like <code>plpgsql</code>, you can switch to Javascript to write stored procedures using this extension <a href="https://github.com/plv8/plv8">https://github.com/plv8/plv8</a>. For this blog post, I will stick to the default language.</p>
<p>This simple function checks if the provided value (account_id) matches the current account id stored in <code>auth.current_account_id</code> setting (Need to have some prefix, or postgresql will try to set the server config). This leads to the next point: <strong>How do we set the current account in postgresql?</strong></p>
<p>There are several ways to do that, you can have a simple function <code>login(username, password)</code> to select the account matched the provided username and compare the password, just like a regular login flow. Then if everything is correct, set the role and store the account id in <code>auth.current_account_id</code> setting through this query</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT</span> set_config(<span>'auth.current_account_id'</span>, account.id::text, <span>true</span>);
</code></pre></div><p>Set the last parameter to <code>true</code> to apply this config for the current transaction, and <code>false</code> for the current session. This value depends on your application layer’s logic. The 2nd parameter needs to be a string because of the function signature.</p>
<p>In reality, we <strong>SHOULD AVOID</strong> setting an actual (id) value to <code>current_account_id</code>. There should be some kind of encryption so that people can’t just call <code>set_config</code> and bypass the login process.</p>
<p>Anyway, for the sake of simplicity, I will just manually set the role, and <code>current_account_id</code> to whatever I want in order to demonstrate the permission system.</p>
<p>And last but not least, we need to allow <code>super_admin</code> to do anything in <code>account</code> table, simply pass <code>true</code> to USING and WITH CHECK.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>GRANT</span> <span>INSERT</span>, <span>DELETE</span> <span>ON</span> account <span>TO</span> super_admin;
<span>CREATE</span> POLICY super_admin_can_do_anything <span>ON</span> account
<span>FOR</span> <span>ALL</span>
<span>TO</span> super_admin
<span>USING</span> (<span>true</span>)
<span>WITH</span> <span>CHECK</span> (<span>true</span>);
</code></pre></div><p>Then, there is one last thing which is to allow <code>admin</code> to use the primary key (id) sequence. Without this, <code>admin</code> won’t be able to generate the next id to be used as the primary key for the new row.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>GRANT</span> <span>ALL</span> <span>ON</span> account_id_seq <span>TO</span> super_admin;
</code></pre></div><h3 id="store">store<a href="#store" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h3>
<p>Our <code>store</code> table has the following schema</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> store (
  id SERIAL <span>PRIMARY</span> <span>KEY</span>,
  name VARCHAR(<span>64</span>) <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span>,
  description TEXT,
  rank INT <span>DEFAULT</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>,
  owner_id INT <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span> <span>REFERENCES</span> account(id) <span>ON</span> <span>DELETE</span> <span>CASCADE</span>
);
</code></pre></div><p>Assuming that <code>rank</code> is only visible to the <code>store_owner</code>, we have these GRANT queries. And <code>store_owner</code> can only UPDATE name and description. The column <code>rank</code> could be something we do in a background job to let store owners know how well their store is doing.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>GRANT</span> <span>SELECT</span>(id, name, description) <span>ON</span> store <span>TO</span> normal_account;
<span>GRANT</span> <span>SELECT</span>(rank, owner_id) <span>ON</span> store <span>TO</span> store_owner;
<span>GRANT</span> <span>UPDATE</span>(name, description) <span>ON</span> store <span>TO</span> store_owner;
<span>GRANT</span> <span>ALL</span> <span>ON</span> store <span>TO</span> super_admin;
<span>GRANT</span> <span>ALL</span> <span>ON</span> store_id_seq <span>TO</span> super_admin;
</code></pre></div><p>Similar to <code>account</code> table, we still need to have some policies. <code>normal_account</code> can SELECT all the stores and <code>store_owner</code> can only UPDATE their own store. Also, <code>super_admin</code> can do anything here as well.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> POLICY normal_account_can_select_everything <span>ON</span> store
<span>FOR</span> <span>SELECT</span>
<span>TO</span> normal_account
<span>USING</span> (<span>true</span>);

<span>CREATE</span> POLICY store_owner_can_update_their_store <span>ON</span> store
<span>FOR</span> <span>UPDATE</span>
<span>TO</span> store_owner
<span>WITH</span> <span>CHECK</span> (is_current_account(owner_id));

<span>CREATE</span> POLICY super_admin_can_do_anything <span>ON</span> store
<span>FOR</span> <span>ALL</span>
<span>TO</span> store_owner
<span>USING</span> (<span>true</span>)
<span>WITH</span> <span>CHECK</span> (<span>true</span>)
</code></pre></div><p>However, there is one problem with this table, we don’t want one store owner to see the rank of another store. With our role hierarchy, <code>normal_account</code> can SELECT all the rows which means that <code>store_owner</code> can also SELECT all the rows (including the <code>rank</code> column).</p>
<p>We can’t revoke access to <code>rank</code> column because we still want the store owner to see their own rank. And postgresql doesn’t support anything to “hide” a column value.</p>
<p>The only solution I can come up with to deal with this limitation is to move <code>rank</code> to another table, say, <code>store_rank</code> and we can apply row level security there to only allow the store owner to SELECT their rank.</p>
<h3 id="product">product<a href="#product" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h3>
<p>Our <code>product</code> table has the following schema</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’ve been working with React since 2016 and still there isn’t a single best practice when it comes to application structure and design.</p>
<p>While there are best practices on the micro level, most teams build their own “thing” when it comes to architecture.</p>
<p>Of course, there isn’t a universal best practice that can be applied to all businesses and applications. But there are some general rules that we can follow to build a productive codebase.</p>
<p>The purpose of a software’s architecture and design is to keep it productive and flexible. Developers need to work on it effectively and modify it without rewriting its core.</p>
<p>This article is a collection of principles and rules that have proven to be effective for me and the teams I’ve worked with.</p>
<p>I outline good practices about components, application structure, testing, styling, state management and data fetching. Some of the examples are oversimplified so we can focus on the principle not on the implementation.</p>
<p><strong>Take everything here as an opinion</strong>, not an absolute. There’s more than one way to build software.</p>

<p>Favor functional components - they have a simpler syntax. No lifecycle methods, constructors or boilerplate. You can express the same logic with less characters without losing readability.</p>
<p>Unless you need an error boundary they should be your go-to approach. The mental model you need to keep in your head is a lot smaller.</p>

<h3 id="write-consistent-components">Write Consistent Components <a href="#write-consistent-components">#</a></h3>
<p>Stick to the same style for your components. Put helper functions in the same place, export the same way and follow the same naming patterns.</p>
<p>There isn’t a real benefit of one approach over the other</p>
<p>No matter if you’re exporting at the bottom of the file or directly in the definition of the component, pick one and stick to it.</p>
<h3 id="name-components">Name Components <a href="#name-components">#</a></h3>
<p>Always name your components. It helps when you’re reading an error stack trace and using the React Dev Tools.</p>
<p>It’s also easier to find where you are when developing if the component’s name is inside the file.</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code>
<span>export</span> <span>default</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>form</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>...</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>form</span><span>&gt;</span></span>

  <span>return</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>form</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>...</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>form</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="organize-helper-functions">Organize Helper Functions <a href="#organize-helper-functions">#</a></h3>
<p>Helper functions that don’t need to hold a closure over the components should be moved outside. The ideal place is before the component definition so the file can be readable from top to bottom.</p>
<p>That reduces the noise in the component and leaves inside only those that need to be there.</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code>
<span>function</span> <span>Component</span><span>(</span><span><span>{</span> date <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

<span>function</span> <span>parseDate</span><span>(</span><span>date</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>...</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You want to keep the least amount of helper functions inside the definition. Move as many as possible outside and pass the values from state as arguments.</p>
<p>Composing your logic out of pure functions that rely only on input makes it easier to track bugs and extend.</p>

<h3 id="component-length">Component Length <a href="#component-length">#</a></h3>
<p>A React component is just a function that gets props and returns markup. They adhere to the same software design principles.</p>
<p>If a function is doing too many things, extract some of the logic and call another function. It’s the same with components - if you have too much functionality, split it in smaller components and call them instead.</p>
<p>If a part of the markup is complex, requires loops and conditionals - extract it.</p>
<p>Rely on props and callbacks for communication and data. Lines of code are not an objective measure. Think about responsibilities and abstractions instead.</p>

<p>when something needs more clarity open a code block and give additional information. The markup is a part of the logic so when you feel that something needs more clarity - provide it.</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>Component</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
      </span><span>{</span><span>}</span><span>
      </span><span>{</span>user<span>.</span>subscribed <span>?</span> <span>null</span> <span>:</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>SubscriptionPlans</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span><span>}</span><span>
    </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="use-error-boundaries">Use Error Boundaries <a href="#use-error-boundaries">#</a></h3>
<p>An error in one component shouldn’t bring down the entire UI. There are rare cases in which we want to take down the whole page or redirect if a critical error happens. Most of the times we’d be fine if we just hide a specific element from the screen.</p>
<p>In a function that deals with data you may have multiple try/catch statements. Put error boundaries to use not just on the top level. Wrap elements on the screen that can exist separately to avoid cascading failures.</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>Component</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="destructure-props">Destructure Props <a href="#destructure-props">#</a></h3>
<p>Most React components are just functions. They get props and return markup. In a normal function you use the arguments it is passed directly, so it makes sense to apply the same principle here. No need to repeat <code>props</code> everywhere.</p>
<p>A reason not to destructure the props would be to distinguish what is external and what is internal state. But in a regular function there is no distinction between arguments and variables. Don’t create unnecessary patterns.</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code>
<span>function</span> <span>Input</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>input</span> <span>value</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>props<span>.</span>value<span>}</span></span> <span>onChange</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>props<span>.</span>onChange<span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span>
<span>}</span>


<span>function</span> <span>Component</span><span>(</span><span><span>{</span> value<span>,</span> onChange <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>state<span>,</span> setState<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>''</span><span>)</span>

  <span>return</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>...</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="number-of-props">Number of Props <a href="#number-of-props">#</a></h3>
<p>The question of how many props should a component receive is a subjective one. The number of props that a component has is correlated to how much it’s doing. The more props you pass to it the more responsibilities it has.</p>
<p>A high number of props is a signal that a component is doing too much.</p>
<p>If I go above 5 props I consider whether this component should be split. In some cases, it may just need a lot of data. An input field, for example, may have a lot of props. In others it’s a sign that something needs to be extracted.</p>
<p>Note: The more props a component takes, the more reasons to rerender.</p>
<h3 id="objects-instead-of-primitives">Pass Objects Instead of Primitives <a href="#objects-instead-of-primitives">#</a></h3>
<p>One way to limit the amount of props is to pass an object instead of primitive values. Rather than passing down the user name, email and settings one by one you can group them together. This also …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>Recently I read a post which said that the White House official website will be now powered by WordPress.</p>
<p>I was playing with a static site generator called Hexo, I even created my own theme for it, before I switched to WordPress.</p>
<h2><strong>Static</strong> <strong>site</strong> <strong>generator</strong>s are <strong>hard</strong> </h2>
<p>Yes, playing with a static site generator is fun. You can learn to create something, you can customize and build your own theme.</p>
<p>But for an average user it’s a pain. Writing content is pain, you have to use markdown, you have to use some YAML syntax. An average user does not want to learn another language to write content. They just want to write and publish.</p>
<p>As much as I love making new things, I just want to write and focus on what’s important to me. Not meddling with MD and YAML, especially when I write a long post.</p>
<h2>Can WordPress handle traffic?</h2>
<p>When my blog first hit the front page of hacker news, I got bit afraid. I thought it will crash.</p>
<p>I’m using a shared hosting for this blog after all. However, it stood very well. I’m passing my WordPress though CloudFlare and using a caching plugin and it stood well against the traffic of hacker news.</p>
<h2>Is WordPress safe?</h2>
<p>No software can be 100% safe, even the modules you are using for your JavaScript projects can have security vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>So even though WordPress can too have vulnerabilities, the WordPress core is pretty stable. You have to worry about the plug-ins that you chose to install.</p>
<p>Make sure you avoid installing unnecessary plugins, the less the better.</p>
<p>Also install plugins that are well maintained, and has a good community behind it. </p>
<p>Uninstall the plugins as soon as you don’t need them.</p>
<h2>Use Git </h2>
<p>Shared hosting providers allow one click install of WordPress via the cPanel, but it’s aways better to install your copy of WordPress locally and version control it via Git.</p>
<p>And since most shared hosting providers give you a terminal, or SSH ability, you will be able to push the changes to your shared hosting with Git.</p>
<h2>Final <strong>thoughts</strong> </h2>
<p>I guess WordPress ticks all the boxes of a good software.</p>
<ul><li>Maintainability ✅ </li><li>Dependability ✅ – The WordPress team maintain WordPress and it’s very much dependable than before.</li><li>Efficiency ✅ – With the right plugins it can be made efficient to handle a good amount of traffic.</li><li>Acceptability ✅ WordPress is accepted by many developers and the their is a community behind it. </li><li>Security ✅ The core of WordPress is pretty safe, it’s the third party plugins that you need to worry.</li></ul>
<p>At the end of the day, I just need to write my thoughts in my own place, and WordPress is the best solution currently available. Write, publish, repeat.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>While there may be subtle improvement in <a href="https://relayvibes.co/tag/tesla">Tesla</a>’s Full Self-Driving Beta since its first iteration was launched back in October, <a href="https://relayvibes.co/tag/waymo">Waymo</a> CEO, John Krafcik, seems to have an impression that there is a limit for Tesla’s current autonomous driving efforts. In an interview with the German business publication <a href="https://www.manager-magazin.de/consent-a-?targetUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.manager-magazin.de%2Funternehmen%2Fautoindustrie%2Fwaymo-john-krafcik-ueber-den-vorsprung-des-google-roboterautos-a-00000000-0002-0001-0000-000174925837" target="_blank" rel="noopener">manager magazin</a>, Krafcik had said that the electric car maker is never a competitor to Waymo, seeing Tesla’s tech as just a “really good driver assistance system.”</p>
<p>Waymo’s vehicles, equipped with a different kinds of sensors including LiDAR, are built to be operated to be driverless.</p>
<p>Waymo has even asked its users not to touch its autonomous cars’ steering wheel while the cars are in operation.</p>
<p>In contrast, Tesla’s Full Self-Driving Beta, and also the company’s tech Navigate on Autopilot, still need human touch as drivers still need to keep their hands on the steering wheel in preparation for manual involvement.</p>

<p>Tesla’s aim, which is to design a full self-driving suite via a vision-based system that depends on incremental improvements, will be rolled out over time.</p>
<p>Through steady updates which are developed on real-world driving data collected and gathered from its fleet, Tesla is hoping to roll out a version of its FSD suite which will totally be a hands-off system.</p>
<p>Once Tesla achieves this, the Electric Vehicle(<a href="https://relayvibes.co/tag/ev">EV</a>) maker aims to starts its own ride-hailing service, dubbed by Elon Musk as the Robotaxi Network.</p>

<p>According to the John Krafcik, this is a misconception. He also observed that between Tesla’s camera-based approach and Waymo’s more robust sensor suite, his company’s sensors is of better advantage over Tesla’s electric cars.</p>
<p>“It’s a misconception that you can just keep developing a driver assistance system till a day you can miraculously leap to a fully autonomous driving system. In terms of robustness and accuracy, take an example, our sensors are orders of magnitude better than what is seen on the road from other manufacturers,” said Krafcik.</p>
<p>One of the noted criticism against Waymo’s autonomous vehicles is their high cost, especially when considering their sensor suite which includes expensive components.</p>
<p>However, the CEO, noted that the cost of its cars are really overestimated, most especially as the price of some sensors such as LiDAR has clearly gone down over the years. Today, Krafcik believes that the cost of a Waymo car is actually on the same range as a moderately-equipped Mercedes-Benz S-Class.</p>
<p>John Krafcik also noted that he is expecting the cost of hardware per mile of Waymo’s autonomous cars to come in at about $0.30/mile before maintenance and service costs, this includes fleet technicians and customer support <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johanmoreno/2021/01/22/waymo-ceo-says-tesla-is-not-a-competitor-gives-estimated-cost-of-autonomous-vehicles/?sh=2b3325e4541b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">services</a>.</p>
<p>Today, comparing this to ride-hailing services, such as Uber and Lyft, who are operating at about $2-$3/mile.</p>
<p>Tesla, however, on the other hand, aims at achieving an $0.18/mile operating cost for its Robotaxi Network.</p>

    <p>Do you want to speed up CSS file loading? Do you also see this waterfall chart in the Network
Tab of your DevTools?
There is a simple measure to help the browser optimize loading assets. Preload them.<br>I think it is <strong>superior to bundling</strong>. It is less complex and has better caching behavior.</p>
<p>Let's start by looking at how we used to do it.</p>
<h2 is="more-h2" id="before">Before</h2>
<p>We normally use </p>
<pre><code>&lt;!-- blog.html --&gt;
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="blog.css"&gt;
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="_nav.css"&gt;</code></pre>
<p>This loads two CSS files, which might look like this:</p>
<pre><code>/* blog.css */
@import "../_global.css";
@import "../_nav.css";

/* _global.css */
@import "./_vars.css";
@import "./_reset.css";</code></pre>
<p>They causes the network view to show this graph and clearly shows that loading one file
results in loading more files. Even though we actually know what other files will need to be loaded.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://picostitch.com/tidbits/2021/01/preload-1.png" alt="Preload waterfall, not ideal" width="100%">
    <figcaption>Preload waterfall, not ideal</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Let's optimize loading the CSS files.</p>
<h2 is="more-h2" id="after">After</h2>
<p>Preloading the assets is as easy as adding a couple of lines in your site's <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>.
In the above example we can preload like this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;link rel="preload" href="/_vars.css" as="style"&gt;
&lt;link rel="preload" href="/_reset.css" as="style"&gt;
&lt;link rel="preload" href="/_global.css" as="style"&gt;
&lt;link rel="preload" href="/_nav.css" as="style"&gt;</code></pre>
<p>and it will result in a network graph looking like this:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://picostitch.com/tidbits/2021/01/preload-2.png" alt="Preloading all CSS files. No waterfall. Ideal." width="100%">
    <figcaption>Preloading all CSS files. No waterfall. Ideal.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h2 is="more-h2" id="superior-to-bundling---why">Superior to Bundling - Why?</h2>
<p>It brings <strong>less complexity</strong>. Bundlers themselves are complex tools. You can drops them
completely for the CSS part of a site by leveraging preloading. You might want to
generate the preload-tags if manual maintanence is a burden. For this site I am sticking to
manually building them. It's not worth the effort (yet).</p>
<p>The browser can <strong>optimize caching</strong> of small files, instead of a big bundled CSS file.
If you deploy multiple times a day you can prevent the customer to have to download a new
bundle every time they visit the site. Using this approach files like <code>_vars.css</code> or <code>_reset.css</code>
may not change as often as others, so the browser won't need to reload them, and even less
a big bundled CSS file.</p>
<h2 is="more-h2" id="details">Details</h2>
<p>On MDN the article 
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Preloading_content">Preloading content with rel="preload"</a>
describes how and what can be preloaded in way more detail.</p>

                <section>
                    <p>Cassandra is a popular, tried-and-true NoSQL database that supports key-value wide-column tables. Like any powerful tool, Cassandra has its ideal use cases - in particular, Cassandra excels at supporting write-heavy workloads, while having limitations when supporting read-heavy workloads. Cassandra's eventual consistency model and lack of transactions, multi-table support like joins, subqueries can also limit its usefulness.</p><p>However, using Cassandra as a metadata database for an object storage system introduces significant complexity resulting in data integrity and performance issues at scale - particularly if one wants to use their object store as a primary storage system. Object storage needs are far simpler and different from what Cassandra is built for.</p><p>Because the implications of employing Cassandra as a object storage metadata database were not properly understood, many object storage vendors made it a foundational part of their architecture - unfortunately it keeps them from ever moving past simple archival workloads into the modern workloads that define the future of object storage (AI/ML, analytics, web/mobile applications).</p><p>Let’s explore why in a little more detail.</p><ol><li>Cassandra was never designed to manage file or object storage metadata and it is predictably weak in this regard. It is <a href="https://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra-oss/2.2/cassandra/dml/dmlTransactionsDiffer.html">not ACID compliant</a>. It does not have the rigidity to prevent partially successful writes, dupes, contradictions and the like. Cassandra does not support joins or foreign keys, and consequently does not offer consistency in the ACID sense. Further, there is no capacity to roll back transactions in the event of a failure. <p>While Cassandra supports atomicity and isolation at the row-level, it trades transactional isolation and atomicity for high availability and fast write performance. </p></li><li>Cassandra is categorized as an AP system in CAP. Meaning it trades Consistency for Availability and Partition tolerance. When employing Cassandra as a metadata database for an object store, you can either be fast or consistent - but not both at the same time. <p>Cassandra’s tunable consistency is a compromise, not a feature. Any setting other than <a href="https://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra-oss/3.0/cassandra/dml/dmlConfigConsistency.html">QUORUM or ALL</a> means you are at risk of reading stale data. It is important to apply this consistency setting for both read and write operations in addition to the object data operations performed outside of it. </p><p>In the object storage world, the implication is that you can be good for archival use cases (write once, read very infrequently) or you choose a different architecture. </p></li><li>Similar to the consistency problem, durability guarantee is also a tradeoff between performance and correctness. The storage engine’s default <a href="https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/architecture/storage_engine.html">commit log</a> is set to sync periodically every 10 seconds. This means you will lose up to 10 seconds worth of latest updates in the event of power failure. The only reasonable way to make Cassandra durable is to use the synchronous batch mode committer which comes with a performance penalty. </li><li>Cassandra’s high-availability guarantee is not suited for erasure coded object stores. With a replication factor of 3 and consistency quorum of 2, Cassandra can only tolerate a single node / drive failure within a replication group. Increasing the replication factor and quorum consistency to 5 or higher serves only to make the meta performance go from bad to worse. Unlike replication, erasure coding can tolerate multiple servers and drives failures in a distributed system. Even if you have configured the erasure code setting to 6 parity (any 6 nodes may fail) in a 16 node setup, you are still limited by the weak link, i.e Cassandra’s replication factor. The ops team is often unaware of these high-availability surprises until it is too late.</li><li>Object storage systems organize the data in a tree structured hierarchical namespace. Since Cassandra does not support a hierarchical key namespace, you will have to build a tree data model on top for each directory prefix and also maintain a flat list for direct lookups without directory walk. Atomically updating multiple tables with batched commit log and full read / write quorum is slow and prone to &nbsp;corruption.</li><li>While objects themselves are immutable, the object storage system is mutable. When you add, remove, overwrite objects and its metadata, apply policies, collect metrics, grant session tokens and rotating credentials, the metadata is always mutating. Cassandra is not designed to handle this level of metadata mutation and definitely not for the primary storage workloads. Long term archival use cases where the objects are large (GBs in size) and infrequently accessed, will work - other use cases will not..<p>The reason is that Cassandra's log structured storage system quickly appends new writes to the end of the log file, but delays the deletes and overwrites with a tombstone marker. Vacuuming these tombstones is an expensive operation, because the actual delete operation is applied by copying the SSTables to a new table sieving the stale entries in the process. This operation has to be performed on all the nodes simultaneously. If you delay vacuuming, excessive tombstones will result in increased read latencies, memory GC pauses and failed queries. Some object storage vendors use an additional Redis database to offload Cassandra’s pressure. Using two databases to manage an object stores metadata is hardly elegant and introduces additional points of failure. &nbsp;</p><p>The biggest gotcha? You won’t see these problems until you are deep into production and it is too late.</p></li><li>Small objects (KB to MB in size) will fill up the metadata drives dedicated to Cassandra much sooner than the data drives. Also small object workloads exacerbate Cassandra’s limitations, because they are sensitive to latency and consistency issues. &nbsp;Some vendors store small objects entirely inside Cassandra to address this problem. At this point, you are merely looking at an S3 proxy on top of Cassandra database. <p>This too is a bad practice. </p><p>If you use your object store for large objects and employ erasure coding and use Cassandra as your data store for small objects and use replication - you have introduced a non-trivial SLA problem. In this approach, data is protected by different guarantees. Given that drives die all the time, the probability of serving an old object or a corrupted object goes up considerably. </p><p>As noted above, your metadata database is now the weak link. Availability, consistency and durability guarantees are only as good as the weakest link. If the weakest link employs replication (three copies) you can only withstand one-node or one drive failure before losing data.</p><p>A counter argument might be to replicate five copies. The result is a massive performance hit and you can still really only withstand two-node or two-drive failure. </p><p>In using replication for small objects and erasure coding for large objects you also undermine the efficiency gains associated with EC. If you only use erasure code for large objects (likely a small percent of your overall object pool) you don’t gain much but increase your exposure considerably.</p></li><li>Employing Cassandra as your metadata database for an object store also introduces a troublesome Java dependency. This in turn can result in bloatware and memory management issues. Cassandra taxes the JVM memory management with constant large scale metadata allocation and mutation resulting in memory exhaustion and garbage collection pauses. </li></ol><p>The obvious takeaway is that it is a lot more complicated to operate a Cassandra cluster than a properly designed object storage system. Cassandra is built for a different purpose and object-storage meta-data is not one of them. The areas where Cassandra struggles are the areas that are core to a performant, scalable and resilient object store.</p><p>The last point is of note - object storage is a natural fit for blob data and that is why Erasure Coding is so effective and efficient. Cassandra is designed for replication. When you use that model for metadata it breaks the object store’s erasure coding advantage (or at the very least makes it brittle and prone to breakage).</p><p><strong>Bottom line. Write your metadata atomically with your object. Never separate them.</strong><br></p><p>We welcome your comments.

<a href="https://github.com/eatonphil/gosql">gosql</a> and I wanted to use it to

critical feature in gosql is <code>LIMIT</code> and <code>OFFSET</code> support. This post walks
through the few key changes to gosql to support <code>LIMIT</code> and <code>OFFSET</code>.</p>

<p>
  Just to call explicitly, with <code>LIMIT</code>
  and <code>OFFSET</code> we still have to check every single row in
  the table (at least until we've reached the offset). This should
  clearly illustrate why paginating based on <code>LIMIT</code>
  and <code>OFFSET</code> is not a great idea for big datasets
  <a href="https://use-the-index-luke.com/sql/partial-results/fetch-next-page">compared
  to index-based pagination</a>.

<p>In the past four years, I wrote three eBooks about programming. It’s like an
addiction.</p>
<p>I would be terrible at talking about writing techniques, so I won’t. But the
content is not everything when you write an eBook. You have to care about
creating <strong>beautiful files to release</strong>: PDF, ePub, Kindle…</p>
<p>Here is the story of how I built my eBooks, especially
<a href="https://gum.co/use-hooks">the last one</a>. After some trial and errors, in the
end, I used the same recipe as the two previous ones, and it involves a
fantastic tool: <strong>Pandoc</strong>.</p>

<p>I wanted my last eBook to be a practical guide, not an academic manual. So I
imagined a very <strong>custom design</strong>, with a <strong>dark theme</strong> and many colors (it is
not designed to be printed).</p>
<p>Since it was about coding, I also wanted to include some source code examples
with <strong>syntax highlighting</strong>.</p>
<p>Bust most of all, I wanted an efficient workflow.</p>

<p>I intended to release a first version of the book ASAP, then iterate thanks to
readers’ feedback and new ideas I had. For this reason, I wanted to focus on the
content and on the appearance <strong>independently</strong>.</p>

<p>I didn’t want to spend time on the presentation each time I updated the content.
I’m a web developer; it wouldn’t occur to me to edit my CSS each time I update
the HTML content. Same here.</p>

<p>I thought: why not just use <strong>MS Word</strong> or its Apple version, <strong>Pages</strong>? Well, I
tried. It didn’t go well.</p>
<p>You can customize pretty much everything you want. Every color, font family,
font size… But it gets trickier when you want to include source code.</p>
<p>Since I wanted to have syntax highlighting, the <em>less bad</em> solution I found was
to copy and paste from VS Code. At first, it looked (kind of) okay, but as soon
as I wanted to modify it, it went terribly: the formatting was lost, spaces were
inserted where I didn’t want them…</p>
<p>Definitely, these tools are not made to write content with embedded source code.</p>
<p>I also tried <strong>Illustrator</strong> and its open-source alternative,
<a href="https://www.scribus.net/"><strong>Scribus</strong></a>.</p>
<p>It was worse.</p>
<p>I admire people able to use these applications. They seem to require a lot of
training and practice. Unfortunately, I intended to release my book in the next
two years, so I didn’t have time to learn them. 😉</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m used to writing content using <strong>Markdown</strong>. Or in <strong>Slack</strong>. Or in
<strong>Notion</strong> (for this blog post). Today, we have such perfect tools for
writing. I didn’t want to struggle each time I update some examples.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, in the end, I relied on the tool I used for my previous books: <strong>Pandoc</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a> is a command-line tool whose main feature is
converting some text (usually Markdown) to another format: HTML, ePub, PDF, etc.</p>
<p>I used it for my other books, and it’s perfect for “academic” work (thesis,
research articles). But I wasn’t sure that creating something a bit more
original, with shiny colors and such, was possible.</p>

<blockquote data-conversation="none" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I spent around 5 hours to write the content, and lost the same amount of time looking for a publishing software or Saas to generate beautiful PDF for developer-oriented content, with source code.

</center>
<p>To write the content, I could now write using Markdown, with the basic
formatting options I needed: titles, italic, source code… And the source code
was highlighted!</p>
<p>By the way, syntax highlighting is themeable, and I really wanted to use
<a href="https://draculatheme.com/">Dracula</a>, which I already used for my VSCode. So I
created
<a href="https://gist.github.com/scastiel/4c409156ad4bc6a6dbbfe2abbd163671#file-dracula-theme">a custom theme</a>
for it. 🙂</p>

<p>The only thing I find problematic with Pandoc is
<a href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html">its documentation</a>. It contains a lot of
information, but it’s on one page.</p>
<p>One page!</p>
<p>So you scroll, then scroll, and scroll again. And when you want to find
something, you do Cmd/Ctrl+F, type “color”, oh cool, there is something. Then
you realize you’re in the section concerning the generation of some obscure and
unknown document format…</p>
<p>Anyway, you can usually find what you’re looking for. I’d just prefer if it used
something more modern, such as Gitbook or Docusaurus, to maintain the
documentation and make it easier to navigate.</p>

<p>Pandoc is very good at generating HTML or an ePub file. You can give it some CSS
to customize anything you want. It would be a dream if you were able to do the
same to generate a customized PDF.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it is slightly more complicated…</p>

<p>To generate PDFs, Pandoc uses <em>pdflatex</em>, which relies on
<strong><a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a></strong>. The LaTeX language is used to write
documents with a powerful but unusual syntax. These documents are then converted
to PDF, Postscript, etc.</p>
<p>So, a little like Pandoc. But with a weird syntax instead of beautiful Markdown.</p>
<p>Long story short, if you want to customize the PDF rendered by Pandoc with
<em>pdflatex</em>, you don’t have a choice: you need to provide some LaTeX code, a bit
like CSS.</p>
<p>And I didn’t want to spend several months learning LaTeX—it’s truly fantastic,
you can do anything you want with it. So I did what every good developer hates
doing: search on Google and copy-paste pieces of code.</p>
<p>Here is, for example, how I managed to have the book title in the page footer:
(sorry if you are a LaTeX guru, it probably will hurt your eyes)</p>
<pre><code><span>\usepackage</span><span>{</span><span>fancyhdr</span><span>}</span><br><span>\pagestyle</span><span>{</span>fancy<span>}</span><br><span>\fancyhf</span><span>{</span><span>}</span><br><span>\lfoot</span><span>{</span><br>  <span>\begin</span><span>{</span><span>tikzpicture</span><span>}</span><span>[</span>overlay,baseline=<span>{</span>(0,0)<span>}</span><span>]</span><br>  <span>\node</span><span>[</span>rectangle, outer sep=0pt, text=white, anchor=west <span>]</span><br>    (pageno)<br>    <span>{</span>A React Developer’s Guide to Hooks, © Sebastien Castiel<span>}</span>;<br>  <span>\draw</span><span>[</span>fill=comment, draw=comment<span>]</span><br>    (<span>[</span>xshift=-<span>\oddsidemargin</span>-1in<span>]</span>pageno.north west)<br>      rectangle<br>    (<span>[</span>yshift=1.5pt<span>]</span>pageno.south east);<br>  <span>\end</span><span>{</span><span>tikzpicture</span><span>}</span><br><span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Well, to be fair, it would have been much more straightforward if I just wanted
the book title. But I wanted it in an indigo rectangle starting from the far
left of the page.</p>

<p>Still, most of the time, I was able to get what I wanted. It just took more time
than I wanted to spend on it.</p>
<p><em>You can find here
<a href="https://gist.github.com/scastiel/4c409156ad4bc6a6dbbfe2abbd163671#file-header-tex">the complete LaTeX header file</a>
I used for my book. I cleaned it a little and added some comments.</em></p>
<p>Although I didn’t interact with them, I’m sure the LaTeX community is fantastic
because you can find many resources on the Internet: answers on forums,
tutorials, manuals, etc.</p>

<p>I think the last time I used the
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html">GNU make</a> utility was like
ten years ago. I had this idea that it was only used by C or C++ projects.</p>
<p>If you never heard of <strong>GNU make</strong>, it’s a utility program to run specific
commands to generate files. It’s mostly used to compile and build programs, but
you can use it for any command.</p>
<p>My first intuition was to write a shell script to generate my book in several
formats. Quickly, I realized a <strong>Makefile</strong> would make more sense:</p>
<ul>
<li>I had <em>content</em> files and <em>resource</em> files (images, the LaTeX header, for
example)</li>
<li>I needed to generate intermediate files, such as the cover as a PDF from a PNG</li>
<li>Some formats (ePub) were used to create other formats (Kindle)</li>
</ul>
<p>Using a Makefile, I regenerated only the needed parts, based on which files were
updated since the latest build. I could run <code>make pdf</code>, <code>make epub</code>,
<code>make mobi</code>, or just <code>make</code> to generate all formats.</p>
<p>Here is the portion of my Makefile used to generate the <em>ePub</em> and <em>mobi</em>
(Kindle) files:</p>
<pre><code>BOOK_TITLE <span>=</span> A\ React\ Developer’s\ Guide\ to\ Hooks\ -\ Sebastien\ Castiel<p><span>epub</span><span>:</span> dist/<span>$</span><span>{</span>BOOK_TITLE<span>}</span>.epub<br>  <span>@</span>echo <span>'✅  ePub'</span></p><p><span>kindle</span><span>:</span> dist/<span>$</span><span>{</span>BOOK_TITLE<span>}</span>.mobi<br>  <span>@</span>echo ‘✅  Kindle’</p><p><span>dist/<span>$</span>{BOOK_TITLE}.epub</span><span>:</span> dist content/*.md images/* resources/dracula.theme resources/metadata.xml resources/epub.css<br>  <span>@</span>pandoc content/foreword.md content/ch*.md content/resources.md \<br>  --output<span>=</span>dist/<span>$</span><span>{</span>BOOK_TITLE<span>}</span>.epub \<br>  --highlight-style resources/dracula.theme \<br>  --standalone \<br>  --epub-metadata<span>=</span>resources/metadata.xml \<br>  -c resources/epub.css \<br>  --epub-cover-image<span>=</span>cover.png \<br>  --toc --toc-depth<span>=</span>1 \<br>  --metadata title<span>=</span><span>"A React Developer’s Guide to Hooks"</span></p><p><span>dist/<span>$</span>{BOOK_TITLE}.mobi</span><span>:</span> dist/<span>$</span><span>{</span>BOOK_TITLE<span>}</span>.epub<br>  <span>@</span>kindlegen dist/<span>$</span><span>{</span>BOOK_TITLE<span>}</span>.epub -o <span>$</span><span>{</span>BOOK_TITLE<span>}</span>.mobi &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1</p></code></pre>
<p>Okay, maybe slightly overkill for my needs, but I felt so powerful! 💪🏻</p>
<p><em>You can find
<a href="https://gist.github.com/scastiel/4c409156ad4bc6a6dbbfe2abbd163671#file-makefile">here the complete Makefile</a>
for my book.</em></p>

<p>I embedded the examples’ source code in a small <strong>React</strong> application to run
them locally. The user can start it by running <code>yarn start</code> and navigate easily
through them.</p>
<p>Now, I feel a bit silly not to have thought of using
<a href="https://storybook.js.org/">Storybook</a>, which could have been a perfect
solution.</p>

<p>I often design graphics using <strong><a href="https://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a></strong> (for
example, the banner for the <a href="https://gum.co/use-hooks">Gumroad page</a>), even if
at the end I manipulate and generate bitmap images. I know it’s not its first
purpose, but I find it easier to use than Gimp or commercial alternatives.</p>
<p>If you know a better choice, please please please tell me!</p>

<p>From the beginning, I really wanted a custom presentation with a dark theme.</p>
<p>Now, I realize this wish took me a lot of extra time. And I would have preferred
spending that time on the content. Plus, I don’t know if the readers actually
like this theme or not…</p>
<p>Also, it may have been better to focus first on the <strong>web support</strong>.
<a href="https://v2.docusaurus.io/">Docusaurus</a> could do an excellent job: readers could
navigate the sections, search for keywords, etc.</p>
<p>The PDF or ePub version would be secondary content: available, but maybe with a
generic appearance. So what?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the end, if the user finds the content useful, shouldn’t it be all that
matters?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I will probably consider this change soon. Plus, I’d like to create a <strong>course</strong>
(without video) from the book’s content…</p>
<p>Regarding the workflow with Pandoc, I’m quite satisfied with it. Writing using
Markdown is lovely to focus on the content without caring how it will render.
And since Markdown is text, it’s easy to keep track of the history using Git. 🙂</p>

<p>Sci-Hub is&nbsp;since 2011&nbsp;the world´s most celebrated – and despised – «shadow library», performing&nbsp;«pirate style»&nbsp;copying and republishing&nbsp;for free of subscription based&nbsp;academic articles.&nbsp;The initiator, Alexandra Elbakyan&nbsp;(32)&nbsp;of Kazakhstan,&nbsp;has given&nbsp;a number of interviews but&nbsp;here Finnish library activist and philosopher&nbsp;Mikael Böök&nbsp;in an e-mail interview&nbsp;asks&nbsp;his own&nbsp;specific and&nbsp;very&nbsp;current&nbsp;questions.&nbsp;Just now she´s in the news with a lawsuit against her&nbsp;by&nbsp;Elsevier, Wiley&nbsp;etc.&nbsp;We also get her opinions on Plan S, on joining IFLA and on her alleged&nbsp;Russian&nbsp;communist espionage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&gt;&gt; <a href="https://bibliotekettarsaka.com/english-version/">About this blog</a></p>



<p>First Mikael explains his idea and approach for&nbsp;his&nbsp;interview:</p>



<p>It was not possible for me to meet up «physically» with Alexandra Elbakyan for this interview. Nor was it absolutely necessary. Having found her contact details on the Net, I asked her, at the beginning of December 2020, if she was willing to dialog with me about e-books, libraries and so called «shadow libraries». I told her that I had just finished a general essay (here [<a href="http://www.kaapeli.fi/book/#English"><u>http://www.kaapeli.fi/book/#English</u></a>]) on e-books in public libraries, and in the Z-Library, which is a so called «shadow library»; now I needed to consult her for another essay on the question of open access to scientific literature and Sci-Hub. Alexandra accepted to start an exchange of views with me, whereupon I formulated a first set of questions for her. She made clear that it would take some time for her to answer them. Waiting for her answers, I spent hours on the web, and reading books, trying to deepen my knowledge about the situation of the open access movement in general, and Sci-Hub in particular. This process led to the questions and answers which are published below.</p>



<p>– <em>Would you like to tell a little about yourself and your background so that people who become interested can then go, for instance, to your blog Engineuring.wordpress.com to find out more?</em></p>



<p>– I’m from Kazakhstan, and I was born in&nbsp;an&nbsp;engineering family. My grandmother was an engineering surveyor and mother a computer&nbsp;programming engineer. So I started creating websites when I was 12 years old and wrote my first computer program in Delphi language when I was 14. Back then a game named Tamagotchi was popular, it is a virtual pet that you can feed, groom and it grows. I was trying to program a Tamagotchi with artificial intelligence inside, so it will also behave as a real animal. I became gradually interested in how cognition works, so I collected a lot of e-books about neuroscience, artificial neural networks and so on. At the university I got interested in&nbsp;the&nbsp;technology of Brain-Machine Interfaces, that can connect your brain to&nbsp;a computer&nbsp;directly. So I started thinking how we can merge our consciousness into&nbsp;a computer&nbsp;using such technologies.</p>

<p>After graduating from Kazakh National Tech University&nbsp;in 2009, I applied to a PhD program in&nbsp;the United&nbsp;States to study bioengineering and such technologies, but was not accepted.&nbsp;So I remained in Kazakhstan and started working as a computer programmer.</p>



<p>I also participated in online forums for scientists. Here I learned that many researchers had a problem with access to academic journals and books, because it was very expensive. So I used my programming skills to create a Sci-Hub web application. Using that application any person can read expensive academic literature absolutely for free! The program immediately became very popular among Russian researchers and then, in the whole world. Today more than 500,000 researchers and students of science use Sci-Hub every day to get access to academic journals.</p>



<p>– <em>In your blog you write that Sci-Hub resembles a so called web scraper. Grateful if you can open the meaning of this technical term a little. And can you then outline the history of Sci-Hub and illustrate how it is being used as a webservice? For instance, it is known that over the years, there has been a certain division of labour between Sci-Hub and Library Genesis (Libgen). What do Sci-Hub and Library Genesis have in common? How do they differ?</em></p>



<p>– Sci-Hub in its essence is a web scraper: A program that downloads web pages from the Internet, processes them, extracts information from these web pages, and saves some information in the database. We have those paid websites with academic journals that many researchers are unable to afford. So what Sci-Hub does in its core, it downloads information from these paid websites, and then provides this information for free to the users.</p>



<p>So how exactly&nbsp;does&nbsp;Sci-Hub download information from paid websites? Some universities are subscribed to these websites. So when you open such&nbsp;a&nbsp;website from the university, it will provide all information for free. Next, all universities provide&nbsp;<em>proxy servers</em>. Using such&nbsp;a&nbsp;proxy server a student or a professor can open these websites&nbsp;<em>as if</em>they open&nbsp;it&nbsp;from&nbsp;the&nbsp;university, while being at home. See? Sci-Hub collects many passwords from students and professors. Then it uses proxy servers to access the websites&nbsp;<em>as if</em>&nbsp;they are accessed from universities that have subscriptions.&nbsp;Using a proxy to access the website, Sci-Hub web scraper downloads paid academic journals and provides them to its users for free.</p>

<p>That is the core of Sci-Hub: a&nbsp;web scraper<em><strong>&nbsp;</strong></em>working through&nbsp;password-protected&nbsp;<em>proxy servers</em>.</p>



<p>There is a widespread&nbsp;<em>lie</em>&nbsp;that Sci-Hub is a search engine while in fact it never had any search function at all.&nbsp;What&nbsp;a&nbsp;search engine such as Google does,&nbsp;is&nbsp;it gets a bunch of keywords from users, then it surveys web pages on the Internet, looking for such keywords. If some web page contains such keywords, it is displayed to the user. There is no similarities to Sci-Hub.&nbsp;Yes, search engines also&nbsp;contain&nbsp;web scrapers to download web pages from the whole Internet. Then they extract keywords from these web pages and store them in database. When&nbsp;a&nbsp;user is looking for some keyword,&nbsp;a&nbsp;search engine checks&nbsp;its database for matching&nbsp;web pages.&nbsp;And sometimes you can look up for free versions of academic journals using&nbsp;a&nbsp;search engine such as Google.&nbsp;But that is&nbsp;very&nbsp;different from what Sci-Hub does.</p>



<p>Library Genesis is another website that is different from Sci-Hub. Basically it is a huge database that stores millions of academic ebooks. It exists, as far as I know, from 2007 or 2008, and contains also a search engine to look up books in that database.</p>



<p>I created Sci-Hub to access academic journals in 2011 and after that&nbsp;Library Genesis had an idea to store academic journals in their database too, not only books.&nbsp;So they asked me if they&nbsp;could&nbsp;save research articles that Sci-Hub downloads in their database, and we started collaborating. At the beginning Sci-Hub worked without any database at all. Then it started using LibGen database to save the articles, so there will be no need to download them again every time they&nbsp;are&nbsp;requested.</p>



<p>Starting from 2014-2015 Sci-Hub has its own databases and it does not rely on LibGen, but still all new articles downloaded by Sci-Hub are uploaded to LibGen.</p>



<p>So the difference between Sci-Hub and LibGen is that Sci-Hub is primarily an article-download engine, while LibGen is a database without an integrated algorithm to download new articles.</p>



<p>– <em>Sci-Hub and Libgen are often mentioned among the so called ‘shadow libraries’ (in the Wikipedia, for instance, and in the 2018 book «Shadow Libraries» edited by Joe Karaganis.) Then there is yet another ‘shadow library’ which I myself stumbled upon and started to explorate even before I had heard about Libgen. I am surprised that almost nobody talks about the Z-Library. What do you know about that one? (I for one know practically nothing except that it is big, seemingly Moscow-based and maintained on a server in China.) By the way, is the epithet ‘shadow library’ an apt description of a service like Sci-Hub which gives the researchers ‘open access’ to the articles of their colleagues?</em></p>



<p>I remember there&nbsp;were&nbsp;some mistakes in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Sci-Hub description in that «Shadow Libraries» book by Karaganis, but I do not remember exactly which mistakes. I was very angry when I read the book:&nbsp;They could&nbsp;have&nbsp;asked&nbsp;me to proof-read their chapter about Sci-Hub before publishing, but they didn´t!</p>

<p>As far as Z-Library is concerned, I know that is a website that basically mirrors Library Genesis books database, including the database of Sci-Hub articles.</p>



<p>Why nobody talks about Z-Library and everyone talks about Sci-Hub? Sometimes people even have conspiracy theories why Sci-Hub got such fame and recognition. What can I say? Sci-Hub is actually the&nbsp;<em>first</em>&nbsp;website to provide free access to academic journals on a massive scale. Before Sci-Hub there existed websites such as Gigapedia or library.nu, Library Genesis and others that provided academic&nbsp;<em>books</em>&nbsp;for free, but not&nbsp;<em>journal articles</em>. Sci-Hub became the&nbsp;<em>first</em>&nbsp;website to target that academic journals problem!</p>



<p>For a long time the existence of Sci-Hub was censored in the media. Sci-Hub started in 2011 and immediately became popular among researchers but… even in 2015 articles discussing the problem of access to academic journals did not mention Sci-Hub!</p>



<p>Then in 2015 the lawsuit from Elsevier came, that included both Sci-Hub, Library Genesis and its mirrors such as Z-Library. A website named TorrentFreak published a short article about the lawsuit, and it listed Sci-Hub… as a mirror of Library Genesis! I read the article and became extremely angry. Then I contacted the journalist to correct the mistake, and they …</p></div></div>

<p>Scrum has good intentions. Measuring your productivity. Accountability to not do more or less than we agree to do upfront. Increasing visibility for stakeholders. Communication as a team to help each other perform better. The problem is that Scrum’s methods for pursuing these things are not well suited to the act of building software. The first issue I have with Scrum is that the entire system is built around the assumption that you can reasonably estimate how long software development tasks are going to take. Unfortunately, this is extremely difficult, primarily due to 3 things:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Hidden complexity.</strong> Unless you’re doing something you’ve done before, using the exact same tools and the exact same techniques, it is difficult to know how complicated a given task will be. <i>Today’s tools and techniques change so rapidly that you’re almost never doing things the exact same way.</i> And thus, one problem that looks menacing takes 30 minutes to fix; another problem that seems simple takes 3 days.</li>
<li><strong>Inconsistent overhead.</strong> Every week, customer crises, bugs that made it past your tests, issues with your libraries that demand you fork and fix, a necessary refactoring uncovered by a feature requirement, and a thousand other “things that come up” occupy our time. These cannot be planned for or anticipated, and they inject a regular but inconsistent amount of overhead that takes us away from executing the plan.</li>
<li><strong>Distractions that affect you differently.</strong> If you’re a developer, you operate in 2 primary modes: Flow and Stuckness. If you’re in a state of Flow (more on this later), you know what you must do and you’re getting it done rapidly. But the smallest of distractions can bring the whole thing to a screeching halt. Distractions are a bad thing when you’re in Flow. But if you’re in a state of Stuckness, you don’t know what’s wrong, and you use the Scientific Method until you solve the problem. John Cowan <a href="http://recycledknowledge.blogspot.com/2005/06/flow-stuckness-and-interruptions.html" target="_blank">says</a>, <i>“Stuckness cannot be overcome by will or planning, only by insight, and the arrival of insight is not predictable. Striving for insight can often be what prevents it from being achieved. The motto ‘Sleep on it’ reflects the perception that blocking the conscious mind can be just the right thing to allow the unconscious mind to operate, often giving the key to the problem as if from nowhere. Distraction is an equally successful approach. During times of stuckness, therefore, interruptions are actually desirable, as they allow this useful distraction.”</i> Since distraction affects developers differently, depending on which mode we are operating in, we cannot know whether the inevitable distractions this week will be a great help, or a great hindrance to us getting work done.</li>
</ol>
<p>These 3 things destroy the elegance of Scrum, by making it very difficult to estimate how long work will take.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.aaron-gray.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/estimate-your-work.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.aaron-gray.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/estimate-your-work.jpg" alt="If you could just tell me how long your work will take, that would be great." title="That Would Be Great" width="526" height="440" srcset="https://www.aaron-gray.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/estimate-your-work.jpg 526w, https://www.aaron-gray.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/estimate-your-work-300x251.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 526px) 100vw, 526px"></a></p>
<p>Not only that, Scrum assumes that you can estimate how long other people’s tasks are going to take! Planning poker assumes that every member of the team can have a reasonable idea of how long everyone else’s tasks on other parts of the system will take. And since Scrum advocates cross-functional teams, this means that a QA person is estimating how long a developer’s job is going to take. This means that a developer is estimating how long a designer’s job is going to take. This is totally unrealistic.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.aaron-gray.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/estimate-my-work-too.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.aaron-gray.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/estimate-my-work-too.jpg" alt="if you could just tell me how long my work will take, that would be great too." title="That Would Be Great" width="526" height="440" srcset="https://www.aaron-gray.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/estimate-my-work-too.jpg 526w, https://www.aaron-gray.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/estimate-my-work-too-300x251.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 526px) 100vw, 526px"></a></p>
<p>Now, some people will be quick to point out – we don’t measure Scrum tasks by time, we measure them by complexity, or effort, or points, or something else. Unfortunately, this is just a pretty little wrapper that cleverly tries to pacify developers who say that programming estimates are inaccurate, and to satisfy project managers who still want estimates. Because even if you use this wrapper, Scrum still demands that you declare how much work you’re going to do in this sprint – in this fixed time iteration. Scrum wants you to repeatedly answer the question, <i>“Given a certain number of workers and a fixed amount of time, how much work can we do?”</i> By definition, this equation requires you to – implicitly or explicitly – estimate how long each work task is going to take. So, any way you spin it, Scrum assumes you can reliably estimate task duration.</p>
<p>For the reasons listed above, I reject the assumption that you can reliably estimate how long your own tasks are going to take, much less everyone else’s.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.aaron-gray.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/one-does-not-simply-estimate-task-duration.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.aaron-gray.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/one-does-not-simply-estimate-task-duration.jpg" alt="One does not simply estimate how long something will take to program." title="One Does Not Simply" width="568" height="335" srcset="https://www.aaron-gray.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/one-does-not-simply-estimate-task-duration.jpg 568w, https://www.aaron-gray.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/one-does-not-simply-estimate-task-duration-300x177.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 568px) 100vw, 568px"></a></p>
<p>Some people say that you have to estimate how long things will take for your clients’ sake. Well, I think estimates are wrong more often than they are right, so deadlines and dates tend to be inaccurate in our line of work. Making a habit of estimating things means that you often miss your estimates, and this cultivates a slippery slope that results in either client distrust due to things taking longer than originally expected, or decrease in craftsmanship as you are tempted to “just get it done” because you are trying to meet your estimate even though you know the next guy who touches that code is going to have a bad time.</p>

<p>Scrum fits nicely into the manager’s schedule, but not the <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html" target="_blank">maker’s schedule</a>. Paul Graham coined the term in his classic piece about the difference between managers and makers in regards to time management.</p>
<blockquote><p>
One reason programmers dislike meetings so much is that they’re on a different type of schedule from other people. Meetings cost them more. </p>
<p>There are two types of schedule, which I’ll call the manager’s schedule and the maker’s schedule. The manager’s schedule is for bosses. It’s embodied in the traditional appointment book, with each day cut into one hour intervals. You can block off several hours for a single task if you need to, but by default you change what you’re doing every hour.</p>
<p>When you use time that way, it’s merely a practical problem to meet with someone. Find an open slot in your schedule, book them, and you’re done.</p>
<p>Most powerful people are on the manager’s schedule. It’s the schedule of command. But there’s another way of using time that’s common among people who make things, like programmers and writers. They generally prefer to use time in units of half a day at least. You can’t write or program well in units of an hour. That’s barely enough time to get started.</p>
<p>When you’re operating on the maker’s schedule, meetings are a disaster. A single meeting can blow a whole afternoon, by breaking it into two pieces each too small to do anything hard in… For someone on the maker’s schedule, having a meeting is like throwing an exception. It doesn’t merely cause you to switch from one task to another; it changes the mode in which you work. I find one meeting can sometimes affect a whole day. A meeting commonly blows at least half a day, by breaking up a morning or afternoon…</p>
<p>If you’re a maker, don’t your spirits rise at the thought of having an entire day free to work, with no appointments at all? Well, that means your spirits are correspondingly depressed when you don’t. And ambitious projects are by definition close to the limits of your capacity. A small decrease in morale is enough to kill them off.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I don’t think meetings are evil, but they are very costly, particularly to makers. Most businesses and software teams need to have occasional meetings for various things, but Scrum prescribes even more, which exacerbates this issue. Between daily standup’s, sprint planning, sprint review, sprint retro, daily check-in’s, backlog grooming, product demos, company meetings, and technical trainings, its easy to have enough meetings each week to keep your makers in a perpetual state of <a href="http://vooza.com/videos/maker-vs-manager/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">meeting hangover</a>.</p>

<h2><a id="meetings-disrupt-flow" onclick="window.history.pushState('meetings-disrupt-flow', '', '#meetings-disrupt-flow');">Meetings disrupt flow</a></h2>
<p>Okay, so lots of meetings aren’t a good fit for the maker’s schedule, but why is that? Its because meetings disrupt <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/mihaly_csikszentmihalyi_on_flow" target="_blank">Flow</a>. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, the foremost psychologist on the topic of Flow, asks the question, <i>“What contributes to a life worth living?”</i></p>
<p>He points out that more money doesn’t make us as humans happier. While the average inflation-adjusted income in the U.S. more than doubled over the last half of the twentieth century, self-reported happiness did not increase at all. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.aaron-gray.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/personal-income-and-happiness.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.aaron-gray.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/personal-income-and-happiness.jpg" alt="While the average inflation-adjusted income in the U.S. has more than doubled over the past half century, self-reported happiness has not." title="The relationship between income and happiness" width="720" height="373" srcset="https://www.aaron-gray.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/personal-income-and-happiness.jpg 720w, https://www.aaron-gray.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/personal-income-and-happiness-300x155.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px"></a><br>
<i>Income data from the U.S. Commerce Department, Bureau of the Census (1975), and Economic Indicators, Happiness data from General Social Surveys, National Opinion Research Center, University of Chicago.</i></p>
<p>The concept of Flow is that we feel happier and more fulfilled in life when we can regularly lose ourselves in an activity we have spent years mastering.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.aaron-gray.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/where-flow-occurs.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.aaron-gray.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/where-flow-occurs.jpg" alt="Flow happens at the intersection of tasks that are highly challenging which occur in areas that we are highly skilled." title="Where Flow Occurs" width="541" height="450" srcset="https://www.aaron-gray.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/where-flow-occurs.jpg 720w, https://www.aaron-gray.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/where-flow-occurs-300x250.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 541px) 100vw, 541px"></a><br>
<i>Flow can only happen when we are doing tasks that are highly challenging, in areas that we are highly skilled.</i></p>
<p>For software developers, this happens when they apply years of experience to a difficult task, and they are so absorbed in creating something that they don’t have enough attention left over to monitor their five senses, or think about the problems in their life, or realize that they’re hungry or tired. It is an ecstatic, literally out-of-body experience. This is where real work gets done and where developers feel most engaged and satisfied in their work.</p>
<p>Getting into Flow is like falling asleep. Its nearly impossible to will it into existence – it takes time, and <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/a/46283" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the smallest little thing can throw it off and restart the whole process</a>. Meetings and interruptions are the primary enemies of Flow in the workplace, so businesses that employ creative people must make a regular effort to <a href="https://www.aaron-gray.com/ways-to-protect-flow/" target="_blank">keep disruptions to Flow at a minimum</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>TL;DR: I spent years mistakenly thinking I understood what Paul Graham meant.
I'm trying something slightly different now.</p>
<p>I prefer a different wording of Paul Graham's <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/good.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">advice</a> for startups.</p>
<p><strong>Build What They Want</strong> makes the precedence obvious: before you start, you
have to find out <em>who</em> they are, and <em>what</em> they want.</p>
<p>It’s not about building what <em>you</em> want.</p>
<p>Paul Graham starts with “build something”, and that’s what hits your
subconscious first, allowing the “something” to remain ambiguous. I'd prefer to
start with “build what”, so you’re forced to evaluate the “what”. The original
wording lets you think that you can build something and convince people to want
it later (once you show them and tell them how great it is, and all the
important features it has...).</p>
<p>This changes everything.</p>
<p>My problem is that I find it too easy to imagine things that I could build, and
once I’ve imagined something, I struggle to not want to build it exactly that
like. Because I enjoy the process of building.</p>
<p><em>Building</em> is a wonderful thing to enjoy. If you want to start a businesss, just
do it differently.</p>
<p>Instead of applying imagination to products, apply imagination to companies.
What company could exist if someone (you) went and built it? What excites you? A
company is built on something that people want.</p>
<p>How do you know what people want?</p>
<p>Talk to people. Understand them. Ask questions.</p>
<p>Choose who you talk to. Talk to people who you think might want something that
you would be excited to build. Don’t imagine the product though. Imagine the
kind of change you could make in their lives.</p>
<p>They probably won’t be able to describe exactly what they want; the skill you
must develop is in spotting the unexpressed (or inexpressible) want.</p>
<p>But whatever you do, your goal must be to build something they want.</p>
<p>This is strongly related to jobs to be done. The things they want will always be
related to the things they already do. Find that link.</p>
<p>Last year I built something that I wanted to build. I only partly wanted the
final product. Mostly, I wanted the experience of building it. And actually that
turned out to be extremely valuable, though it wasn’t the right way to build a
business.</p>
<p>Then again, it’s important to geek out and build interesting things without
immediate value. Contribute something novel, and maybe one day it will be useful
to someone else (even just as prior art).</p>
<p>And if you’re going to build something for the love of building, you should
definitely do so in public. You’ll make new friends and learn much more. So
publish your code, get a website up, and tell people what you're doing.</p>
<p>You can start by <a href="mailto:ric@rmhsilva.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">telling me</a>.</p>

		<p>We bought a new house last year and as I was moving my old Apple IIe computer from my old attic over to my new attic, I thought it would be fun to hook it up and see if it still worked.&nbsp; To make a long story short … it worked!&nbsp; (Scroll down to see some pictures and even a video clip of my working Apple IIe.)</p>
<p><strong>To make a long story even longer … here are all the gory and geeky details:</strong></p>
<p>Back in 1983, when I was only 13 years old and in 8th grade in Central Illinois, my parents bought me an Apple IIe computer for Christmas.&nbsp;&nbsp; At that time I had no computer training but I think there were a couple of APPLE II computers in my school.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.leucht.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/1983-christmas-apple-iie-unwrapping-scaled.jpg"><img src="http://www.leucht.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/1983-christmas-apple-iie-unwrapping-400x303.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="303" srcset="http://www.leucht.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/1983-christmas-apple-iie-unwrapping-400x303.jpg 400w, http://www.leucht.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/1983-christmas-apple-iie-unwrapping-1024x775.jpg 1024w, http://www.leucht.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/1983-christmas-apple-iie-unwrapping-768x581.jpg 768w, http://www.leucht.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/1983-christmas-apple-iie-unwrapping-1536x1162.jpg 1536w, http://www.leucht.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/1983-christmas-apple-iie-unwrapping-2048x1550.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"></a></p>
<p>Well, now that I look at the photo of my sister and I unwrapping it, I guess it was technically a gift for the both of us.&nbsp; But I think we both knew it was really mine!&nbsp; 🙂</p>
<p>Here’s an old and humorous Apple II commercial:</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/05M80HHNB6s?rel=0" width="480" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Purchase Details:</strong></p>
<p>The cost of my Apple IIe computer in November of 1983 was $995 plus $115 for the standard green phosphor monitor for a grand total of $1,165 including 5% sales tax.&nbsp; That translates to nearly $2,700 in 2012 dollars.&nbsp; Yes, that’s a lot of money for a 13 year old kid’s Christmas present.&nbsp; The Apple IIe had only been on the market for less than a year when I got mine so it was not extremely popular yet. To hook it up to your own television, you would pay $70 for a modulator rather than $115 for the green monitor, but the resolution would not be as sharp on a television screen as it was on the computer monitor.&nbsp; We eventually did get the TV modulator, though, so I could use the computer in full color.&nbsp; Full color for an Apple IIe was only 15 colors, by the way.</p>
<p>My parents bought the computer from Wallace Micro-Mart on University Street in Peoria, Illinois.&nbsp; I believe the salesman there, who was listed as “Howell” on the hand written carbon receipt, lived in our same home town.&nbsp; At the bottom of the receipt it says that “Wallace has been serving the Peoria Community for over 10 years”.</p>
<p>I google’d Wallace Micro-Mart and all I found was this old commercial for an Apple Lisa computer:</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/3R8fArhOWso?rel=0" width="480" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Geeky Specs:</strong></p>
<p>The Apple IIe came with 64KB of memory standard, but it was expandable to 1 Megabyte and also had lots of expansion slots for various accessories.&nbsp; It ran at a screaming 1 Megahertz and had an 8 bit data bus.&nbsp; It had 2 text display modes and 4 graphics display modes.&nbsp; The text modes were 40 or 80 columns at 24 lines.&nbsp; The graphics modes were 40×48 or 80×48 block low resolution modes and 280×192 or 560×192 pixel high resolution modes.&nbsp; For comparison, the Apple IIe high res graphics modes were about the same pixel resolution as your most common cell phones used in the year 2005 … and those old cell phones definitely had way more memory than the Apple IIe.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Apple IIe contained Applesoft BASIC in ROM and booted into it if no floppy disk was found during boot.</p>
<p><strong>Unboxed Nearly 30 Years Later:</strong></p>
<p>Here is a photo of the computer in 2011 when I unboxed it during the move.&nbsp; It is basically a big case containing a keyboard, power supply, motherboard and that’s about it.&nbsp; It did not come with a mouse, nor did any of the Apple software support a mouse for the Apple II series of computers.&nbsp; I believe the Apple IIe came with one floppy drive and I think we bought the second one later.</p>
<p>The keys on the keyboard had some serious friction resistance and the keys were not very easy to push down.&nbsp; I think the key wiggle tolerances were pretty tight and the plastic-to-plastic friction caused quite a bit of resistance if you didn’t push the keys in the exact proper direction.&nbsp; Typing on this keyboard was seriously loud.&nbsp; Click, click, click!</p>
<p>There were some unique keys on these old Apple keyboards.&nbsp; Notice the outlined apple key which was called the open-apple and the solid white apple key which was called the closed-apple or solid-apple.&nbsp; The key sequence of simultaneous Control-OpenApple-Reset would reboot the machine immediately.&nbsp; Control-ClosedApple-Reset would enter BIOS setup before rebooting.&nbsp; Control-ClosedApple-OpenApple-Reset would perform a self test during reboot.&nbsp; Those are some crazy key sequences.</p>

<p>Here is the green phosphor “Monitor II”, as Apple called it.&nbsp; It had one single RCA style input connector and that’s it.&nbsp; No audio jacks, no output jacks, nothing.&nbsp; This thing was pretty old school and very basic.&nbsp; The serial number on this monitor is actually written by hand.&nbsp; The one cool feature was that the actual glass CRT was mounted on an axis that tilted up and down for a more direct viewing angle.&nbsp; The user just pushed on the darker green plastic frame around the glass CRT to tilt the glass up and down.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/index.php/appleiie/02" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img title="image 1" src="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/var/resizes/appleiie/02.JPG?m=1440971774" alt="" width="640" height="480"></a></p>
<p>Here is what the motherboard looks like inside the case.&nbsp; The lid was basically held down with a couple of hard plastic velcro type devices.&nbsp; There are 8 expansion slots and I was using four of them when I packed mine up for storage back in the late 80s.</p>
<p>The tiny card on the far left is the 80 column card and it is plugged into the auxiliary slot.&nbsp; This card just let the computer display 80 columns rather than the default 40 columns.&nbsp; This card also added more memory to the computer.</p>
<p>The long card on the left in slot 1 is the parallel interface card.&nbsp; It sure took a lot of electronics to interface to a parallel printer back then!</p>
<p>The short card in the middle in slot 4 is a Covox sound card.&nbsp; This card intercepted the sound going from the motherboard (yellow and red wires ) to the built-in speaker (black wires).&nbsp; The built-in speaker is mounted under the keyboard pointing straight down.&nbsp; This Covox sound card also had a headphone jack mounted directly on the card itself.&nbsp; I thought that was terribly inconvenient, so I de-soldered it from the card and mounted it into the plastic hole cover on the back of the computer.&nbsp; The brown wires are connecting the card to the headphone jack.&nbsp; I was pretty handy with a soldering iron, even when I was young.&nbsp; 🙂</p>
<p>The medium length card on the right in slot 6 is the floppy disk drive controller.&nbsp; Both disk drives are connected to that card using standard flat ribbon cables and nothing else.&nbsp; PC users are used to connecting power cables separately from data cables, but the power and data are both in these ribbon cables.&nbsp; Convenient … and also just a little scary.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/index.php/appleiie/3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img title="image 1" src="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/var/resizes/appleiie/3.JPG?m=1440971950" alt="" width="480" height="640"></a></p>
<p>This is a 5 and a quarter inch magnetic floppy disk that holds the operating system.&nbsp; Do you remember these floppy disks?&nbsp; Some floppy disks were double sided, so you could flip them over and use the other side and get twice the data onto them.&nbsp; You had to punch out a notch in a specific place on the disk in order to make it read-only.&nbsp; Then you had to put a sticker over that hole in order to write to it again.&nbsp; Computer stores sold special notch cutters, but most of us users just used a standard hole punch numerous times until we got the notch created in the right place in order to open up the microswitch in the disk drive.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/index.php/appleiie/4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img title="image 1" src="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/var/resizes/appleiie/4.JPG?m=1440971830" alt="" width="480" height="640"></a></p>
<p>30 years ago, I loved that Apple gave stickers away with their hardware and they still do it today and I still love it!&nbsp; This was a folder containing the receipt and some manuals and it also contained some really cool full color apple logo decals.&nbsp; I never used the decals.&nbsp; I just checked EBay and people are selling these vintage rainbow Apple stickers for 20 bucks each!&nbsp; Wow.&nbsp; I guess they are a true collectors item now that they are 30 years old.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/index.php/appleiie/5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img title="image 1" src="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/var/resizes/appleiie/5.JPG?m=1440971903" alt="" width="480" height="640"></a></p>
<p>The owners manual was spiral bound.&nbsp; It took you though the internals for a computer and then walked you through the DOS command line commands and also introduced you to Applesoft BASIC programming.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/index.php/appleiie/6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img title="image 1" src="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/var/resizes/appleiie/6.JPG?m=1440971927" alt="" width="480" height="640"></a></p>
<p>Ah, the good old dot matrix printer.&nbsp; Man, these things were loud.&nbsp; And how annoying was it to keep these things feeding the paper properly?&nbsp; These things were part typewriter and part printer.&nbsp; When somebody invented laserjets, we never looked back, did we?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/index.php/appleiie/10" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img title="image 1" src="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/var/resizes/appleiie/10.JPG?m=1440971781" alt="" width="640" height="480"></a></p>
<p>I actually still had an un-opened ribbon for the dot matrix printer.&nbsp; It probably dried out a year after I packed this thing up and went to college, though.&nbsp; I don’t remember how much these ribbons cost, but I do remember trying to squeeze every last drop of ink out of them.&nbsp; We used to reuse them multiple times and some people went as far as trying to re-ink them.&nbsp; I guess we still do the same thing today with our inkjet cartridges and our toner cartridges, though.&nbsp; The more things change, the more they stay the same!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/index.php/appleiie/11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img title="image 1" src="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/var/resizes/appleiie/11.JPG?m=1440971788" alt="" width="480" height="640"></a></p>
<p>Here is a photo of the command line after one of my personal boot disks had been booted up.&nbsp; This was just a disk that had some small Applesoft BASIC programs on it.&nbsp; This particular program printed some text to the screen and exited.&nbsp; Very much beginner stuff.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/index.php/appleiie/20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img title="image 1" src="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/var/resizes/appleiie/20.JPG?m=1440971794" alt="" width="640" height="480"></a></p>
<p>If you typed CATALOG from the command line, the computer would show you the list of files on the floppy disk.&nbsp; File type (A=Applesoft BASIC, B=Binary, I=Integer Basic, T=Text) and file size (disk sectors) and file name were shown.&nbsp; Notice that file names can have spaces.&nbsp; UNIX did not allow this initially and neither did the early DOS for PCs, but Apple did.&nbsp; Now pretty much every OS does allow it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/index.php/appleiie/21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img title="image 1" src="http://www.leucht.com/photos-new/var/resizes/appleiie/21.JPG?m=1440971803" alt="" width="640" height="480"></a></p>
<p>This image shows a listing of a small Applesoft BASIC program.&nbsp; It was written on the command line, line for line, then it was tested and if it worked, it was written to the disk as a file.&nbsp; In Applesoft BASIC you did not start with an empty file on disk and write characters to that file.&nbsp; You created your program directly in the computer’s memory and copied it to disk later.&nbsp; There was no plain text editor app that I’m aware of.&nbsp; No computer manufacturer does that anymore, for good reasons.</p>
<p>In this particular program, it draws some boxes on the screen with the HPLOT commands.&nbsp; Then it creates an artificial delay using the old school empty for/next loop.&nbsp; Then it repeats the box drawing sequence three times with a for/next loop, part of which has scrolled off the screen.&nbsp; After three cycles of the box drawing sequence, it runs a subroutine, which is not necessary in this case since it is only called once.&nbsp; But …</p></div></div>

<p>The credit for the title goes to Jeff Moser and his excellent <a href="http://www.moserware.com/2008/02/does-your-code-pass-turkey-test.html">post</a> which he authored in 2008. He basically discussed the dangers of improper localization and took a clever approach, stating «“The Turkey Test.” It’s very simple: will your code work properly on a person’s machine in or around the country of Turkey?”». The Turkish alphabet is based on Latin letters but there are few interesting properties of the Turkish alphabet such that
Jeff proposes if your code works fine in Turkish culture, then chances are good it is resilient to possible localization problems in other cultures using the Latin alphabet. Perhaps this is a bit overstatement as there are too many different languages and alphabets. However, unless we have a specific focus in a particular language or have dedicated people working on each language, in practice it’s next to impossible to have bug-free localization in our applications. In that aspect, I believe the Turkey test is a low effort way to do basic
smoke test on localization for your development process.</p>

<p>In his post, Jeff discusses the localization problems mostly from a .NET point of view. In this post, however, I will try to follow Jeff’s footprints but from a JavaScript point of view.</p>

<h2 id="dotted-and-dotless-i">Dotted and dotless I</h2>

<p>Well, the obvious question is why “Turkey”? One of the main reasons to use the Turkish alphabet for testing is that that the Turkish alphabet has two “I” letters. One with a dot and one without.
Namely the upper case  “I” and “İ and lower case “ı” and “i”. And yet there is even a dedicated Wikipedia [article] about it (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dotted_and_dotless_I).</p>

<p><img src="https://onurgumus.github.io/assets/posts/2021-01-23-Does-your-code-pass-the-Turkey-test/i-i.png" alt="i-i"></p>

<p>The challenge with these “I”s usually occurs when you try to do a case insensitive equality comparison. As a Turkish, I have been burned very badly because of “I” issues.</p>

<h2 id="problems-with-oracle-fixed-a-long-time-ago">Problems with Oracle (fixed a long time ago)</h2>

<p>One particular case I remember is I was developing an application for a bank. We had done extensive testing of the application in the local development environment.
But once we deployed the application to the bank’s prod machines, it immediately crashed.</p>

<p>After 13 hours of investigation (at that time my debugging skills wasn’t so sharp so I mostly relied on the logs), I realized my query was in the form of
“select description from …” and Oracle database will always capitalize the column names in its results returning a column with “DESCRIPTION”. 
The developers of ODP.NET were aware of this inconsistency so as a workaround they were calling ToUpper to match the column names from your query. However,
if your code runs within Turkish culture then <strong>ToUpper</strong> call will transform the column name to “DESCRİPTİON” and boom! your code would bail out with a cryptic exception.
Luckily only 3 years later Oracle has fixed the issue by using <strong>ToUpperInvariant</strong> instead of <strong>ToUpper</strong></p>

<h2 id="javascript-world">JavaScript world</h2>

<p>Having reiterated the problem on .NET, let’s explore the situation with the browsers. The browsers take the current culture from the operating system on macOS
and Linux. And on windows depending on the browser they may obey “preferred language” settings.  The following one-liner should help you to get the current culture of the browser:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>getLanguage</span> <span>=</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>navigator</span><span>.</span><span>userLanguage</span> 
  <span>||</span> <span>(</span><span>navigator</span><span>.</span><span>languages</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>navigator</span><span>.</span><span>languages</span><span>.</span><span>length</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>navigator</span><span>.</span><span>languages</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>])</span> 
  <span>||</span> <span>navigator</span><span>.</span><span>language</span> <span>||</span> <span>navigator</span><span>.</span><span>browserLanguage</span> <span>||</span> <span>navigator</span><span>.</span><span>systemLanguage</span> <span>||</span> <span>'</span><span>en</span><span>'</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Perhaps one of the easiest ways to make case-insensitive but 
safe comparisons are to use ToLocalUpperCase and ToLocalLowerCase:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>city</span> <span>=</span> <span>'</span><span>istanbul</span><span>'</span><span>;</span>

<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>city</span><span>.</span><span>toLocaleUpperCase</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>en-US</span><span>'</span><span>));</span>
<span>// expected output: "ISTANBUL"</span>

<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>city</span><span>.</span><span>toLocaleUpperCase</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>TR</span><span>'</span><span>));</span>
<span>// expected output: "İSTANBUL"</span>

<span>const</span> <span>cityU</span> <span>=</span> <span>'</span><span>İSTANBUL</span><span>'</span><span>;</span>

<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>cityU</span><span>.</span><span>toLocaleLowerCase</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>en-US</span><span>'</span><span>));</span>
<span>// expected output: "i̇stanbul"</span>

<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>cityU</span><span>.</span><span>toLocaleLowerCase</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>TR</span><span>'</span><span>));</span>
<span>// expected output: "istanbul"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Notice the interesting dot on top of the i for lower-case en-us transformation. I have no idea what it is.</p>

<h2 id="javascript-internationalization-objects">JavaScript Internationalization objects</h2>

<p>JavaScript also offers several built-in objects for internationalization.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Intl</li>
  <li>Intl.Collator</li>
  <li>Intl.DateTimeFormat</li>
  <li>Intl.ListFormat</li>
  <li>Intl.NumberFormat</li>
  <li>Intl.PluralRules</li>
  <li>Intl.RelativeTimeFormat</li>
  <li>Intl.Locale</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl">mdn</a></p>

<p>Although I appreciate the effort, I personally find these APIs relatively limited. The internationalization API extends towards interesting problems like pluralization,
however, if you review the API, it’s mostly geared towards formatting and displaying but relatively weak when it comes to parsing. First, let’s visit our original
problem. Is there another API we could compare “İSTANBUL” with “istanbul” case-insensitively and find them equal?</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>'</span><span>İSTANBUL</span><span>'</span><span>;</span> 
<span>const</span> <span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>'</span><span>istanbul</span><span>'</span><span>;</span> 

<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>.</span><span>localeCompare</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>'</span><span>en</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span> <span>sensitivity</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>base</span><span>'</span> <span>}));</span>
<span>// expected output: 0</span>

<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>.</span><span>localeCompare</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>'</span><span>tr</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span> <span>sensitivity</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>accent</span><span>'</span> <span>}));</span>
<span>// expected output: 0</span>

<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>.</span><span>localeCompare</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>'</span><span>en</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span> <span>sensitivity</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>accent</span><span>'</span> <span>}));</span>
<span>// expected output: 1</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It seems to work expectedly.  What about the dotless I case?
Let’s compare ‘IĞDIR’ and ‘ığdır’ which are considered equal in Turkish case-insensitively.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>'</span><span>IĞDIR</span><span>'</span><span>;</span> 
<span>const</span> <span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>'</span><span>ığdır</span><span>'</span><span>;</span> 

<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>.</span><span>localeCompare</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>'</span><span>en</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span> <span>sensitivity</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>base</span><span>'</span> <span>}));</span>
<span>// expected output: -1</span>
<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>.</span><span>localeCompare</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>'</span><span>tr</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span> <span>sensitivity</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>base</span><span>'</span> <span>}));</span>
<span>// expected output: 0</span>

<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>.</span><span>localeCompare</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>'</span><span>tr</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span> <span>sensitivity</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>accent</span><span>'</span> <span>}));</span>

<span>// expected output: -1</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Notice here you must set the culture to ‘tr’ otherwise it won’t work.</p>

<h2 id="date-and-time">Date and Time</h2>
<p>Most languages have different formats for dates so if we have <strong>05/01/2021</strong> does it mean January 5 or May 5?. Some people would argue we should use 
<strong>2021-05-01</strong> but then your users will complain. How about 01 MAY 2021, this is good but then you have to localize MAY. So pick your poison. To make things more complicated, languages like Turkish use “.” instead of “/” as a date separator.</p>

<p>Furthermore, there is no built-in way to parse such strings to convert JavaScript date objects. You have to rely on external libs like moment.js and
there goes another 75 kb to your bundle.</p>

<p>Finally, I should add that, <strong>1 PM</strong> is shown as <strong>13.00</strong> in Turkish culture. That’s one more thing you should consider.</p>

<h2 id="numbers">Numbers</h2>

<p>Well, it’s a well-known fact that different languages use different symbols for thousands and decimals separators. But being uncareful with number localization has dire consequences. In Turkish thousands is split by dot “.” and for the decimal separator “,” is used. For example
<em>1.234,56</em> is one thousand two hundred thirty-four point fifty-six. In .NET if you try parsing in Turkish culture</p>



<p>What do you think the output will be? Well, it is <strong>1234</strong> as the .NET parser completely ignores the thousands separator even if that wasn’t your intention.
What about the situation in JavaScript? You are completely on your own. parseFloat is just using en-US culture and that’s fixed.</p>

<p>That’s not all. How many digits are there? 10 you say? <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20040309-00/?p=40333">Raymond Chen disagrees</a> 
Well at least from a .NET standpoint Arabic digits are also considered as digits. In JavaScript, you are on your own again.</p>

<h2 id="currency">Currency</h2>
<p>Well, the simple fact is in Turkish and many other languages the currency symbol is written after the numeric value not before as in <strong>100$</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="percentage-symbol">Percentage symbol</h2>

<p>In Turkish, the percentage symbol comes before e.g <strong>%50</strong></p>

<h2 id="other-alphabets">Other alphabets</h2>

<p>Let’s see some peculiarities with other Alphabets. One might think “Z” is probably the last letter in Latin alphabets. Enter the nordic languages</p>

<p>Danish and Norwegian Alphabets:
A	B	C	D	E	F	G	H	I	J	K	L	M	N	O	P	Q	R	S	T	U	V	W	X	Y	Z	Æ	Ø	Å</p>

<p>As you can see there are three letters coming after Z.</p>

<p>In the Icelandic alphabet, Z is obsoleted!!!</p>

<p>Ok, but at least we cans say Z is the last letter if we consider plain English letters. Unfortunately no. Here’s the Estonian alphabet:</p>

<p>A, B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, R, S, Š, Z, Ž, T, U, V, Õ, Ä, Ö, Ü.</p>

<p>Some alphabets like Dutch has digraphs like “IJ” which is sometimes considered a single letter. Some fun facts taken from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IJ_(digraph)">wikipedia article</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>In Dutch primary schools, ij used to be taught as being the 25th letter of the alphabet, and some primary school writing materials list ‘ij’ as the 25th letter of the alphabet.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When a word starting with IJ is capitalised, the entire digraph is capitalised: IJsselmeer, IJmuiden.[5]</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On mechanical Dutch typewriters, there is a key that produces ‘ij’ (in a single letterspace, located directly to the right of the L). However, this is not the case on modern computer keyboards.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In word puzzles, ij often fills one square.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>And here’s the Nigerian alphabet:</p>

<p>Upper case	A	B	Ɓ	C	D	Ɗ	E	Ǝ	Ẹ	F	G</p>

<p>Lower case	a	b	ɓ	c	d	ɗ	e	ǝ	ẹ	f	g</p>

<p>Upper case	H	I	Ị	J	K	Ƙ	L	M	N	O	Ọ</p>

<p>Lower case	h	i	ị	j	k	ƙ	l	m	n	o	ọ</p>

<p>Upper case	P	R	S	Ṣ	T	U	Ụ	V	W	Y	Z</p>

<p>Not only Nigerian alphabet has 3 E letters but they have an I with dot like Turkish but the dot is at the bottom.</p>

<p>If you wonder things can go more interesting than this, ladies and gentleman, I present you Hungarian keyboard:</p>

<p>My non-elven eyes see there are 4 U’s and 4 O’s with different accents in the Hungarian keyboard most of them being at right hand side :)</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Despite its widespread use, I have a feeling that JavaScript is not on par with backend languages like .NET when it comes to localization capabilities. 
What is the solution? You probably have to rely on third-party libraries. An alternative route might be to use Blazor which brings .NET Runtime into the browser.
That way you can get the benefit of all the Globalization goodies of .NET but your app can still reside in the browser. Feel free to share your thoughts in the comments section.</p>

How to make it more sustainable?</p><div><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/iter_fusion_reactor_plasma.jpg" alt="Figure 1: Inside the Korean tokamak KSTAR (NFRI)"><figcaption><p>Figure 1: Inside the Korean tokamak <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KSTAR">KSTAR</a> (NFRI)</p></figcaption></figure><p>With corporations like Microsoft, Oracle, and Google truly reinventing
themselves to adapt to an open source world, and typical open source
projects moving towards—oftentimes centralized—governance models, the
<a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/homesteading/cathedral-bazaar/">Cathedral–Bazaar</a> dichotomy feels increasingly less relevant.</p><p>It was met with
<a href="https://firstmonday.org/article/view/708/618">criticism</a>
even back in the 90s.</p><p>While being an entertaining piece of history with useful takeaways, its
most important achievement was arguably helping create a sense of identity
for hacker culture via the revolutionary Open Source movement, and
promoting the value of the Internet for software development.</p><p>In the Cathedral-Bazaar continuum, contemporary projects like Kubernetes,
Chromium, and VSCode are <i>fusion reactors</i>.</p><p>They have the backing of heavily invested companies with virtually infinite
capital, who are able to staff highly competent teams that not only work
full-time on these projects, but also have enough personpower to maximally
leverage the benefits brought by a gigantic user base.</p><p>Like with fusion power, they seem to be able to leverage a high amount of
energy to generate even more.</p><p>Sometimes, their user base includes <i>other</i> organizations with
endless resources: by means of its success, VSCode is getting
<a href="https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2019/11/21/fb-vs-code.aspx">sizable contributions</a> from Facebook, for example.</p><p>In contrast, the vast majority of open source projects depend almost
exclusively on decentralized volunteer efforts from people sacrificing time
out of their busy schedules and lives to move things forward.</p><p>And yet, projects following this style of development can end up becoming
backbones of modern computing:</p><blockquote><p>The OpenSSL project has been around since 1998. Since the project is open
source, it is an informal group comprised primarily of about a dozen
members throughout the world, most of whom have day jobs, and some of whom
work on a volunteer basis. Being open source, the OpenSSL project’s code
has always been public facing. Any person could download it and modify it
or implement it in their own software.</p><p>[…]</p><p>The fascinating, mind-boggling fact here is that you have this critical
piece of network infrastructure that really runs a large part of the
internet, and there’s basically one guy working on it full time.</p><p>— <a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/otm/articles/ssl-heartbleed">Steve Marquess in “It’s Not A Fun Week To Work at OpenSSL, The Mostly
Volunteer Project Responsible for the Heartbleed Bug”, (2014)</a></p></blockquote><p>Heartbleed is a symptom of an ever-existing problem: corporations profit
massively by leveraging typically under-resourced open source projects
while not giving back proportionally, or (most commonly) at all; either
with money or people.</p><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/xkcd_load_bearing_open_source.png" alt="Figure 2: &amp;ldquo;Load-Bearing Internet People&amp;rdquo;"><figcaption><p>Figure 2: <a href="https://xkcd.com/2347/">“Load-Bearing Internet People”</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>After Heartbleed the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_Infrastructure_Initiative">Core Infrastructure Initiative</a>
was created to support software essential to the "functioning of the
Internet and other major information systems".</p><p>Less critical software like Emacs also follows this decentralized
development style, and similarly, lacks resources.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>So if Emacs wants to compete with these tools then it has to have
seamless, context aware code completion and refactoring support, and GNU
tools has to provide Emacs the necessary information to implement these
features.</p></blockquote><p>I agree. But to have that, the only way is to have motivated volunteers
step forward and work on these features. Otherwise we will never have them.</p><p>Right now, no one is working on that, though everyone is talking. [T]he
same as with weather.</p><p>— <a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2015-10/msg00646.html">Eli Zaretskii in “Re: IDE” (2014)</a></p></blockquote><p>One way to incentivize contributions is by funding developers. Some (most?)
open source contributors would gladly take income to fund their work.</p><blockquote><p>Long-term my big dream has always been to accumulate enough backing to be
able to work full-time on open-source projects, but whether I’ll achieve
this dream or not is entirely up to you.</p><p>— <a href="https://emacsredux.com/blog/2020/09/13/patronage-revisited/">Bozhidar Batsov in “Patronage Revisited” (2020)</a></p></blockquote><p>While others feel that accepting funding would degrade their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive:%5FThe%5FSurprising%5FTruth%5FAbout%5FWhat%5FMotivates%5FUs">intrinsic
motivation</a> to contribute.</p><blockquote><p>I can’t speak for all FLOSS developers, but I can speak for myself: I don’t
want monetary rewarding from users. Mainly for the reason, that I don’t
want to change the relationship with my users. Currently it is mostly a
team attitude, we’re working together to solve the problem. And there is
also no legal obligation for me to work on something I don’t like.</p><p>If I accepted contributions I think many users would get a “but I paid for
that, so do what I want” attitude. I definitely don’t want that. I do FLOSS
in my free time to do something that matters, and for my personal
fulfillment, not for money.</p><p>It will also get harder to do the right thing (in contrary to doing what
the users want) since the users can stop the payments.</p><p>So, no payments for me, thanks.</p><p>— <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/6pjbn0/sustainable%5Femacs%5Fdevelopment%5Fsome%5Fthoughts%5Fand/">cjk101010 in “Sustainable Emacs development - some thoughts and
analysis” (2017)</a></p></blockquote><p>Which is fair: with compensation comes responsibility, timelines,
expectations, and things can get complicated. From the point of view of the
project, there doesn’t seem to be a conflict: capture funding to enable those
who need (or want) it, while still empowering those who don’t, to contribute
on their own terms.</p><p>Not everyone is in a position to spend unpaid time on open source,
especially consistently. “Free” time <a href="https://www.rightattitudes.com/2017/08/08/opportunity-cost/">isn’t free</a>—<em>it costs life</em>. By
funding work, a project might get to see contributions from talented folks
passionate about it who wouldn’t be able to volunteer their time.</p><p>And sometimes, the reason why your PR isn't getting immediate attention
is that the maintainer is busy literally
<a href="https://github.com/fre5h/DoctrineEnumBundle/pull/12#issuecomment-33023169">fighting</a>
a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolution_of_Dignity">revolution</a>.</p><p>For Emacs specifically, one problem is that there’s no clear way of funding
“Emacs”. Sending money to the FSF doesn’t guarantee that it will fund Emacs
development. <em>Even if there was</em> a way of “funding Emacs”, the Emacs
community—like many things in life—seems to be roughly divided in two
sides: those who prioritize <em><a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html">freedom</a></em>, and those who prioritize <em>progress</em>. So
one would potentially want to fund one side or the other, depending on their
values.</p><p>In the excellent “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0578675862/">Working in Public</a>: The Making and Maintenance of Open
Source Software”, Nadia Eghbal calls attention to a shift in how
individuals support open source. Similarly to platforms like Twitch, more
and more people are funding creators directly instead of projects, as a way
of “incentivizing the ongoing creation of creative work” from developers
who produce things that are in their interests.</p><p>Maintainers of popular Emacs packages, for example, have their own <a href="https://github.com/tarsius/elisp-maintainers">separate
streams of patronage</a>, which receive varying levels of support depending on
their popularity and the value added by what they create.</p><p>For efforts that involve multiple people, like maintaining and evolving
Emacs itself, services like <a href="https://opencollective.com/">Open Collective</a> could be of great assistance by
helping on three fronts:</p><ol><li>providing a legal banking entity</li><li>recurrently collecting funds from individuals and companies</li><li>distributing funds to contributors</li></ol><p>Funds can be transparently collected, and dispersed for specific contract
work, infrastructure costs, and even developer salaries. Take for example
the <a href="https://opencollective.com/babel">Babel</a> project, which draws in enough recurrent income to finance
multiple contractors and a full-time developer earning a San Francisco
salary. An Emacs Open Collective could not only be an answer to “how can I
fund Emacs development?” but also a way to financially support developers
working on it.</p><p>The Clojure community seems to be doing an excellent job at not only
<a href="https://www.clojuriststogether.org/news/q4-2020-funding-announcement/">funding</a>
efforts that are making the whole Clojure ecosystem
better but also at surveying and
<a href="https://www.clojuriststogether.org/news/q3-2020-survey-results/">responding</a>
accordingly to user
feedback.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/sponsors">GitHub Sponsors</a> is another great example of developer empowerment. With it,
not only does GitHub equip people to:</p><ul><li>be more productive by providing great code hosting, bug tracking, wiki,
code reviewing and merging, project management, continuous integration,
documentation, artifact hosting, etc.</li><li>have a broader impact by giving projects more visibility and standardized
workflows that are familiar to others already on the platform</li></ul><p>It also makes it possible for its <a href="https://octoverse.github.com/">40 million users</a> to frictionlessly fund
work on open source, and for a large number of maintainers to be
conveniently compensated for their labor. I just started sponsoring someone
with literally two clicks!</p><p>The power of platforms can’t be understated.</p><p>Whether you like GitHub or not, it’s undeniable that it has, and continues
to revolutionize Open Source, simply by providing a significantly better
and unified experience for all aspects of building software.</p><div><p>When there are people making over
<a href="https://changelog.com/posts/i-just-hit-100000-per-year-on-github-sponsors">100k/year</a>
on GitHub Sponsors, you better have a great reason to <b>not</b> try to
<a href="https://github.com/sponsors/neovim">take advantage</a>
of it.</p><p>In the case of Emacs, the reason is <i>freedom</i>.</p></div><p>I wouldn’t mind if Emacs development moved to GitHub, but <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/repo-criteria-evaluation.en.html">I don’t think
it’s ever going to happen</a>. Maybe for good reason: GitHub is backed by a
for-profit corporation and is far from perfect, both in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/9/20906213/github-ice-microsoft-software-email-contract-immigration-nonprofit-donation">moral</a> and <a href="https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc">technical</a>
terms. It might be a great tool today, but being a proprietary platform,
its users are at their complete mercy.</p><p>I should point out that from my perspective GitHub has been for the
most part a force for
<a href="https://github.blog/2020-11-16-standing-up-for-developers-youtube-dl-is-back/">good</a>.</p><p>It would be great if main development at least moved from a
mailing-list-driven process to a modern <em>forge</em> style of contribution. It
<a href="https://emba.gnu.org/emacs/emacs">seems that it <em>might</em></a>, but whether or not it will is still <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/28152">unclear</a>.</p><p>In the same way that corporations extract value out of open source, open
source projects should as much as possible leverage “energy” generated by
corporations. In this new open source world, companies have their workforce
contributing millions of person-hours to projects that benefit everyone.
LLVM equips people to build programming languages. LSP gives people potent
software development capabilities. Rails empowers people to build powerful
web applications.</p><blockquote><p>More than 3,000 people have committed man-decades, maybe even
man-centuries, of work for free. Buying all that effort at market rates
would have been hundreds of millions of dollars. Who would have been able
to afford funding that?</p><p>That’s a …</p></blockquote></div></div>

                    Preface to the Wolfpack Edition

This is Geoff Cashman's venerable User's Guide to Empire.  It was written
in 1991, and Empire has evolved quite a bit since then.  Nevertheless, many
players have found it useful through the years, so here it is.  We
reproduce it verbatim except for this preface and corrections of a few
editing mistakes.

				Preface

This guide's intended audience is the beginning player and those players
who have played a game or three and would like to have some insight on some
more subtle aspects of the game.  Some experienced players may find some 
benefit from reading this guide as well.  While you may feel you are an
expert, it is always possible to learn.  Nothing in this guide is intended 
to be difficult to understand, and every effort has been made to make this
guide an easy learning tool.

User's Guide to Empire							 3

				Foreword

It has been over a year now since I first sat down and thought in a serious
way about writing this guide.  It has been a long trip with many interesting
turns and developments.  When I first started, the version of Empire that
this guide has ultimately been written for had not yet been released.  Now,
with this project nearing release I find that yet another new version of
Empire is coming out.  I look on in near despair as I realize that this guide
may very well soon be outdated.  Nevertheless, I feel compelled to release
this information in what might be considered a final form.  

However, I hope that this is not the final form.  With new versions of
Empire coming out in the very near future I hope that some other potential
author steps forward and takes up the banner of educating the new player. 
I caution you though that such a work as this takes quite an effort. 

To the reader and any critics or even cynics that might be reading, I say
that I am not writer.  I never was, and I never intend to be.  There are
certainly enough writers in the world to write almost everything the world
could want to know about in print.  I was never skilled in the art of proper
style for any sort of writing.  Please, be kind and keep this in mind.

I wrote this guide because I felt there was a great need for something of
this nature.  I have watched so many players come to the network looking
for information on Empire, such as the rules, or information on how to play.
One can get information about the various commands available to oneself
within the game, but to understand how to use those commands effectively
and get skilled at running a country is a far greater task.  Many new
players have despaired after playing their first game for lack of the
requisite knowledge to play effectively.  Some come back fighting hard
in the next game, but many just disappear never to be heard from again.
This guide was written with the hope that if the new player is supplied
with the basics, they can advance in skill more quickly than previously
possible and not despair at their first defeat. 

I am hoping that within the near future two other companion guides to 
this one will be written and released to the net.  These two guides will
be intended to make the average player a better player or even expert,
and to teach fledgling deities how to compile and establish a, solicit 
entries for , and effectively run, a game.  Some people have commented
to me that the time spent on these guides would be better spent if I 
were to spend time programming for Empire instead.  It is my belief that
in teaching players to be better players, and teaching deities how to be 
a deity should that guide be released, the potential pool for
programmers of Empire will increase.  

I can not take credit for the idea of this guide.  The need for such
a guide I think was painfully obvious to a great many players.  Some in
fact did engage in projects to fill that need.  Every such attempt has
fallen short, in my humble opinion.  Witness the large number of people


User's Guide to Empire							 4

who still ask the network, "How do I play?" and even more importantly
the lack of sufficient answer to such people's questions.  In my highest
hopes, I dream that someday soon that answer will be "Get a copy of the
User's Guide to Empire, which is available via FTP from xx.xx.xx".

This work was made possible by the contributions of several Empire players.
This work would not have been completed without the insights and assistance 
of many Empire players and deities.  To the Empire community as a whole,
I say thank you for your priceless contributions.

User's Guide to Empire							 6

Chapter 1 :-: What is Empire?

	Empire is a game in which you are pitted against several other
	players in a country vs. country format.  There are economies to
	run, armies to support, policies to generate, and allies and
	enemies to make.  The game supports various features that make
	certain aspects of the game seem to parallel the "realistic"
	world.  These include satellites, planes, banks, parks, etc.
	
	Empire, in the version herein described, is a very complex 
	game.  The closest game that most people will know that is 
	analogous to it is the game known as Risk.  However, Empire is 
	more complex by a factor of at least one hundred.  Nevertheless, 
	as a result of the computer aiding you every step of the way, the 
	game is not difficult to play, though it can be difficult to 
	learn.  If you read this guide thoroughly, and use it as a 
	continuing resource, you can help make learning this game a lot 
	easier. 

	It should be noted that in learning to play this game, you
	may become frustrated or feel daunted by its complexity. 
	Several players have noted that they almost gave up on Empire,
	until one day when everything seemed to start to make sense.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><div><div><p><em>This is a guest post authored by <a href="https://jacobian.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jacob Kaplan-Moss</a>, co-creator of Django.</em></p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>I’ve spent a good deal of my career with my feet in two different worlds. I came up as a web developer and helped create a popular web framework (Django). And I’ve spent a sizable chunk of my career working in information security.
Unfortunately, I’ve seen these two roles clash far too often. Engineering often sees Security as standing in the way of delivery, or as creating meaningless busywork. Security thinks Engineering is irresponsible, willing to ship broken or vulnerable code.</p>
<p>I’ve spent more than a decade trying to bridge this gap. There’s no silver bullet. But, over and over, I’ve seen one practice be quite effective: automated security tests — and particularly integrating security checks and tests into an existing CI pipeline.</p>
<h3>Bringing Security along on the CI/CD journey</h3>
<p>Engineers have largely embraced CI as a critical part of quality assurance, and that a robust test suite that runs on every commit is a huge enabler of velocity. We can be bold about making changes, knowing that the test suite will catch us if we’ve messed up. A mature CI/CD pipeline is a reliable litmus test for good software.</p>
<p>Historically, though, Security has been left out of this CI/CD journey. We’ve relied on manual security assessments; hands-on exercises like threat modelling and threat hunting; and bespoke penetration tests. These are important activities that will always have a place in a mature product security lifecycle, but they increasingly are difficult to integrate into an agile delivery model that relies on incremental changes and automated tests. Much of the friction between modern engineering and security teams can come down to this impedance mismatch.</p>
<p>So, to get Security and Engineering playing well together, one massively useful tool is getting security work integrated into continuous delivery. When done right, Security and Engineering work together to produce automated checks that cover security issues in the same test suite that’s already in CI. This maintains delivery cadence, gives confidence about the security of the product, and — most importantly — gives a place where Security and Engineering collaborate, rather than conflict, to produce secure code.</p>
<p>How does this look in practice? Each organization is different, but there’s a typical progression of maturity that Security and Engineering orgs go through as they build a continuous integration and automation pipeline:</p>
<ul>
<li>Level 1: Security finds problems; Engineering fixes them</li>
<li>Level 2: Security and Engineering collaborate to produce test cases and remediations</li>
<li>Level 3: After the issue is fixed, Security and Engineering collaborate to find systemic fixes and develop checks</li>
<li>Level 4: Security and Engineering now also proactively look for new classes of issues and create systemic checks before an actual problem occurs</li>
</ul>
<p>For the rest of this post, I’ll walk through each of these phases with a specific example about a team that systemically fixed an issue with logging sensitive tokens.</p>
<h3>Level 1: Security finds problems; Engineering fixes them</h3>
<p>This is (unfortunately) how many organizations operate. Nobody really works together: Security is off in one corner looking for vulnerabilities (or, worse, waiting for a breach and then responding!). When they find one, they tell Engineering, who (hopefully) fixes the problem.</p>
<p>Let’s begin the example and see how this could shake out in practice. A few months ago, Nathan Brahams <a href="https://r2c.dev/blog/2020/fixing-leaky-logs-how-to-find-a-bug-and-ensure-it-never-returns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote about systemically fixing an issue around accidentally logging sensitive tokens</a>. His article illustrates the steps a quite mature security/engineering organization would take, but I’ll use this issue as a jumping-off-point to imagine how teams earlier in their journey might approach discovering a similar issue.</p>
<p>So, imagine a budding team has found this security issue: SQLAlchemy debug logging is turned on and sensitive tokens are being logged. The issue is fixed with a clever technique that uses a custom <code>ObfuscatedString</code> column that prevents SQLAlchemy from logging the token's value. So, we just swap in <code>ObfuscatedString</code> for the token column. Problem solved, right?</p>
<p>Well, while this does fix the issue, it has many problems:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Verification</strong>: If Engineering just rolls out this fix, how do we verify that the issue is actually fixed? Usually at this level of maturity, the Security team will manually verify the fix, but that’s error-prone. It’s also slow; if the fix didn’t work or is incomplete, the cycle has to repeat itself.</li>
<li><strong>Regression</strong>: If another engineer, some time later, doesn’t understand this <code>ObfuscatedString</code>, it could get reverted or modified in a way that re-introduces the issue. How would we know if this happens? (Spoiler alert: with an automated test, which we’ll discuss in the next section.)</li>
<li>Is this a one-off issue, or <strong>is it a systemic issue</strong>? Are there other sensitive values elsewhere that might be logged?</li>
<li><strong>Conflict</strong>: Most importantly, this workflow sets up conditions ripe for conflict between Security and Engineering. It creates a dynamic where it’s easy for Engineering to feel like Security’s just creating work for them, and where Security can feel ignored or powerless to fix problems. I’ve never seen this model produce a really healthy relationship; just ones with varying levels of dysfunction. Even when Security helps write the fix, the lack of any sort of robust verification or systemic analysis means it’s very likely they’ll need to come back later with this issue or a similar one again, which both parties will resent.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Level 2: automated tests</h3>
<p>The next rung on the maturity ladder is one that’s becoming increasingly common: instead of just fixing a security issue, Security and Engineering will collaborate on producing a test case (and often the fix). Following along with the example above, we might write a test case that sets up a test model with an <code>ObfuscatedString</code> column, captures some logs, and verifies that the value is correctly obfuscated.</p>
<p>This relatively simple addition fixes a bunch of problems we had before:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Verification</strong>: If the test case passes, we can be confident the security issue is fixed.</li>
<li><strong>Regression</strong>: Because this test case is part of our test suite, if it ever regresses the test case will fail, and we won’t risk re-introducing it to production.</li>
<li><strong>Collaboration</strong>: Security and Engineering are now working more closely together, increasing the chances both teams will see this as “our issue” and “our fix”, not “their problem”.</li>
</ul>
<p>But: we still lack any sort of understanding of whether this issue occurs elsewhere, or any sort of holistic fix for the entire class of issues. In the case of logging sensitive tokens, it’s easy to imagine this issue occurring elsewhere. So when — inevitably — a similar issue occurs elsewhere, we’re likely to be bitten again. And this, in turn, will continue to produce the kind of resentment that can be so damaging to Security/Engineering working well together.</p>
<h3>Level 3: systemic fixes and checks</h3>
<p>The next step, then, is for Security and Engineering to work together to find systemic problems and fixes. Things start out as above — it’s important to fix the specific vulnerability first, before getting fancy! But after the specific fix is in, Security and Engineering come together to figure out if this is a systemic problem. If so, they work to develop a check or a fix.</p>
<p>Sometimes this can be a fairly simple holistic fix. For example, <a href="https://r2c.dev/blog/2020/understanding-and-preventing-dos-in-web-apps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I wrote about ReDoS last time</a>. Discovery of a ReDoS vulnerability might lead to discovering other similar potential problems. That in turn could lead to the decision to switch to <a href="https://github.com/google/re2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">re2</a>, which isn’t vulnerable to ReDoS.</p>
<p>But much of the time, the systemic fix is more complex — there isn’t a simple drop-in replacement that eliminates a class of vulnerabilities. That’s true of this sensitive-logging issue: we don’t have any sort of logging module that can magically know when variables are sensitive, and obfuscate them.</p>
<p>This is where code scanning tools like Semgrep come in. They are a terrifically important part of a mature product security workflow. Traditional testing practices — unit tests, integration tests, etc — are great for reproducing specific security issues, and ensuring that they’re fixed and won’t regress. But they struggle to discover whole classes of security issues, and this is what code scanners enable. Traditional code linters (e.g., Flake8, RuboCop) help to ensure code consistency and find some common issues, but since they have to apply generally to all kinds of projects, they tend to only provide a one-size-fits-all best-practices check. Tools that understand code semantically, like Semgrep, can be used to write tests for <em>your unique codebase</em> and find whole classes of security issues — including, most importantly, new instances of a problem that might be added after the check has been written.</p>
<p>And indeed, that’s what Nathan and his team did: they wrote a Semgrep rule that finds columns with names suggesting they’re sensitive (e.g., containing “token”, “secret”, “key”, etc), and issues a warning.</p>
<p>At this point, we’re in a pretty good spot. New code is continually scanned for this issue, and when found, they are fixed robustly. We have a workflow and tooling that ensures that the original, specific issue is fixed and that it stays fixed, and we ensure that similar issues — present and future — are discovered and fixed. Security and Engineering collaborate on this work, which is now well-automated. There’s still (of course) room for teams to not get along, but we’ve removed some of the most common pain points (verification, regression, conflict between teams).</p>
<p>If suddenly blocking builds with new checks will only increase conflict in your organization, you could softly roll out checks that do not block Engineering and only notify Security. For issues that arise, Security can begin conversations with Engineering to collaborate on both specific and systemic fixes. Once the check is satisfactory to both …</p></div></div></div></section></div>

				<p>The new RP2040 chip by RaspberryPi is amazing. When we got our hands on this beautiful little thing, we did what we always do with new chips and slapped on a Goldfish; our favourite acid bassline synthesizer (we make fish and chips hahahaha).</p>
<p><img src="http://www2.thisisnotrocketscience.nl/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Goldfish-2021-FrontPanel-300x188.png" alt="" width="300" height="188" srcset="http://www2.thisisnotrocketscience.nl/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Goldfish-2021-FrontPanel-200x125.png 200w, http://www2.thisisnotrocketscience.nl/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Goldfish-2021-FrontPanel-300x188.png 300w, http://www2.thisisnotrocketscience.nl/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Goldfish-2021-FrontPanel-320x202.png 320w, http://www2.thisisnotrocketscience.nl/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Goldfish-2021-FrontPanel-400x251.png 400w, http://www2.thisisnotrocketscience.nl/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Goldfish-2021-FrontPanel-600x376.png 600w, http://www2.thisisnotrocketscience.nl/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Goldfish-2021-FrontPanel-700x441.png 700w, http://www2.thisisnotrocketscience.nl/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Goldfish-2021-FrontPanel-768x482.png 768w, http://www2.thisisnotrocketscience.nl/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Goldfish-2021-FrontPanel-800x502.png 800w, http://www2.thisisnotrocketscience.nl/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Goldfish-2021-FrontPanel.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px">While benchmarking the performance by copy/pasting instances of our entire Goldfish in search of the chips limits, we suddenly found ourselves with a polyphonic synth. We have since rewritten these multiple instances into a 16 voice Poly-Goldfish with 4 oscillators per voice. To celebrate we designed a PCB and brightly coloured frontpanel to give this new Goldfish some dedicated controls.</p>
<p>Bring-up was trivial due to the amazing documentation and the extremely flexible PIO-blocks. The RP2040 is a dream to work with. Childlike giddiness ensued while lying on the carpet and programming in VSCode on an RPi400 talking directly to the RP2040. This is the way to release a chip onto the world: with fantastic documentation, an open toolchain and plenty of examples of how to use everything. There is a tantalizing hint at the start of the data sheet that this is the lowest grade chip of the family they plan to release… we cannot wait to play with the RP4755.</p>

<p>Once these chips hit general availability we will probably share some designs on our <a href="https://github.com/ThisIsNotRocketScience">Github</a>. This chip is now part of our go-to set of tools to make the cool stuff and will very bloody likely be inside our next three modules.</p>

Because of the easy, &nbsp;high quality, multi-platform, FREE and even beginner-friendly toolchain they have built around this chip we can expand the accessibility to the insides of our designs. With these chips it is way easier for us to have you do things like adding your own algorithms, building extra modes or creating personal effects. We can lean on the quality of RaspberryPi platform and this amazing chip.</p>

January 24, 2021 | https://edgarluque.com/blog/wrapping-errors-in-rust | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://edgarluque.com/blog/wrapping-errors-in-rust">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
	<p>While I was developing a rust crate (<a href="https://github.com/edg-l/paypal-rs">paypal-rs</a>) I noticed my error handling was pretty bad.</p>
<p>In that crate I had to handle 2 different types of errors:</p>
<ul>
<li>HTTP related errors, in this case <code>reqwest::Error</code></li>
<li>Paypal API errors, which I represent with my own struct <code>PaypalError</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Initially I used <a href="https://github.com/dtolnay/anyhow">anyhow</a> but then I found out this is pretty much only good to be used on binary applications, not in libraries.</p>
<p>The way to make this nice and clean for the library consumers is to wrap the errors.</p>
<h2>Wrapping the errors</h2>
<p>First we need to know which errors need to be wrapped, in my case I have <code>PaypalError</code>:</p>
<pre><code>/// A paypal api response error.
#[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct PaypalError {
    // ...
}

// implement Error and Display for PaypalError...
</code></pre>
<p>And then an error from the reqwest library: <code>reqwest::Error</code>.</p>
<p>First we create an enum to represent all possible errors in our library:</p>
<pre><code>#[derive(Debug)]
pub enum ResponseError {
    /// paypal api error.
    ApiError(PaypalError),
    /// http error.
    HttpError(reqwest::Error)
}
</code></pre>
<p>And as with any error, we have to implement <code>Error</code> and <code>fmt::Display</code>:</p>
<pre><code>impl fmt::Display for ResponseError {
    fn fmt(&amp;self, f: &amp;mut fmt::Formatter&lt;'_&gt;) -&gt; fmt::Result {
        match self {
            ResponseError::ApiError(e) =&gt; write!(f, "{}", e),
            ResponseError::HttpError(e) =&gt; write!(f, "{}", e),
        }
    }
}

impl Error for ResponseError {
    // Implement this to return the lower level source of this Error.
    fn source(&amp;self) -&gt; Option&lt;&amp;(dyn Error + 'static)&gt; {
        match self {
            ResponseError::ApiError(e) =&gt; Some(e),
            ResponseError::HttpError(e) =&gt; Some(e),
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now we should make all the functions that return a Result use the new Error type, this will also give consistency to all our functions.</p>
<p>However, right now we can’t use <code>?</code> directly on our wrapped Errors:</p>
<pre><code>/// func_call_returns_error() returns a Result&lt;(), reqwest::Error&gt;

pub fn some_func() -&gt; Result&lt;(), ResponseError&gt; {
    // Won't work, because the error returned is not ResponseError and has no From implementation!
    // func_call_returns_error()?
    // However we can map it.
    func_call_returns_error().map_err(ResponseError::HttpError)?;
    Ok(())
}
</code></pre>
<h2>Implementing From on the wrapped errors</h2>
<p>To solve this, we have to implement <code>From&lt;PaypalError&gt;</code> and <code>From&lt;reqwest::Error&gt;</code>:</p>
<pre><code>impl From&lt;PaypalError&gt; for ResponseError {
    fn from(e: PaypalError) -&gt; Self {
        ResponseError::ApiError(e)
    }
}

impl From&lt;reqwest::Error&gt; for ResponseError {
    fn from(e: reqwest::Error) -&gt; Self {
        ResponseError::HttpError(e)
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>And now our code becomes like this:</p>
<pre><code>pub fn some_func() -&gt; Result&lt;(), ResponseError&gt; {
    func_call_returns_error()?;
    Ok(())
}
</code></pre>
<h2>The library to skip all this process</h2>
<p>There is a library called <a href="https://github.com/dtolnay/thiserror">thiserror</a>, which implements macros to make this process a breeze, here is how our code ends up if we use this library:</p>
<pre><code>use thiserror::Error;

#[derive(Error, Debug)]
pub enum ResponseError {
    /// A paypal api error.
    #[error("api error {0}")]
    ApiError(#[from] PaypalError),
    /// A http error.
    #[error("http error {0}")]
    HttpError(#[from] reqwest::Error)
}
</code></pre>
<p>And that’s all the code we need!</p>
<p>This is equal (or maybe even better) than our previous code, the best is that it is entirely transparent, the library consumers won’t even know <code>thiserror</code> was used, quoting their github:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thiserror deliberately does not appear in your public API. You get the same thing as if you had written an implementation of std::error::Error by hand, and switching from handwritten impls to thiserror or vice versa is not a breaking change.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For candidates, a full day of interviews is grueling, but in the context of demonstrating your technical skills and how well you’ll perform on the job, it’s a short amount of time. There’s not enough time to invent completely novel solutions, or to prototype multiple different approaches. Instead, you’ll have to rely on previous experience.</p>

<p>Given this time constraint, the single most effective trick for an effective interview is <strong>pattern matching on a toolbox of common techniques</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="rapid-pattern-matching">Rapid pattern matching</h2>

<p>Interviews become easier when you can look at a problem and quickly assess, at a high-level, what approach to take. Every problem is unique, but most are variations of the same common principles. It’s even okay to be wrong at first. When you go down one route and encounter some difficulties, just pattern match on the next technique based on those difficulties.</p>

<p>Let’s see how pattern matching plays out in a few scenarios:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong><a href="https://avikdas.com/2020/01/28/the-balanced-parentheses-problem.html">The balanced parentheses problem</a></strong>, specifically the third follow-up with arbitrary delimiters. Until that follow-up, you can go through the input string once in a for loop. But if you try that with arbitrary delimiters, you find you may not have enough information to tell if a particular character is an opening or closing delimiter. There’s ambiguity. At this point, you reach into your toolbox to find which technique deals with ambiguity: backtracking!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A system design problem like <a href="https://hiringfor.tech/2020/05/11/system-design-practice-designing-a-payment-system.html">designing a payment processor</a>.</strong> Talking through the problem with the interviewer, it turns out the key requirements are reliability (ensuring every promise made to the user is fulfilled) and idempotency (the effect of each action happens only once). If you have a comprehensive toolbox, you know a queue-based architecture is appropriate and you can design the system around that queue.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Design and implementing a lightweight chat application.</strong> Some of the tools in your toolbox to draw from include a client-server architecture, database modeling of domain objects like users and messages, and REST APIs. To support instantaneous delivery of messages, the tools you have include server-sent events, polling or even bi-directional channels like WebSockets. Even the composite architecture composed out of these tools is itself a common architecture, and therefore a pattern in your toolbox.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In all these cases, you <em>can</em> build up the right techniques from scratch, often through trial and error. But if you can immediately pattern match to find the appropriate techniques, and <em>you can name those techniques</em> (“I’m going to use backtracking because we’re dealing with ambiguity”), then the interviewer quickly knows you’re on the right track.</p>



<p>An effective toolbox of techniques consists of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Common algorithmic techniques.</strong> <a href="https://avikdas.com/2019/04/15/a-graphical-introduction-to-dynamic-programming.html">Dynamic programming</a>, <a href="https://avikdas.com/2020/02/25/a-tree-based-introduction-to-backtracking.html">backtracking</a>, <a href="https://avikdas.com/2019/08/13/practical-computer-science-connected-components-in-a-graph.html">graph algorithms</a>, to name a few. Having a formal computer science education helps, but practicing problems and reading up on the theory can make up the gap.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Common types of large-scale systems.</strong> <a href="https://avikdas.com/2020/03/23/scalability-concepts-distributed-id-generation.html">Horizontal scaling</a>, <a href="https://avikdas.com/2020/04/13/scalability-concepts-read-after-write-consistency.html">consistency in distributed systems</a> and <a href="https://avikdas.com/2020/05/11/scalability-concepts-the-reliability-queue.html">queue-based architectures</a> are good examples. Unfortunately, experience working at scale really puts you ahead of the pack, but I’ve tried to write articles about these concepts to help those without the relevant experience.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Common building blocks of practical applications.</strong> These are the tools you’ll use to implement a project, like web frameworks used to build REST APIs, common databases and interfaces to those databases, and UI libraries for the client portion of these projects. You don’t have to know every possible API or framework, but you should be able to build a full application in your area of expertise (client, server, full-stack, etc.).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The latter two categories of tools become increasingly more important the more senior you are. Meanwhile, algorithmic techniques are more important for junior engineers with less industry experience.</p>

<p>The best way to build up this type of toolbox is to observe real-life applications, recognize the technologies and techniques used in those applications, and most importantly, <strong>understand why those technologies and techniques were used</strong>. Whether the application uses Kafka or RabbitMQ doesn’t matter, but the fact that a queue is used for reliability is key.</p>

<h2 id="is-this-the-right-approach">Is this the right approach?</h2>

<p>I don’t think an interview that relies only on pattern matching is ideal, though it’s not completely unfounded either.</p>

<p>Interviewers often talk about assessing a candidate’s problem solving skills. There’s the type of interview where you’re expected to not come up with a perfect solution, but to think through a hard problem from the ground up. To some extent, that type of interview is more reflective of a software developer’s day to day work. But some amount of pattern matching is important for any senior engineer, whose past experience plays a large part in making solid technical decisions.</p>

<p>Still, regardless of what interview style is ideal, pattern matching will still help you succeed in the types of interviews you’ll encounter <em>in practice</em>.</p>

<hr>

<p>Real-world development is done collaboratively over the course of weeks, months and years. Interviews need to evaluate candidates in a matter of hours. For that reason, candidates benefit from pattern matching problems to common techniques. By quickly recognizing the type of problem and what techniques are applicable, you can demonstrate to the interviewer you’re going in the right direction early on. Then, you can spend the rest of your time focusing on the particulars of the given problem.</p>

January 24, 2021 | https://verietyinfo.com/taiwaneng/after-disabling-adobe-flash-trains-in-dalian-china-could-hardly-open-technews-科技-新-报/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://verietyinfo.com/taiwaneng/after-disabling-adobe-flash-trains-in-dalian-china-could-hardly-open-technews-科技-新-报/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Adobe Flash was completely disabled in 2021. Although many media outlets report that Chinese flash agent Chong Orange Network claims to continue to run upgrade services, but this seems useless. Due to the recent suspension of the Flash train in Dalian, China, the entire line of trains in Dalian could hardly work. To solve the problem it was necessary to create a special “technical group” for more than 20 hours.<span id="more-695158"></span></p>

<p>80 years ago, Dalian Railway Station was the largest and most modern railway station in Asia. However, Dalian Railway Station reportedly seems to have frozen in a certain era, and many technologies sound rather “retro”.</p>
<h3>The train dispatch system is actually designed with Flash</h3>
<p>According to the content of the public account WeChat “Warehouse depot of Dalian Railways”</p><p>; Dalian Railway was stated that at 20.00 on January 12, the mayor responsible for dispatching stations, for the first time said that the system page of dispatching machines can not be displayed normally, which did impossible to control the state of operation of trains. The marshal group cannot be displayed, and a maneuvering plan cannot be organized.</p>
<p>In the next half hour almost the same problem arose in the transportation and production of computers across the line. After the technicians “searched the Internet”, it was confirmed that the source of the fault was due to the complete suspension of Flash in Adobe in the US.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.technews.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/15174827/flashtran01.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Many network users should be surprised to see this. First of all, is the railway system in the region and the train control system throughout the region written with the most uncertain and resource-intensive Flash?</p>
<p>Second, the cessation of Flash is not a sudden cessation, it has been announced for at least 3 years. As a result, the railway company had to wait until support was officially stopped, and then a problem arose, and a search on the Internet suddenly revealed that “the United States has completely stopped Flash content.” Do the IT staff of this company have obvious problems?</p>
<p>However, this is not the only problem, this is just the beginning!</p>
<h3>Install the backup computer in person and go to the station on site to install and check?</h3>
<p>The article “Delyan Dalian” takes time as a whole, deliberately creating an exciting solution to “deactivate the flash” of the “technical team”. First, the headquarters installs a backup computer, devises a solution, and then personally takes the installed computer to the station for on-site inspection.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.technews.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/15174918/flashtran02.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>and more!</p>
<p>Isn’t it 2021? Isn’t there something called the Internet? To solve the problem of disabling Flash, why should I install another computer and then transport it to the station for testing? Isn’t this a solution that IT staff used only 10 years ago?</p>
<p>In addition, network users also found out from the article that the railway company has computers divided into computers “original Microsoft system” and “Ghost version system”. The article explains that the original Microsoft system computer is resolved, and the computer “version of Ghost” must be removed.</p>
<p>Honestly, I haven’t heard of “Ghost Edition Computers” in 10 years, but in reality it mostly applies to pirated systems.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.technews.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/15174919/flashtran03.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h3>So how do they solve the problem of disabling Flash?</h3>
<p>After spending so much effort and running around different stations with your computer, how did you finally solve the problem of disabling Flash?</p>
<p>Answer: “install the old version of Flash Player”.</p>
<p>Wait, is everything that simple?</p>
<p>It’s that simple.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.technews.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/15174921/flashtran04.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Just install the old version of the executable file of the Flash player on the pirated system, why spend the whole night sleepless and do it like Keanu Levy from “Defense Forces”, who runs between different stations, desperately holding a computer, because what?</p>
<p>I don’t know, maybe … it looks really hot, right?</p>
<p>Chinese network users called the incident “the happiest technology news in early 2021.” The article in the official WeChat account of the “Dalian Train Department” may have something wrong in the message and the article has been deleted.</p>
<p>But Flash was eliminated, and it, by the way, almost eliminated the railroad in the big city, which is really amazing. Perhaps even more interesting is that local electricity and transportation systems are also designed with Flash, right?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>Need to automate creating Azure AD applications? Look no further. It just got easier with CLI for Microsoft 365.</p> <h2>Before you begin: Azure AD</h2> <p>When you build apps on Microsoft 365, one of the very first things that you need is an Azure AD app. Azure AD app represents your app on the Microsoft cloud. In your Azure AD app you configure what kind of app it is (desktop or web app), how users can authenticate (or if your app is an automated process and doesn't require user context at all) and which permissions your app requires in Microsoft 365 to work.</p> <p>Azure AD offers many settings to support the different scenarios and you can configure them through the Azure Portal. But what if you want to standardize your configuration and share it with your dev team, put it in your CI/CD pipe or give it to your customers?</p> <h2>Automating creating apps with Azure CLI</h2> <p>To automate creating resources on Azure, you can use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/overview?WT.mc_id=m365-12763-wmastyka" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Azure ARM templates</a>. ARM templates support many types of resources on Azure, <em>except Azure AD apps</em>. To create Azure AD apps, you would need to write a script using Azure CLI.</p> <p>Azure CLI has the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/ad/app?view=azure-cli-latest&amp;WT.mc_id=m365-12763-wmastyka#az_ad_app_create" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>az ad app create</code></a> command that allows you to create Azure AD apps. Using this command you can configure some basic settings of the app such as if it's multi-tenant, what reply URLs and which API permissions it has. If you want to configure additional capabilities, such as expose APIs, you need to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/ad/app?view=azure-cli-latest&amp;WT.mc_id=m365-12763-wmastyka#az_ad_app_update" target="_blank" rel="noopener">update the existing Azure AD app</a>. To add a secret or a certificate, you would call <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/ad/app/credential?view=azure-cli-latest&amp;WT.mc_id=m365-12763-wmastyka#az_ad_app_credential_reset" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another command</a>. For some things, there are no commands available in Azure CLI and you would need to call the Microsoft Graph using the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/reference-index?view=azure-cli-latest&amp;WT.mc_id=m365-12763-wmastyka#az_rest" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>az rest</code></a> command yourself.</p> <p>Using Azure CLI you can create and configure Azure AD apps exactly to your needs. If you have a solid understanding of Azure AD and the different settings, you will appreciate the verbosity and flexibility of Azure CLI. But what if you're looking for an easier way of creating Azure AD apps?</p> <h2>Easily create Azure AD apps with CLI for Microsoft 365</h2> <p>Many developers have a basic understanding of Azure AD. Yet, everyone needs to create Azure AD apps in one shape or another. Especially if you build apps on Microsoft 365, there is no way around it. So to help you get started, in the preview version 3.5 of <a href="https://aka.ms/cli-m365" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CLI for Microsoft 365</a>, we introduced a new command that allows you to easily create Azure AD apps with just one line of code.</p> <p>To create an Azure AD app for a deamon app with specified Microsoft Graph permissions, you'd execute:</p> <div><div><pre><code data-lang="sh">m365 aad app add <span>--name</span> <span>'My AAD app'</span> <span>--withSecret</span> <span>--apisApplication</span> <span>'https://graph.microsoft.com/Group.ReadWrite.All,https://graph.microsoft.com/Directory.Read.All'</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>In comparison, with Azure CLI, you write a script similar to:</p> <div><div><pre><code data-lang="powershell"><span>$appName</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"My AAD app"</span><span>

</span><span>"Creating AAD app </span><span>$appName</span><span>..."</span><span>

</span><span># wait for the AAD app to be created or the script will fail later on</span><span>
</span><span>"Waiting for the app to be fully provisioned..."</span><span>
</span><span>Start-Sleep</span><span> </span><span>-Seconds</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span>

</span><span># add current user as app owner</span><span>
</span><span>"Adding current user as app owner..."</span><span>

</span><span>"AppPassword=</span><span>$(</span><span>$appSecret</span><span>.</span><span>password</span><span>)</span><span>"</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div> <p>And that's assuming that you know the exact JSON structure of the API permissions to configure on the app, which is something like:</p> <div><div><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>[</span><span>
  </span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>"resourceAppId"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"00000003-0000-0000-c000-000000000000"</span><span>,</span><span>

      </span><span>{</span><span>
        </span><span>"id"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"e1fe6dd8-ba31-4d61-89e7-88639da4683d"</span><span>,</span><span>

      </span><span>}</span><span>
    </span><span>]</span><span>
  </span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>]</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div> <p>With the <code>aad app add</code> command from CLI for Microsoft 365 you can also create Azure AD apps for single-page apps:</p> <div><div><pre><code data-lang="sh">m365 aad app add <span>--name</span> <span>'My AAD app'</span> <span>--platform</span> spa <span>--redirectUris</span> <span>'https://myspa.azurewebsites.net,http://localhost:8080'</span> <span>--apisDelegated</span> <span>'https://graph.microsoft.com/Calendars.Read,https://graph.microsoft.com/Directory.Read.All'</span> <span>--implicitFlow</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Or even more elaborate apps that expose an API with a custom scope:</p> <div><div><pre><code data-lang="sh">m365 aad app add <span>--name</span> <span>'My AAD app'</span> <span>--uri</span> api://caf406b91cd4.ngrok.io/_appId_ <span>--scopeName</span> access_as_user <span>--scopeAdminConsentDescription</span> <span>'Access as a user'</span> <span>--scopeAdminConsentDisplayName</span> <span>'Access as a user'</span> <span>--scopeConsentBy</span> adminsAndUsers
</code></pre></div></div> <p>The <code>aad app add</code> command doesn't cover all scenarios at the moment. Initially, we focused on helping you to easily create Azure AD apps for most of the types of apps that you'd build on Microsoft 365.</p> <p>Since we've just introduced this command in the v3.5 beta version of CLI for Microsoft 365, we'd love for you to give it a try and tell us what you think. Does it work? Do we miss something important? Is there anything that we should reconsider?</p> <p>To see what's possible, see the <a href="https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/cmd/aad/app/app-add/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">command's docs</a>. Looking forward to hear from you.</p> </div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p>When installing software with Nix, if the target isn’t available in a binary cache somewhere, the software will be built on your machine from source.
This is fine for a development machine, but when deploying software on a remote server this can be tricky depending on the resources available. Building Haskell programs is a long, resource intensive process,
so on a <code>t2.micro</code> EC2 instance it’s pretty much a lost cause.</p><p>Luckily, with GitHub Actions we can use Docker and Nix to build our IHP app and ship a small image containing only what is necessary to run the app.
This took a lot of trial and error to get working, so hopefully this can help you save time and get your application up and running!</p><h2 id="building-a-nix-derivation">Building a Nix derivation</h2><p>I wasn’t able to use <code>nix-build</code> to build a derivation of my project with the Nix files included with IHP, so to get this working I copied the structure of the Nix files included in the project
and changed what was needed to get a build to work. I split up the code into two files, <code>default.nix</code> which is used as the entry point for <code>nix-build</code>, and
<code>build.nix</code> which actually creates the derivation for the project.</p><p>These files assume your IHP project lives in a folder named <code>./web</code>.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="nix"><span># default.nix</span>

</code></pre></div><p>There’s a lot going on in the build file, but don’t fear: this is mainly copied from the IHP project to get all the dependencies needed, and then uses the build and install phases in <code>mkDerivation</code> to build binaries and copy them to the output.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="nix"><span># build.nix</span>

</span></code></pre></div><p>So far, this Dockerfile will build our project and create a symlink pointing to its place in the Nix store in the <code>./result</code> directory. At this point, the image is pretty huge: about 10GB! This is mainly build dependencies like GHC. When shipping to production, we don’t want to keep these around. This is where the beauty of Nix comes in: we can use the <code>nix-store</code> command to get only the runtime dependencies for our derivation, and copy them over to a fresh image using Docker multi-stage builds.</p><p>Continuting on in the same Dockerfile…</p><div><pre><code data-lang="dockerfile"><span># Store all runtime dependencies in a folder</span><span>

Super easy, and best of all free!</p><h2 id="thats-it">That’s it!</h2><p>Now you have a Docker image which contains a built IHP application. This can be deployed in any way you deploy Docker images. To keep costs low, I deployed my project on an AWS EC2 instance running NixOS along with a PostgreSQL database. Come back next Wednesday for a guide on getting that working, and as always please leave a comment with any questions or suggestions.</p><p>I’d also like to give huge thanks to Marco for his excellent post about using multi-stage builds and Nix over at <a href="https://marcopolo.io/code/nix-and-small-containers/">his blog</a>.

<p>Without leaving the letter <em>M</em>: <a href="https://taylor.gl/blog/11/#moore-s-law"><strong>Moore’s Law</strong></a>, <a href="https://taylor.gl/blog/11/#murphy-s-law"><strong>Murphy’s Law</strong></a>, <a href="https://taylor.gl/blog/11/#metcalfe-s-law"><strong>Metcalfe’s Law</strong></a>, <a href="https://taylor.gl/blog/11/#mooers-law"><strong>Mooers’s Law</strong></a>. I’m not saying an adage should never, ever be named after a person. I’ll admit, <a href="https://taylor.gl/blog/11/#moore-s-law"><strong>Moore’s Law</strong></a> and <a href="https://taylor.gl/blog/11/#murphy-s-law"><strong>Murphy’s Law</strong></a> have a certain catchiness to them. But the trend of taking a maxim and calling it Person’s Law has resulted in dozens and dozens of these things being produced, and it makes my head spin. Soon every fact or aphorism will be Somebody’s Law. Not only have such adage laws become a cliché, but, as I have found when researching this article, many of the laws are either not named after the person who came up with the idea (ignorance), or are named by the author after themselves (egotism). They are also called “laws” when they aren’t really laws to lend the ideas more credence than they deserve, or at least more memetic value. It’s hard for me not to take on a negative tone in this article after being exposed to such egotism and ignorance. Apologies in advance.</p>
<p>Newton earned his laws. So did Asimov. But now any lazy aphorism can lend your name immortality if you push for it hard enough. Let me give it a go:</p>

<p>If an adage is named after a person and called a law, there is a 50% chance the law is named after the wrong person, and if not, there is a 50% chance it was named by the author after themselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tell your friends. Ironically, I have basically stolen <strong>Stigler’s Law</strong> here (see <a href="https://taylor.gl/blog/11/#stigler-s-law">below</a>). Oh well, nothing is new under the sun.</p>
<p>Here are some popular adage laws. There are so many of them, but I bet you’ve heard of at least half. Special thanks to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_eponymous_laws">Wikipedia’s list of eponymous laws</a>.:</p>

<p>In early April, <a href="https://first10em.com/aerosols-droplets-and-airborne-spread/">I wrote a long post covering all the science I could find about aerosols and droplets</a>. The basic summary was that this is an area of medicine with lots of misconceptions, poor assumptions, and incomplete science. There was good evidence that previous coronaviruses were spread by aerosols. There was good evidence that influenza is spread by aerosols. Overall, it seemed very likely that SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 was being spread by aerosols, but the science was pretty weak. There is still a lot we don’t know, but as I update the evidence 6 months later, it is pretty clear that aerosols play an important, and unfortunately still widely ignored, role in the transmission of COVID-19.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Dispelling some misconceptions</strong></h2>



<p>There are still many who argue strongly against the role of aerosols in transmission of COVID-19. In general, I think these arguments clash with science and have significant logical inconsistencies. Before getting to the evidence that COVID-19 is spread by aerosols, let’s dispel a few widely held misconceptions.</p>



<h3>COVID-19 has a low Ro</h3>



<p>One main argument against aerosol spread points to the Ro, with the assumption that airborne diseases will always spread easily, and therefore have a high Ro. The argument is often framed as, “this disease doesn’t look like measles, and therefore cannot possibly be airborne.” This is bad logic, as infectivity and mechanism of transmission are separate concepts. Some pathogens require higher numbers to reliably cause infections, which will result in a lower Ro no matter how the infection is transmitted. “While many airborne infections are highly contagious, this is not, strictly speaking, part of the definition.” (Tellier 2019)</p>



<p>The logic here is clearly faulty. The argument being used has the basic format: “X is a Y. Z is not like X. Therefore Z cannot be a Y.” This is somewhat like saying “a horse is a mammal, therefore that dog cannot be a mammal because they don’t look the same.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>This logic is especially problematic in the context of aerosol spread because there are other diseases with good evidence of aerosol spread, such as influenza, that look nothing like measles, but a lot like COVID-19. In fact, the prototypical airborne pathogen is tuberculosis, and tuberculosis has an Ro between 1-3 (exactly like COVID-19). (Ma 2018)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Furthermore, the statement that ‘COVID looks nothing like measles’ is probably untrue. On average, disease transmission is low, but if you look at <a href="#superspreaders">super-spreaders</a>, COVID-19 starts to look a lot like measles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Therefore, the arguments based on Ro are both illogical and inconsistent with science. If anything, the Ro of COVID-19 looks exactly like other known airborne diseases (such as tuberculosis), and so this would be an argument in favour of airborne spread.</p>



<h3>Most transmission is short distance</h3>



<p>The equally fallacious corollary to the Ro argument is that “if COVID-19 is transmitted through aerosols, we should see a lot of infections occurring over long distances”. Although it is true that aerosols will disperse much further than droplets, it is faulty logic to define the <em>mode</em> of transmission by the <em>distance</em> of transmission. The concentration of infectious particles falls dramatically with distance, even when those infectious particles are carried by aerosols. They are spread out through 3 dimensional space, and therefore decrease exponentially with distance. Although aerosols <em>can </em>transmit disease over long distances, they are much more likely to transmit disease over a short distance. (Chen 2020)</p>



<p>This illogical step is so ingrained in the infectious diseases literature that most studies just assume droplet spread if there was close contact. This illogical assumption undermines a great deal of the existing infectious disease literature.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As an interesting historical analogy, for decades it was thought that tuberculosis was transmitted through droplets and fomites, because it occurred most often after close contact. We now know that tuberculosis <em>can only be transmitted through aerosols. </em>(Jimenez 2020)</p>



<p>The existing science refutes the assumption that close contact suggests droplet spread. At the typical conversational distance of about 1 meter, exposure to aerosols is about 2000 times greater than exposure to droplets. (Chen 2020)</p>



<p>The bottom line is that short range disease transmission is definitely consistent with aerosol transmission, and distance cannot be used to define mode of transmission. </p>

<figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/L5-2vvhXzO_aDuKAGFwUDx_AxmkSd38kpa6yoxpUFaZZClsGgK6MXNAkSF51B2EJw6Yt3CN4cvg22edQQ7_IrNotc9UB-diCwotWjds5t5A0KTXYRGN96WFJrkOk2vk9f5x42zvK" alt=""><figcaption>From Nielson 2020. Transmission by both aerosols and droplets is highest when close to the patient. Although aerosol transmission can occur at a distance, the vast majority will occur at close range.</figcaption></figure>



<p>So why don’t we see a lot of long range transmission of COVID-19? The primary explanation is simple dilution. The further you are from a patient, the more dilute aerosols become. Risk of aerosol transmission drops off dramatically with increasing distance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The importance of dilution of aerosols is evident in everyday life. You can smell cigarette smoke when you are standing 8 meters away from a smoker, but it is nothing like the obnoxious fumes present if you were standing right next to them. Similarly, cigarette smoke is much worse indoors than out. Imagine each smoke molecule as a virus. You are obviously at much higher risk 1 meter away than you are at 8 meters. (But that doesn’t make smoke a droplet.)</p>



<p>Dilution doesn’t prevent exposure to the virus, but it makes it less probable. With dilution of aerosols, the primary driver of infection is the intrinsic infectivity of the pathogen. If infection occurs after exposure to only a few viral particles, we should expect to see more long range transmission despite the dilution. If larger exposures are required, we will see fewer infections. This is the primary difference between measles and COVID-19.</p>



<p>One final note about long range transmission: we really don’t know how common it is in COVID-19. Identification of long range transmission is incredibly difficult unless there are a very small number of cases. With a small outbreak of measles cases, it is easier to determine exactly where individuals were, and identify airborne transmission. For the vast majority of COVID-19 cases, we do not know how the individual became ill, and so could easily be overlooking long range transmission (especially when the possibility of aerosol transmission is dismissed out of hand in some circles). In fact, there seems to be pretty good evidence of long range transmission in many of the <a href="#superspreader">super-spreader events discussed below</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Our current approach is working</h3>



<p>Another argument occasionally used to dismiss aerosols as a mode of transmission is that our current PPE approach seems to be working in hospitals. First, <a href="https://first10em.com/we-are-not-doing-enough-to-protect-healthcare-workers-from-covid-19/">I would point out that healthcare workers are contracting COVID-19 at a rate that is far higher than the general population</a>, so this argument is pretty weak. Furthermore, as will be explored further below, there are many other factors that significantly dilute aerosols in most hospitals, like excellent ventilation, good distancing, and masking of both patients and providers. Although not quite as good as N95s, well fitting surgical masks will still filter out as much as 80% of infectious aerosols. (Makison Booth 2013) Combined with the low infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, these factors keep us relatively safe even when we stubbornly ignore the science that suggests aerosols are very important in the transmission of COVID-19.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Particle size</h3>



<p>Many of the arguments against the aerosol spread of COVID-19 rely on incorrect assumptions about particle size. <a href="https://first10em.com/aerosols-droplets-and-airborne-spread/">I went into this at length in the first post</a>, so won’t repeat myself here. The basic summary is that particles of sizes that many articles refer to as droplets actually remain airborne for prolonged periods, and are therefore better classified as aerosols for the purposes of transmission. Just be careful when reading articles, because many don’t define these terms. When I use the term aerosol here, I am referring to any droplet that remains suspended in the air for longer that a few seconds, whatever the size, because that is the feature that matters for infection control. </p>



<h3>The lack of definitive proof</h3>



<p>Some of the arguments against aerosol transmission simply assume droplet transmission and demand “definitive proof” for aerosol transmission. I won’t attempt a treatise on the philosophy of science here, but that is an unreasonable bar.</p>



<p>One version of this argument states that viable SARS-CoV-2 has never been isolated from the air, and therefore we cannot definitively prove airborne transmission. This demand is unreasonable. Measles and tuberculosis are both known to be airborne, and no one has been able to isolate viable pathogens for either from the air. (Jimenez 2020) Furthermore, this is probably an outdated argument, as multiple studies actually have identified viable SARS-CoV-2 in the air. (Lednicky 2020; Santarpia 2020a)&nbsp;</p>



<p>The specifics of whether or not viable virus has been cultured from air samples is irrelevant. The point is that unfair standards are being used when comparing aerosols and droplets. There is no definitive proof that SARS-CoV-2 spreads through large droplets. (Jimenez 2020) It is crazy to require such stringent proof of aerosol transmission, while simultaneously just assuming droplet transmission is occurring. The same standards must be required for both claims. We are unlikely to have ‘definitive proof’ of either claim. Our decisions must be made based on the preponderance of the evidence.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>There is good evidence that COVID-19 spreads through aerosols</strong></h2>



<p>Although there is no “smoking gun”, the evidence that COVID-19 spreads through aerosols is relatively strong. Below I outline the …</p></div></section></div></article></div>

<p>Jeff Bezos — a strong Democratic supporter — and Amazon are aiming to postpone a unionization vote at one of its warehouses in Alabama, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-seeks-to-postpone-alabama-unionization-vote-11611339250?mod=e2tw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reports</a>. Interestingly, Amazon has requested that the National Labor Relations Board reconsider allowing mail-in voting, claiming that the mail-in voting process has “serious and systemic flaws.”</p>
<p>Got that? Bezos and Amazon are doing all they can to prevent any shady activity when workers cast their ballots for unionization, and they are particularly concerned about the integrity of mail-in ballots.</p>
<p>You are likely trying to figure out how that adds up, right? The <em>Washington Post</em>, owned by Bezos, called any claims of mail-in voter fraud by Donald Trump and his supporters dangerous and inexcusable. Amazon even banned Parler from its servers, in part to ensure no one could claim voter fraud occurred from mail-in ballots back in November.</p>
<p>But stop trying to make it make sense. It is not supposed to add up.</p>
<p>In this case, mail-in voting is disadvantageous for Bezos and his e-commerce behemoth. Therefore, they now consider mail-in voting seriously flawed.</p>
<p>An Amazon spokesperson <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/22/tech/amazon-nlrb-union-election/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tells</a> CNN the company is seeking a “valid, fair and successful election” and suggests that only in-person voting can ensure that. Hmm, interesting perspective.</p>
<p>Amazon has, thus far, fended off unions in the United States. If a majority of ballots vote in favor of unionization, hourly Amazon workers would send an L right up to Bezos’ office.</p>
<p>Bamazonunion.com explains that a union at Amazon would “give us the right to collectively bargain over our working conditions including items such as safety standards, training, breaks, pay, benefits, and other important issues that would make our workplace better.”</p>
<p>The NLRB says, “A mail ballot election will enfranchise employees who cannot enter the voting location for health reasons or due to positive COVID tests.” Fearing an unfavorable outcome, however, Amazon now insists that current COVID outbreaks aren’t dangerous enough to warrant this NLRB decision.</p>
<p>Amazon says that Lisa Henderson, NLRB’s Acting Regional Director “reached the remarkable conclusion that any level of infection or potential infection among employees counts as an ‘outbreak.'” <em>O</em><em>nly</em> 218 people employees, 2.88%, at its Bessemer facility tested positive during the 14-day period ending on January 7, which Amazon does not consider an “outbreak” apparently. This is quite the change of perspective. Imagine the coverage from the <em>Washington Post</em> if similar questions had been asked before November.</p>
<p>Mail-in voting has never been about the health of Americans or ensuring that each voice counts. As always, our country’s most powerful figures in both Washington and Silicon Valley base their opinions solely on the outcomes that increase their own power, finances, and flexibility.</p>
<p>Hypocritical, but sadly, all too predictable.</p>

January 23, 2021 | https://markjames.dev/2021-01-23-plotting-csv-files-fsharp/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://markjames.dev/2021-01-23-plotting-csv-files-fsharp/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article role="main">
        <p>Data visualization is an important tool, and there’s been many cases where I’ve found myself wanting to visualize data from a CSV file. As I’ve <a href="https://markjames.dev/2021-01-04-why-learning-fsharp-2021/">been learning F#</a> in the New Year, I thought that plotting a chart would be a great exercise to help sharpen my F# skills. This is especially true as once I finish porting <a href="https://markjames.dev/2021-01-08-writing-an-iracing-sdk-implementation-fsharp/">the iRacing SDK</a> to F#, the next step will be to record my lap times and visualize the telemetry data. Fortunately, charts can be created fairly easily in F# by using the <a href="https://github.com/fslaborg/XPlot">XPlot</a> library in conjunction with Plotly.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this exercise, I’ll be using the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks?select=data_by_year.csv">Spotify Dataset</a> from Kaggle, specifically the data by year file. From this file, we’ll be looking to plot the danceability of music over time. According to the Kaggle definition, danceability is “The relative measurement of the track being danceable (ranging from 0 to 1)”, but I’m unsure what the exact criteria for danceability is (maybe tempo and loudness combined with some other variable?). The end result should produce an HTML file which you can then embed on a website:</p>


    
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        
    
    
        
        
    




<p>After creating a new F# console project in Visual Studio, the first step was to load the CSV file so that we can feed the data to XPlot. This can be done using the CSV type provider in the <a href="https://fsprojects.github.io/FSharp.Data/">F# Data library</a>.</p>

<p>Next, I created a new module called CSVRead inside a new file called CSVRead.fs. Inside the module, I place the first few lines of code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>open</span> <span>FSharp</span><span>.</span><span>Data</span>

<span>[&lt;</span><span>Literal</span><span>&gt;]</span>
<span>let</span> <span>filePath</span> <span>=</span> <span>"""C:</span><span>\</span><span>Path</span><span>\</span><span>To</span><span>\</span><span>data_by_year.csv"""</span>

<span>type</span>  <span>rawCSV</span> <span>=</span> <span>CsvProvider</span><span>&lt;</span><span>filePath</span><span>,</span> <span>HasHeaders</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In the above code, we bind our filepath to an identifier and then create a new type which contains the CSVProvider plus our filepath. We also include HasHeaders = true as our CSV file contains column headers.</p>

<p>One thing to note is that in F# we use [&lt;Literal&gt;] the same way we would const in C# or other languages. I’m using a literal here due to a blessing and curse of type providers in F#. On one hand, they’re amazing, because you get compile-time types for your data! But, that also means the data must be available at compile time. You can usually work around this by either:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Including representative data inside your project’s git repo, so you can build the provider based on sample data and then parse any conforming input data</li>
  <li>Using a string literal in source code to define sample data and use that for the provider (which is what I’ve done here).</li>
</ul>

<p>Now that we have our type provider setup, the next step is to create a function which loads our CSV file by using the GetSample() function from our type provider:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>loadCSVFile</span> <span>()</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>try</span>
        <span>let</span> <span>cSVFile</span> <span>=</span> <span>rawCSV</span><span>.</span><span>GetSample</span><span>()</span>
        <span>let</span> <span>cSVFile</span> <span>=</span> <span>Some</span><span>(</span><span>cSVFile</span><span>)</span>
        <span>cSVFile</span>
    <span>with</span> <span>_</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>None</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This function’s signature is unit -&gt; Some cSVFile. Note that we’re using an option here since the CSV file may not load (for more information on using options for error handling, see <a href="https://markjames.dev/2021-01-14-handling-errors-fsharp-with-option-types/">this post</a>).</p>



<p>Now that we have a way to load our CSV file in place, the next step is to use XPlot to chart our data with Plotly, a handy charting library with an HTML frontend. To do so, I created a new file called Graphing.fs which would contain our graphing module and associated functions.</p>

<p>With our Graphing module created, the first step was to create a graphData function which would map our chosen rows to a scatter plot. My solution ended up looking like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>graphData</span> <span>(</span><span>rawCSV</span><span>:</span> <span>rawCSV</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>Scatter</span><span>(</span>
       <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>for</span> <span>row</span> <span>in</span> <span>rawCSV</span><span>.</span><span>Rows</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>row</span><span>.</span><span>Year</span><span>],</span>
       <span>y</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>for</span> <span>row</span> <span>in</span> <span>rawCSV</span><span>.</span><span>Rows</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>row</span><span>.</span><span>Danceability</span><span>],</span>
        <span>mode</span> <span>=</span> <span>"lines+markers"</span>
    <span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This function takes in our rawCSV type and returns a Scatter object, which is produced by iterating over the Year and Danceability rows of the CSV file.</p>

<p>One important thing to remember, is that in F#, the order of your files matter. In my Graphing module, I had been getting the error: <em>FS0039: The namespace or module ‘CSVRead’ is not defined</em> which confused me as I was referencing was my own module inside Graphing.fs. It turns out however, that I had forgotten to put CSVRead.fs above Graphing.fs inside Visual Studio, but once I did the error cleared up right away.</p>

<p>Although I’m not used to having the order of source files matter, it makes quite a lot of sense in terms of readability as the same principles apply to functions within the files. My experience with this style so far has made it easier to understand programs as I’m not constantly jumping from file to file and looking in different areas while trying to mentally keep track of function side effects.</p>

<p>The next step is to create a function which takes our scatter plot as input and then sets up the actual plot in Plotly:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>createPlot</span> <span>(</span><span>data</span><span>:</span> <span>Scatter</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>data</span>
    <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Chart</span><span>.</span><span>Plot</span>
    <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Chart</span><span>.</span><span>WithOptions</span>
        <span>(</span><span>Options</span><span>(</span><span>title</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Music Danceability Over the Ages"</span><span>))</span>
    <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Chart</span><span>.</span><span>WithXTitle</span><span>(</span><span>"Year"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Chart</span><span>.</span><span>WithYTitle</span><span>(</span><span>"Danceability"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Chart</span><span>.</span><span>WithWidth</span> <span>700</span>
    <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Chart</span><span>.</span><span>WithHeight</span> <span>500</span>
    <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Chart</span><span>.</span><span>Show</span> 
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The above code is fairy straightforward, setting up a pipeline which creates a chart to plot and then fills it with the relevant information. I must say that I’m becoming a big fan of F# pipe-forward operator as I find this style of coding to look clean and elegant while being easy to reason about.</p>



<p>With our CSV and graphing modules now in place, the final step was to chain our functions together in our Program.fs EntryPoint:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>open</span> <span>CSVRead</span>
<span>open</span> <span>Graphing</span>

<span>[&lt;</span><span>EntryPoint</span><span>&gt;]</span>
<span>let</span> <span>main</span> <span>argv</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>loadCSVFile</span><span>()</span>
    <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Option</span><span>.</span><span>map</span> <span>graphData</span>
    <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Option</span><span>.</span><span>map</span> <span>createPlot</span> 
    <span>|&gt;</span> <span>ignore</span>
    <span>0</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here, we’re loading our CSV file and then chaining functions together to graph the data and create the plot. Note the use of Option.map here as loadCSVFile() is returning an option. In addition, we’re ignoring the return value since Plotly is being loaded and displayed in the browser and we don’t need any return value.</p>



<p>As you can see, plotting a chart from a CSV file is fairly straightforward in F#. I find F#’s pipe operator and lack of visual clutter makes it very succinct and easy to understand. Although this example creates a connect scatterplot, Plotly has a wide variety of chart types that you can create, and I highly recommend taking a look and playing around to see what you can do!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p>DRM is the bridge between the Linux kernel and actual software running atop
Linux, for most operations which involve a graphics card. For example, X11 and
Wayland actually send drawing commands to the graphics card using DRM.</p>
<p>In this post I’ll be talking about how to write software which communicates with
the graphics card directly, completely bypassing X. Do mind that I am also
learning while I write, so some information might be inaccurate and also I’m
jumping through unnecessary hoops, from the perspective of just getting things
done.</p>
<p>I’ll be using C++.</p>

<p>The kernel DRM API is file based, which means you can open a file representing
the graphics card (usually <code>/dev/dri/card0</code>) and use that file to send actual
commands to the card, using the <code>ioctl()</code> syscall with the opened file
representing the card.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there is also a library conveniently named <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/drm/">libdrm</a> that
simplifies all that. Keep in mind that all that it does is what we mentioned
above: opening a file and sending commands through <code>ioctl()</code> syscalls.</p>
<p>In C++ a simple program that interacts with the video card through DRM might
look like this at the top level:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;cassert&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;fcntl.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span></span>
<span>// The file which represents the card
</span><span></span><span>static</span> <span>const</span> <span>char</span> gpu_dev[] <span>=</span> <span>"/dev/dri/card0"</span>;

<span>int</span> <span>open_gpu</span>() {
  <span>return</span> open(gpu_dev, O_RDWR);
}

<span>int</span> <span>close_gpu</span>(<span>int</span> gpu) {
  <span>return</span> close(gpu);
}

<span>int</span> <span>main</span>(<span>int</span> arg_count, <span>char</span><span>**</span> arg_vector) {
  <span>const</span> <span>int</span> gpu <span>=</span> open_gpu();
  assert(gpu <span>&gt;=</span> <span>0</span>);

  <span>// some ioctl() magic here...
</span><span></span>
  assert(close_gpu(gpu) <span>&gt;=</span> <span>0</span>);

  <span>return</span> <span>0</span>;
}
</code></pre></div><p>And as a sanity check we can try to run it in a Linux machine:</p>
<pre><code>❯ clang++ drm-part-1.cpp -o drm-part-1
❯ ./drm-part-1
❯
</code></pre>
<p>Surely enough, it runs! But it doesn’t do anything yet. It needs that <code>ioctl()</code>
magic, but at least no assertions failed and we know we can open the video card
file now!</p>
<p>Lets include another library which has some very handy <em>structs</em> and also
definitions of parameters for <code>ioctl()</code>: <code>libdrm/drm.h</code>. While we are at it,
lets also include <code>sys/ioctl.h</code> and <code>iostream</code> for syscalls and printing.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;libdrm/drm.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;sys/ioctl.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;iostream&gt;</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The first interaction that we are going to have with the card is not going to be
with the card itself but just with the driver (bummer, I know). Lets try to
retrieve the driver version using a <code>ioctl()</code> call.</p>
<p>There is a definition for a <em>struct</em> which holds exactly this data in
<code>libdrm/drm.h</code>, <code>drm_version_t</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>struct</span> <span>drm_version</span> {
	<span>int</span> version_major;	  <span>/**&lt; Major version */</span>
	<span>int</span> version_minor;	  <span>/**&lt; Minor version */</span>
	<span>int</span> version_patchlevel;	  <span>/**&lt; Patch level */</span>
	__kernel_size_t name_len;	  <span>/**&lt; Length of name buffer */</span>
	<span>char</span> <span>*</span>name;	  <span>/**&lt; Name of driver */</span>
	__kernel_size_t date_len;	  <span>/**&lt; Length of date buffer */</span>
	<span>char</span> <span>*</span>date;	  <span>/**&lt; User-space buffer to hold date */</span>
	__kernel_size_t desc_len;	  <span>/**&lt; Length of desc buffer */</span>
	<span>char</span> <span>*</span>desc;	  <span>/**&lt; User-space buffer to hold desc */</span>
};
</code></pre></div><p>To get the version from the driver we need to do three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Initialize a <code>drm_version_t</code>, notice there are some <em>char *</em> fields for which
we need to allocate memory.</li>
<li>Call <code>ioctl()</code> with the appropriate parameters and a pointer to our
<code>drm_version_t</code>.</li>
<li>Print out the information we get and free everything.</li>
</ol>
<p>Seems easy enough right? Lets do it!</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp">drm_version_t <span>create_version</span>() {
  drm_version_t version;

  version.name <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>char</span>[<span>256</span>];
  version.date <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>char</span>[<span>256</span>];
  version.desc <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>char</span>[<span>256</span>];

  <span>return</span> version;
}
</code></pre></div><p>And:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>void</span> <span>delete_version</span>(<span>const</span> drm_version_t <span>&amp;</span>version) {
  <span>delete</span> version.name;
  <span>delete</span> version.date;
  <span>delete</span> version.desc;
}
</code></pre></div><p>To print it out:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>void</span> <span>print_version</span>(<span>const</span> drm_version_t <span>&amp;</span>version) {
  std<span>::</span>cout <span>&lt;&lt;</span> std<span>::</span>string(version.name, version.name_len) <span>&lt;&lt;</span> std<span>::</span>endl
            <span>&lt;&lt;</span> std<span>::</span>string(version.desc, version.desc_len) <span>&lt;&lt;</span> std<span>::</span>endl
            <span>&lt;&lt;</span> version.version_major <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"."</span>
            <span>&lt;&lt;</span> version.version_minor <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"."</span>
            <span>&lt;&lt;</span> version.version_patchlevel <span>&lt;&lt;</span> std<span>::</span>endl;
}
</code></pre></div><p>And finally, we can call all that in our <code>main()</code>, notice the <code>ioctl()</code> call
using the <code>DRM_IOCTL_VERSION</code> value, which is defined in <code>libdrm</code> so we don’t
have to worry about the specific values passed:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>int</span> <span>main</span>(<span>int</span> arg_count, <span>char</span><span>**</span> arg_vector) {
  <span>const</span> <span>int</span> gpu <span>=</span> open_gpu();
  assert(gpu <span>&gt;=</span> <span>0</span>);

  drm_version_t version <span>=</span> create_version();
  assert(ioctl(gpu, DRM_IOCTL_VERSION, <span>&amp;</span>version) <span>==</span> <span>0</span>);
  print_version(version);
  delete_version(version);

  assert(close_gpu(gpu) <span>&gt;=</span> <span>0</span>);

  <span>return</span> <span>0</span>;
}
</code></pre></div><p>After a little compiling, behold the power!</p>
<pre><code>❯ ./drm-part-1
i915
Intel Graphics
1.6.0
</code></pre>
<p>We are <em>talking</em> to the DRM driver of my Intel graphics card! No X11 involved,
this runs even directly in the <em>tty</em>!</p>
<p>Keep in mind that <em>libdrm</em> does a lot more than just provide the definitions and
we do not need to be calling <code>ioctl()</code> directly, but for the purposes of
learning I found important know exactly how the syscalls are made to the
graphics driver.</p>

<p>This blog post is a part of a series of posts devoted to <strong>Firecracker automation</strong>. Currently it consists of the
following posts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Part I (current)</li>
<li>Part II:
<a href="https://ongres.com/blog/63-node-eks-cluster-running-on-a-single-instance-with-firecracker">63-Node EKS Cluster running on a Single Instance with Firecracker</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-some-firecracker-automation-would-be-helpful">Why some Firecracker automation would be helpful</h3>
<p><a href="https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/">Firecracker</a> is a lightweight <em>VMM</em> (Virtual Machine Monitor), a VM
“controller” layered on top of KVM, created an open sourced by AWS. The virtual machine runs as a process in your
host OS, and is designed for simplicity and security. This post is not about Firecracker itself, but if you are
not familiar with it I recommend diving deeper.</p>
<p>Because of its simplicity, it only supports virtualizing Linux, and starting a VM requires handing to Firecracker a root
filesystem image and the kernel in uncompressed format. When using Firecracker you often times find yourself using the
sample Linux kernel and root filesystem images on Firecracker’s GitHub
“<a href="https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md">getting started</a>”, or building
your own.</p>
<p>Firecracker is started as a process per VM, typically listening on a file-based socket for HTTP requests to its API for
configuration and VM lifecycle operations. Passing all the required configuration becomes a bit tedious and is a great
candidate for scripting.</p>
<p>Besides, <strong>it would be ideal to run vanilla cloud images, as produced by the different distros, on Firecracker</strong>. This
is possible and was enabled when
<a href="https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/1246">initrd support was added</a>. Still, you need to download
the cloud image and modify it to potentially add SSH keys, change the default user’s password, configure the network,
etc.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, both <strong>configuring and starting Firecracker, and preparing the cloud images to connect and use
them, requires a fair amount of effort. The main goal of this post is to show some automation for these tasks, and offer
a simple way to run cloud images, as provided</strong>. Key to this automation will be the use of
<a href="https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/">cloud-init</a>, a pervasive initialization software that is included in most cloud
images, allowing to configure the image on first boot, based on provided metadata.</p>
<h3 id="the-architecture">The architecture</h3>
<p>The created automation should be good to launch multiple VMs. Multiple Firecracker processes will be then needed (one
for each VM), and one socket file for each too (for Firecracker’s API to listen to our commands and launch the VMs). Then,
we will need one “disk” for each VM. A disk for a Firecracker VM is just a file on the host OS containing the root
filesystem. So it will suffice to download the cloud image, make some minor scripted adjustments to it (more on this
later) and then use it as a template –basically, copy the root filesystem to the file that the VM will effectively use.</p>
<p>What about networking? Firecracker allows you to specify a tap device to be passed to the VM. These tap devices will
then have one endpoint on the VM and another one on the host, allowing the network traffic to flow. In order for the host
OS to communicate with the VMs, and the VMs to communicate among each other, a Linux bridge will be used, where all the
host endpoints of the tap devices will be connected. The bridge will have its own IP on the same network (enabling host
processes to reach the network on the VMs), and then will be MASQUERADEd via <code>iptables</code> to allow the VMs to reach the
Internet.</p>
<p>Additionally, a second tap device will be added to the VMs. It will not be connected anywhere on the host or be given
any IP address on the host. This tap device will also have the special Firecracker property <code>allow_mmds_requests</code>, which
enables communications from the guest VM to the HTTP metadata endpoint to access Firecracker’s
<a href="https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/blob/master/docs/mmds/mmds-user-guide.md">metadata service</a> (MMDS).
This metadata service is what will be used to provide the necessary information for the VM to configure itself on first
boot. The MMDS could have been enabled just on the main tap interface; but both for performance and security reasons,
it is better to have a separate tap device just to access MMDS.</p>
<p>This is how the complete architecture looks like:</p>
<p><img src="https://ongres.com/img/blog/automation_firecracker-architecture.jpg" alt="Firecracker automation: architecture"></p>
<h3 id="cloud-init">cloud-init</h3>
<p>Key to all the process is <code>cloud-init</code>. It is installed by default on most cloud images, and runs on first boot,
configuring the VM. <code>cloud-init</code> supports several methods (“sources”) from where to feed the necessary metadata on how
to configure the instance. Here I will be using one called
<a href="https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/datasources/nocloud.html"><code>nocloud-net</code></a>, which is specific for
on-prem environments. It supports fetching all the metadata from an HTTP endpoint, which is a perfect match for
Firecracker’s MMDS service. It will suffice then to write the cloud-init necessary metadata from the host to
Firecracker’s MMDS service via its API, and the guest VM will connect to the URL provided as the seed for <code>nocloud-net</code>
cloud-init datasource, and fetch it. Configuring <code>nocloud-net</code> can be easily achieved by passing to Firecracker’s boot
source configuration the following additional Linux kernel command line argument:</p>
<pre><code>ds=nocloud-net;s=http://169.254.169.254/latest/
</code></pre><p>(see
<a href="https://gitlab.com/ongresinc/blog-posts-src/-/blob/master/202012-firecracker_cloud_image_automation/conf/firecracker/boot-source.json">conf/firecracker/boot-source.json</a>).
Here <code>169.254.169.254</code> is the address where by default the MMDS service is accessible from the guest (can be changed via
Firecracker’s API if desired) and <code>/latest</code> is part of cloud-init’s API when accessing metadata (more precisely, it’s
a versioning field).</p>
<p>But how do we connect to the metadata IP service? We should firstly configure the network, in particular the tap device
that would be configured for MMDS access. Fortunately, we can also pass a network configuration via a kernel command line
argument (<code>network-config</code>), from where it will be read by cloud-init. It must be a
<a href="https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/network-config-format-v2.html#network-config-v2">Networking Config Version 2</a>
YAML file, base64 encoded (can also be gzip’ed before encoding –used here). The applied configuration will be
derived from the file
<a href="https://gitlab.com/ongresinc/blog-posts-src/-/blob/master/202012-firecracker_cloud_image_automation/conf/cloud-init/network_config.yaml">conf/cloud-init/network_config.yaml</a>.</p>
<p>Upon boot, cloud-init will then read the kernel command-line arguments explained, and will configure <code>eth0</code> inside the
VM, the device that is allowed to communicate with the MMDS API, with an IP able to access the MMDS range; and <code>eth1</code>
with an IP in the range of the internal network of the VMs. Remember that <code>eth0</code>’s host tap endpoint is not connected
anywhere, while <code>eth1</code>s host tap endpoint is connected to the bridge (and NAT-ed). Note that because of this, the IP
address of the <code>eth0</code> device can be made the same on all VMs.</p>
<p>Once the network is configured, it will follow the <code>nocloud-net</code> datasource configuration, and connect to the HTTP
endpoint, accesible from <code>eth0</code>. According to cloud-init, it will need to fetch two files from the metadata service:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/ongresinc/blog-posts-src/-/blob/master/202012-firecracker_cloud_image_automation/conf/cloud-init/meta-data.yaml">meta-data</a>.
It serves to perform instance configuration. Here only will be used to set the instance id and configure the hostname.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/ongresinc/blog-posts-src/-/blob/master/202012-firecracker_cloud_image_automation/conf/cloud-init/user-data.yaml">user-data</a>.
Probably known to many (as you can pass this on most cloud environments), is used to perform package installation, user
configuration and many other actions on instance’s first boot. Here, it is used as a
<a href="https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/examples.html">cloud-config</a> script, one of the several possible
options to initialize the instance provided by cloud-init. In particular, it is used to create the <code>fc</code> user, add it to
password-less sudo, and set the SSH authorized key to an SSH pubkey, part of a key-pair previously generated on the host.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks to this process, once the VM is booted, it will have its network configured and will be accessible from the host
(thanks to the IP assigned to the bridge) via password-less SSH and with sudo permissions. <strong>Just like your regular EC2
instace!</strong></p>
<h3 id="automation-steps">Automation steps</h3>
<p>All the automation has been written on a series of –a bit <em>hackish</em>– shell scripts. They are only intended for
demonstration purposes, and definitely have a lot of room for improvement. All the source code is
<a href="https://gitlab.com/ongresinc/blog-posts-src/-/tree/master/202012-firecracker_cloud_image_automation">publicly available</a>.</p>
<p>To use the automation, please review first the <code>README.md</code> file and see if you want to modify any values in <code>variables</code>.
Note that this will only run on a bare metal Linux system or a Linux VM with support for nested KVM virtualization.
Follow the next steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download Firecracker and set permissions for your user to access the <code>/dev/kvm</code> special device. See
<a href="https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md">Getting Started with Firecracker</a>
for more information.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>sudo setfacl -m u:${USER}:rw /dev/kvm
[ $(stat -c "%G" /dev/kvm) = kvm ] &amp;&amp; sudo usermod -aG kvm ${USER}
</code></pre><ol>
<li>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/ongresinc/blog-posts-src/-/blob/master/202012-firecracker_cloud_image_automation/01-setup_host.sh">01-setup_host.sh</a>.
This script creates the host bridge where all VMs will be connected and creates the <code>iptables</code>
rules to NAT outgoing traffic from the VMs to Internet. Modify the <code>$EGRESS_IFACE</code> variable if the device would not be
correctly detected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/ongresinc/blog-posts-src/-/blob/master/202012-firecracker_cloud_image_automation/02-gen_keypair.sh">02-gen_keypair.sh</a>.
Generates the SSH keypair. The private key will be kept on the host to SSH the VMs. The public
key will be inserted into the <code>authorized_keys</code> of the <code>fc</code> user in all VMs. Note that the more modern and
secure <a href="https://medium.com/risan/upgrade-your-ssh-key-to-ed25519-c6e8d60d3c54">EdDSA</a> keys have been used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/ongresinc/blog-posts-src/-/blob/master/202012-firecracker_cloud_image_automation/03-download_generate_image.sh">03-download_generate_image.sh</a>.
All the user configuration will be performed via cloud-init. However, because of how Firecracker works, cloud image as
downloaded cannot be used directly. First of all, Firecracker doesn’t use a disk image with partitions, but just the root filesystem.
Also, the kernel and initrd need to be provided separately (as Firecracker doesn’t support system emulation for
bootloaders). Finally, the kernel image cannot be compressed. This script just downloads a <code>.tar.xz</code>-ed cloud image,
copies it into an <code>ext4</code> filesystem backed by a file, downloads the initrd and kernel, and uncompresses the kernel.</p>

The main script, that launches N virtual machines. It launches one Firecracker process per VM, proceeds to configure the
VM and the metadata via Firecracker’s HTTP API, and finally boots into it. Note that several requests are needed to configure
all the …</p></li></ol></div></section></main></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>MONTREAL -- 
	A team of researchers from the Montreal Heart Institute believe they have found an effective weapon against COVID-19: colchicine, an oral tablet already known and used for other diseases.</p>
<p>
	For Dr. Jean-Claude Tardif, who led the study, this is a "major scientific discovery," he said. Colchicine is the first "effective oral drug to treat out-of-hospital patients."</p>
<p>
	"To be able to offer this, from Quebec, and for the planet, we are very happy," said Tardif.</p>
<p>
	<a href="https://www.colcorona.net/" target="_blank">The ColCorona study</a> involved 4,159 patients whose diagnosis of COVID-19 had been confirmed by a nasopharyngeal test (PCR).</p>

<p>
	Analysis of the study found that colchicine resulted in reductions in hospitalizations by 25 per cent, the need for mechanical ventilation by 50 per cent, and deaths by 44 per cent.</p>
<p>
	"This is the first hope for patients who have COVID, who are worried and who hope that they will not have complications," said Tardif. Previously, "there were no tablets that could be taken by mouth and reduce the risks."</p>
<p>
	Tardif said he believes that prescribing the drug could help reduce congestion in hospitals quickly and reduce health-care costs in Quebec and elsewhere.</p>
<p>
	"Our study showed the effectiveness of treatment using colchicine to prevent the phenomenon of the major inflammatory storm and reduce complications related to COVID-19," he said.</p>
<p>
	As colchicine is a well-understood drug, it could be used very quickly to treat people with COVID-19, the researcher says.</p>
<p>
	"Colchicine is old as it is -- we've been treating gout with it for hundreds of years -- so it's available in pharmacies," Tardif said, speaking in French.</p>
<p>
	"So any doctor, tomorrow, who reads this can definitely decide to prescribe if he wants."</p>
<p>
	On Friday evening, Quebec Premier Francois Legault called the study "big news" on social networks.</p>
<p>
	In the spring, Legault said the Colcorona study was one of the largest studies in the world researching ways to fight the virus.</p>
<p>
	The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was deployed in Canada, the United States, Europe, South America and South Africa.</p>
<p>
	"It was a double-blind study, meaning neither the patient, nor the team that ran the study, including me, knew whether the patient was taking the placebo or the drug," explained Tardif.</p>
<p>
	"There was just one group, independent from us, which was aware."</p>
<p>
	He said the team is "very proud of the work accomplished -- it is a clinically convincing result," adding that he assembled a spectacular team from all over Quebec including microbiologists, intensive care specialists, statisticians, computer scientists and epidemiologists.</p>
<p>
	The Centre de Coordination des Essais Cliniques de Montréal (MHICC) of the Montreal Heart Institute coordinated the study.</p>

    <p>Striking things about the figure below, which I got from <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/time-use">Our World in Data</a>, on time use:</p>
<ul>
  <li>People spend increasing time alone over their whole lives, with the exception of roughly their twenties. This surprises me a bit because it seems like people like spending time with other people, and I would expect them to increasingly succeed at it with experience and time to acquire partners and families and friends.</li>
  <li>From 31 to 45, people spend more time with children<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> on average than they spend with any other category of person, including for instance partners and colleagues.</li>
  <li>You might think all this children time would be substituting for some partner time, but as the children time swoops downward by three quarters, partner time stays about the same.</li>
  <li>People are at a relationship-time-steady-state between about thirty and sixty. I imagine that many people start relationships in that time, so does that mean that they also stop them at about the same rate, or gradually reduce time with their partners at a rate matching others’ forming of new relationships? Are people radically less likely to start relationships after about thirty?</li>
  <li>People spend broadly decreasing time with every group except their partner over time, from some early peak for each trend—in the teenage years for friends and family, and in the 20s and 30s for colleagues and children. I wonder how many people just like being alone and with their partners more than most other options, and steadily optimize for that, once they have been sociable enough to find a partner in their early years.</li>
  <li>Coworker time peaks at age 25-30 and goes slowly downward before the retirement descent. Is that from people dropping out of the workforce? Earning themselves a nice private office? Some difference between junior and senior roles?</li>
  <li>People spend fairly consistent time with their friends after a decline from 18 to 40. Retirement doesn’t increase it. Spending three hours a day fewer with children doesn’t increase it. I guess those things go to solitude.</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>If there is one thing that I have taken away from my 3 years studying CS at college, it’s that learning is not exclusively reserved for the lecture halls. In fact, I would argue that I have learned more by myself in my bedroom in the past 10 months than I have in the first 2 years of university.</p><p>There are several factors that went into this, but I want to focus on my experience doing research for both the computational brain lab and machine learning (ML) lab at my college. Before that, here’s a little background.</p><p>I breezed past the typical undergraduate CS courses and to be honest, I can’t say that I learned much more than I had for free online or that I could have in far less time for free online (do you see the pattern here?).</p><p>Learning what IEEE-754 floating point representation is was great and all, but something else caught my eye the winter of my sophomore year, ML. I started going through Andew Ng’s famous CS229 on coursera and was introduced to a whole new world with these interesting concepts. I quickly became obsessed. But at the same time, I stumbled upon the world of entrepreneurship and listened to countless founder stories of successful startups. My university classes became secondary to what I was teaching myself online and what I was consuming via podcasts and founder interviews on YouTube.</p><p>Now for those of you who are being swayed to skip out on university because of what I’ve said until now, please don’t take that as the main message. I am blessed to be able to attend a university and get this experience, and I will forever be grateful and remember these years of my life. What I do want to say though is that you will find much more fulfilment by proactively challenging yourself to find things which will satisfy your intellectual and/or creative desires beyond the lecture hall.</p><p>With my new found interest in ML, I scoured my university’s computer science website for things that an undergraduate student could do for more exposure to AI and ML. I came across the term research, which was obviously a term that I was familiar with but I did not know that the world of AI research was so vast, with its history going back as far as 1955. There were so many professors who were working on incredible things, so I hastily read a few of each of their publications and cold emailed close to 10 professors, each with a genuine interest in their work and desire to join their lab. 9 of them ghosted me, but 1 professor emailed me back saying that he wanted to meet the following day.</p><p>I had finally found an outlet where I could work on some more interesting things related to AI. Turns out, I had gotten far too ahead of myself. I was assigned to work on an interface for a robot head, which I happily worked on but quickly found to not be the kind of work I was looking for. Then covid-19 hit like a truck and all students and professors were sent home, and here we are now.</p><p>Covid didn’t stop my research group, and of course classes were still in session. I apologize for potentially sounding insensitive, but to be honest Covid brought a turning point in terms of research for me. I constantly started bugging a PhD student in my lab about what I could learn and work on during this time working remotely. After several back and forth emails, he offered a chance for me to work on an actual AI project to work towards a second author publication with him and one other lab mate.</p><p>Working on this publication quickly took all time away from me, and I loved it <i>at first</i>. The intellectual challenges that I faced in having to learn so many things on the fly fundamentally changed the way that I learn and I will forever be grateful that I learned how to learn during my time working on this project. Working with two other PhD students, we successfully submitted our project to a conference called CoRL and the work was accepted. Great! But I faced several realizations about the world of AI research, at least in academia.</p><p>I realized that research in AI was really cool and intellectually challenging, but I also realized that it took a very large amount of time away from both me and the PhD students in the lab. Deep down inside, I knew that I always wanted to start my own company, and I missed listening to and studying how other founders started their startups. I was passionate about building, but research had taken the time that I once spent listening to CEO interviews and podcasts away, not to mention time I once spent learning how to build software products. But the prestige and challenging nature of research and PhD students was compelling to me and it seemed like an easy route to respect from friends and family.</p><p>Amidst this internal conflict, I reached out to the ML lab at my college because it would be great to have another publication and potential recommendation letter for applying to PhD programs later on. I joined the ML lab November 2020 and worked on some very interesting things in probabilistic generative models and representation learning. The work that the lab was interested in was exactly what I had wanted to work on when I first fell in love with ML and AI. However, every day that went by reading a few papers a day, preparing for presentations on some of these papers, and going deeper still into the rabbit hole of ML research, my desire for making products and working on being an entrepreneur screamed louder and louder.</p><p>I took time to carefully reflect on what my desires were, and I found that all I desired was to live a life of continual learning and working on interesting problems. Research was a means by which I was gaining this for sure, but my opinion on research started to become exactly like what my opinion on classical lecture learning was; it was slow and I found that I could do things faster on my own. <i>Lightbulb</i> I realized that the bureaucracy of academic learning and research put ceilings over the potential that I believe I have. Only a month and a half later I contacted the&nbsp; professor of the ML lab that I wanted to work on my entrepreneurial dreams and that I could not commit to contributing to the lab any longer.</p><p>And here I am now, writing this blog to share my experiences with the people of the internet. Some of you may be wondering, do I regret giving up my chances of going to a prestigious PhD program and gaining the “elite” status of being an AI researcher at a top university lab? To be honest, I don’t have an answer for that explicitly, but I do know that the past month where I’ve been preparing to launch a startup with my cofounder and closest friend has been just as challenging and just as fulfilling, if not more, as my experience working with the computational brain lab and ML lab. The ceiling I once felt from university and research is nowhere to be seen, because the path to entrepreneurship is impossible to foresee. Everyone’s story of launching a successful startup is different, thus I live everyday in mystery just trying to get closer to my goal of working on challenging problems to help people live easier and happier lives. The path to being a researcher is quite established and oftentimes a rinse and repeat cycle. You do research in your undergraduate years and make strong relationships with your professors in hopes of getting strong recommendation letters for PhD programs, then you hopefully join a top 10 lab in the world and do research for 5-6 years before either doing a postdoc at a university or joining an industry lab. Then you work for the next few decades until you become a tenured professor at a nice university while still doing research and guiding younger researchers to push out publications for your lab. This sounds great for sure, but living in uncertainty sounds even greater to me. Even if I don’t gain a single ounce of respect or prestige that I could have from continuing to be a researcher, I will have no regrets because in the time that I live I know that I will be working on creating products and services to make the lives of people just like me easier. There is no ceiling to entrepreneurship. You control what your path is, and I’ve just started going along my path after taking a few detours.</p><p>I am by no means telling people to quit their dreams of pursuing research in AI, rather I am sharing the reason why I both joined and quit research in the field as an undergraduate student.</p></div></div></div>]]>

people like me to do <a href="https://www.thanassis.space/remotepower.html" target="_blank">crazy</a> things)</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p><span color="red"><b>Back:</b></span></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>USB-C</strong> for power (5V)</li>
<li>1x <strong>HDMI2.0</strong>, supporting up to 4K@60Hz</li>
<li>RJ45 10/100/1000 (i.e. <strong>Gigabit Ethernet</strong>)</li>

</ul>

<p>The SBC came with a power adapter, so I plugged it in, connected a Full-HD 
monitor to the HDMI port, and...</p>

<div>
<p><img src="https://www.thanassis.space/stationm1-welcome.jpg" alt="Default setup screen"></p><p>
<em>Default setup screen</em>
</p></div>

<p>After 5 minutes of configuration setup, I ended up with a fully operational
Android 10 set-top box experience; with the provided remote control allowing
easy control of the pre-installed Kodi.</p>

<p>But if you want to see an Android review of this SBC, you are on the wrong 
site :-)<br>
I have far more fun <a href="https://www.thanassis.space/android.html" target="_blank">hacking Android</a>
than I ever have using it.</p>

<p>So, to quote a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/EEVblog">famous electronics Youtuber</a>:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>"Don't turn it on! <strong>Take it apart!</strong>"</em></p>

<p>...and I'll add: <em>"...and then install a fully open-source OS, compiled from scratch"</em>.</p>

<p>Keep reading :-)</p>

<h2>Disassembly</h2>

<p>There are 4 screws holding the enclosure firmly in place. After removing them,
the insides of the SBC are easily accessible:</p>

<div>
<p><img src="https://www.thanassis.space/stationm1-disassembly.jpg" alt="Disassembled"></p><p>
<em>Disassembled.</em>
</p></div>

<p>As you can see, the Wi-Fi antenna is already pre-installed; the two chips 
giving my SBC 2GB of RAM are easily identifiable; and on the top, the
GPIO pins that make SBCs what they are - perfect toys for makers :-)</p>

<p>In case you are wondering, yes, that's a battery slot for an RTC.
I always use NTP, of course - but this is a nice perk for usage scenarios
where the SBC is not connected to the web.</p>

<p>In the case of the Station M1, the 3 pins shown in the picture below
form a 3.3V serial port, that speaks at 1500000 baud - in classic 8-N-1.
Any USB2TTL dongle that works with 3.3V levels will do nicely:</p>

<h2>The issue of SW - Armbian</h2>

<p>At a high level, there are basically two options with most ARM SBCs <em>(including this one)</em>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Either you trust the makers of the board with the custom
distributions they build (including Android ones).<br></li>
<li>Or you trust <a target="_blank" href="https://www.armbian.com/">Armbian</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am firmly in the second camp. I don't know where the makers of the Station M1
stand on the subject, but as a rule, SBC builders rarely - if ever - update
their custom distros. I can't abide by that.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="https://docs.armbian.com/Developer-Guide_Using-Vagrant/">
I therefore prefer building the entire, flashable Armbian distribution for my targets myself - from source</a>.
There is no better way to trust my SBCs, than knowing that I built their OS myself;
and that I can go as deep as I want and debug everything using the source code...
From the deepest dungeon at kernel level, all the way to the top-level bash scripts. </p>

<p>Then again, I do this sort of thing <a href="https://www.thanassis.space/cv.pdf">for a living</a>. Your mileage may vary.</p>

<p>If you do decide to build from sources, the board is marked in the Armbian
<a href="https://github.com/armbian/build/blob/master/config/boards/station-m1.csc">repo</a>
as CSC - so you need to enable the CSC option during the build, and then
choose "Station M1". Other than that, everything just worked;
building went just as smoothly as any other flashable Armbian image I've compiled:</p>

<div>
<pre><tt><span>$ git clone https</span><span>:</span><span>//github</span><span>.</span><span>com/armbian/build</span><span>/</span>
<span>$ cd build</span>
<span>$ sudo </span><span>.</span><span>/compile</span><span>.</span><span>sh</span>
</tt></pre>
</div>

<p>Since it takes some time to do this build, I performed it from an Ubuntu-Focal
Droplet that I created in my Digital Ocean account. At a cost of 3 cents per hour
and a total build time of approximately 3h, I paid 10 cents to have fully traceable
SW for my SBC.</p>

<p>Not bad :-)</p>

<p>Another option you have is to trust completely the Armbian developers - and simply
download the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.armbian.com/station-m1/">pre-built image</a>.</p>

<p>In either case, you then "flash" the image in any micro SD card.
In my case, I executed something like this:</p>

<pre><code># ls -l *img
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1816133632 Jan 20 20:06
    Armbian_21.02.0-trunk_Station-m1_bullseye_current_5.10.9.img

# dd if=Armbian_21.02.0-trunk_Station-m1_bullseye_current_5.10.9.img
    bs=1M oflag=sync iflag=fullblock status=progress of=/dev/sdc
</code></pre>

<p>When running this command, my Micro-SD card was inside a USB adapter plugged-in and visible under /dev/sdc.
Make sure you use the appropriate target here, <strong>otherwise you will wipe out your own machine's
data!</strong> The output of <code>dmesg</code> is your friend - look at it <em>(as well as the output
of <code>lsblk</code>)</em> to see the name of the device for your SD writer.</p>

<p>The <code>sync</code> output flag of <code>dd</code> caused a significant improvement in reliability with
my SD writer. You may or may not need this option - but if you don't use it,
make sure you actually invoke <code>sync</code> after <code>dd</code> is complete. And you will definitely
benefit from a big block size (<code>bs=1M</code>) and a nice and simple progress report
while the writing takes place (<code>status=progress</code>). </p>

<p>Most importantly: don't you dare remove the <code>fullblock</code> iflag. Trust me on
this - you need it.</p>

<h2>Booting Armbian</h2>

<p>After that, I plugged the Micro-SD card in the Station M1, and booted - in a 
normal, Armbian boot. I didn't use my USB-to-TTL adapter this time; the HDMI
cable offered a far easier way to interact with the boot process - and a
keyboard plugged in the USB2 port allowed me to easily work with the system.</p>

<p>I then connected the SBC directly to my router (over the Gigabit Ethernet
port), setup SSH, rebooted, and SSH-ed into the machine from my laptop.</p>

<p>Since I hate the speed and reliability aspects of Micro-SD cards, I then
proceeded to migrate into an external USB3 drive. I can probably migrate into
the EMMC, but I chose not to - I prefer to keep it in its pristine
("Android-y") state, for easy re-use when COVID allows me to visit people
again. A credit-card sized, portable set-top box is always nice :-)</p>

<p>To migrate to the external drive, I copied everything in the root fs into a
freshly formatted 5GB ext partition. The rest of the drive was formatted as
a LUKS-encrypted drive, which will take advantage of the crypto instructions
in this SBCs ARM cores.</p>

<p>I then modified two files in the SD-card filesystem to make the system boot
from the USB drive instead:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <code>/boot/armbianEnv.txt</code> needs to know where the root fs lives:</li>
</ul>

<div>
<pre><tt>
<span>verbosity</span><span>=</span><span>1</span>
<span>bootlogo</span><span>=</span><span>false</span>
<span>overlay_prefix</span><span>=</span><span>rockchip</span>
<span>fdtfile</span><span>=</span><span>rockchip/rk</span><span>3328</span><span>-roc-pc</span><span>.</span><span>dtb</span>
<span>rootdev</span><span>=</span><span>UUID</span><span>=........</span><span>-</span><span>....</span><span>-</span><span>....</span><span>-</span><span>....</span><span>-</span><span>............</span>
</tt></pre>
</div>

<p>The device UUID is easily obtainable via <code>blkid -c /dev/null</code>.</p>

<ul>
<li>The <code>/etc/fstab</code> should also point to the proper root.
So the proper UUID needs to appear there:</li>
</ul>

<div>
<pre><tt>
<span>UUID</span><span>=...</span><span> </span><span>/</span><span> ext4 defaults</span><span>...</span>
</tt></pre>
</div>

<p>That's it - the SBC now works from reliable, fast storage.</p>

<h2>How fast is it, with USB3 storage?</h2>

<p>Well, don't take my word for it - let's watch it in action:</p>

<center>
<a href="https://asciinema.org/a/386483" target="_blank"><img src="https://asciinema.org/a/386483.svg"></a>
</center>

<p>What you can see in this <em>asciinema</em> video:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>This (110MB+ per second) is the same speed I have seen with this mechanical
external USB3 drive on any of my computers (including PCs). No slowdowns in
the Station M1.</p></li>
<li><p>Did you notice the temperature of 37C? This is my coolest SBC yet...
The metal enclosure and the thermal pad it uses to attach on the SoC perform
their work admirably.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Benchmarking CPU performance</h2>

<p>OK, but what if we stress the machine? Let's benchmark the device with my <a href="https://www.thanassis.space/renderer.html">renderer</a>.</p>

<pre><code># apt install libsdl1.2-dev
...
# wget -q -O - https://github.com/ttsiodras/renderer/archive/v2.3b.tar.gz \
    | tar zxvf -
# cd renderer-2.3b
# ./configure
# make -j4
...
# make bench
</code></pre>

<p>My renderer uses all available cores, and stresses the memory and the FPU a lot <a href="#renderer">[1]</a>.
You can see results from all kinds of machines running it via the <a href="https://openbenchmarking.org/test/pts/ttsiod-renderer#metrics">Phoronix</a>
test suite.</p>

<p>For completeness, I include the results from all my ARM SBCs - so you can compare
for yourself.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Raspberry PI2</strong>: it reached 58C - and scored 17fps...</li>
</ul>

<div>
<pre><tt><span>Average value</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>17.306140</span>
<span>Std deviation</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>0.199651</span>
<span>       Median</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>17.401600</span>

<span>          Max</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>17.479500</span>
</tt></pre>
</div>

<ul>
<li><strong>Orange PI Zero</strong>: It scored 21 frames per second and its temperature rose above 80C.
That forced me to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thanassis.space/thebeast.html#thebeast">install a fan to keep it cool</a>...</li>
</ul>

<div>
<pre><tt><span>Average value</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>21.027340</span>
<span>Std deviation</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>0.037930</span>
<span>       Median</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>21.017200</span>
<span>          Min</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>20.979300</span>
<span>          Max</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>21.082800</span>
</tt></pre>
</div>

<ul>
<li><strong>ROCK PI S</strong> scored 28fps, with a temperature that reached 76C:</li>
</ul>

<div>
<pre><tt><span>Average value</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>28.139440</span>
<span>Std deviation</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>0.084740</span>
<span>       Median</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>28.153200</span>
<span>          Min</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>28.003400</span>
<span>          Max</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>28.227900</span>
</tt></pre>
</div>

<ul>
<li><strong>Station M1</strong>: Let's watch the newcomer live:</li>
</ul>

<center>
<a href="https://asciinema.org/a/386492" target="_blank"><img src="https://asciinema.org/a/386492.svg"></a>
</center>

<p>The Station M1 scored 32.7 fps. It never exceeded 1.3GHz while doing so,
  which makes me think there's more potential here - the Armbian defaults
  can probably be bumped up. Not that I need more horsepower <em>(it offers
  more than what I need)</em> but it's still nice to know there's room to grow.</p>

<p>Also, very importantly - notice that even though we stressed the machine to
  an extreme - all cores fully utilised <em>(see second run with <code>top</code> in the
  first <code>tmux</code> pane for confirmation)</em> the temperature <strong>never went above 53C</strong>.</p>

<p>The enclosure barely felt warm during the test; nothing even remotely concerning.
  From a thermal perspective, amongst all my ARM SBCs, this is the one I trust the most.</p>

<h2>Network</h2>

<p>Is it truly a Gigabit device?</p>

<p>Well, the best way to confirm it, is to use another <a href="https://www.thanassis.space/atomicpi.html">machine</a>
on the same Gigabit network, to send/receive data and benchmark via <code>iperf3</code>.</p>

<p>Again, let's see it done live:</p>

<center>
<a href="https://asciinema.org/a/386494" target="_blank"><img src="https://asciinema.org/a/386494.svg"></a>
</center>

<p>That looks like Gigabit to me :-)</p>

<h2>Power consumption</h2>

<p>OK - so we know this is a more than fast enough SBC, with fast USB3
storage and Gigabit networking. But how does it fare in terms of
power consumption?</p>

<p>I revert the configuration to a …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">                                   
                    <p>A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-03160-0">new study</a> published Jan. 21 in Nature by Katrin Andreasson and Paras Minhas, suggests that cognitive aging is not irrevocable, but can be reversed by reprogramming glucose metabolism in myeloid cells.</p>

<p>Biologists have long hypothesized that reducing inflammation may slow down the aging process and delay the onset of age-associated diseases, such as heart disease, Alzheimer's disease, cancer and the frailty that concerns each of us during our aging.
Yet, the question of exactly what causes these inflammatory reactions of the immune system had not found a definitive answer.</p>

<p><strong>Diseases concerned</strong></p>

<p>A long-standing observation in epidemiological studies of aging populations has been that NSAIDs, which inhibit the production of cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and COX-2 and prostaglandin (PG), prevent the development of the disease. Alzheimer's.</p>

<p>Model ALS mice and patients with sporadic ALS have increased levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). In addition, levels of microsomal proteins PGE synthase-1 and cyclooxygenase-2, which catalyze PGE2 biosynthesis, are <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27140190/">dramatically increased in the spinal cord mice model of ALS </a>.</p>

<p>Preclinical studies suggest that prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is an essential inflammatory mediator of brain damage via the activation of four G protein coupled receptors, namely EP1-EP4.</p>

<p>Transient inhibition of the EP2 receptor by antagonists permeable to the blood-brain barrier shows marked anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects in several rodent models of epilepsy, without, however, having a noticeable effect on seizures per se.</p>

<p>In the brain, microglia lose the ability to remove misfolded proteins associated with neurodegeneration.</p>

<p><strong>Prostaglandin and myeloid cells</strong></p>

<p>Prostaglandins are one of the main mediators of inflammation which play an important role in improving neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative processes. Myeloid cells are the main source of PGE2, a hormone belonging to the prostaglandin family. Prostaglandins are a group of physiologically active lipid compounds derived from arachidonic acid.</p>

<p>Arachidonic acid is one of the most abundant fatty acids in the brain (10% of its fatty acid content). Among other things, it helps protect the brain from oxidative stress by activating the gamma receptor activated by peroxisome proliferators.</p>

<p>One type of receiver for PGE2 is EP2. This receptor is found on immune cells and is particularly abundant on myeloid cells. It initiates inflammatory activity inside cells after receiving PGE2.</p>

<p><strong>Myeloid and macrophages</strong></p>

<p>Myeloid cells are distinguished from lymphocytes.
Monocytes, a type of myeloid cell, and their macrophages and dendritic cell descendants perform three main functions in the immune system. These are phagocytosis, antigen presentation and cytokine production.</p>

<p>Macrophages engulf and digest cell debris, foreign substances, microbes, cancer cells, and anything that does not have the type of proteins specific to healthy cells in the body on its surface.
The first author of the study, Paras Minhas, initially isolated monocytes from blood donated by healthy people under the age of 35 or over 65. Scientists also looked at macrophages from young mice compared to old mice.</p>

<p>During aging, functional changes are due to macrophages. Microglia residing in the brains of aged mice increase their soma volume but reduce the length of their processes, limiting their ability to interact and support neuron survival.</p>

<p>Macrophages can undergo "training" after re-exposure to a stimulus.
Recent studies have described that the induced immunity in young mice leads to an increase in myeloid lineage cells and can occur in myeloid precursors in the bone marrow.
As we age, a similar shift towards a myeloid cell line occurs, and the aging microenvironment may also have a ripple effect.</p>

<p><strong>Effects of a significant increase in PGE2 levels</strong></p>

<p>The authors observed that older macrophages from mice and humans not only produced significantly more PGE2 than in younger subjects, but also had a much higher number of EP2 on their surface. Andreasson and his colleagues also confirmed significant increases significant levels of PGE2 in the blood and brain of old mice.
The researchers found that in aging macrophages and microglia, PGE2 signaling through its EP2 receptor promotes the sequestration of glucose into glycogen, reducing glucose flow and mitochondrial respiration.</p>

<p>The dramatically increased PGE2-EP2 binding in elderly myeloid cells alters energy production in these myeloid cells by inducing them to store glucose, rather than fueling energy production in the cell.
Cells store glucose by converting this energy source into long chains of glucose called glycogen (the animal equivalent of starch).</p>

<p>This build-up creates a state of chronic exhaustion (stress) in the cells, which leads them to express inflammatory signals.
Not only have aging macrophage cells found it difficult to burn glucose, they also don't use other sources of energy for respiration. Young macrophage cells were better able to utilize lactate and pyruvate.</p>

<p><strong>An apparent rejuvenation?</strong></p>

<p>The authors deleted EP2 in transgenic mice, which halved the amounts of receptors. Macrophages from 20 month old EP2-deficient mice maintained normal cellular respiration and glycolysis. In control animals of the same age, macrophage function deteriorated with age.
Cells from control animals secreted pro-inflammatory factors, were poorly phagocytosed, and had fewer and poorly formed mitochondria. Macrophages deficient in EP2, on the other hand, had none of these problems, behaving like those of young mice.</p>

<p>Scientists gave mice one or both of two experimental drugs known to interfere with PGE2-EP2 binding in animals for a month. They also incubated cultured mouse and human macrophages with these substances. In doing so, the old myeloid cells metabolized glucose just like the young myeloid cells, reversing the inflammatory character of the old cells.</p>

<p>More strikingly, the drugs reversed the cognitive decline associated with the age of mice. Indeed, the old mice who received them performed recall and spatial navigation tests as well as the young adult mice. Blocking peripheral myeloid EP2 signaling is therefore sufficient to restore cognition in aged mice.</p>

<p>The blood-brain barrier EP2 inhibitor C52 improved glycogen synthesis, improved glycolytic response and TCA cycling of myeloid cells (microglia and peripheral macrophages), and improved cognitive performance.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, mice reaped these cognitive benefits even when treated with an EP2 inhibitor (PF-04418948) that does not cross the blood-brain barrier.</p>

<p><strong>Towards drugs?</strong></p>

<p>Since activation of the EP2 receptor has been identified as a common culprit in several neurological conditions associated with inflammation, such as stroke and neurodegenerative disease, selective small molecule antagonists targeting EP2 are being developed. to suppress PGE2-mediated neuroinflammation.</p>

<p>Several companies manufacture selective EP2 antagonists, but none are approved for human use. Pfizer's PF-04418948 was tested for safety in a Phase 1 study in 2010, but the company has discontinued clinical development.</p>

<p>However, targeting EP2 could be complicated. The receptor is known to regulate blood flow and blood pressure, and has been shown to protect the brain during stroke.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><img src="http://alexanderganderson.github.io/static/img/indeterminism.png" alt="two_times_three"></p>

<p>Two times three equals six or at least that’s what I naively expected.</p>

<p>It is well-known that floating point matrix multiplication can result in a variety of <a href="https://developer.download.nvidia.com/video/gputechconf/gtc/2019/presentation/s9911-determinism-in-deep-learning.pdf">surprises</a>.
But did you know that quantized neural networks are not deterministic as well?
A quantized neural network uses integers to
multiply weights and activations in a neural network.
Thus, the naive logic goes, two and three represented and multiplied as integers should always give the exact same result,
namely six.</p>

<p>However, according to the <a href="https://source.android.com/devices/neural-networks#validation">Android NNAPI Driver Validation</a> documentation, a
driver is valid if multiplication of quantized tensors is within plus or minus
one bit.</p>



<p>The non-determinism of quantized multiplication is a result of optimizing for
the most common neural network deployment use cases.  Neural networks used for
classification and detection generally work well with small amounts of
non-determinism due to the nature of the mathematical operations involved in
<a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1IDRdeCW">neural networks</a>. Furthermore, such networks often benefit from training with
some noise (e.g. batch normalization). Likewise, the input to many neural
networks comes from a camera that generates inherently variable images.</p>

<p>The main challenge associated with neural network deployment on the phone
is creating models that are sufficiently fast, power friendly, and small on
disk. Quantizing a neural network helps one improve in all of these categories.
Quantized weights take up less space on disk, take less energy to transfer, and
can be moved more quickly between different levels of memory.</p>

<p>The last issue at play is that it is much cheaper (both in terms of computing
cost and engineering effort) to quantize a pre-trained model than to train an
existing model from scratch. Consequently, the method developed in this
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05877">Integer Inference</a> paper
targets quantizing existing models. The key idea is that a floating point
value can be approximated as a scale times a quantized value minus a zero
point. (Also take a look at the <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/quantization_spec">Tensorflow Quantization Spec</a>).
The scale and zero point can be chosen relatively easily by, for
instance, looking at the
range of the weights and activations when evaluating the model on a number of
representative inputs.</p>

<p>The loss in predictive performance due to quantization in many practical use cases is
small and this abstraction is widely implemented and baked into hardware,
for instance, by Qualcomm’ <a href="https://developer.qualcomm.com/docs/snpe/quantized_models.html">Snapdragon Neural Processing Engine SDK</a>.
[Strictly speaking, the drivers for this hardware could be
changed to ensure determinism, but that may result in a significant loss in
speed at inference time.]
The SNPE was developed and subsequently, Android sought to simplify the process
of deploying neural networks given the wide variety of available
accelerators. The restrictions on the driver tests were relaxed after pushback from
chip manufacturers whose hardware and drivers did not produce deterministic
quantized math.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the NN API off by at most 1 (or 3 for a larger network) leaves a
lot of room for funny business that can change the results by small amounts.
The hardware and driver vendors want to produce fast times and low energy
usage numbers on
various neural network benchmarks and are less concerned about reproducibility.
This can lead to unexpected changes in neural network outputs.
For instance, the zero point or scale of the
weights might be changed for some reason by the hardware, and the quantized
values are then recomputed. Another thing that can happen is that the range might
be slightly shifted to make zero exactly representable (see Case 3: Inputs are
both negative and positive in the <a href="https://developer.qualcomm.com/docs/snpe/quantized_models.html">Snapdragon Neural Processing Engine SDK</a>).
Likewise, as the off by one error bound is on a per layer basis, larger
networks generate accumulating error. Practically speaking, the error bound is
increased to three for mobilenet in the NN API driver validation tests. Other
networks could produce larger errors.</p>



<p>The lack of determinism for quantized neural networks touches on the broader
issue of cross platform reproducibility and performance optimization for neural networks.
As the neural networks get deployed more and more widely, these issues will grow in importance.</p>

<p>The first major issue is that if you want to deploy a neural network across
many platforms, you don’t have any guarantees that you are going to get the
same results.
Even if you manage to assemble a large team to test your networks on many
different platforms, the problem isn’t solved.
<em>The lack of determinism means that even if you test your network
on every platform, a driver update may unexpectedly change your results</em>.
This creates an ongoing engineering cost beyond the initial fixed cost of
validating the deployment on existing hardware.</p>

<p>The next major issue is that some application areas have more stringent
standards in terms of reproducibility and auditability. Suppose that a neural
network is used in a self-driving car that gets in an accident. For auditing
purposes, it is important to be able to replay the decisions made by the car’s
control system exactly. In the best case, this requires a significant
engineering effort to keep track of all of the driver versions and internal
testing to verify reproducibility for any deployment.</p>

<p>The final issue is that while classification and detection are not particularly
sensitive to small changes in output, the lack of determinism makes it more
challenging to deploy neural network models which are deeper or more sensitive to
changes.  For instance, imagine a language model that is unrolled over many
iterations to parse or generate a sentence. In that case, accumulating errors
could cause unexpected results.</p>



<p>In the past couple years, there has been an explosion of experimentation in
neural network deployment from software frameworks to hardware
accelerators.  As the field matures, questions about best practices will slowly
be answered. The ability to <em>train once, deploy anywhere</em> will become easier
and easier. In the particular case of determinism, the most reasonable next
step is to have a driver test that ensures determinism and publish a list of
vendors that implement a deterministic API.</p>

<p>The question of determinism is only one small part of the puzzle of being able
to deploy anywhere. Another subtle but important issue is that different
operations will run faster on different hardware. Even if a network can deploy
anywhere in a reproducible manner, an even more fundamental issue is whether
or not a network will be fast and power efficient on any platform. Indeed, while there
has been a great amount of progress in the field of neural network
deployment, there is much to be done to make the ecosystem easier to use and
more mature.</p>

January 23, 2021 | https://www.politico.eu/article/whatsapp-privacy-fine-data-protection-europe-50-million/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.politico.eu/article/whatsapp-privacy-fine-data-protection-europe-50-million/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
									<p>Facebook-owned messaging app WhatsApp could be fined up to €50 million over violations of the European Union's data protection rules, according to three people with direct knowledge of the procedure who spoke with POLITICO.</p>
<p>The preliminary penalty — the figure is now under consultation with the bloc's other data protection agencies — would be one of the largest-ever fines under the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, a set of privacy rules that came into force in 2018. </p>
<p>As part of Ireland's draft findings, the internet messenger may face a fine of between €30 million and €50 million for not living up to transparency requirements under Europe's privacy regime. Whatsapp could also be required to change how it handles its users' data, as the case relates to how the messenger may have failed to properly inform its EU users about how it would share their data with Facebook.</p>

<p>France's privacy authority <a href="https://www.cnil.fr/en/cnils-restricted-committee-imposes-financial-penalty-50-million-euros-against-google-llc" target="_blank">has fined</a> Google €50 million for separate privacy violations, while Ireland's Data Protection Commission, which has regulatory authority over Facebook, recently <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/irish-data-regulator-fines-twitter-e450000/">issued</a> a €450,000 penalty against Twitter. That represented its first levy against any Silicon Valley company, many of which fall under Dublin's jurisdiction because these firms are legally domiciled in Ireland, mostly for tax reasons.</p>
<p>The multi-million euro draft WhatsApp fine is an initial proposal from Dublin, and has been opened up to other European data protection agencies for their feedback. A final decision on how big the fine should be — and what other remedies WhatsApp should agree to — is not expected until later in the year.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Ireland's Data Protection Commissioner declined to comment. A spokesman for WhatsApp said the company was awaiting the final privacy decision.</p>
<p>In November, Facebook&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1521035">earmarked €77.5 million&nbsp;for a likely privacy fine against its messaging service WhatsApp,&nbsp;</a>which, unlike Instagram, is a separate legal entity in Ireland and therefore has its own set of financial records. The Irish data protection agency is conducting a separate investigation into whether WhatsApp can legally share its users' data with Facebook's other digital services, among other privacy-related concerns.</p>
<p>The draft penalty against WhatsApp, which Ireland <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1577539">submitted</a> to other EU agencies for review just before Christmas, comes as the messenger faces a global backlash over planned updates to its terms and conditions. Those include&nbsp;clarifying to its billions of users how their data is shared more widely with Facebook's other services.</p>
<p>Those changes will not affect WhatsApp European operations, but people across the bloc and elsewhere still have flocked to rivals like Signal because of privacy fears. On January 15, the messenger <a href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/giving-more-time-for-our-recent-update" target="_blank">said</a> it was delaying the upcoming privacy changes, in part because of the confusion generated by the proposed overhaul.</p>

<p>Johannes Caspar, Hamburg's privacy regulator who filed objections to a previous Irish decision against Twitter, told POLITICO earlier this week that he<a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1579886"> had not ruled out </a>doing the same in the WhatsApp case. </p>
<p>"WhatsApp has an enormous amount of users," he said. "It must be clear that the consent mechanism they use must be lawful and that consent is informed and freely given by the users."</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Lately, there’s been renewed interest in clean, simple technology

the chaos of the web. Hardware hackers fit screens in

these many awesome projects is the <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://remarkable.com/">reMarkable 2</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve been using the reMarkable for the past month or so and it is a
seriously solid device. I use it mainly to take notes, at which it
excels. The e-ink display is the best I have ever seen, barely ever
refreshing the entire screen and almost entirely without the temporary
artifacts that plague similar devices. The pencil is comfortable to
use – slightly fuzzy – and, interestingly, entirely passive: it never
needs to charge. Given that it’s meant to replace your paper, it
shouldn’t be too surprising that the tablet’s also incredibly thin.</p>
<h2 id="cornellnotes"><a href="#cornellnotes" aria-label="Anchor link for: cornellnotes">##
</a>
cornellNotes</h2>
<p>In one of my classes, I’m required to take Cornell notes. On what may
be a related note, it’s a terrible class. Regardless, I need to get an
A and so notes I shall take. The reMarkable comes with a built-in
Cornell notes template. It’s slightly different than the format I’m
used to, but it fits the bill well enough.</p>
<p>It’s hard to describe the experience of using the device. I would
say that it feels shockingly natural. Using it to take notes feels
like writing on a clipboard with none of the usual annoyances – the
paper sliding, having finite pages; and all the benefits of a digital
device – sending files via email, OCR, a select-and-drag tool, etc.
It’s convenient, feels nice, and performs well. Most importantly, it
makes me <em>excited</em> to use it every time I turn it on.</p>
<h2 id="worksheet"><a href="#worksheet" aria-label="Anchor link for: worksheet">##
</a>
workSheet</h2>
<p>In another class, the instructor distributes worksheets every once in
a while to complete during class. Now that we’re in distance learning
due to COVID, these are <code>pdf</code>s – perfect for use with the reMarkable.</p>
<p>I download them onto my laptop, upload them through the app, and
voila. Look Mom, no scratch paper! I can write directly on the
worksheet. I’ve only started doing it this week, and it’s amazing.
Sure, there are programs on the computer that allow you to write
on a <code>pdf</code>, but doing math with a trackpad sounds like torture. With
the reMarkable, it’s enjoyable.</p>
<p>That’s the device’s biggest impact. I used to hate writing by hand.
I would beg my teachers to let me type assignments so I didn’t have
to use a pencil – what am I, a caveman? Now, my paper has superpowers.</p>
<h2 id="notkindle"><a href="#notkindle" aria-label="Anchor link for: notkindle">##
</a>
notKindle</h2>
<p>It’s also a suprisingly good reading device, with native support for
<code>epub</code>s and <code>pdf</code>s. It doesn’t have a backlight, but to be fair
neither do actual books so I’m not too bothered. The default font size
is quite large, and the UI is really minimal which makes for peaceful,
undistracted reading. I own two Kindles already, but I’ve taken to
using the reMarkable instead for a number of reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>There’s no ads or tracking. On Kindle there’s an ad on the bottom
of the homescreen, which expands to the whole screen when you turn it
off – plus it sends every move you make to live forever with Big Papa
Bezos. Not so with the reMarkable.</li>
<li>The screen on the reMarkable is physically larger. Though sometimes
the compact size of my Kindle comes in handy, like when traveling,
having a nice big display is definitely an advantage. My Kindle is
closer to a large phone, and the reMarkable is definitely a tablet.</li>
<li>The reMarkable is a fairly open device. The Kindle, on the other
hand, is locked down and dripping with DRM (fairly easy to break but
still an encumberance).</li>
</ol>
<p>The developers have also made a browser extension for Chromium-based
browsers called <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/read-on-remarkable/bfhkfdnddlhfippjbflipboognpdpoeh">Read on reMarkable</a>, which I would love to see
the insides of but is unfortunately closed-source. Basically, it takes
any webpage, turns it into an <code>epub</code>, and sends it off to your device.
I love it and use it near constantly: whenever I run into anything on
HN that is either really long, or I just want to save for later, I
hit a button and it sends it to the tablet. Again, just incredibly
convenient.</p>
<h2 id="jailbreak"><a href="#jailbreak" aria-label="Anchor link for: jailbreak">##
</a>
jailBreak</h2>
<p>This section is titled “jailbreak,” which is actually a bit of
misnomer because the reMarkable runs Linux and you can <code>ssh</code> into it
with ease. It’s also not too fitting because I’m not just going to
talk about modifying the device, but also about official accessories.
My device came with a <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://remarkable.com/store/remarkable-2/folios">Book Folio</a> and <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://remarkable.com/store/remarkable-2/markers">Marker</a> in the
box, which is pretty good value. I did find out while writing this
that they offer a “Marker Plus” that comes with a built-in eraser. It
is, unfortunately, out of stock currently but I plan on buying it once
it returns in “January 2021,” so supposedly sometime in the next week
or so.</p>
<p>Ok now time for the jailbreak-y stuff. There’s an active community on
Freenode, an unofficial <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://remarkablewiki.com/">wiki</a>, and an <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/reHackable/awesome-reMarkable">Awesome list</a>.
All of these are really great resources for cool stuff you can do with
your device, and I’m planning to begin experimenting with them in the
coming weeks. My first goal is to get <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/koreader/koreader">KOReader</a> running so I
can sync my extensive Calibre library to the device. I’m going to
avoid adding any <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/reHackable/awesome-reMarkable#games">games</a> so as not to add additional complexity
to a device that aims to remove distractions, and proceed slowly so I
don’t brick my fancy new toy. Stick around to see how that goes.</p>
<h2 id="ps"><a href="#ps" aria-label="Anchor link for: ps">##
</a>
pS</h2>
<p>The recently published fairly viral <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://surma.dev/things/ditherpunk/index.html">Ditherpunk article</a>
by <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://surma.dev/">Surma</a> gives a really interesting overview of image
dithering. After reading the article, I noticed that the reMarkable
itself uses dithering to “fade off” your writing and make it look
like pencil. Neat.</p>
<p>Also, comparing the reMarkable to the Kindle makes me want to
jailbreak that too – I’ll find some time to look into that soon.</p>

may well be incorrect); only the marginal notes are new.</span></p><p>The sender’s name was in all-upper-case, and the subject
line read, “Not exactly...”.</p><p>Spam.</p><p>But I’m glad I opened it anyway. “This is not exactly your
normal query...”, the message
body began. It was from an upstanding citizen at the NASA
Johnson Space Center, asking
for... the Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) for
DrScheme<span><span><span>Now <a href="https://www.drracket.org/">DrRacket</a>.</span></span></span>, a Scheme programming environment I
helped develop.</p><p>The what for what?!?</p><p>It transpires that a tasteful astronaut (name withheld to protect the innocent) had loaded
DrScheme on his laptop for use during his free
time in space.<span><span><span>Turns out he was working through <span><a href="https://htdp.org/">How to Design Programs</a></span>.</span></span></span>
He was (a) going to be on the International Space Station (ISS) and (b) launching a
hard drive image from Russia. The ISS is a multinational enterprise and Russia is, well, another
country, so the act of sending software in both instances involves an export. Both, consequently,
need an ECCN. (I wonder if there is some tacit assumption here that outer space, or at least the ISS,
is a foreign land. I wonder if there isn’t some
group squirreled away trying to determine the
equivalent of nautical limits in space.)</p><p>The US government does a remarkably good job
of publishing documents on the Web; anyone
who’s had to deal with the IRS or the lucky few
who’ve had to contend with the INS will grudgingly admit this. These are sometimes no more
than OCR-scanned copies, but the scanning yields
enough clarity that Google can find the documents. I can’t begin to imagine what this process
must have been like ten years ago. (Probably a lot
simpler: I’d have written off for an official document, then returned to my regularly scheduled
work.)</p><p>Anyway, accessing prose is not the same as understanding it. The second paragraph of the first document I read began “The CCL is contained in
Supplement No. 1 to part 774 of the EAR.”</p><p>It was going to be that kind of day.</p><p>I have some layman’s thoughts about such prose.
It doesn’t look like natural language at all. I conjecture it’s because natural language is rife with
anaphoric references. Letting context and a rich
language of reference “do the talking” leads to
higher communication bandwidth, but it’s hell on
disjointed documents.... But this is beginning to
read like one of Eugene’s<span><span><span>That would be natural-language processing maestro
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Charniak">Eugene Charniak</a>, who had a regular column in <span>conduit!</span> that was
the inspiration for mine.</span></span></span> articles, so I should stop
this digression now.</p><p>The ECCN system is quite simple once you get
the hang of it. Numerous artifacts, from nuclear to
software, are given codes such as 14D993. These
codes determine the range of permitted distribution and the licensing demands on those who wish
to acquire them. Everything else is assigned the
default code EAR99, sometimes designated NLR
(No License Required). So it’s simply a matter of
reading enough documentation, slotting your
product, and finding a code. This is a bit like saying that feeding your pet octopus is simply a matter of pulling aside the arms, placing the food in
the middle, then retracting your limb. Easily done,
but you may lose an organ or two getting the hang
of it.</p><p>Reading these documents was not without its rewards. I discovered, for instance, that EAR 740.13
(d) (3) (ii) (A) differs from EAR 774 Supplement
No. 2 (2) (a), though they describe the same thing.
The former document is dated later, yet leaves out
a key provision included in the latter, the recognition that software may be sold electronically! Better still, I found that ECCN category 14D993
specifically restricts the export of “program”
proof and validation “software” using mathematical and analytical techniques and designed or
modified for “programs” having more than
500,000 “source code” instructions. Beware, all
you verification researchers—don’t get too ambitious!</p><p>Having done my research, I determined that we
fall under License Exception TSU (Technology
and Software — Unrestricted), though it all gets a
bit sketchy here because our software is not specifically sold. (The concept of free software
doesn’t seem to be in the ECCN vocabulary.
Cheap political crack omitted here.) This didn’t
necessarily mean we were EAR99, and EAR99 is
an ECCN, whereas TSU isn’t, and NASA had
asked for an ECCN. Mustering great courage, I
called the encouragingly named Outeach and Educational Services Division of the US Commerce
Department. After only a few minutes, I was connected to a gruff counselor.</p><p>“Can I help you?”</p><p>“Ah, yes, I was hoping to get a quick clarification
on an ECCN classification.”</p><p>(gruffer still) “Yes?”</p><p>(deep breath) “If I find that my product falls under
License Exception TSU under part 774 of the
EAR, can I assume it has the ECCN of EAR99?”</p><p>I believe I did this without inhaling.</p><p>These are the moments that test the mettle of great
men. Like Major Major’s father, my counselor
was made of stern stuff. He paused for just a moment, just long enough to
accord respect to someone he clearly perceived to be a fellow numbers-and-policy wonk. And then, in a voice rich in
cameraderie, he said, “You know, I’ve been trying
to determine that for five years myself!”</p><p>Being excepted from a license was not the same as
not requiring a license? In the logic of the US government, did the Law of the Excluded Middle not
apply? What was the difference between the two?</p><p>Syria.</p><p>No, seriously. The difference really is Syria. TSU
permits export to Syria, but EAR99 does not.</p><p>My counselor told me this with glee. Apparently I
had hit on one of his favorite trivia questions, because, now really warming to the topic, he informed me that he had asked this very question of
many of his colleagues. Some had incorrectly
identified the two; others, quicker on the draw,
had said that they were indeed different but had
recommended the use of ECCN 4D994. As everyone knows — shucks, by this point even I knew —
this was a contemptible response, because 4D994
permits the export of only specific software products. And so on.</p><p>Anyway, this story has a happy ending. We appear
to meet EAR99. NASA Johnson has acknowledged receipt of our ECCN. I’ve been in touch
with the fine astronaut. DrScheme will soon be
happily beta-v-cs-reducing expressions in outer
space.</p><p>Where has your programming language been today?</p></div></div></div>]]>

        </p>

  <h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<p>Terraform is great; I provide a Terraform recipe that’s easy to get started with, along with some things I learned along the way.</p>

<h2 id="intended-audience">Intended Audience</h2>
<p>Software developers who are interested in trying out Terraform to manage cloud infrastructure.</p>

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>Until recently, my old web property languished on a past end-of-life Rails Heroku stack. It was slow to build and served over plain HTTP. Time for an upgrade.</p>

<p>I taught myself Terraform (and Jekyll) by migrating to this new stack. I’m convinced it’s an ideal configuration for modern static sites: S3-backed CloudFront offers blazing fast page loads, SSL/TLS configuration is one-and-done, and your cloud architecture is expressed in code, so you never need click through tedious AWS interfaces trying to remember how you configured a firewall setting or bucket rule. And you have complete control over every part of your stack.</p>

<p>I’ve captured my learnings in two public repos: <a href="https://github.com/happythenewsad/terraform-static-site">terraform-static-site</a> and <a href="https://github.com/happythenewsad/jekyll_pkcom">jekyll-pkcom</a></p>

<p>Feel free to start there. The rest of this post will cover some more detailed thoughts and observations on working with Terraform. Code snippets reference <a href="https://github.com/happythenewsad/terraform-static-site">terraform-static-site</a>.</p>

<h2 id="terraforms-tactical-merits">Terraform’s tactical merits</h2>
<p>Terraform expresses cloud infrastructure (i.e. servers, load balancers, datastores, permissions) in code. This is super great because non-trivial cloud configurations become complex very quickly.</p>

<p>Cloud providers (e.g. AWS, Azure) provide browser UIs out of the box for managing infrastructure. These can be helpful when starting out, but quickly become cumbersome.</p>

<p>Here are a few scenarios that illustrate problems I have encountered with cloud infrastructure management before Terraform:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A teammate changes a firewall rule, cutting communication between a load balancer and a server. Identifying the root cause takes minutes rather than seconds, because infrastructure configurations are not versioned in a central place. After identifying the bad firewall rule, uncertainty lingers - have other misconfigurations occurred which may also be impacting production?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You want to set up a new CDN distribution that reads from various S3 buckets. To do this, you need to copy and paste a list of S3 bucket names into an AWS web form to tell the new CDN distribution where to read from.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Terraform solves issues like these by deploying your cloud infrastucture from a versioned template files. Terraform deployments are idempotent, so existing architecture is preserved if it reflects what’s in your Terraform specification.</p>

<h2 id="notes-and-learnings">Notes and learnings</h2>

<p>The official Terraform <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/index.html">documentation</a> is indispensable and generally quite good, but it can be overwhelming when starting out.</p>

<p>I found it helpful to start with a minimal working Terraform configuration (say, a single <code>.tf</code> file that deploys a bare EC2 instance), and extend iteratively.</p>

<p>Let’s look at <a href="https://github.com/happythenewsad/terraform-static-site">terraform-static-site</a>: it has a single Terraform directory, <code>s3</code>, with just 3 files inside. Yep, that’s all you need. Like Git, Terraform only cares about the directory you tell it to care about. If you run <code>cd s3 &amp;&amp; terraform init .</code>, Terraform will start managing artifacts within <code>s3/</code>, and only <code>s3/</code>. Terraform can manage multiple directories through Terraform modules, but those are out of the scope of this minimal example.</p>

<p><code>s3.tf</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>terraform {
	...
} 
provider "aws" {
	...
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "pkcom" {
	...
}

resource "aws_cloudfront_distribution" "pkcomCFDistro"{
	...
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There’s some boilerplate, specifying AWS as our cloud provider, then just two resources: an S3 bucket and a CloudFront distribution. Sadly, Terraform <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/571">does not currently support</a> dynamic names, so you’ll have to change “pkcom” and “pkcomCFDistro” to something relevant to you.</p>

<p>That’s it: get used to resource blocks; they’re Terraform’s bread and butter. Resources are tied to a specific cloud provider, so if you’re not using AWS, you’ll need to use Azure resource blocks, for example, which will have configuration options that differ from AWS.</p>

<p>You could populate <code>s3.tf</code> with hard-coded variables, like S3 bucket names, but it’s best to think of your main <code>.tf</code> file as a template, and store variables separately. Let’s check out <code>variables.tf</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>variable "region" {
  default = "us-west-2"
}

variable "property" {
}

variable "bucketName" {
}
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is how you declare variables in Terraform. I’ve abstracted the <em>values</em> of the variables into <code>terraform.tfvars</code>. This is a way to keep secret values out of version control, but it’s not required.</p>

<p>When you run <code>terraform apply</code>, the Terraform CLI will automatically inject variables into your template file(s).</p>

<p>That’s it! Once you’ve populated <code>terraform.tfvars</code> with your specific values, you can deploy with <code>terraform apply</code>.</p>

<h3 id="http-or-https">http or https?</h3>

<p>It’s easy to misconfigure the connection between S3 and and CloudFront. After trial and error I found that it’s best to have CloudFront fetch S3 objects over http, but accept only https requests:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>origin_protocol_policy = "http-only"
...
viewer_protocol_policy = "redirect-to-https"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Some recipes will specify</p>

<div><div><pre><code>origin_protocol_policy = "match-viewer"`
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>which causes CloudFront to raise HTTP 504 errors in my experience. In general, it’s handy to enable an S3 logging bucket when debugging S3 &lt;-&gt; CloudFront issues.</p>

<h3 id="custom-domain--cert">custom domain / cert</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/happythenewsad/terraform-static-site">terraform-static-site</a> is configured to use a custom domain, so your web property can be accessed via a normal domain instead of xyz.cloudfront.net. Doing this in AWS requires a custom SSL/TLS cert. You need out-of-band approval for a cert. Log into the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/acm">AWS Certificate Manager</a> to create one, then add its ARN in <code>terraform.tvars</code>. If you prefer to host domains outside of AWS’s Route53 service like I do, you’ll also need to follow <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/CNAMEs.html">this CNAMEing procedure</a>. Verifying ownership of your domain is easy, but manual and out-of-band. It took about 10 minutes for AWS to recognize ownership for my domain after I updated CNAME records through my 3rd party DNS service.</p>

<h3 id="503-gotcha">503 gotcha</h3>
<p>If you’re getting 503’s from CloudFront, it may be because you need a <code>custom_origin_config</code> within your <code>aws_cloudfront_distribution</code> resource block. Luckily, <a href="https://github.com/happythenewsad/terraform-static-site">terraform-static-site</a>’s configuration should work out of the box.</p>

<p>And if you have any feedback or suggestions, please add an issue or open a PR on the <a href="https://github.com/happythenewsad/terraform-static-site">Github repo!</a></p>

<p>* Terraform supports most cloud providers; this post uses AWS.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-c850fbf271b4b442b8bf"><div><p>This week, we stumbled across&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/TEb33U0hHxM" target="_blank">a video</a>&nbsp;that outlines a paradigm shift in the way that humans see viruses in the context of germ theory. The traditional explanation of disease is that it’s caused by microbial colonization of a healthy body. The immune system, then, is there to mount a defense against that pathogen. Since their discovery in the early 20th century, viruses have been included in this milieu as just another type of autonomous pathogen.</p><p>More recently, however, both the human microbiome and the human virome have been recognized as foundational elements of our biology. The “-ome” title is given in order to denote a network of interrelated viruses or microorganisms that are associated with the human body. In the case of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4919837/" target="_blank">virome</a>, this includes the viruses that target members of the gut microbiota (our intestinal bacteria). Viruses, however, unlike bacteria, archaea, and fungi are not organisms - rather,&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26970895/" target="_blank">they are a process</a>. During the viral process, target-specific, nucleotide-containing vesicles, virions, are secreted by one individual and can be taken up by another.&nbsp;</p><p>The paradigm shift, that the viral program represents a wider communication network between organisms, has seen some press - but like all such shifts, is slow to be accepted. There are even tantalizing clues that viruses may have an evolutionary role that extends beyond mere pathology.&nbsp;</p><p>In this video, Dr. Zach Bush points to this changing pathogenic narrative with enthusiastic certainty... and then adds some other less established assertions. The conversation that follows takes aim at some of these tendentious assertions. More importantly, we demystify Dr. Bush’s presentation, showing both the merits of his theory as well as his use of some rather common epistemological vices.  Let us know your thoughts on social or in the comment section…</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1599965975832_14859"><div><p><strong>AB:&nbsp;</strong>We don’t really make it to the core of the presentation of the video until the very end - that the pathology of COVID-19 is due to the fact that humans live in a particularly toxic environment. This is maybe the strongest piece of his whole argument since there’s ample literature that suggests air pollution plays an important role in the lethality of COVID - as do pre-occurring conditions. [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004896972032221X" target="_blank">1</a>][<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7345938/" target="_blank">2</a>][<a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/04/27/2020.04.05.20054502.full.pdf" target="_blank">3</a>]</p><p><strong>MD:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, it seems like Dr. Bush is setting out to explain how COVID or pandemics in general are a natural response to a toxic environment. He sees viruses as a whole-species software update. If you get the update, your body will adapt. If you are unable to handle the update, your body self-destructs through widespread inflammatory disease. He presents this “update” notion as a matter of fact, but it’s quite hypothetical since we aren’t aware of any selective advantage of getting infected. It is an interesting theory but his conversion of hypothesis to fact sets off alarms.</p><p><strong>AB:&nbsp;</strong>This sort of certainty is a common feature of scientific presentations - both fringe and mainstream, that leave me uneasy about the reliability of the presenter’s claims. For me, it shifts their presentation into one of belief. Ideally, when someone makes a presentation they’re doing so from the standpoint of possibility, rather than certainty, since the entire enterprise of science is one of “maybe.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MD:</strong>&nbsp;For me, the most valuable scholars are the ones that will not make a claim without scaling the uncertainty, either qualitatively or quantitatively.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>AB:&nbsp;</strong>And we see some of those issues here pretty early. He makes the claim that 50% of the human genome is viral, which is, at best, a 5X exaggeration. Then there are some non-specific claims about the fact that viral expression is induced by stress, which has only been shown in the case of herpes simplex, not across the board. Then there’s the nebulous presentation about these pools of pig feces where there’s a lot of “stress” that causes the viruses to jump into the human population.&nbsp;</p><p>None of them would be deal-breakers if presented in an inductive lens. Say, “We know that stress causes flare-ups of the herpes virus, so..” or “a significant amount of the human genome is composed of viral DNA…” It makes it much harder for me to pay attention to the actual content of the presentation since I’m so busy searching PubMed for confirmation of the claims.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MD:</strong>&nbsp;Right. And I feel like these are very common problems amongst both science popularizers and scientists themselves. They want so badly for their theory to be taken seriously that they’re willing to compromise their presentation’s accuracy. We see this all the time from institutional authorities as well.&nbsp;</p><p>But underneath all the exaggerations and hypotheses converted to “facts,” we have a cool idea; one that’s rapidly gaining mainstream traction. Scientists are starting to realize that viruses aren’t jumping or doing anything active like an organism: they’re a targeted message system. Recall that a virus itself is a process; the physical objects secreted are called “virions” and they are not alive in the canonical sense.</p><p><strong>AB:&nbsp;</strong>The question of viral “aliveness” has come up over and over again in our research on COVID and viruses, in general, these last few months. In order to be a living organism, you’d expect viruses to reproduce independently - but no, they can only do so by forcing a host cell to create them - lending credence to the idea that they’re little more than software.</p><p>That’s probably the biggest gem in this presentation - that viruses are a software program. But I’m not totally sure about the fact that they’re more damaging in the modern-day because we live in some kind of “toxic” world. After all, virions make up the majority of the nucleic acid content in the world. That there weren’t always some that could cause harm to humans just doesn’t scan for me.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MD:</strong>&nbsp;I’m fairly sure that our industrial world is pumping out toxins on a level that our ancestors never imagined in their worst nightmares, but the link to viral expression or infection-mediated resilience, while interesting, is far from a settled matter. And this is why it’s so important to be transparent when presenting a new idea in science. If you want your idea to be taken seriously, you can’t oversell its merits. At best you can oversell its&nbsp;<em>potential&nbsp;</em>merits.</p><p>When you present a new mechanism in science, also called a theory, you have to be absolutely clear in the set up: here is what&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;known and apparent, and here is what could hypothetically, if shown to be true, provide for my explanation.</p><p>Honestly, if a presenter does not follow that simple method, it makes a lot of work for readers like us, trying to pluck the gold from the slag. And quite frankly, most scientists won’t have the patience for this at some point, which means that a lot of potentially brilliant leaps get relegated to the back pages.</p><p><strong>AB:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>It’s definitely not as sexy, to talk about possibility rather than certainty, or to avoid tendentious claims - those are basically the fritos of the intellectual world. But I think that there’s a lot to be said about the ideas that are produced by the “fringe” actually being useful for all of science. They’re analogous to the potentially pathological software updates that Dr. Bush suggests viruses act like!</p><p>I’d love to see a wider acceptance among audience members for what makes a good presentation - rather than allowing ourselves to be bowled over by big numbers and even bigger claims, I want to see a world where people clamor for a more reasonable, measured approach.&nbsp;</p><p>I have a feeling it would go a long way towards reconciling the fringe with the mainstream.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div>]]>

<h2>Introduction</h2>



<p>I’m sure some of my followers have seen my recent social media posts regarding the 200+ Raspberry Pi Model B’s I purchased on ebay – if you have not then follow my <a href="https://twitter.com/jmdawson_blog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">twitter</a> for sneak peaks and updates!</p>



<div><p>I purchased the job lot of Pi’s for just £61 although there was a catch – they were listed as broken and I believe they are customer returns. They are all Model B’s with with either 256MB or 512MB of RAM and are in various conditions. </p><p>The first step in repairing these is to diagnose the issues, I created some tooling to assist with this which I will cover now.</p></div>



<h2>Pi Diagnostics</h2>



<p>So how do you go around diagnosing 200+ faulty Raspberry Pi’s? Regardless of how clever I get around this its not going to be a fast process but I needed a plan. </p>



<div><p>I will be categorising the Pi’s into two categories those that boot and those that are or appear dead. The “Dead” Pi’s will be revisited at a later date but lets take a look at how I’ve gone about testing the ones that boot up. </p><p>Using a cheap 3.5″ TFT Pi display and a hacky bash script I have created a diagnostic tool that will test the following: </p></div>



<ul><li>USB Ports</li><li>Ethernet</li><li>Display Output</li></ul>



<p>This also gives me an opportunity to test the GPIO to an extent as the display uses the I2C, VCC and GND pins and also gives me a chance to assess the physical condition of the device. </p>

<p>So far I am around half way through the diagnostics and 59 of the Pi’s boot and work with minor damage such as snapped SD card slots or physically damaged USB ports.</p>



<p>10 of the Pi’s are fully working although their is no Ethernet – These will not be fixed as such although the Ethernet chip and port will be removed transforming the device into a Model A. </p>



<div><p>A further 4 devices are fully working although the HDMI port doesn’t work, all 4 of these look to have damaged traces on the PCB around the HDMI circuitry – I will not be fixing these although I can make them safe to run headless. </p><p>A further 40 Pi’s are dead although some of them are likely just broken power delivery circuits which should be easy fixes – I will revisit these in the near future. </p><p>Here are the remaining devices that need to be diagnosed: </p></div>

<div><p>Over the next few days I will diagnose the remaining devices and add a follow up post that will have a total count of Pi’s in the box and a count of the ones that I believe are repairable. </p></div>



<h2>Repairing the Pi’s</h2>



<p>Although I haven’t finished diagnosing the Pi’s I couldn’t help but repair a few of the easier fixes, lets look at a few repairs I carried out this morning.</p>



<h3>Bent GPIO pins</h3>

<p>How the hell does this happen?! one of the Pi’s had the GPIO pins swashed flat. I could have replaced the header but as no pins were snapped I carefully straightened them a metal ruler. <br></p>

<p>Ok broken is an understatement! This poor Pi has had the ports ripped right off it, fortunately there is plenty dead Pi’s that will not be fixable so rather than buying parts I salvaged the USB ports from a dead Pi. </p>

<p>There we have it, another Pi saved from the scrap pile! </p>



<p>I know people are excited to see the board level repairs but I can assure that they are coming, there are just a lot of devices to go through and I want to get the easy fixes out of the way first. <br></p>



<div><p>I fixed several with broken USB ports and added them to the box of working Pi’s. I will be covering SD card slot repairs when my AliExpress parts arrive but for now this is all on the repairs. </p><p>Here is a final photo showing the so-far working devices: </p></div>

<h2>What am I going to do with 200 Raspberry Pi’s?!</h2>



<p>I’m sorry to disappoint but I won’t be building a cluster or decorating my walls with them! In fact I don’t have a project planned for these instead they will be sold on starting at £4 for a “Model A” and up to £9 for a fully boxed un-repaired Model B. I’m not doing this to make a quick buck I’m doing it for the blog content and the experience and to hopefully provide you guys with some very cheap Raspberry Pi’s for your projects!</p>



<p>I had a lot of suggestions to send the Pi’s to a developing Country for students to learn IT on and whilst I really like that idea the logistics of it and finding someone trustworthy enough to hand them out aren’t straight forward. Then there is the issue or 200 Pi’s requiring SD cards, Keyboards, Mice and Displays A board alone just isn’t enough here and its just not simple or easy for me to do. Instead I will be donating the proceeds of the sales to the Raspberry Pi Foundation and they can decide what to do with the Money! </p>



<p>I will post an update tomorrow with the results of the diagnostics and a link where you can purchase the repaired devices – UK only though I’m afraid unless you are willing to cover the shipping. </p>



<p>Let me know what you think of this mammoth task in a comment below and please consider following this blog for updates. </p>



<p>Edit: 24/01/21<br>Part 2 is now out <a href="https://blog.jmdawson.co.uk/i-bought-200-raspberry-pi-model-bs-and-im-going-to-fix-them-part-2/">here</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Cleaning up resources is one fo the most difficult things in Go. If careful attention isn’t paid to files,
network connections, or goroutines then a special type of memory leaked, called a resource leak, can occur.
One of the most effective way to identify resource leaks I’ve found are “baseline” tests. These tests establish
a healthy baseline. Next some work is simulated. The final step is to verify that the baseline was returned to,
once the work has completed.</p><p>Baseline tests are a reactionary way to detect resource leaks. This means that a resource leak must <em>already</em> be
present in code. Contrast this with a proactive detection mechanism such as a static analysis. In static analysis
a check may be performed to ensure that every <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/io/#Closer"><code>io.Closer</code></a>, has <code>Close()</code> called
on it within the function scope the resource was opened. Another strategy to manage resource leaks is a strict adherence to convention. i.e.
ensure that every goroutine that’s started has a way to finish, or <code>defer</code>ing <code>Close()</code> right after a resource is
successfully opened.</p><p>A baseline tests involves starting your application and then generating some short-lived test load.
Below shows an example of a baseline test.</p><p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="baseline_heap_objects" title="baseline_heap_objects" src="https://on-systems.tech/static/d13e832dfad97b040e0f45e97d960323/b1001/baseline_heap_objects.png" srcset="https://on-systems.tech/static/d13e832dfad97b040e0f45e97d960323/e4d6b/baseline_heap_objects.png 345w,https://on-systems.tech/static/d13e832dfad97b040e0f45e97d960323/1e043/baseline_heap_objects.png 690w,https://on-systems.tech/static/d13e832dfad97b040e0f45e97d960323/b1001/baseline_heap_objects.png 1380w,https://on-systems.tech/static/d13e832dfad97b040e0f45e97d960323/a6d66/baseline_heap_objects.png 2070w,https://on-systems.tech/static/d13e832dfad97b040e0f45e97d960323/53948/baseline_heap_objects.png 2720w" sizes="(max-width: 1380px) 100vw, 1380px" loading="lazy">
    </span></p><p>The graph shows the # of objects allocated by go. The flat sections of the graph display the “baseline”. The
spikes indicate load is being applied.</p><p>After the program is initialized it is a flat steady line. Then some load is applied to the program. Afterwards
the runtime returns to the initial flat line. When resources leak the # of objects will increase after each
application of load, and the flat “baseline” sections will slowly grow.</p><p>The next graph shows a base line tests affect on the # of goroutines. During steady state 11 goroutines are
running. </p><p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="baseline_go_routines" title="baseline_go_routines" src="https://on-systems.tech/static/179864feba9ab80a5db07a66e58f3c2f/b1001/baseline_go_routines.png" srcset="https://on-systems.tech/static/179864feba9ab80a5db07a66e58f3c2f/e4d6b/baseline_go_routines.png 345w,https://on-systems.tech/static/179864feba9ab80a5db07a66e58f3c2f/1e043/baseline_go_routines.png 690w,https://on-systems.tech/static/179864feba9ab80a5db07a66e58f3c2f/b1001/baseline_go_routines.png 1380w,https://on-systems.tech/static/179864feba9ab80a5db07a66e58f3c2f/a6d66/baseline_go_routines.png 2070w,https://on-systems.tech/static/179864feba9ab80a5db07a66e58f3c2f/4f2ef/baseline_go_routines.png 2714w" sizes="(max-width: 1380px) 100vw, 1380px" loading="lazy">
    </span></p><p>If the # of go routines or the # of objects allocated never return after stopping load, it’s a good indicator
of a resource leak. Once a resource leak is detected its important to dig into the root cause. Go provides a tool
called <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/pprof/">pprof</a> which helps in <a href="https://medium.com/dm03514-tech-blog/sre-debugging-simple-memory-leaks-in-go-e0a9e6d63d4d">detecting resources leaks</a>.</p><p>Baseline tests are a really simple and easy way to detect resource leaks. Unfortunately, they only detect after
a resource leak is already present in code, so they should be combined with static analysis and resource management
conventions for the best coverage. Go makes it particularly easy to inspect the runtime and expose the # of
allocated objects and goroutines through the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/runtime/#ReadMemStats"><code>runtime</code></a> package.</p><p>References:</p><ul><li><a href="https://medium.com/dm03514-tech-blog/sre-debugging-simple-memory-leaks-in-go-e0a9e6d63d4d">https://medium.com/dm03514-tech-blog/sre-debugging-simple-memory-leaks-in-go-e0a9e6d63d4d</a></li><li><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-i-investigated-memory-leaks-in-go-using-pprof-on-a-large-codebase-4bec4325e192/">https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-i-investigated-memory-leaks-in-go-using-pprof-on-a-large-codebase-4bec4325e192/</a></li><li><a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/pprof/">https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/pprof/</a></li></ul></section></div>]]>

<p>Here's how to stop being so darn precious about your blogging: <strong>The third time you use an idea in a conversation, you have to blog about it.</strong></p>
<p>

<section>
  <h2 id="why"><a href="#why">Why</a></h2>
  <p>People often wonder what to blog about. You can get really fancy with Google keyword research and content calendars and the like. It's too complicated for me, and often leads to the kind of impersonal, SEO-driven blogposts that are slowly ruining the web.</p>
  <p>We need a simple, authentic heuristic to decide. Let's think about the upper and lower bounds:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>It's possible to blog too much — nobody wants you to broadcast every waking thought.</li>
    <li>But it's more likely that we are just <em>not blogging enough</em>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>What's obvious to you is often not obvious to others. How often do you speak with someone and casually mention something that is new to them?</p>
  <p>Pretty often.</p>
  <p>
    <img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/ten_thousand.png" alt="xkcd 1053">
  </p>
  <p>It's natural to want to hold off publishing our insights and discoveries until the magical right time when it all clicks together in one beautiful, perfect essay that springs forth fully formed from our foreheads, making us famous and showing the world how smart we are.</p>
  <p>We want it so much we end up <strong>never writing it</strong>.</p>
  <p>This is how the world misses out on so much of our unique voices, taste, and perspectives.</p>
  <p>The Three Strikes Rule is designed as both a filter (for passing thoughts) and a prompt (for you to write more).</p>
  <p><strong>To stop being so precious</strong> about your blog.</p>
  <p><strong>To share ideas</strong> more openly and freely with your readers.</p>
  <p><strong>To <a href="https://www.swyx.io/create_luck/">Create Luck</a></strong>.</p>
  <p><strong>To create one reference</strong> for that bunch of links you always end up searching for when you write or answer questions.</p>
  <p>And, quite honestly, <strong>to write shorter blogposts</strong>. Nobody has time to read the 3,000 word preamble to your magnum opus. It's a blog, not a physical book — you can return over time to expand it if it's worth it (like <a href="https://www.swyx.io/LIP">this</a> or <a href="https://www.swyx.io/how-to-name-things/">this</a>).</p>

  <h2 id="how"><a href="#how">How</a></h2>
  <p>Let's say we accept that "the 3rd time we reference an idea in a conversation, we have to blog about it". What does that really mean?</p>
  <p>I take an expansive view of what "ideas" and "conversations" means.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Ideas</strong> includes great talks, good books, useful concepts, obscure names, handy definitions, copied-and-pasted code snippets, historical facts, surprising charts, and even blogposts by other people. (Yes, you can blog about other blogs. <a href="https://css-tricks.com/the-power-of-lampshading/">Like this</a>. Why not?) Sometimes the idea will be your own, most times it will be your takes on others'.</li>
    <li><strong>Conversations</strong> include in-person, on Zoom, on Twitter, wherever you communicate and exchange ideas.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>The first time</strong> you refer to an idea, you probably just learned about it. It might be a fad; you may never find the idea useful again. Let it go.</p>
  <p><strong>The second time</strong> you refer to the idea, you should be taking note. Ideas are things we find useful in our day-to-day conversations, and there's probably a good amount of our readers who would too. But it might <em>still</em> fade away, so we hold off on it. It still needs to <strong>prove its usefulness</strong>.</p>
  <p>By <strong>the third time</strong> you refer to an idea, it's no longer a coincidence. It's a pattern. You're increasingly likely to refer to it again in future. It's marinated in your head for a bit, and you've likely gained some experience explaining it to others. It's also not so old that it may have lost relevance. It's time to write it down <a href="https://www.hanselman.com/blog/do-they-deserve-the-gift-of-your-keystrokes">to save keystrokes</a>.</p>
  <p>Do I <em>literally</em> write everything down after the 3rd time? No, sometimes the "three strikes" becomes the "five strikes" or the "ten strikes" rule, mostly out of laziness. But I know I <em>should</em>. With this rule, I find that I blog more and people still get value out of the core idea.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>In case you were wondering... yes the "reference counter" on the Three Strikes rule itself got up to about 8 or 9 before I wrote this post. 🙈</p>
  </blockquote>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 id="delivery"><a href="#delivery">Delivery</a></h2>
  <p>Following this rule will dramatically increase the volume of your output. There's then the question of how to deliver these high frequency things. There are a few methods:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Tweet it out</li>
    <li>Dump them in a github repo (<a href="https://github.com/jbranchaud/til">like this</a>)</li>
    <li>Split your blog from "only having essays" mode to having both "essays" and "notes". Publish separate RSS feeds for them.</li>
    <li>Buffer them up for a "grab bag post" like <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2021/01/what-ive-been-reading-183.html">Tyler Cowen</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Personally, I am exploring doing this with a <a href="http://swyx.transistor.fm/">daily podcast</a>. See what works for you.</p>
  <p>If you're worried that people will think you're too noisy, you probably shouldn't.</p>

  <p><strong>I'd love for you to share great ideas more freely.</strong> Great ideas deserve to be shared, and your readers will appreciate it.</p>

January 23, 2021 | https://jmmv.dev/2021/01/why-endbasic.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://jmmv.dev/2021/01/why-endbasic.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <div>
              
              <article><p>If you have been following this blog or my social profiles for the last year, you are probably aware that <a href="https://jmmv.dev/tags/endbasic">I have been working on something called EndBASIC</a>. You also probably know that this is a retro-looking BASIC interpreter written in Rust that <a href="https://endbasic.jmmv.dev/">happens to run on the web</a>. And if you know those two things, you are probably wondering, like some of my friends do: why am I <em>wasting</em> time developing such a useless project? <strong>Because.</strong></p>
<p>No, seriously, because. It is obvious that the EndBASIC language and environment will not gain massive traction, and I do not have any interest in inventing a perfect new language (because, let’s face it, we already have one and it’s called Rust 😉).</p>
<p>So, then, why do I spend any of my scarce free time on this project? If you must know:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>It’s a fun thing to do.</strong> Just like some people enjoy watching TV shows, playing video games, or crafting wood, I enjoy programming. It feels like a game. And EndBASIC <em>itself</em> could be seen as a game at this point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>It’s a form of art.</strong> Developing a personal project is a different experience than developing a work project. I can spend all the time in the world polishing the same turd over and over again, playing with different ideas until things look best.</p>
<p>If you have ever considered that programming may be art, then this kind of side project is where you crank your craft up a notch. As just one example, working on EndBASIC’s tests made me come up with the idea of <a href="https://jmmv.dev/2020/12/builder-pattern-for-tests.html">using the builder pattern for tests</a> and it seemed to have been well-received.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>It’s a learning experience.</strong> In writing EndBASIC, I’m playing with Rust. I strongly believe that Rust is one of the languages of the future and it’s the language that makes me say “aha, I agree” at every corner I turn. Yet, I haven’t mastered it. Working on Rust projects lets me learn a bunch of stuff about the language that will be helpful in future endeavors. And it’s not only about Rust per se: <a href="https://jmmv.dev/2020/04/rust-into-trait.html">learning the idioms</a> used in this language can <a href="https://jmmv.dev/2018/06/rust-review-protect-the-data.html">help write better code</a> in any other.</p>
<p>Another example is that I also got to learn about WASM, targeting the browser from a “native” app and making it work on various different devices. This led me down the path of async programming and how to interact with Javascript in that context—which was <a href="https://jmmv.dev/2020/05/bridging-the-web-gap-endbasic.html">a painful but eventually-gratifying obstacle</a> to overcome.</p>
<p>And yet another example is that I also got to set up continuous <em>deployment</em>, first via Travis CI and then via the new GitHub Actions coolness. This, in turn, gave me ammo to write up more <a href="https://jmmv.dev/2021/01/github-actions-code-health.html">interesting</a> <a href="https://jmmv.dev/2021/01/do-not-submit.html">stuff</a> in this blog.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Copying an “old technology” is irrelevant.</strong> Yes, BASIC is not the language of the future (although… VB.NET users may disagree with you because it supports, I don’t know, thousands of businesses?). But that doesn’t matter. Only 5,000 lines of the codebase (about 30% of the total) are devoted to parsing the language, and most of those lines are unit tests anyway. If I wanted to change the language per se to offer a more “modern” experience with things like first-order functions, objects, etc. it’d be <em>trivial</em> to do so.</p>
<p>To be clear, I have no interest in building my own language as mentioned in the opening, but having worked on the <em>building blocks</em> of a real language is enlightening, and having those building blocks around will surely come in handy in the future.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So what happened to the <a href="https://jmmv.dev/2020/04/hello-endbasic.html">original goal</a> of teaching programming to my kids via this project? Well… uhh… let’s say I’ve gotten distracted having fun by myself rather than actually getting them in front of this. I should get back to that goal after all the recent improvements to make the environment more usable and seeing if they care at all.</p>
<p>But yes. For the most part, EndBASIC is a crazy/useless language. Although… ~50 other people currently disagree with the thought of this being useless if <a href="https://github.com/jmmv/endbasic/">GitHub stars</a> mean anything at all 😉 If you are one of those ~50, thank you! And if you are not, join me in the craze?</p>
<p><strong>Edit (Jan 24th): If you are here from the recent bump in Hacker News, hello! I have <a href="https://jmmv.dev/2021/01/endbasic-0.5.html">just published the 0.5.0 release</a> which might answer some of the questions you have.</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p>Consensus algorithms is a topic that always caught my attention: it is complex and hard and needs a precise and safe solution. In other words: We have a couple of machines forming a cluster, and they operate on identical copies of the same data and can continue operating even in the scenario of some servers being down. This approach is used to solve a bunch of problems in distributed systems.</p>

<p>To give a bit of background of where we currently stand, we have to talk about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)">Paxos</a>. Over the past decade or more, Paxos was almost synonymous with consensus, as it is the protocol taught in most computer science courses, and most implementations of consensus make use of it. The only problem is that Paxos is really difficult to understand, thus making it very hard to be implemented correctly. With that, Diego Ongaro and John Ousterhout <a href="https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf">designed Raft</a>, with the most important goal of making it understandable.</p>

<p>Given that Raft focuses so much on understandability, it breaks down the consensus into three relatively independent subproblems (quoting the Raft paper):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Leader election: a new leader must be chosen when an existing leader fails.</li>
  <li>Log replication: the leader must accept log entries from clients and replicate them across the cluster, forcing the other logs to agree with their own</li>
  <li>Safety: if any server has applied a given log entry to its state machine, then no other server may apply a different command for the same log index.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this blog post, I will cover only the Leader election. The other two topics I will cover in the future in other blog posts!</p>

<h3 id="the-basics-of-raft-and-leader-election">The basics of Raft and leader election</h3>

<p>A Raft cluster is composed of several servers and five is a typical number, therefore allowing the system to have two failures. A server in this cluster is in one of three possible states:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Leader: Handles all client requests.</li>
  <li>Followers: are passive, and only respond to requests from leaders.</li>
  <li>Candidate: a state used to elect a new leader.</li>
</ul>

<p>Raft divides time into terms of arbitrary length, and they are numbered with consecutive integers. Each one of these terms starts with an election, where one or more candidates attempt to become the leader of the cluster. When a candidate wins the election, it serves as the leader for the rest of the term. To explain this process a bit better, we can illustrate these transitions.</p>

<p><img src="http://laurocaetano.com/images/raft-states-2.png" alt="raft-states"></p>

<p>Raft uses a heartbeat mechanism to trigger elections. When a server joins the cluster, they begin as followers, and they remain in this state as long as they receive valid heartbeats from the current leader. The leaders send periodic heartbeats to all followers in order to notify them of the existence of it and maintain its authority. When a follower does not receive a heartbeat over a period of time, named in Raft “election timeout”, then it proceeds to start a new election.</p>

<p>A new election follows these steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Changing the state from follower to candidate</li>
  <li>Increase the current term by 1</li>
  <li>Votes for itself</li>
  <li>Requests votes from all servers in the cluster</li>
  <li>If the server gets the majority of the votes, it assumes the role of leader</li>
  <li>Starts sending heartbeats to all followers, including the new term</li>
</ol>

<p>This is a very simplistic and short explanation for the leader election process, and for more details do not hesitate in <a href="https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf">reading the paper</a>! It’s a very pleasant read.</p>

<h3 id="implementation-in-rust">Implementation in Rust</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> is a programming language designed for performance, safety, and safe concurrency. It is strongly typed, compiled, has no garbage collector, and has no runtime (a.k.a a very minimal runtime).</p>

<p>I got interested in Rust at the end of 2020, by reading a couple of blog posts. With that trigger, I decided to read <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html">The Rust Programming Language</a> book and started to code very small projects. Only that very small projects do not tell you much about the language in the real world. So I decided to implement something that is more related to what I work on on my daily basis: dealing with distributed systems.</p>

<p>Note: if you are not familiar with the language, you can quickly check <a href="https://stevedonovan.github.io/rust-gentle-intro/">the Gentle intro to Rust</a>.</p>

<h4 id="the-implementation">The implementation</h4>

<p>I decided to use the most simple and basic constructs of the language. This means no big runtimes, libs that do most of the job and etc. So I ended up using only threads for concurrency, and TCP for the RPCs.</p>

<h5 id="reproducing-the-states-and-types-in-the-code">Reproducing the states and types in the code</h5>

<p>My initial approach was to find out which types were the most important ones, and reproduced them in the code.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Examples of types.</span>
<span>enum</span> <span>State</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>FOLLOWER</span><span>,</span>
  <span>LEADER</span><span>,</span>
  <span>CANDIDATE</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>enum</span> <span>LogEntry</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Heartbeat</span> <span>{</span> <span>term</span><span>:</span> <span>u64</span><span>,</span> <span>peer_id</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span> <span>},</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>Server</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>id</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span>
    <span>address</span><span>:</span> <span>SocketAddrV4</span><span>,</span>
    <span>state</span><span>:</span> <span>State</span><span>,</span>
    <span>term</span><span>:</span> <span>u64</span><span>,</span>
    <span>log_entries</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>LogEntry</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
    <span>voted_for</span><span>:</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Peer</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
    <span>next_timeout</span><span>:</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Instant</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
    <span>config</span><span>:</span> <span>ServerConfig</span><span>,</span>
    <span>current_leader</span><span>:</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Leader</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span>
    <span>number_of_peers</span><span>:</span> <span>usize</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// Visit the file "types.rs" in the repo to see the all type definition.</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And once my types were defined, I started to implement the state transitions step by step.</p>

<h5 id="a-server-starts-as-follower">A server starts as follower</h5>

<p>In order to reproduce this behavior, I implemented a <code>new</code> method inside <code>Server</code>, to ensure that all servers are started with this state.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>impl</span> <span>Server</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>new</span><span>(</span>
        <span>config</span><span>:</span> <span>ServerConfig</span><span>,</span>
        <span>number_of_peers</span><span>:</span> <span>usize</span><span>,</span>
        <span>address</span><span>:</span> <span>SocketAddrV4</span><span>,</span>
        <span>id</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span>
    <span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Self</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>Server</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>id</span><span>:</span> <span>id</span><span>,</span>
            <span>state</span><span>:</span> <span>State</span><span>::</span><span>FOLLOWER</span><span>,</span>
            <span>term</span><span>:</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span>
            <span>log_entries</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(),</span>
            <span>voted_for</span><span>:</span> <span>None</span><span>,</span>
            <span>next_timeout</span><span>:</span> <span>None</span><span>,</span>
            <span>config</span><span>:</span> <span>config</span><span>,</span>
            <span>current_leader</span><span>:</span> <span>None</span><span>,</span>
            <span>number_of_peers</span><span>:</span> <span>number_of_peers</span><span>,</span>
            <span>address</span><span>:</span> <span>address</span><span>,</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now we have a server that starts as follower! Let’s go and implement the rest of the state transitions.</p>

<h5 id="starting-an-election-when-a-timeout-occurs">Starting an election when a timeout occurs</h5>

<p>As mentioned before, a server in Raft times out when it does not receive a heartbeat from a leader in a predetermined amount of time. Each server has a randomized timeout setting, to ensure that servers time out at different times.</p>

<p>To implement that, I decided to do the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// The final implementation is not exactly like this,</span>
<span>// but the idea is the same.</span>
<span>thread</span><span>::</span><span>spawn</span><span>(||</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>loop</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>server</span><span>.has_timed_out</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>new_election</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>server</span><span>);</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>So we have a thread that runs an infinite loop, always checking for the server’s timeout. Whenever it occurs, a new election is triggered.</p>

<p>The election process, in the happy path, occurs as follow:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// 1. Changing the state from follower to candidate</span>
<span>server</span><span>.state</span> <span>=</span> <span>State</span><span>::</span><span>CANDIDATE</span><span>;</span>

<span>// 2. Increase the current term by one</span>
<span>server</span><span>.term</span> <span>=</span> <span>server</span><span>.term</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
<span>server</span><span>.refresh_timeout</span><span>();</span>

<span>// 3. Vote for itself</span>
<span>server</span><span>.voted_for</span> <span>=</span> <span>Some</span><span>(</span><span>Peer</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>id</span><span>:</span> <span>server</span><span>.id</span><span>.to_string</span><span>(),</span>
    <span>address</span><span>:</span> <span>server</span><span>.address</span><span>,</span>
<span>});</span>

<span>// 4. Prepare vote requests and make the RPC request</span>
<span>let</span> <span>request_vote_rpc</span> <span>=</span> <span>Some</span><span>(</span><span>VoteRequest</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>term</span><span>:</span> <span>new_term</span><span>,</span>
    <span>candidate_id</span><span>:</span> <span>id</span><span>,</span>
<span>})</span>

<span>let</span> <span>rpc_response</span> <span>=</span> <span>rpc_client</span><span>.request_vote</span><span>(</span><span>request_vote_rpc</span><span>);</span>

<span>// 5. if the server gets the majority of votes, becomes leader</span>
<span>if</span> <span>has_won_the_election</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>server</span><span>,</span> <span>rpc_response</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

<h5 id="election-timeout-and-discovering-another-leader">Election timeout and discovering another leader</h5>

<p>In case a timeout occurs or the server does not get the majority of the votes, it will start the election once again, increasing the term once more. In Raft, it is totally fine to have terms without a leader.</p>

<p>Another interesting case can occur during the election process: another server in the cluster is elected, and starts sending heartbeats. When this occurs, our server changes back the state from <code>CANDIDATE</code> to <code>FOLLOWER</code>, and set the terms to the current leader’s term.</p>

    <span>})</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With that, we have covered all the steps for the state transitions in Raft’s leader election algorithm!</p>

<h5 id="more-info-about-the-full-implementation">More info about the full implementation</h5>

<p>The core logic for the leader election is implemented in the <code>raft::core</code> package, where functions to handle log entries (heartbeats), elections, and timeouts are placed. Please visit the <a href="https://github.com/laurocaetano/rsraft/blob/fda7e677627577e452fef5858d58bce3ed8d74f6/src/raft/core.rs">full implementation</a> for a more detailed look into the code.</p>

<p><em>Important notes</em></p>

<p>RPCs are done through TCP connections. Each server starts up with a TPC listener, and create client connections to all other servers in the cluster.</p>

<p>The implementation is not making usage of persistent storage, so all operations are done in memory. For this reason, the <code>Server</code> instance is shared across many functions, by making usage of Rust’s <code>Arc</code> and <code>Mutex</code> combination. It took me a while to understand the concepts, but once you get the basics, it turns out very simple!</p>

<p>There is a <a href="https://github.com/laurocaetano/rsraft/blob/fda7e677627577e452fef5858d58bce3ed8d74f6/src/raft/demo.rs">demo</a>, which runs and demonstrates the process of electing a leader in a new cluster. By running it, we get the following output:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p><span>3</span> <b>January 2021</b></p><p>With the society trending towards short-term wins and satisfaction,
open-source is no different.
Doing open-source is shifting from being something close to the art of craftsmanship,
to make developers feel like a magician where their GitHub profile is the hat,
and the rabbit their new project for the “community” to talk about.
They are competing with themselves to have always a new trick (i.e. project) to show off.</p><p>There’s something <strong>positive</strong> in it:
there’s constant innovation.
However,
there are important <strong>caveats</strong> that our industry should be aware of.
The first one of them is fatigue that developers face when choosing their stack because open source creators optimize quantity over quality.
There are many shallow projects that you might not be able to use because the creator is already in the mood of finding new tricks.
That’s not negative per-se.
The problem comes when expectations are not set and a hype is created around it when there are no interests in maintaining it long term.
The community is given something that has a side effect on the maintainer’s flattery.
The community is a means, not a goal.
The second caveat is fatigue for the developer that is in the constant lookout of of those tricks.
Burnout is becoming normal in the industry,
and attitudes like the one I’m describing here naturally lead to it.
You create this illusion that the community needs you and therefore you need to respond:
<em>open source projects, blog posts, podcasts, books, talks</em>.
That’s insanely unsustainable.</p><p>Although I’ve had times where I also trended myself towards that approach of doing open-source,
I realized it stressed me and created this false illusion of the community needs me 24/7.</p><p><a href="https://tuist.io/">Tuist</a> was in fact that hat-rabbit that became my pet,
and with whom I like spending time these days.</p></article></div>]]>

                    <p>Launching an MVP is the only way to get real user feedback on your startup. Rather than build out a custom backend, <a href="https://postgrest.org/">PostgREST</a> exposes your Postgres DB tables as a REST API. <strong>Put those first months of engineering focus into the frontend and unique business logic - save the custom backend for when you need to scale.</strong></p><blockquote>Using PostgREST is an alternative to manual CRUD programming. Custom API servers suffer problems. Writing business logic often duplicates, ignores or hobbles database structure. Object-relational mapping is a leaky abstraction leading to slow imperative code. The PostgREST philosophy establishes a single declarative source of truth: the data itself. - <a href="https://postgrest.org/">https://postgrest.org/</a></blockquote><p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/">AWS Fargate</a> is an ideal compute platform for PostgREST. Being serverless, it is very efficient in terms of cost and operations. Yet Fargate containers are relatively long-lived compared to AWS Lambda - this allows PostgREST's caching mechanisms to remain effective.</p><h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2><ul><li>You'll need an AWS account and its associated access/secret keys.</li><li>Install the AWS CLI [<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html">directions here</a>], and configure your AWS keys [<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html#cli-configure-quickstart-config">directions here</a>].</li><li>The <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/fargatecli">Fargate CLI</a> is the easiest way to deploy a container on AWS. You'll want to install it [<a href="https://github.com/awslabs/fargatecli/releases">download here</a>].</li><li>A Postgres database. Your Fargate task(s) will need network access to this database. If you are using RDS, be sure to specify subnets and security groups for your load balancer and tasks (see below) so they get deployed in the same VPC as your database.</li></ul><h2 id="ship-it">Ship it</h2><h3 id="1-setup-a-test-db-api-role-and-table-in-postgres-">1. Setup a test DB, API, role, and table in Postgres:</h3><p>Connect to Postgres, then create a database for this exercise:</p><pre><code>postgres=&gt; create database startup;
CREATE DATABASE
postgres=&gt; \c startup;
psql ...
You are now connected to database "startup" as user "root".
startup=&gt;</code></pre><p>PostgREST uses a "naked schema" to identify which DB tables should be exposed in the API. We can create one, and add a sample table:</p><pre><code>startup=&gt; create schema api;
CREATE SCHEMA

startup=&gt; create table api.trees (id serial primary key, name text not null, species text not null);
CREATE TABLE

startup=&gt; insert into api.trees (name, species) values ('Banyan', 'Ficus benghalensis'), ('Quaking Aspen', 'Populus tremula'), ('American Elm', 'Ulmus americana'), ('Red Maple', 'Acer rubrum');
INSERT 0 4</code></pre><p>Finally, we need to set up two roles. The first controls anonymous access with Postgres' standard grants and (optionally) row-level security. PostgREST uses the <code>authenticator</code> role to connect to the database. Once connected, PostgREST assumes the <code>web_anon</code> role. <em>Please pick a better password than 'secret1'.</em></p><pre><code>create role web_anon nologin;

grant usage on schema api to web_anon;
grant select on api.trees to web_anon;

create role authenticator noinherit login password 'secret1';
grant web_anon to authenticator;</code></pre><p>This structure ensures you are not using the <code>root</code> user for PostgREST connections and makes it easy to add <a href="https://postgrest.org/en/v7.0.0/tutorials/tut1.html">JWT-authenticated roles</a> in the future.</p><p>A more detailed PostgREST setup tutorial is available here: <a href="https://postgrest.org/en/v7.0.0/tutorials/tut0.html">https://postgrest.org/en/v7.0.0/tutorials/tut0.html</a></p><h3 id="2-deploy-an-application-load-balancer-to-route-traffic-to-your-fargate-task-s-">2. Deploy an Application Load Balancer to route traffic to your Fargate task(s):</h3><pre><code>fargate lb create postgrest --port HTTP:80
 ℹ️  Created load balancer postgrest</code></pre><p>Let's break down this command:</p><ul><li><code>fargate lb create postgrest</code>: create an ALB named <code>postgrest</code>.</li><li><code>--port HTTP:80</code>: the load balancer will accept internet requests on port 80.</li><li>If you've deleted your default VPC, or wish to use a different VPC, be sure to specify the appropriate subnets (this flag can be used multiple times):<br><code>--subnet-id subnet-0ae7XXX</code></li><li>You can also optionally specify multiple security groups with the <code>--security-group-id sg-02ddXXX</code> flag. </li></ul><h3 id="3-deploy-a-postgrest-task-">3. Deploy a PostgREST task:</h3><p>This command will deploy the PostgREST image to a Fargate task. It automatically creates a new ECS cluster and a default IAM role for task execution.</p><pre><code>fargate service create postgrest \

  --image 'registry.hub.docker.com/postgrest/postgrest' \
  --num 1 \

  --env PGRST_DB_SCHEMA='api' \
  --env PGRST_DB_ANON_ROLE='web_anon'
  ℹ️ Created service postgrest</code></pre><p>A quick review of the flags we used:</p><ul><li><code>fargate service create postgrest</code>: create a <code>postgrest</code> Fargate service in a new ECS cluster.</li><li><code>--lb postgrest --port HTTP:3000</code>: connect this service to your load balancer.</li><li><code>--image 'registry.hub.docker.com/postgrest/postgrest'</code>: deploy the <code>postgrest</code> image from dockerhub.</li><li><code>--env PGRST_DB_URI='postgres://authenticator:secret1@HOST/startup'</code>: set <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING">URI</a> for access to your database. Note this is the username/password/db you setup in step 1.</li><li><code>--env PGRST_DB_SCHEMA='api'</code>: name the API you created in step 1.</li><li><code>--env PGRST_DB_ANON_ROLE='web_anon'</code>: name the role you created in step 1.</li></ul><h3 id="4-test-troubleshoot">4. Test/Troubleshoot</h3><p>If things go as planned, you'll be able to find your load balancer hostname with:</p><pre><code>$ fargate lb list | grep postgrest
postgrest	Application	Active	
postgrest-132447124.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com	HTTP:80</code></pre><p>Now, you can query your new API:</p><pre><code>curl postgrest-132447124.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/trees
[{"id":1,"name":"Banyan","species":"Ficus benghalensis"},
 {"id":2,"name":"Quaking Aspen","species":"Populus tremula"},
 {"id":3,"name":"American Elm","species":"Ulmus americana"},
 {"id":4,"name":"Red Maple","species":"Acer rubrum"}]</code></pre><h2 id="cost">Cost</h2><p>AWS's "free tier" doesn't include Fargate, so here’s the bottom line: it will cost you $2.83 to run PostgREST on a Fargate &nbsp;for one month, while easily serving 500 requests/second. This is with the smallest single instance available - there is tons of room to scale both vertically and horizontally with this architecture.</p><p><strong>Caution:</strong> the load balancer costs are more significant (~$16+/mo), but they are included in the "free tier" and can be shared between many Fargate (and Lambda/EC2) services.</p><h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2><ul><li>Looking for more than a read-only API? You can enable authenticated access to read and write private information in your database. PostgREST supports JWT authentication, which maps to Postgres roles you configure. You can even enable row-level security. <a href="https://postgrest.org/en/v7.0.0/tutorials/tut1.html">Tutorial is here</a>, with <a href="https://postgrest.org/en/v7.0.0/auth.html">further details here</a>.</li><li>Please enable TLS (SSL) on your load balancer, and require encrypted connections to PostgREST. We don't want your credentials leaking!</li><li>In production, you might use an infrastructure-as-code tool like Terraform or CDK to deploy your Fargate tasks. These tools offer more control and customization than the Fargate CLI.</li><li>Want more content like this? Follow me on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/nedmcclain">@nedmcclain</a>.

It has the highest RAM and largest storage since it needs to run multiple GitLab CI build jobs, perform proxying to the other instances, and run a VPN so I can access the local network from anywhere. It also acts a Kubernetes node, but typically doesn’t host anything unless the others are full.</p><p>The <strong>s1</strong> and <strong>s2</strong> instances are meant for hosting applications via Kubernetes.</p><p>The <strong>w1</strong> instance can be used for hosting applications via Kubernetes. But, it is more of a general purpose box to SSH into for ad-hoc Linux work, use as a <a href="https://www.docker.com/blog/how-to-deploy-on-remote-docker-hosts-with-docker-compose/#:~:text=A%20remote%20Docker%20host%20is,remote%20host%20in%20several%20ways.">remote Docker host</a>, and run long-running jobs or fan-spinning jobs I don’t want to run on my MacBook Pro.</p><h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2><h3 id="storage">Storage</h3><p>For storage I am using <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-256GB-Extreme-UHS-I-SDSDXXY-256G-GN4IN/dp/B07H9VX76D/ref=sr_1_2?crid=GZY4QWXOYYJR&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=sandisk+sdxc+card&amp;qid=1610551297&amp;sprefix=sandisk+sd+cards%2Caps%2C160&amp;sr=8-2">SDXC flash memory cards</a> instead of an external hard drive to keep it portable and fast. SDXC cards, however, can be prone to failure on heavy read/write workloads. I haven’t had too much of a problem with this though, using reputable cards from a manufacturer like SanDisk lowers the odds of a card failure. Any vital data is placed in or backed up to <a href="#system--storage">the s3fs mount</a> regularly.</p><h3 id="network-switch">Network Switch</h3><p>At the bottom, I am using a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/NETGEAR-8-Port-Gigabit-Ethernet-Unmanaged/dp/B07PFYM5MZ/ref=sr_1_3?crid=3L02KVPMAQV8S&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=netgear+network+switch&amp;qid=1610513653&amp;sprefix=netgear+network%2Caps%2C170&amp;sr=8-3">NETGEAR Ethernet network switch</a> so I can plug in the cluster into a router using a single connection and that connection can be split 4 ways to each instance. While I always leave the instances plugged into the switch, I usually don’t connect the switch to a router as the instances <a href="#networking">can also connect over WiFi</a> and those speeds are tolerable most of the time.</p><h3 id="cable-management-and-power">Cable Management and Power</h3><p>In order to keep the build clean, short cables are used to connect the network cables to the network switch and the USB power cables to the reliable <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-10-Port-Charger-PowerPort-iPhone/dp/B00YRYS4T4/ref=sr_1_13?crid=1KU57ZAEHMG8T&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=anker+usb+power+supply&amp;qid=1610513955&amp;sprefix=anker+usb+c+power%2Caps%2C187&amp;sr=8-13">Anker USB power supply</a>. Any longer cables are wound, zip-tied, and hidden in the back.</p><p>Since both the network switch and the USB power supply have an AC adapter, I attached a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/JSVER-Portable-Desktop-Charging-Station/dp/B074KBN8FY/ref=sr_1_11?dchild=1&amp;keywords=mini+power+strip&amp;qid=1610514053&amp;sr=8-11">mini power strip</a> at the top that they both plug into, so there is only one external power cable coming out of the otherwise self-contained cluster that needs to be plugged into the wall.</p><h2 id="system--storage">System &amp; Storage</h2><p>The system runs <a href="https://ubuntu.com/download/raspberry-pi">Ubuntu Server Edition for Raspberry Pi</a>. I have flashing scripts that can flash SDXC cards with the operating system and custom initialization scripts for each instance. The initialization scripts handle numerous things including:</p><ul><li>Installing and running instance specific applications (<a href="https://microk8s.io/">Kubernetes via microk8s</a>, <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/index.html">GitLab CI Runner</a>, <a href="https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/v2.0/getting-started/install-traefik/">Traefik</a>, <a href="https://github.com/hwdsl2/docker-ipsec-vpn-server">VPN server</a>, etc.) and polls for updates to the initialization scripts using a cron so I can modify the software stack without re-flashing.</li><li>Mounting an S3 bucket via <a href="https://github.com/s3fs-fuse/s3fs-fuse">s3fs</a> for remote storage and shared storage between the cluster instances.</li><li>The entire operating system is commited to a Git repository at the root <code>/</code>. This saves a checkpoint of the server’s file system before anything else is installed. Then, with a script containing some simple <code>git</code> commands I can blow everything away if I need to restore and start an instance over from scratch without having to pop out the SDXC card and re-flash. This can be tricky since <code>git</code> isn’t made for volatile use cases like this, but it has worked suprisingly well with a proper <code>.gitignore</code> file.</li></ul><h2 id="networking">Networking</h2><p>The initialization scripts automatically connect to WiFi so an Ethernet connection is not required, but can be used.</p><p>The <strong>main</strong> instance is exposed to the external network. The router port forwards specific ports to the <strong>main</strong> instance and other instances are proxied to <strong>main</strong> via Kubernetes and then Traefik exposes Kubernetes services and the VPN server to the external internet on <strong>main</strong>. The <strong>main</strong> instance updates a Route53 DNS record with its public IP address every few minutes as a method of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_DNS">dynamic DNS</a>.</p><p>Traefik and/or Kubernetes with <a href="https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/kubernetes/">cert-manager</a> automatically issues TLS certificates for applications using <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let’s Encrypt</a>.</p><p>Finally, instances can be accessed at hostnames like <code>main.local</code> or <code>s1.local</code> on the local network for SSH access automatically because the instances will publish themselves via the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/avahi">Avahi daemon</a> using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonjour_(software)">Bonjour/Zeroconf protocol</a>.</p><h2 id="running-x86-on-raspberry-pi">Running x86 on Raspberry Pi</h2><p>The biggest downside to running on Raspberry Pi right now is the fact that it runs on ARM. That means many GitLab CI builds will fail since the Docker images might only be available for x86. There’s reason to believe this might change since Apple’s new chips are ARM-based and that will surely push adoption forward.</p><p>For now, however, I implemented a solution similar to Apple’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21304182/apple-arm-mac-rosetta-2-emulation-app-converter-explainer">Rosetta 2</a> for running x86 applications on ARM. I use <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/QemuUserEmulation">QEMU’s user emulation</a> along with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binfmt_misc"><code>binfmt_misc</code></a> capability of the Linux kernel to transparently run x86 executables on the instances. This can also be done to <a href="https://github.com/multiarch/qemu-user-static">enable running and building x86 Docker images</a>.</p><p>However, just doing this, doesn’t seamlessly work as dynamically linked binaries need to be able to access x86 shared libraries not ARM ones. In order to solve this, I download a x86 version of the same Ubuntu Server image and place the files in a directory <code>/x86_root/</code>. Then, I use <code>chroot</code> to run the x86 version of <code>/x86_root/bin/bash</code> against <code>/x86_root/</code>. The result is a nice working x86 shell on your ARM-based Raspberry Pi!</p><p>I go one step further and wrap running the shell with <code>chroot</code> into an executable script. I create a new SSH user <code>ajay-x86@</code> that allows me to SSH and drop directly into an x86 shell instead of the native ARM shell I would get if SSH into <code>ajay@</code>.</p><p>The whole solution is elegant, simple, and has worked extremely well in my usage.</p><h2 id="casing-and-cooling">Casing and Cooling</h2><p>The Pi boards are cased for protection along with a fan to prevent throttling of the CPU. The fan usually keeps it below $50^{\circ}$ celsius on idle and $70^{\circ}$ celsius at peak.</p><p>All of the different boxes are attached together using <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07JHQJHP4/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">ceramic magnets</a> (which are glued to the surfaces with a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KPYB05A/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">cyanoacrylate glue</a>). This allows them to be disassembled and quickly snapped back together for easy portable transport in a smaller container.</p><figure><img src="https://media.ajayp.app/posts/2020/06/magnets.gif" loading="lazy" alt="Magnetic Connectors" title="Magnetic Connectors" width="200"><figcaption>Yeah, <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/J0IqVC8mTwk?t=149">magnets</a>.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="cost">Cost</h2><p>All in all, the system cost around ~$600. The equivalent instances on AWS would cost around (without accounting for bandwidth / storage costs):</p><p>$$ 1 \space\text{8GB instance} * $0.05\space/\space\text{hour} * 24 * 30 * 12 $$
$$ +\space 3 \space\text{4GB instances} * $0.04\space/\space\text{hour} * 24 * 30 * 12 $$
$$ = $1,468.80\space/\space\text{year} $$</p><p>Yes, you could likely optimize this cost a little bit using RIs or a different host, but as a rough calculation, it works out to be much more affordable (especially over multiple years) and you get to avoid the suprise bills of AWS services.</p><p>But, you should still probably only use this for development or individual use cases, even though it can be served to the internet.</p><h2 id="size">Size</h2><p>Finally, for a sense of scale, the server is actually not that large and can be tucked away pretty easily especially since it can connect via WiFi.</p><figure><img src="https://media.ajayp.app/posts/2020/06/server_scale.jpg" loading="lazy" width="300"></figure></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>In a previous post I wrote that I live in a part of the world that <a href="https://ruky.me/2020/12/28/sri-lanka-need-unlimited-internet-connections/" data-type="post" data-id="107">does not provide unlimited internet</a>.</p>
<p>This means data is valuable, and if I run out of data, I have to pay a premium amount to activate a data add-on which can be quite expensive. There is one router at our apartment, and we all share the data among ourselves, and we hope that we are all using in a fair manner without over spending on streaming, or downloads, in an unfair way. </p>
<p>The easiest way for anyone to do is use the nighttime data for their streaming and downloads, and leave to peak day time data for office and other important work. (Yes if you are reading this from USA, we have peak and off peak time data for home broadband)</p>
<p>A detailed usage report provided by my ISP suggested to me that there is a WhatsApp addict in my apartment, who is spending large amount of data for WhatsApp video calls.</p>
<p>Since I’m the person who is paying the internet bill, and I need data for more important work than making WhatsApp video calls, I wanted a way to stop people from spending my data in unnecessarily ways, and use their own mobile data if they have to make WhatsApp or any other video calls.</p>
<p>Since I can’t go and ask from each and every individual whether they are spending too much time on WhatsApp video calls, I decided to block all WhatsApp communications at the router level.</p>
<p>Initially I thought this would be a walk in the park, just log in to my router dashboard, and block the WhatsApp URL, IP addresses and ports. Just a two minute job.</p>
<p>But this lead me to rabbit hole that too more than several hours, and made me yield without finding a solution.</p>
<h2>Google search</h2>
<p>A search on Google shows that people have been asking for a way to block WhatsApp, going back to several years.</p>
<p>The first approach which I found in a StackOverflow answer was to block the domain <strong><em>c.whatsapp.net </em></strong> according to the answer, this is the domain which handshakes at initiation of the app. And according to the poster, if we can block this domain, we would be able to block initiation a connection to WhatsApp server, and therefore successfully block WhatsApp.</p>
<p>I flagged the domain and tested, but to it did not prove to successfully block WhatsApp.</p>
<p>So I decided to search even further, another <a href="https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/203475/how-to-block-whatsapp-traffic-in-tp-link-router" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">answer also posted on StackOverflow</a> told me to block some ports, with TCP and UDP connections. These included TCP ports 5222, 5223, 5228 and 3478.</p>
<p>I painstakingly blocked all upstream and downstream TCP and UDP connections from my router, hoping it would block WhatsApp. But that did not also proved to be effective.</p>
<h2>Trying to find an IP addresses</h2>
<p>There has to be a way to block WhatsApp right? So why can’t I find an IP address or list of IP addresses, that I can block from my router, and finally block WhatsApp for good?</p>
<p>There was one IP address range that I found in the same SO answer, 31.13.64.0/18.</p>
<p>So I decided to block the IP addresses, and tested to see if it works, but unfortunately that also did not seem to work.</p>
<p>So I did further digging, and came to the GitHub post, which showed a comprehensive list of domains and IP addresses, that according to the poster, should be able to successfully block WhatsApp, or most of the connections to WhatsApp.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ukanth/afwall/wiki/HOWTO-blocking-WhatsApp">https://github.com/ukanth/afwall/wiki/HOWTO-blocking-WhatsApp</a></p>
<p>There it seems WhatsApp has multiple domains from c.whatsapp.net to c20.whatsapp.com and e.whatsapp.net to e20.whatsapp.com.</p>
<p>Also multiple IP ranges, and ports, but even though I tried all of them, none seemed to work. Why can’t I block a simple app from accessing though my router?</p>
<p>I guess they may have changed their domains, or added more domains and IP addresses by now, since WhatsApp has grown in popularity since most of these answers were posted on different forums.</p>
<h2>WhatsApp will tell you their IPs, only if you pay</h2>
<p>It seems like WhatsApp shares there IP addresses only to network operators and if you pay them to do it. </p>
<blockquote><p>WhatsApp is currently providing special pricing campaign service for Mobile operators, the IP pool is only available for those operators. Please note that we have migrated the latest IP pools of WhatsApp to Facebook Mobile Partner Portal and the IP pool update process has been fully automated.</p><cite><a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/cidr.txt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.whatsapp.com/cidr.txt</a></cite></blockquote>
<p>So there is no way for me to know what are the IP addresses and ports that I should block in order to prevent WhatsApp from using my network, without randomly blocking ports and IPs and breaking my access to internet.</p>
<p>It seems almost all the posts I found on the internet, the people who originally asked the question also did not find a clear way to block WhatsApp. So I guess it’s not just me.</p>
<p>So how would you block WhatsApp if you faced with a similar situation? If you want your employees to stop using WhatsApp or other IM service during their working hours?</p>
<p>I’m left with no other option but to change my router password, so no one else can access internet via my router and my internet connection.</p>

<p>BERLIN — A call for Berlin to renew its commitment to NATO’s nuclear defense in a gesture of solidarity with the United States has prompted a heated backlash among Germany’s Greens, the party seen as the likely kingmaker in the country’s next government.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A high-profile group of German and American academics and strategic advisers delivered the NATO call in a more than 8,000-word&nbsp;<a href="https://anewagreement.org/en/" target="_blank">paper</a>&nbsp;titled “More Ambition, Please!,” urging Berlin to seize the moment presented by the change in administration in Washington.</p>



<p>“The erosion of transatlantic relations is a strategic crisis for Germany,” the signatories argue in a prelude to specific policy recommendations for transatlantic cooperation on everything from climate change to trade. “Without this alliance, a stable and united Europe cannot be sustained, and neither can the international order be renewed.”</p>



<p>While such conclusions may sound self-evident to American ears, they are not universally shared in Germany, especially when it comes to the country’s role in NATO and in ensuring Europe’s nuclear defense.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Those questions remain particularly contentious in the Green party, which, despite moderating its stances on many policy fronts in recent years, never abandoned its pacifist, antiwar roots. Support for the transatlantic declaration by moderate forces in the party triggered a fierce reaction by leading members of the Greens’ left wing, underscoring the difficulty that lies ahead for the Biden administration as it seeks to repair and renew America’s strategic bonds in Europe following the divisive Trump years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’m very irritated,”&nbsp;Agnieszka Brugger,&nbsp;deputy leader of the Greens’ parliamentary group,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/gruene-heinrich-boell-stiftung-verteidigungspolitik-1.5182258" target="_blank">told</a>&nbsp;the daily Süddeutsche Zeitung. She said she was especially annoyed that the paper was supported by Ellen Ueberschär, the co-head of the Heinrich Böll Stiftung, the Greens’ de facto in-house think tank (Ueberschär not only signed the controversial paper, she co-wrote an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/transatlantisch-traut-euch-wir-brauchen-eine-neue-uebereinkunft/26827522.html" target="_blank">op-ed</a>&nbsp;in Berlin’s Tagesspiegel encouraging others to embrace the initiative as well.).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper’s signatories – a group that includes the likes of James D. Bindenagel, a retired American ambassador who spent much of his career in Germany, and Boris Ruge, a German ambassador currently serving as deputy head of the&nbsp;<a href="https://securityconference.org/en/" target="_blank">Munich Security Conference</a>&nbsp;— acknowledge the corrosive effect Donald Trump had on the alliance, while also highlighting “German neglect and failures” on defense spending and in pursuing the controversial&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/angela-merkel-joe-biden-nord-stream-2/">Nord Stream 2</a>&nbsp;pipeline project with Russia.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The group ascribes a central role to Germany in Europe’s broader effort to keep the U.S. engaged in the region, saying that in order to meet that responsibility, Germany should accelerate its push to increase defense spending to ensure “a deployable military.” Critics say Germany’s military, known as the Bundeswehr, has been plagued for years by underfunding and chronic mismanagement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“A deployable military gives weight to diplomacy, adds an indispensable contribution to transatlantic credibility, strengthens the deterrence capability of NATO, and consequently defends the freedom of German citizens,” the paper argues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A key aspect of Germany’s mission should be to remain engaged in NATO’s “nuclear-sharing arrangements,” a reference to Germany’s longstanding commitment to deliver U.S. atomic bombs in the event of an attack. To maintain that role, Berlin needs to replace the country’s aging fleet of combat aircraft equipped to carry out the role.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The U.S. nuclear shield is essential to all non-nuclear NATO countries in Europe,” the paper says.&nbsp;“It should exist for as long as nuclear weapons exist and the nuclear threat looms.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>But many on Germany’s left, including factions in both the Green party and the Social Democrats, oppose the move and want the U.S. to remove the nuclear warheads it has stationed in Germany.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>While Greens have enshrined the goal of a nuclear-free Europe into their party platform, some in the party see the weapons as a necessary evil for as long as Europe remains threatened by Russia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That pragmatic approach to security has helped broaden the party’s appeal to centrist voters in recent years and is one reason why many political observers believe it is likely to enter a coalition with the center-right Christian Democrats, Germany’s dominant political force, after national elections in the fall. The Greens are currently polling at about 20 percent, more than double their showing in the last election in 2017.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite the party’s newfound mainstream appeal, the friction over Germany’s continued role in guaranteeing NATO’s nuclear deterrent suggests that Green acceptance of existing norms is far from settled.</p>



<p>Many in the party believe Germany should abandon NATO’s spending target, which calls on members to strive towards investing 2 percent of their GDP on defense. Brugger, in her Süddeutsche interview, called the focus on military spending “false and dangerous.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some Greens also want Germany to sign the United Nations’&nbsp;<a href="https://www.un.org/disarmament/wmd/nuclear/tpnw/" target="_blank">nuclear ban treaty</a>, which goes into effect on Friday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Among them is Jürgen Trittin, a veteran Green MP and former minister. He&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/JTrittin/status/1352367821003628547" target="_blank">tweeted</a>&nbsp;that he could only “slap his forehead” over Ueberschär’s support for the initiative to renew the transatlantic alliance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the Greens’ moderate and more ideological wings have a long history of locking horns on policy issues, the military question is particularly explosive because opposition to all things nuclear lies at the core of the party’s identity.</p>



<p>Even so, the party has a history of breaking with orthodoxy, most notably by&nbsp;<a href="http://ghdi.ghi-dc.org/sub_document.cfm?document_id=3723" target="_blank">supporting</a>&nbsp;NATO’s 1999&nbsp;military intervention in Kosovo. If the Greens are to join the conservatives in forming a government after the September election, the consensus-driven party may have no choice but to redraw its red lines once again.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

n a recent interview, Bill Zeitler, IBM's General Manager for the AS/400 Division, was asked a very blunt question: What are you betting the AS/400 business on today?  His answer, in all of two words, was "Network Computing".  In the next breath, he explained that he wasn't just talking about connectivity, but about conducting business electronically, over the Internet, and largely by virtue of a superior Java environment.

</p><p>
It's remarkable to think that IBM is basing so much of its future on, of all things, a programming language, and on a programming language that not only didn't exist a few years ago, but also was developed by an IBM competitor, Sun Microsystems.  What on earth could a new programming language offer to merit such attention?  Some new killer op-code?  A revolutionary new way to program a do-loop?

<img src="https://www.tug.ca/articles/Volume13/V13N1/V13N1_Jenkins_Fig-1.jpg" alt="Figure 1. ">

</p><p>
The answer is that there is not much in the Java language itself to write home about - it is a slightly simplified and streamlined version of C++, with some features that make it suitable for running applications over a network - the Internet, for an obvious example.  However, Java does have the revolutionary attribute of being hardware platform and operating system independent: "Write Once, Run Anywhere" is the battle cry of the Java faithful, and when you think about it, it certainly would change the industry landscape if hardware platforms and their respective operating systems became the handmaidens of applications, not vice versa.  Put a Java applet on your Web page, and it can be used, unchanged, by a Windows user in Buenos Aires, a Mac bigot in Australia, a Unix nut in Sweden, and an OS/2 diehard in Singapore (and all this with no royalties accruing to Microsoft!)

</p><p>
Thus, Java has the potential, at least, to break the hold that the hardware and operating system monoliths have on the computer world, and could make hardware and software tycoons like Steve Jobs and Bill Gates as obsolete in the 21st century as railway barons have become in the 20th.  From IBM's point of view, if business application software were uncoupled from hardware platforms and operating systems, then computer systems could be sold on their own merits - robustness, security, manageability, etc. - and IBM no doubt feels that with the AS/400 they can compete quite well on that playing field.

</p><p>
Computer industry geopolitics aside, Java has become the Next Big Thing in the computer field - and if you're not constantly eager to get in on the Next Big Thing (even before you've fully mastered the Previous Three Big Things), then why the heck did you choose this industry to work in!

<img src="https://www.tug.ca/articles/Volume13/V13N1/V13N1_Jenkins_Fig-2.jpg" alt="Figure 2. ">

</p><p>
Since Java was introduced by Sun Microsystems, the Java Development Kit (JDK) has been available to be downloaded free over the Internet.  The JDK (now at version 1.1) includes a Java compiler, an applet viewer, and standard class libraries.  However, it is strictly command line based.  If you want to design the graphical interface of your application on-screen, as well as take advantage of the other benefits of graphical integrated development environments, you have to open your wallet a bit and look at something like Borland's JBuilder, Microsoft's Visual J++, or Symantec's Visual Café.  Or, as of July 25, IBM's Visual Age for Java.

</p><p>
The latest in IBM's Visual Age series of development environments had been available in a beta test version for several months, but recently Version 1.0 was officially released.  It's available in two flavours: the Professional Edition, and the pricier Enterprise Edition, which adds support for team development, as well as "Enterprise Access Builders" - tools for developing components to connect a Java client to various database platforms.  Within the Visual Age for Java environment you can create both applications and "applets" - Java programs that can be embedded in an HTML document and run by Web browsers which implement the JVM (Java Virtual Machine).  (Note that Visual Age for Java includes its own JVM as well as an applet viewer, so you can view and test your programs locally).  VA for Java also has a version control capability, and a debugger is included.

</p><p>
The Professional Edition is priced to compete with its counterparts mentioned above - that is, in the 100 - 200 dollar range per license.  However, if even that amount is a deterrent to you, the neophyte dabbler in Java, you may be interested to know that you can download a free copy of the Entry Edition - which contains all the functionality of the Professional Edition, minus only the documentation and online help, and limited to the creation of 100 classes.  In the remainder of this article, I'll show how you can download and install the Entry Edition of Visual Age for Java, and have a quick look at some of its features.

</p><p>
First, you'll have to consider the prerequisites, which are pretty significant, particularly for RAM.  You'll need Windows 95 or Windows NT 4.0 or OS/2 Warp V4, an SVGA display, and, IBM says, 32MB of RAM (with 48MB recommended), at least 45MB of free disk space for the software (with an additional 30MB free disk space for swapping), and lastly, an unzip program.

</p><p>
If you're still standing, here's where you can find the Entry Edition on the Internet: <a href="http://www.software.ibm.com/ad/vajava" target="_blank"> www.software.ibm.com/ad/vajava</a>.  (Before downloading it, you should uninstall any Beta versions of the product from your system).  The Windows version of the download file (wenty100.ZIP) is a single .ZIP file almost 22MB in size - so you'll finally be able to wallpaper that bathroom while it's downloading.  Download it into a temporary directory, then unzip it.  One of the unzipped files is a setup.exe file, which can be invoked to complete the installation.  There is also an install.txt file with further installation and troubleshooting information.
After a successful installation, you'll have an "IBM Visual Age for Java" icon on your desktop to invoke the program.  It will bring up the Workbench window seen in Figure 1.  It will also bring up the "Quick Start" window seen in Figure 2 (which also can be brought up at any time from the Window… Quick Start… menu option).  If you select to create a new applet, as shown, you will be taken to a Smart Guide window (comparable to a Windows 95 "wizard"), which prompts you for applet name, project, and package, and whether you want to design the applet visually, or write source code for it.  If you select the former, the Visual Composition Editor is invoked (Figure 3).

<img src="https://www.tug.ca/articles/Volume13/V13N1/V13N1_Jenkins_Fig-3.jpg" alt="Figure 3. ">

</p><p>
The Visual Composition Editor allows you to create a graphical interface, with all the usual components - buttons, lists, menus, entry fields, etc., which it calls (in yet another of those coffee metaphors which are already becoming tiresome) "beans".  These are selectable from the left hand side of the window.  Beyond just laying out an application window, basic application logic can be constructed by making connections between components in the window (marked out with the dashed line), or with non-visual components outside the window.  In the example shown, the Remove button has been connected to the list, to indicate that clicking Remove should delete the highlighted item from the list.  The source code for this event logic is then generated automatically.
With Version 1.0, "beans" for all the standard Java Class Libraries are available.  In future, more sophisticated - and AS/400-specific - components will accessible, allowing, for example, access to files and fields in DB2/400, analogous to using externally described files in RPG/400.

</p><p>
Regardless of how many pre-built components, or "beans", are available, there will always be a requirement for new classes in any custom application.  VA for Java of course enables the creation of such classes in the old fashioned way - typing source code - with Smart Guides that prompt you and provide some of the fundamental class definition code.  And even if you are programming the old fashioned way, the VA for Java environment makes life easier by making instantly accessible the definitions of all the classes on the system and their methods, organized by their respective packages, whether standard Java classes or your own previously created classes (see again Figure 1).  If, like me, you've tried to learn and program Java from one of the many books available today, you may have been frustrated by not having access to such comprehensive documentation of the numerous standard Java classes.

</p><div><p>
What I've given above is just a quick overview of IBM's Java development environment - and admittedly not much reference is made to where the AS/400 comes into all this.  The AS/400, as of V3R7, does not currently natively support Java applications - a coming release of OS/400 will rectify that.  And as of the time of writing this article, much of the AS/400-specific Java development capability is still under construction.  In future articles, I hope to explore more AS/400-related capabilities of Java as they become available.  In the meantime, the latest scoop from IBM is of course available on the Internet, at www.software.ibm.com/ad/vajava.

<h2><a name="caveat">CAVEAT</a></h2><a name="caveat">
<br>
This one of my pages is not well maintained.  This is a jumble of poorly-organized information; some info is quite useful, some is not.  I keep it around only because there of the few good nuggets buried in it.
</a><a name="the_problems_being_addressed"><h2>The problems being addressed</h2>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⚈&nbsp;&nbsp;Your web page the wrong characters coming out where accented letters should be.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⚈&nbsp;&nbsp;You are upgrading from MySQL 4.0, where characters were simply bytes.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⚈&nbsp;&nbsp;You are trying to wrap your head around how MySQL handles CHARSET / COLLATION.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⚈&nbsp;&nbsp;You upgraded, and now you are getting garbage.
<p>

Please read most of this document.  I know it is long (after all, I wrote it!)
But you really need to understand a lot of the pieces in it, in order
to solve your problem.
</p><p>

The tips in this document apply to MySQL, MariaDB, and Percona.
Version differences are called out where relevant.
</p></a><a name="basic_concepts"><h2>Basic Concepts</h2>
<br>
"Character" and "byte" are different!
You must understand this before continuing.
A "byte" is an a-bit thing; it is the unit of space in computers (today).
A "character" is composed of one or more bytes, and represents what we think
of when reading.
<p>

A byte can represent only 256 different values.
There are over 11,000 Korean characters and over 40,000 Chinese characters --
no way to squeeze such a character into a single byte.
</p><p>

Charset vs collation.  These are different things!
'Charset' ('character set'; 'encoding') refers to the bits used to represent 'characters'.
'Collation' refers to how those bits could be compare for inequality (WHERE)
and sorting (ORDER BY).  GROUP BY and FOREIGN KEY CONSTRAINTS can also involve collation.
And it even can involve deciding whether two different bit strings compare 'equal'.
</p></a><a name="history"><h2>History</h2>
<br>
1950's -- A character was (sometimes) represented in only 5 bits, on "paper tape"; no lowercase; had to "shift" to switch between letters and digits.
<br>
1960's -- A character was 6 bits; no lower case.  "Punched cards" were used.
<br>
1970's -- 7-bit ASCII becomes common -- that limits you to English.
And the 8-bit "byte" was invented and was coming into common usage (re: IBM 360).
<br>
1980's -- Beginning to see 8-bit encodings.  Especially since 7-bit ASCII
was wasting a bit of the omni-present "byte".
This can handle Western European accented letters.
<br>
1990's -- The computer world realizes that there are other people in
the world and embarks on Unicode and UTF8.  ("UTF" = "Unicode Transformation Format")
<p>

Meanwhile, MySQL is born,
but has enough problems without worrying about character sets.
Through version 4.0, a CHAR is just a byte.
You can put any kind of bytes, representing anything, into a VARCHAR.
Thus, begins the need for this discussion.
</p><p>

MySQL 4.1 introduced the concept of "character set" and "collation".
If you had legacy data or legacy code, you probably did not notice
that you were messing things up when you upgraded.
Or you started with 4.1 (or later) and "latin1 / latin1_swedish_ci"
and failed to notice that you were asking for trouble.
</p><p>

Today, it's pretty safe to simply lay down the law and say
"Use utf8 for all text."
If you have version 5.5.3 or later,
"Use utf8mb4 for all text."
</p><p>

Sure, there are other character sets,
and they are useful if you have a narrow focus.
But, you may as well use utf8mb4.
</p></a><a href="https://docs.python.org/2/howto/unicode.html">Another take on the History</a><a name="best_practice"><h2>Best Practice</h2>
<br>
Best practice is to go completely utf8mb4.
I will focus on utf8 and utf8mb4, but if you choose to do otherwise, keep reading;
most of this discussion can still be adapted to the charset of your choice.
<p>

For collation, probably the best 'overall' collation is utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci (if available) or utf8mb4_unicode_520_ci.
<i>0900</i> refers to UCA 9.0.  xxx_unicode_520_ci collations are based on UCA 5.2.0 weight keys: https://www.unicode.org/Public/UCA/5.2.0/allkeys.txt.
Unnumbered Collations are based on the older UCA 4.0.0.
</p><p>

A web page (if that is what you have) should begin with
</p><tt>&lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /&gt;</tt>
<p>

Establish the characterset for talking to the MySQL server:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⚈&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><tt>init_connect = 'SET NAMES utf8'</tt>  in my.cnf
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⚈&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>SET NAMES utf8</tt> -- done immediately after connecting
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⚈&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>SET GLOBAL VARIABLE character_set_...</tt> SET NAMES does the three you need.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⚈&nbsp;&nbsp;In some cases in your my.cnf (my.ini) file, add this under [mysql] or [client]: <tt>default-character-set = utf8</tt>
<p>

For PHP:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⚈&nbsp;&nbsp;(deprecated; DO NOT USE mysql_* !) mysql interface: </p><tt>mysql_set_charset('utf8');</tt> (assuming PHP 5.2.3 &amp; MySQL 5.0.7)  Note: "mysql_" interface is deprecated.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⚈&nbsp;&nbsp;mysqli interface: <tt>mysqli_set_charset('utf8') function</tt>.  See </a><a href="https://secure.php.net/manual/en/mysqli.set-charset.php">mysqli_set_charset</a>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⚈&nbsp;&nbsp;PDO interface: set the charset attribute of the PDO dsn or via SET NAMES utf8mb4.
<a href="https://php.net/manual/en/ref.pdo-mysql.connection.php">PDO manual</a><p>

For Java (JDBC):
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⚈&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><tt>?useUnicode=yes&amp;characterEncoding=UTF-8</tt> in the getConnection() call.
<br>
For Hikari (perhaps):
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⚈&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.connection.characterEncoding=utf-8</tt>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⚈&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.connection.CharSet=utf-8</tt>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⚈&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.connection.useUnicode=true</tt>
<br>
(or maybe it is =yes and =utf8)
<p>

add
</p><pre>spring:
  datasource:
     connectionInitSql: "SET NAMES 'utf8mb4'"
</pre>
in the application.yml.  connectionInitSql is used by HikariCP when it open the connection.

<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/45305951/1766831">Something about 'filters'</a></p><p>

SET NAMES can be invoked by your language just like
other non-SELECT commands: mysqli_query(), do(), execute(), etc.
</p><p>

I digress here for a note about GRANTs.
'root', and any other user from </p><tt>GRANT ALL ON *.*</tt>,
because it has "SUPER" privilege, will skip the <tt>init_connect</tt>,
so that technique is not 'perfect'.
<p>

<a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/charset-connection.html">SET NAMES</a></p><p>

Declare most CHAR/TEXT columns in all tables as CHARSET utf8.
Some exceptions: columns with hex (MD5, GUID), ...
These should be BINARY or CHAR charset ASCII.
</p><p>

Collation?
</p><p>

For true text, utf8_unicode_ci is best.  It handles the complex
rules of "combining chararacters", etc.
It handles essentially all languages simultaneously, but compromises on ordering.
</p><p>

utf8_general_ci is the default for utf8, so you may accidently
get this.  It is a little faster than utf8_unicode_ci and
works ok for many situations.
</p><p>

utf8_bin says to just compare the bytes.
CHAR/TEXT utf8 with utf8_bin validates (on INSERT) that the bytes comprise valid
utf8 bytes, but does not do anything useful for comparisions other than
exact (no case folding, etc) equality.
BINARY/BLOB should be usually be used instead CHAR+utf8;
this stores the bytes without any checking.
</p><p>

Alas, MySQL's collations think of case folding and accent-stripping as equivalent.
That is, there is no utf8 collation for case folding, but keeping accents distinct.
Do </p><tt>SHOW COLLATION LIKE '%cs';</tt> to see the few collations that work that way.
<p>

This document is evolving.  It started with just 'utf8', but the 'standard' is becoming 'utf8mb4'.
The document is inconsistent as to which it specifies.
If you are running MySQL before 5.5.3, you have only 'utf8'.
If you need Emoji or Chinese, then you need 'utf8mb4'.
</p><a name="conversions_and_common_errors"><h2>Conversions and Common Errors</h2>
<br>
This is a summary of how things work, and what is likely to go wrong.
<p>

There are 3 dimensions to character set problems:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⚈&nbsp;&nbsp;How the client's bytes are encoded when INSERTing, and what encoding you want when SELECTing;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⚈&nbsp;&nbsp;What SET NAMES you use (or what the default is);
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⚈&nbsp;&nbsp;The CHARACTER SET on the column definition.
</p><p>

All is well if the SET NAMES agrees with the encoding of the bytes in the Client.
The column's CHARACTER SET need not agree with SET NAMES; if they differ, a conversion will be performed for you.
If your characters exist in both encodings, the conversion will be transparent.
If a source character does not exist in the target encoding
(example: when converting a Chinese character from utf8mb4 to latin1), a "?" is usually put in its place.
</p><p>

The main thing that can go wrong is that SET NAMES can disagree with the Client's bytes.
Let's walk an acute-e (é) through the INSERT and SELECT.  First, note the encodings for é:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⚈&nbsp;&nbsp;Hex for latin1's 1-byte encoding: E9
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⚈&nbsp;&nbsp;Hex for utf8's 2-byte encoding: C3A9
<br>
(BTW, this and some other encodings are enumerated below.)
</p><p>

Case 1: SET NAMES latin1 (the default) is in effect and your application is thinking in utf8.
It INSERTs é encoded as utf8 (hex C3A9):
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⚈&nbsp;&nbsp;C3A9 will become two latin1 characters: 'Ã©' "on the wire".  (C3 represents Ã in latin1, etc)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⚈&nbsp;&nbsp;If the CHARACTER SET for the column is latin1, then those 2 characters (2 bytes) are inserted.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⚈&nbsp;&nbsp;If the CHARACTER SET for the column is utf8, then they are converted to utf8: Ã ⇒ C383 and © ⇒ C289; you insert 4 latin1 characters (4 bytes: C383C289) into the table.
<br>
Continuing the case, let's do a SELECT:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⚈&nbsp;&nbsp;For utf8 column, the C383C289 is converted to latin1 Ã© (C3A9) for sending across the wire to the client.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⚈&nbsp;&nbsp;For latin1 column, no conversion is performed, so, again, C389 goes across the wire.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⚈&nbsp;&nbsp;The client receives the two bytes C389, thinking it is Ã© (because of SET NAMES).  However, the rest of your application is thinking 'utf8', it sees it as é.
<br>
C383C289 is an example of what I call "double encoding" because of the
two 'wrong' conversions from latin1 to utf8.
The resulting SELECT (at least for European text) looks exactly like what you INSERTed.
However, comparisions (WHERE x&gt;y) and sorting (ORDER BY) and, in a few cases, equality (x=y) will not work as expected.
</p><p>

Now, let's flip the situation:
Case 2: SET NAMES utf8, but you are inserting é encoded as latin1 (E9):
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⚈&nbsp;&nbsp;SET NAMES is falsely asserting that E9 is a valid utf8 encoding of something, which it is not.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⚈&nbsp;&nbsp;The INSERT finishes (with a WARNING that you probably ignored), but the string is truncated before the é.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⚈&nbsp;&nbsp;The CHARACTER SET of the column does not matter since the string is truncated.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⚈&nbsp;&nbsp;A SELECT will get only the truncated string.
</p><p>

Case 3: One application INSERTs and another SELECTs, but they are using different SET NAMES.
All sorts of messes can occur.
</p><p>

Case 4: You have an old latin1 table (possibly dating back to …</p></a></div>

        <p>There are many interesting things that can be learned about probabilistic modelling from the world of trading and finance, where, perhaps due to the direct connection to very large sums of money,  attitudes to problems are generally very different to those of the typical statistician or ML practitioner. Two books I have enjoyed recently in the area are <em>The Education of a Speculator</em> by Victor Niederhoffer and <em>Fooled by Randomness</em> by Nassim Nicholas Taleb. The books are similar in many ways, both contain plenty of interesting insights into thinking probabilistically, as well as a number of cautionary tales of modelling gone wrong<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. In <em>Fooled by Randomness</em>, Taleb talks a lot about the power of simulation for probabilistic models, and how modern computers, using what he calls his “Monte Carlo Engine”, allow us to get answers from complex models that previously would have been impossible, or at least very time consuming, to solve analytically. This was fresh in my mind when I read the following passage from chapter 8 of <em>The Education of a Speculator</em> about the well known gambler’s ruin problem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A speculator with initial capital $C$ plays a game with a casino: he wins $£1$ each play with probability $P$ or loses $ £1$ with probability $Q=1-P$, the speculator stays in the game until his capital reaches $A$ or depreciates to $0$. It can be shown that in such a game, the speculators probability of ruin is, $$ \frac{(Q/P)^A-(Q/P)^C}{(Q/P)^A-1}$$</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a very good example a problem which can be solved easily with the “Monte Carlo Engine”, or simulation in plainer language, but is actually quite difficult to solve analytically. In this post we’re going to derive the formula for the probability of ruin above analytically, and calculate the probability using simulation and hopefully along the way we’ll get a feel for the advantages and disadvantages of both methods<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="simulation">Simulation<a href="#simulation" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>The idea behind simulation is really simple, to work out the probability that our gambler will be ruined, all we need to do is run a bunch of games in our imaginary casino, and work out the proportion of games in which the gambler loses, this then becomes our answer for the probability of ruin. We can think of each of these games as a sort of parallel universe, each is possible and distinct from the next, and taken as a whole they represent every possible situation our gambler could go through. Now you might be thinking, hang on, are there not an extremely large number (an infinite number even) of possible games? Could the gambler not keep on playing indefinitely if the correct combination of wins and losses arise such that the balance never goes higher than $A$, or lower than $0$? How are we going to simulate all of the games? The answer is that we aren’t, because this would take an infinitely long time, and so unfortunately we will never get the answer for the probability exactly correct, but we will be able to get pretty close in quite a short time. When we simulate things randomly, games that are more probable, and so contribute more to our final answer, are likely to occur even in a small number of simulations. Improbable games, such as very long games, are unlikely to occur in our simulation, this isn’t a problem though  because they naturally don’t contribute much to the final answer, so the error associated with not including them in our proportion will be small.</p>
<p>So how do we actually do the simulating? We just need to have some code that can produce randomly 1 (representing the gambler winning a play) with probability $P$ or 0 (representing the gambler losing a play) with
probability $Q$. Then we add or subtract $£1$ from the gamblers balance accordingly, we keep doing this until the balance reaches $A$, in which case we note down a win for the gambler, or $0$, where we note down a loss. All we have to do then to calculate the probability is tally up all the games the gambler lost, and then divide by the total number of games we simulated to get our estimate. The following Python code will do this for us:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> scipy.stats <span>import</span> bernoulli

<span>print</span>(f<span>"Probabilty of ruin: {simulated_probability(0.6, 5, 10)}"</span>)
</code></pre></div><p>Note the Bernoulli function here just produces a 1 with probability $P$, and a zero with probability $Q=1-P$ like we needed. It really is that simple! Before we look at the properties of the answers our code gives, let’s solve the problem analytically as well.</p>
<h2 id="analytical-solution">Analytical Solution<a href="#analytical-solution" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p><em>(This section is going to be a bit more maths heavy, so if that’s not your thing then feel free to skim/skip.)</em></p>
<p>Like a lot of problems in probability, at first glance it doesn’t look too bad. Unfortunately it’s kind of hard to know where to start because of the limitless number of different games that are possible. To get going we need to use a bit of a trick<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. Let’s say the probability of winning the game when we start with capital $i$ is $P_i$ (taking $i$ to be an integer). The two possibilities for the first play of the game are:</p>
<ol>
<li>The gambler wins the first play with probability $p$ and ends up with capital $i+1$, the probability of going on to win the game from this position is then $P_{i+1}$.</li>
<li>The gambler loses the first play with probability $q=1-p$, and ends up with capital $i-1$, the probability of going on to win the game from this position is then $P_{i-1}$.</li>
</ol>
<p>We can then write $P_i$ in terms of these possible outcomes for the first play, as</p>
<p>$$ P_i = p \times P_{i+1} + q \times P_{i-1}. \tag{1}$$</p>
<p>We also know that $P_0=0$, if we have no money we have certainly lost, and $P_A=1$, if we reach capital $A$ we have certainly won. Equation 1 is called a difference equation, and it is like a discrete version of a differential equation. To solve it, we use use $p + q = 1$ to rewrite as follows,
$$(p+q)P_i =pP_{i+1} + q P_{i-1}$$
$$ \implies pP_{i+1}-pP_i=qP_{i}-qP_{i-1}$$
$$ \implies P_{i+1}-P_i=\frac{q}{p}(P_{i}-P_{i-1}) \tag{2}$$</p>
<p>Next write equation 2 as,<br>
$$ P_{j+1}-P_j = \frac{q}{p}(P_{j}-P_{j-1}) = \Big(\frac{q}{p}\Big)^2(P_{j-1}-P_{j-2}) = \dots= \Big(\frac{q}{p}\Big)^{j-1}(P_{1}-P_{0})=\Big(\frac{q}{p}\Big)^{j-1}P_{1}$$</p>
<p>for $j=1, \dots, A$, using $P_0=0$ for the final step. Next we want to use this to find a general formula for $P_i$, we are allowed to write
$$ P_i = P_i - P_0 = (P_i - P_{i-1}) + (P_{i-1} - P_{i-2}) + \dots + (P_{1} - P_{0}) $$</p>
<p>because for example the $+P_{i-1}$ cancels with the $-P_{i-1}$ and so contributes nothing overall. Subbing in equation 2 to each of the terms in brackets we get,
$$ P_i = P_1 \sum^{i-1}_{j=0}\Big(\frac{q}{p}\Big)^{j-1}$$</p>
<p>using the standard result for a finite sum of a geometric series, we get</p>
<p>$$P_i = P_1 \frac{(q/p)^i -1}{(q/p) -1}$$</p>
<p>as long as $p\neq q$. If $p=q=1/2$ then we simply get  $P_i=P_1\sum^{i-1}_{j=0}(1)=iP_1$. Now we need to get rid of the $P_1$ which we can do by using $P_A=1$. In the case $p\neq q$ we have,</p>
<p>$$ P_A = 1 = P_1 \frac{(q/p)^A -1}{(q/p) -1}$$</p>
<p>so,
$$ P_1 =  \frac{(q/p) -1}{(q/p)^A -1}$$</p>
<p>which means
$$ P_i =  \frac{(q/p) -1}{(q/p)^A -1}\frac{(q/p)^i -1}{(q/p) -1} =\frac{(q/p)^i -1}{(q/p)^A -1}.$$</p>
<p>In the case $p=q=1/2$ we have $P_A=1=A P_1 \implies P_1 = 1/A$ so $P_i = i/A$. We now have an expression for the probability of a win so to covert our answer into the probability of ruin we just subtract it from 1 to get,</p>
<p>$$ P_i = 1 - \frac{(q/p)^i -1}{(q/p)^A -1} = \frac{(q/p)^A - (q/p)^i}{(q/p)^A -1} \text{ and } P_i = 1 - \frac{i}{A} = \frac{A-i}{A} \tag{4}$$</p>
<p>in cases $p\neq q$ and $p=q=1/2$ respectively. We’ve finally made it, equation 4 is the same as the answer from <em>Education of a Speculator</em>!</p>
<h2 id="comparison">Comparison<a href="#comparison" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>OK so now we have methods to calculate the probability of ruin both using simulation and analytically, let’s see how they compare. Below are plots of the probability of winning the game against the probability of winning a play $P$, for starting capital $C=£8$ and $C=£1$, using 500 simulated games. We can see that there is very good agreement between the two methods.</p>

  <figure>
    <img src="https://magnusross.github.io/ruin_main.png" alt="How likely is ruin?">
    
      <figcaption>Plot of probability of ruin against probability of winning single play, for different $C$'s</figcaption>
    
  </figure>


<p>We can get a better idea about the error introduced by using the simulated method from the following plot of error against number of simulated games, with error bars computed from 5 repeats. The gradient of the graph is about 0.5 and since the axis are log scale this corresponds to the relationship $E\propto\sqrt N$, where $E$ is error and $N$ is number of games. This is consistent with the standard result for the error of a Monte Carlo estimator.</p>

      <figcaption>Plot of error introduced by simulation methods against  number of simulated games.</figcaption>
    
  </figure>


<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions<a href="#conclusions" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>I think the most important thing to consider when comparing the two solutions before we even think about errors, computation time etc, is simplicity. The code for the simulations took me less than 5 minutes to write. I spent about an hour trying to come up with an analytical solution with no luck, I then looked up the solution, and it took me quite a while longer to get my head round it. Even simple problems in probability can end up being analytically intractable, meaning no closed form solution can ever be found, let alone by me. For this reason Taleb is right to emphasize the power of the Monte Carlo engine, I hope this post has gone some way to illustrates it practical application.</p>

					February 2019 â€” I created this document from a collection of memories of a particular time in my life.  It is accurate to the best of my memory, but that does not mean it is complete.  Still, I think itâ€™s worth making public because there is almost no similar information on the intarwebs.
				</p>
				<p>
					If youâ€™re here to read about the TRS-80 Model 100 computer, you will have to slog through a lot of background information and personal anecdotes.  I didnâ€™t write this for clicks, or popularity, or recognition.  I wrote it for my own edification.  And I wrote the text of it on a TRS-80 Model 100.
				</p>
			</blockquote>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>
				Introduction
			</h2>
			<p>
				There are many TRS-80â€™s in the world. But this one is mine.
			</p>
			<figure>
				<a href="https://wayne.lorentz.me/This_TRS-80/images/2000/TRS-80_Model_100-001.jpeg"><img src="https://wayne.lorentz.me/This_TRS-80/images/1000/TRS-80_Model_100-001.jpeg" alt="My TRS-80 Model 100 computer on a table at Starbucks, as I wrote this story."></a>
				<figcaption>My TRS-80 Model 100 computer on a table at Starbucks, as I wrote this story.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				The TRS-80 Model 100 is claimed by some to be the worldâ€™s first portable computer.  Whether that is true or not is hard to say.  Ninety percent of online journalism these days is nothing more than wannabe reporters summarizing other peopleâ€™s assumptions from web sites that know how to game a search engine.  But looking at old magazines of its era, the Model 100 was at least the first portable computer that wasnâ€™t a glorified calculator, or a suitcase so hefty that you could chock a tire with it to keep a Greyhound bus from rolling away.
			</p>
			<p>
				This document exists to show that the urban legend about TRS-80's being the devices that ushered journalism into the modern age is true. The Model 100 was a workhorse for a number of journalists, including a cadre of  roving correspondents for the Associated Press.  And also for me: a cub reporter for a radio station in a medium-sized, unremarkable city.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>
				Background
			</h2>
			<p>
				This was a city not unlike dozens of other river towns across the United States.  For me, it wasnâ€™t my first experience as a broadcast journalist, but it was my first full-time, all-on-my-own job hundreds of miles from home.  More importantly, it was my first job with a computer.
			</p>
			<p>
				The conventional wisdom is that the computer revolution came all at once, and from the top down; with big businesses investing in hardware and software to make their employees more productive.  But it was a two-pronged offense.
			</p>
			<p>
				While desktop computers were commonplace in large companies in large office towers in large cities, it took decades for computers to become everyday objects in 90% of America.
			</p>
			<p>
				The second prong came from that 90%.
			</p>
			<p>
				Across the country, computers were becoming regular fixtures in ordinary households.  Commodore 64â€™s, TI99/4Aâ€™s, Apple ][â€™s and the like opened up a new world of possibilities for Joe and Jane Lunchbucket, and their children.  Online services like CompuServe, QLink, The Source, and Delphi connected people to information and each other in ways that previous generations could only imagine.
			</p>
			<p>
				It was also unimaginable to many of the people running the companies for which these people worked.
			</p>
			<p>
				Even as late as the turn of the millennium, it was commonplace for someone to have a computer and online connection at home that was faster and better than what was available in their workplace.  Complaints about this upside-down situation put pressure on small and mid-sized companies to land computers on every desk.  Firms like Dell, Gateway 2000 and eMachines were happy to churn out millions of low-quality â€œbusiness" computers to fill this technology gap.
			</p>
			<p>
				This story starts during the early portion of that gap.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>
				Work before computers
			</h2>
			<p>
				I had a computer at home.  It was home-built, which wasnâ€™t unusual for the time.  But at work, it was all typewriters and pencils.  So many pencils.  I often wondered if it would make sense for all the reporters to put their pencils in a big communal bucket and have the interns sharpen them at the beginning of each work day.
			</p>
			<p>
				In addition to pencils, the primary tools of the reporterâ€™s trade were reporter notepads.  These are special spiral-bound pads of lined paper that are unusually narrow and unusually long.  They are the perfect size for stuffing into the inside pocket of a suit jacket or the outside pocket of a trench coat.  Each big story got its own pad, and youâ€™d build up a library of pads as an archive you could reference.
			</p>
			<p>
				Reporter pads were more than utilitarian.  They helped define the local journalism hierarchy.  Interns and reporters for alternative rags carried steno pads.  Real journalists had real reporter notepads from real journalism supply companies.
			</p>
			<p>
				But there was another level in the notepad caste system.  If you were lucky enough to be in the presence of a network correspondent, or someone working for one of the broadsheet institutions, you might be lucky enough to catch a glimpse of their special reporter notepads.  These looked like the regular notepads that plebs like myself used.  But their companies were so professional, and so focused on making sure their people had everything they needed to do a good job that the notepads had the company logos stamped on the cover.  It was like bird watching for news nerds.  A big black CBS eye here. An academic maroon AP logo there.  A corporate blue UPI logo could be spied if you were very lucky.
			</p>
			<p>
				Just as important as paper were the pencils a reporter carried.  Pens were right out.  If a pen dries up, explodes in your pocket, or otherwise refuses to cooperate, youâ€™re screwed.  A pencilâ€™s point might break, but you could pop into any random office building and ask the first secretary you came across to use her sharpener.  Plus, you always carried a fistful of spares.  In the worst case scenario, you could use a random sharp implement to expose enough lead to scratch with.  We all envisioned a story that was so important weâ€™d have to gnaw the wood off the end of a pencil just to make sure we didnâ€™t miss that career-making quote.
			</p>

				<a href="https://wayne.lorentz.me/This_TRS-80/images/2000/TRS-80_Model_100-008.jpeg"><img src="https://wayne.lorentz.me/This_TRS-80/images/1000/TRS-80_Model_100-008.jpeg" alt="Teletype paper from 1983"></a>
				<figcaption>Teletype paper was never meant to last more than a few hours or days.  This is from 1983.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				In the radio newsroom, an intermittent tide of information came in on an Associated Press teletype machine.  It was something that looked like it belonged on the deck of a battleship spewing hot lead at airborne foes.  Two or three times a day someone would search through the ribbon of paper it spit onto the floor, rip each story from the spool, and file the stories into wire baskets labeled â€œLocal,â€� â€œState,â€� and â€œNational.â€�  There was also a â€œSaveâ€� bin way off to the side where people could collect copies of important news alerts and bulletins for posterity or their own personal collections.  International news went into the trash bins.  Thatâ€™s what we had the national network for.
			</p>
			<p>
				Thatâ€™s not to say that we didnâ€™t know what was going on.  At that level, all reporters are experts on national issues and foreign affairs.  Just ask them.  It was a game of one-upmanship that we all played to feed the fantasy that we might get a call from the network to join the big leagues in New York or D.C.  Which almost never happened.  No matter how much you contributed, you were more likely to squeeze into one of the few desirable slots at Voice of America than to be remembered by the network editors at Black Rock for more than six seconds after your voice left their air.
			</p>
			<p>
				But while we had pencils and we had paper and we had teletype machines, what we didnâ€™t have were computers.
			</p>
			<p>
				In school the boys didnâ€™t learn how to type.  That was for girls.  But since I had a computer at home, I knew my way around a keyboard.  You couldnâ€™t get a journalism degree without being able to bang out 40 words per minute on an IBM Selectric.  My scores were consistently above 80.  My J-school professors thought I was cheating.
			</p>
			<p>
				When I started my career, my home base was an AM/FM combo in the center of a small market.  Since I wasnâ€™t a full-time employee, I was free to work elsewhere.  And I did.  I would do a day at this station to fill in for someone who was sick, or a week at that station so someone could go on vacation.  At the time, it was very unusual for a local radio station to not have news at least once an hour.  Automation existed, but the spinning wheels of carts stopped when it was time for news.
			</p>
			<p>
				Doing news after school and on weekends helped pay for college.  To make that happen I got myself on the fill-in sheets of half the radio stations within 200 miles of where I lived.  Doing so allowed me to list more than a dozen commercial stations on my resume at a point in my career when my peers were lucky to get a DJ shift at a carrier current college station.
			</p>
			<p>
				I was bouncing between so many stations that one day I did, regrettably, announce that â€œKOJ news time is 7:05â€� on a station that wasnâ€™t KOJ.  The good people at K-104 never asked me back, which was a shame.  It was the first place I ever considered working full-time.  The facilities at K-104 were terrible.  But that was because management invested money in the employees instead of the physical plant, and everyone was paid far above what the competition paid.  The result was that everyone worked hard, and we were all handsomely rewarded.  But after my on-air mistake, I decided it was time to find one job, and stick to it.
			</p>
			<p>
				When it came time for a career change, I did what all radio people did: I consulted the help wanted listings in a strange industry newsletter that came in every day by fax.  Some station managers would tear the want ads off the end of the transmissions.  It was a very effective way to keep people from jumping ship in an era when information was still easy to control.  But if you were on the morning shift, you came in six hours before sales and management. That gave you an …</p></section></div>

  <p>small update (01/25/21): I posted this to <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25883791">HN</a> and it ended up at the top of the front page for a couple of hours :O</p>

<hr>

<p>A few months ago I started working on a research project trying to pretrain my own, more efficient language model from scratch. I got access to a 128-core TPUv3 pod from the Tensorflow Reseach Cloud and used it to pretrain a $124$M parameter GPT-2 model to a perplexity pretty close to OpenAI’s results (my pretrained model was trained for about $1/8$th of the number of iterations that OpenAI trained their model for and got $21$ ppl on OpenWebText compared to $17$ ppl for OpenAI’s model), and then pretrained an ALBERT-style GPT-2 (that I’m calling ALGPT2) language model with a factorized input embedding and layer-wise parameter sharing that would reduce the number of paramters in the model from $124$M to around $12$M.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, ALGPT-2 doesn’t perform as well as GPT-2 (ALGPT-2 gets $31$ ppl on OpenWebText compared to $21$ ppl for my pretrained GPT-2 model), but I’m writing this series of blog posts to go through everything I’ve learned over the last few months.</p>

<hr>



<hr>

<p>The main thing that I wanted to do from this sort-of “research project” that I was working on by myself this spring was to develop and train a more efficient version of the $124$M parameter version of <a href="https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/">GPT-2</a>. I wanted to pretrain the $1.5$B parameter version of GPT-2 but since I only got access to the TPU pod for a week, I had to choose a model that would train in time. A $100$k iteration training run takes about $20$ hours to run which gave me plenty of time to run multiple experiments. In contrast, following OpenAI’s training procedure exactly and training for the full $800$k iterations would take up almost an entire week and use up most of my quota.</p>

<p>I was able to almost replicate the $124$M parameter version of GPT-2 by pretraining it to a perplexity pretty close to OpenAI’s results (my pretrained model used was trained for about $1/8$th of the number of iterations that OpenAI trained their model for and got $21$ perplexity (ppl) on the standard OpenWebText dataset compared to $17$ ppl for OpenAI’s model),</p>

<p>My idea of making a more efficient transformer didn’t really work out since my pretrained transformer ended up being about $20$ppl worse than an equivalent GPT-2 model, but I wanted to writeup what I learned over the two or three months that I was working on this anyway.</p>

<hr>

<p>A little bit about myself: I’m an incoming software engineering student at the University of Waterloo and this post is supposed to be a writeup of a NLP research project that I was working on from around March to May of 2020 (right in the middle of the first Covid-19 lockdown of 2020, I’m currently writing this on July 15, 2020 while waiting for my Pix2PixHD model to train for a few hundred epochs on colab for a new project that I’m working on).</p>

<p>I was pretty lucky that I started learning NLP right before transformers exploded in popularity, I remember when <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3781">word2vec</a> and LSTMs were SOTA on a lot of NLP tasks, and it has been really interesting to see how much the field of NLP has changed in just a few years, going from when LSTMs with only a a handful of layers and somewhere on the order of $512$ units were considered to be large networks and computationally expensive to train, to training LSTMs with <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473">attention</a> layers on top, to the original <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762">transformer encoder/decoder networks</a>, to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06146">ULMFIT</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05365">ELMO</a>, then <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805">BERT</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11692">RoBERTa</a>, <a href="https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/">GPT-2</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10683">T5</a>, to just a few months ago with the explosion of new, more efficient replacements for self-attention like the <a href="https://openai.com/blog/sparse-transformer/">Sparse Transformer</a>, the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04451">Reformer</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00743">Synthesizers</a>, and now <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165">GPT-3</a>, which IMO has the potential to really change the whole field of NLP.</p>

<p>Just a few years ago we trained shallow recurrent networks on datasets, then pretrained large transformer language models on large datasets and finetuned on task-specific datasets. Now the whole idea of just training a gigantic language model on a huge dataset, then conditioning the model in a form of few-shot learning by prepending a few examples of a certain task to an input feels like it can really make NLP models a lot more accessible and easier to productionize as well as making human-chatbot interactions a lot more realistic than they are today.</p>

<p>I’ve rambled on for long enough, lets get to the main topic of this post.</p>

<hr>



<hr>

<p><a href="https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/">GPT-2</a> is a transformer decoder.</p>

<p>The embedding layer at the root of the model maps a one-hot vector of a given token’s index (all the GPT-2 models use a vocabulary size of $50257$) to a $768$ dimensional vector (all GPT-2 numbers in this blog post will be for the $124$m parameter version of GPT-2).</p>

<p>The embedding matrix is followed by a stack of self-attention and feed-forward layers that each output a $768$ dimensional vector (keeping the number of outputs for each layer constant), which makes up the main part of the transformer.</p>

<p>The stack of self-attention layers is then followed by an output embedding (the weights of the input and output embeddings are tied to make training easier) that maps the $768$ dimensional vector that is the output of the last layer of the transformer to the same $50257$ dimensional vector that represents the probability of each token in the vocabulary being the next token in the sequence.</p>

<p>Take a look at <a href="http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-gpt2/">The Illustrated GPT-2</a> for a more in-depth look into GPT-2.</p>

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.11942">ALBERT</a> (A Lite BERT) is a paper that takes a look at <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805">BERT</a> and identifies some ways in which to make it more efficient and reduce the number of parameters in the model in four major ways: a factorized embedding, layer-wise parameter sharing, a sentence-order-prediction auxillary loss, and removing dropout.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="factorized-embedding">
Factorized embedding</h3>

<hr>

<p>GPT-2’s embedding has a lot of parameters. It’s really just a matrix of dimensions $50257 \times 768$. That means that the input embedding alone uses up almost $50257 \times 768 = \space \sim 38,000,000$ parameters which is a pretty big chunk of the $128$M total parameters in the model.</p>

<p>The ALBERT authors propose a factorized embedding with an intermediate embedding size of $128$: one embedding of size $50257 \times 128$ and another embedding of size $128 \times 768$. By breaking up the large embedding matrix into two smaller matrices, the total number of parameters used in the embedding goes from about $38$M to about $6$M.</p>

<p>$50257 \times 128 = \sim 6,000,000$</p>

<p>$128 \times 768 = \sim 100,000$</p>

<p>The authors try different intermediate embedding sizes and settle on $128$ as a good tradeoff betweeen parameters and performance.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="layer-wise-parameter-sharing">
Layer-wise parameter sharing</h3>

<hr>

<p>In a normal transformer model, the transformer layers are created something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>BERT</span><span>(</span><span>nn</span><span>.</span><span>Module</span><span>):</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>__init__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>n_layers</span><span>):</span>
        <span>super</span><span>().</span><span>__init__</span><span>()</span>
        <span>//</span> <span>...</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>blocks</span> <span>=</span> <span>nn</span><span>.</span><span>ModuleList</span><span>([</span><span>Block</span><span>()</span> <span>for</span> <span>_</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>n_layers</span><span>)])</span>
        <span>//</span> <span>...</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>forward</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>):</span>
        <span>//</span> <span>...</span>
        <span>for</span> <span>block</span> <span>in</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>blocks</span><span>:</span>

        <span>//</span> <span>...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>ALBERT shares all parameters across the transformer layers something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>ALBERT</span><span>(</span><span>nn</span><span>.</span><span>Module</span><span>):</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>__init__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>n_layers</span><span>):</span>
        <span>super</span><span>().</span><span>__init__</span><span>()</span>
        <span>//</span> <span>...</span>

        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>n_layers</span> <span>=</span> <span>n_layers</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>block</span> <span>=</span> <span>Block</span><span>()</span>
        <span>//</span> <span>...</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>forward</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>):</span>
        <span>//</span> <span>...</span>
        <span>for</span> <span>_</span> <span>in</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>n_layers</span><span>:</span>
            <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>block</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
        <span>//</span> <span>...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>By only defining one transformer block and looping around it <code>n_layers</code> times, ALBERT saves the GPU memory that would be used to store the parameters for all the layers.</p>

<p>Since we normally use $32$ bit floats to store parameters on the GPU, storing the $1.5$B parameter GPT-2 on the GPU will use up about $6$GB of the GPU’s memory — that’s a pretty big chunk of the $16$GB of memory that’s on a normal V100 GPU already being used up before taking into account the memory needed to store the model’s activations as well as any momentum parameters needed by the optimizer. In contrast, if you share parameters across all transformer layers in the $1.5$B parameter GPT-2, the resulting model will only have about $37$M parameters, the parameter-sharing version would only use up around $148$MB of GPU memory.</p>

<p>The authors try applying parameter sharing to BERT and see that it reduces performance but makes it easier to train larger and larger models.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In a machine learning framework like JAX, which by default unrolls and inlines loops when it’s compiling your code with XLA, the size of the unrolled and inlined loop would make the computation graph really large and take a long time to compile. This is why you’re recommended to use somehting like <a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.lax.scan.html"><code>lax.scan()</code></a> in these situations.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="sentence-order-prediction-auxillary-loss">
Sentence-order-prediction auxillary loss</h3>

<p>The ALBERT authors add an auxillary loss to help training. Since language modelling is usually done autoregressively, I didn’t use this for my custom model.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="removing-dropout">
Removing dropout</h3>

<p>The ALBERT authors remove all dropout from BERT and see that it significantly improves performance.</p>

<hr>

<p>That’s pretty much what my idea was: Take GPT-2, add a factorized embedding, share parameters across all transformer layers, remove dropout (I actually missed the part about ALBERT removing dropout until I was pretty far into my work, but I did run one or two runs without dropout to see how that works), and pretrain on a large dataset for a few hundred thousand iterations.</p>

<p>
To begin, we need to write a memory allocator, or as we will be calling it,
a malloc function. The simplest malloc implementations maintain a linked-list of
free blocks of memory that can be partitioned and given out as needed. When a
user requests a chunk of memory, a block of the right size is removed from the
free list and returned. If no blocks of the right size exist, either a block of
a larger size is partitioned into smaller blocks or more memory is requested
from the kernel. Freeing a chunk of memory simply adds it back to the free list.
</p>

<p>
Each chunk of memory in the free list begins with a header describing the
block. Our header will contain two fields, one indicating the size of the chunk
and the second pointing to the next free block of memory:
</p>

<div>
<pre><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>header</span> {
    <span>unsigned</span> <span>int</span>    <span>size</span>;
    <span>struct</span> <span>header</span>   *<span>next</span>;
} <span>header_t</span>;
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Using headers that are embedded in the memory we allocate is really the only
sensible way of doing this, but it has the added benefit of automatically
word-aligning the chunks, which is important.
</p>

<p>
Because we will need to keep track of the blocks of memory currently in use
as well as the blocks that are not, we will have a used list in addition to a
free list. Items will be added to the used list when they are removed from the
free list, and vice-versa.
</p>

<p>
We are almost ready to complete the first step and write our malloc
implementation. Before we do that, we first need to understand how to request
memory from the kernel.
</p>

<p>
Dynamically allocated memory resides in the so-called heap, a section memory
between the stack and the BSS (uninitialized data segment - all your global
variables that have the default value of zero). The heap starts at a low address
bordering the BSS and ends at the program break, which resides somewhere between
the BSS and the stack. Attempting to access any memory between the stack and the
break will cause an access violation (unless you access within the amount the
stack can be extended by, but that's a whole separate conversation). In order to
obtain more memory from the kernel, we simply extend the break, thus allowing us
to access more memory. To do this, we call the Unix sbrk system call, which
extends the break by its argument and returns the address of the previous break
on success, thus giving the program more memory. On failure, sbrk returns -1
casted to a void pointer, which is a terrible convention that no one likes.
</p>

<p>
We can use this knowledge to create two functions: <code>morecore</code> and
<code>add_to_free_list</code>. In the case that we are out of blocks in the free list, we 
will call <code>morecore</code> to request more memory. Since requesting the kernel for more
memory is expensive, we will do it in page-size chunks. Knowing what a page is
is not important right now, but a terse explanation is that it is the smallest
unit of virtual memory that can be mapped to any particular location in physical
memory. We will use the function <code>add_to_free_list</code> to do exactly what it sounds
like.

<p>
Now that we have our two helper functions, writing our malloc function is
pretty straight forward. We simply scan the free list and use the first block
that is at least as big as the chunk we're trying to find. Because we use the 
first block we find instead of trying to find a "better" block, this algorithm
is known as first fit.
</p>

<p>
A quick note to clarify: the size field in the header struct is measured in
header-sized blocks, and not bytes.

<p>
Although this code isn't going to win any awards for low fragmentation, it'll
work. And if it works, that means we can finally get to the fun part - the
garbage collection!

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>Clojure is a dialect of Lisp that runs on the JVM. JavaFX is a modern GUI
toolkit for the JVM. You could use JavaFX directly with Clojure's Java interop,
but Cljfx provides a declarative and functional wrapper for JavaFX. Instead of
building yet another calculator, we're going to use Cljfx to build a GUI for
generating a tone.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/goober99/lisp-gui-examples/master/screenshots/cljfx.png" alt="Screenshot"></p>
<p>You'll need Clojure installed. We also need a way to pull the Cljfx dependency
into our app. It seems <a target="_blank" href="https://clojure.org/guides/deps_and_cli">deps.edn</a>
would be the easiest way to accomplish this for a short tutorial example such
as this, but I develop on Debian and found that the new <a target="_blank" href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=891141">command line
tools</a> for Clojure
that enable this haven't made it into Debian yet. I could install Clojure from
the Clojure website, but the point of this tutorial is to be easy to follow by
someone not familiar with Clojure. It's a lot easier to direct a person to <code>apt
install clojure</code> (or whatever package manager your preferred distro uses). This
tutorial is a living document maintained on GitHub along with the example code.
Whenever the Clojure command line tools become available on Debian, it's
possible I'll revisit this tutorial and update it.</p>
<p>The Clojure build tool Leiningen is capable of managing dependencies (and a
whole lot more). There is also a build tool for Clojure called Boot. I found
more plentiful tutorials and beginner resources for Leiningen, plus Leiningen
is available as a Debian package, so for this tutorial, Leiningen it is.
Install Clojure and Leiningen from your distro's repo. Debian also has an
OpenJFX package, but Leiningen was able to pull OpenJFX in as a dependency of
Cljfx. The version pulled in by Leiningen is probably more up to date than
whatever might be sitting in your distro's repos.</p>
<p>After that, we need to create a Leiningen project directory. This can be
accomplished with <code>lein new app bleep</code>, but that created a directory full of
subdirectories and files that were unnecessary for a short little example like
this. I created the directory structure (<code>mkdir -p cljfx/src/bleep</code>) and
created <code>cljfx/project.clj</code> and <code>cljfx/src/bleep/core.clj</code> with the minimum
needed to create a window with Cljfx.</p>
<p><code>project.clj</code></p>
<pre><code>(defproject bleep "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.10.0"]
                 [cljfx "1.7.12"]
                 [com.jsyn/jsyn "20170815"]]
  :main bleep.core)
</code></pre>
<p><code>core.clj</code></p>
<pre><code>(ns bleep.core
  (:gen-class)
  (:require [cljfx.api :as fx])
  (:import [javafx.application Platform]
           [com.jsyn JSyn]
           [com.jsyn.unitgen LineOut SineOscillator]))

(defn hello-world [&amp; args]
  {:fx/type :label
   :text "Hello, World!"})

(defn root [&amp; args]
  {:fx/type :stage
   :showing true
   :title "Bleep"
   :scene {:fx/type :scene
           :root {:fx/type :v-box
                  :padding 25
                  :spacing 40
                  :children [{:fx/type hello-world}]}}})

(def renderer
  (fx/create-renderer))

(defn -main [&amp; args]
  (Platform/setImplicitExit true)
  (renderer {:fx/type root}))
</code></pre>
<p>The project file (<code>project.clj</code>) is the file that tells Leiningen about your
project (such as its dependencies). Typically with Leiningen, your code will
live in the <code>src</code> subdirectory in a subdirectory that matches the top-level
namespace of your project. All this can be changed with your <code>project.clj</code>, but
we'll be sticking to convention for this example. In this subdirectory is
<code>core.clj</code>.</p>
<p>Begin the file with a namespace declaration. The namespace should have a
<code>(:gen-class)</code> declaration in the <code>ns</code> form at the top for Leiningen. Since
we'll be using Cljfx to create our GUI, we need to <code>require</code> it. We'll mostly
be using JavaFX via Cljfx, but you can also access JavaFX classes directly.
Let's <code>import</code> (a way to get Java code into Clojure) the JavaFX Platform class.
We'll also import the Java JSyn library for use later in generating the tone.</p>
<p>Leiningen needs a <code>-main</code> function (note the leading dash is part of the
function name). This is the function that will get called when you run your app
with Leiningen or when you compile it to a standalone JAR. We use the
<code>setImplicitExit</code> method from the JavaFX Platform class to make sure the JavaFX
runtime shuts down when the window is closed.</p>
<p>Cljfx is declarative instead of imperative or object oriented like many GUI
libraries. You describe the layout with a map of key-value pairs instead of
creating controls with methods or functions. The <code>:fx/type</code> key has a value of
a kebab-cased keyword derived from a JavaFX class name. The other keys of the
map are the kebab-cased properties of that class. You can refer to the <a target="_blank" href="https://openjfx.io/">JavaFX
documentation</a> for a list of classes and their properties.
JavaFX is well documented and has a large number of controls available.</p>
<p>JavaFX defines the user interface by means of a stage and a scene. The stage is
the top-level JavaFX container (the window). The scene is the container for all
content. To add a JavaFX class to the map, you convert the class name to
kebab-case. For example, JavaFX has a <code>VBox</code> pane used to lay out controls
vertically. This would be written <code>:v-box</code> in the Cljfx map. The <code>VBox</code> class
has a <code>padding</code> property. We can set this to 25 by adding a <code>:padding</code> key to
the map with a value of 25.</p>
<p>Cljfx provides a renderer function created with <code>fx/create-renderer</code> that you
pass the map describing your user interface to. You can call <code>renderer</code>
multiple times to dynamically change the GUI. Now let's replace the Hello World
label with a slider:</p>
<pre><code>(defn frequency-slider [{:keys [frequency]}]
  {:fx/type :slider
   :min 20
   :max 20000
   :value frequency})
</code></pre>
<p>Instead of placing the definition of your entire UI into one big map, you can
compose the UI from reusable functions. This also makes your code more
readable, because you don't have a deeply nested map. These functions can be
used just like any other JavaFX class. The <code>:fx/type</code> key is the function name,
and the other keys of the map are the arguments to the function. We can add the
<code>frequency-slider</code> we created above to the <code>:children</code> vector of the <code>:v-box</code>
in the <code>root</code> map like this:</p>
<pre><code>[{:fx/type frequency-slider
  :frequency 440}]
</code></pre>
<p>The range of frequencies audible by humans is typically between 20 Hz and 20
KHz (we lose the ability to hear some of those higher frequencies as we age).
The <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A440_(pitch_standard">musical note A above middle
C</a>) is 440 Hz. Since A4
serves as a general tuning standard, it seems like a sensible default, but if
you run the above with <code>lein run</code>, this is what you'll see:</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/goober99/lisp-gui-examples/master/screenshots/cljfx-linearslider.png" alt="Slider"></p>
<p>The scale of 20 to 20,000 is so large that 440 doesn't appear to move the
slider at all. Ideally, 440 would fall about the middle of the slider. To
achieve this, let's use a logarithmic scale.</p>
<p>I found a <a target="_blank" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/846221/logarithmic-slider/846249#846249">Stack Overflow
answer</a>
on how to map a slider to a logarithmic scale. The code given in the answer is
JavaScript, but it was easy enough to port to Clojure.</p>
<pre><code>; Scale used by slider
(def min-position 0)
(def max-position 2000)
; Range of frequencies
(def min-frequency 20)
(def max-frequency 20000)

; Logarithmic scale for frequency (so middle A [440] falls about in the middle)
; Adapted from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/846221/logarithmic-slider

(def min-freq (Math/log min-frequency))
(def max-freq (Math/log max-frequency))
(def frequency-scale (/ (- max-freq min-freq) (- max-position min-position)))
; Convert slider position to frequency
(defn position-&gt;frequency [position]
  (int (Math/round (Math/exp (+ min-freq (* frequency-scale (- position min-position)))))))
; Convert frequency to slider position
(defn frequency-&gt;position [freq]
  (int (Math/round (/ (- (Math/log freq) min-freq) (+ frequency-scale min-position)))))
</code></pre>
<p>I added some global parameters to the top of the script. I came up with the
range of 0-2,000 by trial and error. It seemed to strike the best balance
between each step of the slider making a noticeable change to the frequency
while still allowing the user to narrow in on a specific frequency with just
the slider.</p>
<p>Then we create two functions: one that takes the position on the slider and
returns the frequency (<code>position-&gt;frequency</code>) and another that takes a
frequency and returns the position on the slider (<code>frequency-position</code>). Now
let's set the initial position of our slider with the <code>frequency-&gt;position</code>
function:</p>
<pre><code>(defn frequency-slider [{:keys [frequency]}]
  {:fx/type :slider
   :min min-position
   :max max-position
   :value (frequency-&gt;position frequency)})
</code></pre>
<p>Underneath the slider is a text field showing the current frequency.</p>
<pre><code>(defn frequency-controls [{:keys [frequency]}]
  {:fx/type :h-box
   :alignment :center
   :spacing 20
   :children [{:fx/type :h-box
               :alignment :center
               :spacing 5
               :children [{:fx/type :text-field
                           :text (str frequency)}
                          {:fx/type :label
                           :text "Hz"}]}]})
</code></pre>
<p>Add this to the <code>:children</code> vector of the <code>:v-box</code> in the <code>root</code> map:</p>
<pre><code>[{:fx/type frequency-slider
  :frequency frequency}
 {:fx/type frequency-controls
  :frequency frequency}]
</code></pre>
<p>At this point, we are starting to have a nice looking interface, but it doesn't
do anything. If you slide the slider, nothing happens. If your experience is
mostly with object-oriented GUI libraries, the way Cljfx does things will be a
little unfamiliar. If you've used the JavaScript library React, it employs a
similar model. Global state is stored in an atom. When you update that atom,
all the relevant controls are updated accordingly.</p>
<pre><code>; Cljfx global state
(def *state
  (atom {:frequency 440}))
</code></pre>
<p>Add middleware to the <code>renderer</code> that maps incoming data from the global state
atom to the component description to be rendered:</p>
<pre><code>(def renderer
  (fx/create-renderer
    :middleware (fx/wrap-map-desc assoc :fx/type root)))
</code></pre>
<p>Then modify <code>-main</code> to use <code>fx/mount-renderer</code> instead of calling <code>renderer</code>
directly. This will watch the global state atom for changes and rerender the
GUI accordingly.</p>
<pre><code>(defn -main [&amp; args]
  (Platform/setImplicitExit true)
  (fx/mount-renderer *state renderer))
</code></pre>
<p>In most of the other examples, I would now write a function for each control
that updates the …</p></div></div>

While these are low effort, they make it hard to add stuff post hoc and/or keep track of non-digital activities. They also aren’t as customizable as people want. While there were fully customized solutions like Rahul’s <a href="https://blog.superhuman.com/the-most-effective-way-to-track-your-time" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">The Most Effective Way to Track Your Time</a>, these often require a lot of manual effort to get the data into a useful format.

    </span></p><p>For the purposes of this workflow, I decided to leave the tasks in the Inbox. This reduces the need to add a Project to each item. However, if you are a regular Todoist user you will likely want to use a specific Project so that you can use your Inbox for non-time tracking items. You could either do this via a keyboard shortcut when you add activities or by manually moving all tasks to a specific project in batches. Here’s my example Inbox:</p><p><span>

    </span></p><p>Now that the items are in Todoist, I created a script to export them into a specific CSV format that will make it easy to upload and analyze in Google Sheets. Once the script is run, you can upload the CSV file in a Google Sheet via “File &gt; Import &gt; Upload”. Here’s an example of what this could look like:</p><p><span>

There is no better feeling (especially as a bad developer) than bringing to life something that was just an idea a couple hours ago. While there are probably better solutions out there, I think this solution strikes a good balance of being easy to use and highly customizable, a combination that seems rare based on all the replies.

<p><img src="https://www.codenotary.com/images/blog/mascotfree.png" width="350"></p><p>A huge percentage of the world’s most valuable data is processed on IBM mainframes. Mainframes are designed with reliability and security in mind since day one. Many libraries on mainframes should only be changed through a trusted pipeline. Tampering central and highly critical programs on a mainframe infrastructure of an organization would be a strike at the heart. Attacks like <a href="https://www.codenotary.com/blog/solarwinds-sunburst/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sunburst</a> showed that cyber-criminals act opportunistic and are able to create huge damage by tampering software. Hackers won't stop at system frontiers but instead, look for a weak spot. Sometimes even mainframes get in their focus although known for being a highly secured platform. One example for that has been the <a href="https://badcyber.com/a-history-of-a-hacking/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Logica-Nordea mainframe hack</a>. Next to cyber-security threats orchestrated by state-funded hacker organizations is the possibility of a malicious insider attack by actors like employees. Although this scenario is not very common the consequences would be equally devastating.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.codenotary.com/technologies/immudb/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Immudb</a> is an open-source, lightweight, high-speed immutable database with built-in cryptographic proof and verification. It can run on almost every architecture and you can track changes in sensitive data in your transactional databases and then record those changes permanently in a tamperproof immudb database. This allows you to keep an indelible history of sensitive data, for example, debit/credit card transactions or datasets and it's members. Traditional DB transactions and logs are hard to scale and are mutable. So there is no way to know for sure if your data has been compromised. As such, immudb provides unparalleled insights retroactively of changes to your sensitive data, even if your perimeter has been compromised. immudb guarantees immutability by using cryptographic data structures internally.</p>
<h2 id="immudb-architecture-on-ibm-z">Immudb architecture on IBM Z</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.codenotary.com/images/blog/immudb-mainframe.jpg" width="450">
Immudb is lightweight and at the same time delivering unprecedented performance. Every Hardware-Architecture that is supported by golang will be able to run immudb. S390X is the Architecture of IBM Z and it is fully supported. The immudb server should run in a different and protected environment. LPAR partitioning on IBM Z is EAL5 certified therefore offering a high level of protection. Of course, immudb is also able to run next to a mainframe on distributed systems.
</p><p>We propose running immudb on Linux on Z on a different LPAR communicating with z/OS over in-memory HiperSockets reducing overhead and latency. <a href="https://github.com/codenotary/immugw" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Immugw</a> is a middleware that provides a REST-API for immudb. The API can be consumed by z/OS through various programming languages and scripts. Take a look at rocket software's <a href="https://www.rocketsoftware.com/zos-open-source" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">open source tools for z/OS</a> to expand your scope with tools like <a href="https://www.rocketsoftware.com/platforms/ibm-z/curl-for-zos" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cURL</a>. </p>
<p>Another very lean option is to use our <a href="https://docs.immudb.io/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">SDKs</a>. Z/OS is supporting three languages with already existing SDKs: Java, Python and Nodejs. The SDKs are relying on the very fast and efficient gRPC (gRPC Remote Procedure Calls) protocol based on HTTP/2 and protocol buffers.</p>
<p>Immudb and immugw can be deployed on Linux on Z without a hassle. Git clone the repositories and install golang. Switch to the repositories directory and type: make all. Start up ./immudb and ./immugw. Done.</p>
<h2 id="application-design">Application design</h2>
<p>One challenge of running highly critical systems is to ensure that no one tampered production software, as described above. Let’s start with a basic example, a developer pushed code into a protected library. Now he wants to notarize that member using immudb. He can do so by using a batch job that has the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Step 1: pull the original signing program or script and verify it</li>
<li>Step 2: generate checksum of his source code and set it in immudb</li>
</ul>
<p>Now a build-job would look almost the same. First, the source will be verified. With immudb it is also possible to look up the history. An object with an unclear history wouldn't be able to get into production.Each stakeholder (machine or developer) of the process can notarize and authenticate objects, therefore adding trust to the process. The program can then be build from the trusted source and the resulting load module has to be notarized. </p>
<h3 id="example">Example</h3>
<p>In this blog we are showing how to communicate with immudb/immugw by using java on IBM Z. Java is a good candidate because it works in every environment even in Db2 as a stored procedure. It is even possible to backup data of DB2 tables on change. More about that later. </p>
<p>Our Java program can be run as a step in JCL Jobs (for example: build jobs or jobs that are altering). The target dataset can be set as a variable in JCL and passed to the java program.</p>
<div><pre><code>//JAVAJVM  EXEC PGM=JVMLDM&amp;VERSION,REGION=&amp;REGSIZE,
//   PARM='&amp;DATASET'
//STEPLIB  DD DSN=&amp;LIBRARY,DISP=SHR

//CEEDUMP  DD SYSOUT=*
//ABNLIGNR DD DUMMY

//*The following DDs can/should be present in the calling JCL

<p>The code snippet below is showing a clean way of doing HTTP-API calls with only using HttpURLConnection. That way you will not face missing dependencies in different runtime locations. The function postRequest needs to be provided with the URL of immugw and a JSON-string. The JSON-string will be converted to bytes and posted. The response is being returned.</p>

<h3 id="getting-checksums-of-datasets-on-change-event">Getting checksums of datasets on change event</h3>
<p>With z/OS it is possible to detect changes of datasets. There are two ways of doing that. Either write a started task and listen to the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSLTBW_2.3.0/com.ibm.zos.v2r3.ieac100/ieac1-smf-inmem.htm" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">SMF realtime api</a> (SMF15) or monitor a module that gets loaded by CLOSE via CSVEXIT. Intercepting the CLOSE SVC is a delicate job but possible. Then use the name of the changed dataset create a hash and set it in immudb. That way you can track changes of datasets immutably and tamperproof.</p>
<h3 id="overcoming-ebcdic-and-ascii-conversion-challenges">Overcoming EBCDIC and ASCII conversion challenges</h3>
<p>Objects will change their checksum when they are converted from EBCDIC to ASCII and the other way around. Many code signing solutions will lose track of the object. Immudb is capable of storing JSON-Objects as value. Metadata can be added to an object including the ASCII/EBCDIC checksum of the object or many other information.</p>
<div><pre><code><span>{</span>
  <span>"ascii.checksum"</span> <span>:</span> <span>"d7e4d83a94d161837aa4038cbaf9708b2bb2d91675a20493a982ce4b17d8012e"</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="immutability-for-db2">Immutability for DB2</h2>
<p>A possible cyber-attack could focus on databases. Bad actors could gain access to databases by using SQL injections or other methods. They then use their access levels to encrypt whatever they get their hands on. Immudb can keep up with the fastest databases and back up their data. Read more about that in our <a href="https://www.codenotary.com/blog/immutability-vs-ransomware" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">randomware</a> blog. Keep in mind: immudb has to be run in a different protected environment. Now, even if immudb writes encrypted values, it still has the history of the record that can not be touched.</p>
<p>This is how it works: triggers in Db2 will notify about changes of tables. Set an <a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEPEK_12.0.0/sqlref/src/tpc/db2z_sql_altertriggeradvanced.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">alter trigger</a> and execute a stored procedure to store the new data of the table in immudb.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
				<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>

<p>I made a map displaying weather and traffic road conditions for Spain that is easier to use, nicer and faster than the official Spanish Government map. <br>
As usual (<a href="http://blog.manugarri.com/where-the-f-can-i-park/">1</a>, <a href="http://blog.manugarri.com/the-sorry-state-of-transparency-in-spain-where-is-my-certificate/">2</a>), I keep being disappointed with the Spanish Government Open Data policies.</p>

<p>You can check out the map <a href="http://dgt.manugarri.com/">here</a>. I also shared the required code on <a href="https://github.com/manugarri/dgt_map">Github</a>.</p>

<h2 id="anintroductionandabitofranting">An introduction, and a bit of ranting.</h2>

<p>It was January 2021, and I was spending the holidays with my family in my awesome hometown of <a href="http://blog.manugarri.com/plotting-100k-tweets-from-my-home-town/">Murcia, Spain</a>.</p>

<p>For you future travelers, this year was the COVID pandemic year, so things were a bit weird and traveling wasnt as easy as you whipersnappers are used to. Me and my family (two kids at the moment of writing this) would be driving back from Murcia to Lisbon, Portugal where I reside.</p>

<p>Additionally, this year saw record breaking snowstorms in Spain thanks to (<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-55612955">Storm Filomena</a>).</p>

<p>These two reasons meant that going back home to Lisbon from my hometown required planning, since there was a real risk of getting stuck in the car with 2 crying babies (omg Im shivering just thinking about it).</p>

<p>So a couple days before the travel day, I checked online to see any information on the roads.</p>

<p>The best resource I could find (<strong>and if there is a better resource, the fact that it cant be easily found defeats its purpose</strong>) was the official Spain Traffic Authority (DGT, <em>Direccion General de Trafico</em>) Map. You can check it <a href="http://infocar.dgt.es/etraffic/">here</a></p>

<p>Here is a screenshot of how the map looks like: <br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/wAbVIe9.png" alt="ugh"></p>

<p>There are a few things that trigger me when I see this map:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Slow</em>, this map seems to be an embedded map from an internal GIS system or something, plus it has a ton of features that makes it pretty slow.</li>
<li><em>Confusing</em> no legend regarding event types</li>
<li><em>Overall Ugliness</em>, you can tell icons just jam up next to each other, and they are mostly gray, with a tiny hint of color indicating the road circulation level.</li>
</ul>

<p>But the worst thing of all, <em>there is no navigation search!</em>.  This means the official traffic map forces you to know the actual code of the road you are planning to drive on in order to see if there are any weather events affecting the road's state. <strong>Im not a truck driver! I don't know these names!</strong></p>

<p>What I needed at that uncertain time was to be able <strong>to find out if driving from point A to Point B would go through any road that was blocked for any reason</strong>. The only way to do so with the official map was to search in google maps for driving directions and then check the DGT map for any road event.</p>

<h2 id="buildingabettermap">Building a better map</h2>

<p>Here is my version (<a href="http://dgt.manugarri.com/">link</a>)</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/2uMnyqi.png" alt="tadaa!"></p>

<p>You may notice a few differences between my map and DGT map:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>fast</em>, my map consist of a simple map, so the only loading consists of the map tiles themselves</li>
<li><em>easy to read</em> , my map has an actual legend that indicates what each icon means. This is Dataviz 101</li>
<li><em>pretty</em>, this is more of a personal opinion, but using brighter colors for the event icons makes the map more appealing, and visual appeal increases user engagement. </li>
</ul>

<p>And most important of all, <strong>you can get see the road conditions for the trip you are planning!</strong>. Just type the origin and destination and click the button, and the map will plot the route.</p>

<h2 id="applicationdetails">Application Details</h2>

<p>You can see the code powering the map on <a href="https://github.com/manugarri/dgt_map">Github</a>.</p>

<p>My initial idea was to implement the map as a 100% frontend solution, since that would keep the site from exploding if it becomes too popular,  but due to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS">CORS</a> limitations I had to implement a simple backend to fetch the DGT road condition events.</p>

<p>The backend app is a <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/">FastAPI</a> web application in charge of rendering the index page, fetching the road condition events, and geocoding the navigation search terms. It is the first time I use FastAPI, and its super easy to use and faster than other similar microframeworks (like Flask)</p>

<p>The map itself is a simple Leaflet map with overlaid events, when the user loads the map, an HTTP GET request fetches the official DGT road conditions data from <a href="http://infocar.dgt.es/etraffic/BuscarElementos?latNS=44&amp;longNS=5&amp;latSW=27&amp;longSW=-19&amp;zoom=6&amp;accion=getElementos&amp;Camaras=true&amp;SensoresTrafico=true&amp;SensoresMeteorologico=true&amp;Paneles=true&amp;Radares=true&amp;IncidenciasRETENCION=true&amp;IncidenciasOBRAS=false&amp;IncidenciasMETEOROLOGICA=true&amp;IncidenciasPUERTOS=true&amp;IncidenciasOTROS=true&amp;IncidenciasEVENTOS=true&amp;IncidenciasRESTRICCIONES=true&amp;niveles=true&amp;caracter=acontecimiento">this url</a> , the same one the official map uses (you can check using the developer network tools on your browser). </p>

<p>I used <a href="https://www.python-httpx.org/">httpx</a> to perform the GET request, for no reason besides testing it, its supposed to be the next Requests.</p>

<p>Leaflet provides basic icons out of the box, but since I wanted to display a few different event types, I used erikflower's awesome <a href="https://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/">Weather icons</a>. These icons not only are beautiful (particularly compared to DGT's <a href="http://infocar.dgt.es/etraffic/img/iconosIncitar/">ugly ones</a>), but also render very fast since they are not bitmaps.</p>

<p>I found it a bit complicated how to add custom icons, but <a href="http://blog.manugarri.com/making-a-simple-better-road-conditions-map-for-spain/(https://www.geoapify.com/create-custom-map-marker-icon)">this doc</a> explains it nicely.</p>

<p>Finally, I used <a href="https://openrouteservice.org/">OpenRouteService</a> as a geocoding package to translate the Navigation search terms into geocoordinates. It doesnt work as well as Google Maps, but its open source and Google Maps has turned a bit evil in recent times. OpenRouteService has a nice <a href="https://openrouteservice-py.readthedocs.io/">python package</a>.</p>

<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>

<ol>
<li>Leaflet keeps getting better and better!, now its super easy to add custom tile providers. there are even a ton of tile providers now thanks to the awesome <a href="https://github.com/leaflet-extras/leaflet-providers">leaflet-providers</a> project. For example, here is how the map looks like with a different tile provider (Stadia)</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/lLif5Ff.png" alt="stadia"></p>

<ol>
<li>Again and again, I come up with a nice frontend project idea that I have to implement with a backend just because of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS">CORS</a>. There should be a way to disable CORS for well spirited applications. Maybe prompting the user to disable CORS for a site?</li>
</ol>

<p>If you only learn one technical term from labor economics, make it "chickenization" – Christopher Leonard's term for the way that the Big Three poultry processors have structured the chicken-farming industry (I learned it from Zephyr Teachout).</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/29/break-em-up/#break-em-up">https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/29/break-em-up/#break-em-up</a></p>
<p>Here's chickenization: you're a chicken farmer. There is only one company that can buy your birds, thanks to market concentration. They tell you how to design and maintain your coop. They sell you the chicks. They tell you which feed to use, how much and when.</p>
<p>They tell you when the lights go on and when they go off. They tell you how which vet to use, and which medicines they can use. They bind you to secrecy through nondisclosure and strip you of the right to sue through arbitration.</p>
<p>They experiment on you. Your barn is filled with sensors that they monitor, and they tell you to vary feed, lighting, medicine and other variables to see if your birds get bigger. They are the only buyer in your region, so they know how each farmer's birds are thriving.</p>
<p>But if the "independent" farmers ever tried to compare notes, they'd be violating their nondisclosure agreements and could be sued. Farmers who complain to regulators are barred from the market.</p>
<p>Once your birds are grown, you bring them to the processor, who exploits their information asymmetry to figure out how to pay you JUST ENOUGH to go back to things, but not enough to get ahead. Since chickenization, poultry farmers have faced a wave of suicides.</p>
<p>Once you know about chickenization, you see it everywhere: crop farmers are chickenized by seed companies, and Uber drivers are chickenized by their apps.</p>
<p>The contours of chickenization are impossible to miss: it's a shifting of all the risk from the employer's side of the balance sheet to the workers', using the fiction of independent contractorship, the data-gathering capabilities of digital work, and monopolies.</p>
<p>Today, I learned about the worst chickenization scheme I've ever encountered: a giant, global company that has chickenized a vast workforce, but maintains total secrecy, even as it services massive blue-chip companies from Airbnb to Disney.</p>
<p>That company is Arise, and Propublica and Planet Money just blew the roof off its ghastly charnel house of a chicken farm by, as Ken Armstrong, Justin Elliott and Ariana Tobin reported out leaks, arbitration reports, and whistleblower accounts.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/meet-the-customer-service-reps-for-disney-and-airbnb-who-have-to-pay-to-talk-to-you#1001065">https://www.propublica.org/article/meet-the-customer-service-reps-for-disney-and-airbnb-who-have-to-pay-to-talk-to-you#1001065</a></p>
<p>Here's chickenization, Arise style: the company is a outsource phone support system. Workers have to pay to work for Arise (they're "independent contractors"): buy a dedicated PC, internet connection and other equipment.</p>
<p>They have to do weeks of unpaid "training" just to get started, and then they have to pay more to get specific training for every one of Arise's giant corporate clients, from AT&amp;T to Carnival Cruises to Comcast to Disney to Airbnb to Intuit to Barnes and Noble to Ebay.</p>
<p>After passing random, invasive, in-home inspections, after shelling out thousands of dollars and doing weeks – if not months – of unpaid training, they are finally eligible to sign up for shifts.</p>
<p>These shifts come in 30 minute slices, widely spaced, and turning them down gets you blacklisted. It's impossible to hold down another job while you're an Arise chicken-farmer.</p>
<p>But you don't get paid for 30-minute shifts. You just get paid for the time that you're talking to customers.</p>
<p>The whole time you talk to a customer, an algorithm is ready to penalize you: i.e., if it takes too long to deal with queries, or if there're too many pauses.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the client's outsource managers randomly (or not-randomly) listen in on your calls, and they can penalize you too.</p>
<p>The main penalty is being "deskilled" – barred from working for that client, after paying (in cash and time) to get trained to be their phone rep.</p>
<p>Workers are barred from hanging up on abusive customers. Women report high levels of sexual harassment, which they have to patiently endure, because they risk getting fired if they hang up on their abusers.</p>
<p>And all workers are expected to tolerate unlimited abuse from callers. 64% of Arise's workers are people of color. 89% of them are women. Arise's recruiting ads target Black women in particular.</p>
<p>There <em>is</em> a way to get ahead in Arise: recruit other workers. Because, in addition to everything else, it's a pyramid scheme, and the business is riddled with people who've been previously convicted of wire fraud.</p>
<p>Nearly every person in the Arise structure is chickenized:. The following jobs are all performed by "independent contractors":</p>
<ul>
<li>Client Support Professionals</li>
<li>Quality Assurance Performance Facilitators</li>
<li>Chat Performance Facilitators</li>
<li>Escalation Performance Facilitators</li>
</ul>
<p>Not only do you have to pay to work for Arise – you have to pay (a "contract termination fee") to stop working for them.</p>
<p>Arise binds workers to arbitration, meaning they can't sue. The right of workers to join class actions in spite of arbitration waivers went to the Supreme Court in '18, where the illegitimate justice Neal Gorsuch wrote the majority opinion, ruling against workers.</p>
<p>Arise honors Juneteenth with a day off for all employees. But all those Black women it has chickenized are independent businesses and are still expected to show up for work.</p>
<p>Arise's founder is Richard Cherry, a Canadian "serial entrepreneur" who started off writing scammy get-rich-quick and lose-weight-quick books before moving to Florida and getting heavily involved with the Home Shopping Network.</p>
<p>Today, the company is a division of a giant private equity fund, Warburg Pincus.</p>

<p>One of my all-time favorite artists is London's Dan Hillier, who has made a career out of finding public domain engravings, scanning and cleaning them up, and then making spooky, haunting, grotesque and infinitely lovely collages out of them.</p>
<p>Hillier has just launched two new projects: "Six Women" and "Six Men," a pair of "box sets" of  previously released and sold out work in fresh editions as giclee prints augmented by handpainted, very fine 24K gold leaf, sold as framed sets.</p>

<p>The sets are limited editions, framed in antique-black finish beech by Dylan Shipton Frames, and the prints float in behind anti-UV glass. You can see them in person at Hillier's (distanced/ventimated) Walthamstow gallery or buy them online:</p>

<p>Chekhov exhorted writers not to put a gun onstage unless a character is going to fire it. But this advice has a corollary for audiences: "If there's a pistol on the mantelpiece in Act I, it'll go off by Act III."</p>
<p>If only Apple had paid attention.</p>
<p>Apple wasn't the first company to use DRM to prevent users from installing software on devices without its approval (game consoles did this for years), but it WAS the first company to popularize the model for general purpose devices.</p>
<p>Ten years ago, I predicted that once Apple gave itself the power to decide which software you were allowed to use, governments would start ordering it to prevent you from using software they didn't like.</p>
<p><a href="https://boingboing.net/2010/04/02/why-i-wont-buy-an-ipad-and-thi.html">https://boingboing.net/2010/04/02/why-i-wont-buy-an-ipad-and-thi.html</a></p>
<p>Three years ago, Apple kicked aa working VPNs out of the Chinese App Store, to so that the Chinese state – which was in the midst of rounding up <em>one million</em> Uyghurs and putting them in concentration camps – could spy on its population more effectively</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ad42e536-cf36-11e7-b781-794ce08b24dc">https://www.ft.com/content/ad42e536-cf36-11e7-b781-794ce08b24dc</a></p>
<p>Now, Apple's purged its Chinese App Store of RSS readers, which allow Apple customers in China to evade state censorship and surveillance, which have been used in lethal ways, including targeting dissidents for organ-harvesting.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/apple-removes-two-rss-feed-readers-from-china-app-store/">https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/apple-removes-two-rss-feed-readers-from-china-app-store/</a></p>
<p>This is a really stark example of the failure of the "feudal security" model we have evolved as states have both failed to create protections for users (e.g. a US federal privacy law with a private right of action) and to prevent monopolization of tech.</p>
<p>Deprived of the legal tools to defend ourselves with, we are forced to seek protection from feudal seigneurs (e.g. tech companies) and hope that their business interests align with our human rights interests.</p>
<p>So you can use Chrome, which is about to start blocking third-party cookies, meaning that other people can't track you – but Google can. Google doesn't want to protect your privacy – it wants to get a piece of the action.</p>
<p>Google will use this power to incidentally protect your privacy by blocking some of the worst online surveillance, but if you're worried about Google itself (or one of its trusted parties) abusing your data, Chrome won't help you.</p>
<p>Likewise, Apple makes a big (and deserved) deal out of its privacy orientation, but that privacy is in service to a marketing message: "Apple is the pro-privacy alternative." Apple cares about selling devices, and privacy is a means to that end.</p>
<p>Apple's decision to both manufacture and sell devices in China, combined with its power to choose which apps you can use, all but guaranteed that it would be deputized to aid in mass roundups for concentration camps and organ harvesting.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the policies that Apple relies on to prevent companies creating third-party app stores – policies like DMCA 1201, the copyright law that bans breaking Apple DRM – are defended by an infinite warchest funded by all …</p></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Teams, especially at growth companies, often have a pattern of taking two steps forward and one step back. Let’s explore how teams often unknowingly slip after growing and let’s explore ways to prevent that from happening. Only forward steps!</p>

<h2 id="this-happens-a-lot---the-setup">This Happens A Lot - The Setup</h2>

<p>Let’s talk about my favorite pretend team, The Acme Widget Builders. It’s a cross-functional team with a product manager, an engineering manager, and a number of engineers. The team is operating very well and is growing with the company. Eventually the Original Product Manager has to hire another PM to manage the team, so the Original Product Manager can manage a larger group of teams.</p>

<p>About 6 months later the team starts to suffer a string of quality issues. Nobody really knows why this is happening, but it’s frustrating. The team starts to focus much more heavily on QA and gets back on the righteous path over time. However, a concern remains - what happened?</p>

<h2 id="this-happens-a-lot---the-diagnosis">This Happens A Lot - The Diagnosis</h2>

<p>After doing some soul searching about what the heck happened, you realize that the Original Product Owner was a Widget Whiz. They knew every single thing about the Acme Widgets, and, in fact, they were catching a lot of bugs when reviewing features-to-be-launched at the UAT phase. Herein lies the issue.</p>

<p>It’s not really the PMs primary job to catch bugs in the UAT phase. Actually, when the Original Product Owner transferred the team responsibility to the new PM, the Original Product Owner never mentioned the QA they were doing in UAT. As a result, the team lost a critical QA resource and never thought about how to counteract that reality.</p>

<h2 id="implicit-responsibilities">Implicit Responsibilities</h2>

<p>When team’s grow, explicit responsibilities are often transferred deftly and quickly as new team members join. However, implicit or unstated responsibilities often fall by the wayside. It’s not part of the official checklist, it might not even be part of the job, but the reality remains - if you’re filling a gap and leave without finding a replacement, that gap is going to show up as soon as you leave.</p>

<p>Furthermore, you might have an explicit responsibility that you do way better than expected. Handing off that responsibility to someone who is not going to fully fill your shoes (even if at first), is another form of creating implicit gaps on the team.</p>

<h2 id="the-fix">The Fix</h2>

<p>When you transition a team that you were previously a leader in, take stock of the things you were doing that weren’t part of the official role. Consider things that you are disproportionately owning for the team. It can be anything: meeting running, architecture, QA, recruiting.</p>

<p>Then, find ways to do some of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Let people know the gaps will exist. Announce the diagnosis.</li>
  <li>Find ways to personally ensure continuity and resource the gap.</li>
</ul>

                                <p>If you are in search of a great rollerball you have a lot of work ahead of you. There are many brands of rollerball pens and many styles of rollerball inks, as well as many sizes and colors.</p>
<p>We’ve done the testing and done the research to fine the best rollerball pens and rollerball refills available today.</p>

<h2><span id="What_Is_A_Rollerball_Pen">What Is A Rollerball Pen?</span></h2>
<p>As we noted in our <a href="https://unsharpen.com/ballpoint-vs-rollerball/">rollerball vs. ballpoint guide</a>, a rollerball is a pen that uses water-based ink where a ballpoint pen uses oil-based ink. Rollerballs use smaller writing tips — usually 0.5 mm or 0.7 mm — because their ink spreads out on the paper and forms lines that are wider than the tip of the pen. Most rollerballs use dye for color but some are pigments so they are water-resistant and semi-permanent.</p>
<p>Japanese pen maker Ohto is created with developing the first rollerball, then known as the “water-based ballpoint ink pen” in 1964.</p>

<p>In order to create this guide in a repeatable, methodical manner, we purchased a large number of rollerball pens and refills and use each across a number of different paper types. The favorite pens and refills were isolated and then used further, both for testing and real-world writing. The below rollerball pens — our top picks — are the ones we considered to be the finest rollerballs sold today.</p>
<p>Please note, that while the initial testing list included many rollerball pens, the list was not exhaustive and where are always pens and refills that will be missing in any test like this. Please contact us if you see anything notable missing.</p>
<p>Where possible all sizes of a rollerball were tested and both blue and black were testing. When options were limited the focus was on blue and 1.0 mm, which is where a rollerball can really differentiate itself from the competition.</p>
<p>Please note that gel pens were not part of this test. Gel pens have become their own category and will receive their own buying guide! <a href="https://unsharpen.com/rollerball-pen-fountain-pen-ink/">Refillable rollerball pens</a> are eligible for this list.</p>
<h2><span id="Best_Mainstream_Rollerball_Pens">Best Mainstream Rollerball Pens</span></h2>
<p>If you find yourself walking through the aisles of an office superstore and you want a great rollerball, what should you get? Or if you want a 12-pack of excellent, not-too-expensive rollerballs, what’s the best pick? These are the pens in this list.</p>
<h3><span id="Uni-ball_Vision_Elite">Uni-ball Vision Elite</span></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://unsharpen.com/pen/uni-ball-vision-elite/">Uni-ball Vision Elite</a>&nbsp;has lone been a top pick among choosy rollerball fans as well as dedicated fountain pen users who want something for day-to-day writing. This pen is smooth, a bit watery in its ink, and uses Uni-ball’s Super Ink, which is chemical-, water-, and fade-resistant, plus is acid-free and of archival quality.</p>
<p>This pen is affordable, easy to find, quite smooth, and is reliable. The downsides are that its design is somewhat dated at this point, and it’s not really refillable <a href="https://amzn.to/3hrqYhu" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">(the refills are almost full pens themselves</a>). This is the essence of a great everyday rollerball.</p>

<h3><span id="Uni-ball_Air">Uni-ball Air</span></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://unsharpen.com/pen/uni-ball-air/">Uni-ball Air</a>&nbsp;is a unique, high-tech take of the everyday rollerball. It also uses Uni-ball’s everything-resistant Super Ink and it’s similarly not refillable, but it has Uni’s “Cushion Tip” writing end which is smooth and forgiving, making the pen a great choice for almost all writing scenarios.</p>
<p>The pen isn’t refillable and has an entirely plastic body (including the clip), but it’s still a great everyday rollerball because it’s fun to use, easy to find, and a great writer overall.</p>
<h2><span id="Best_Rollerball_Pens">Best Rollerball Pens</span></h2>
<p>If you are in the market for a great rollerball pen and are willing to upgrade past a disposable pen, here are the top picks of 2021.</p>
<p><a href="https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/zoom_505-e1608993432315.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/zoom_505-e1608993432315-450x44.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="44" srcset="https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/zoom_505-e1608993432315-450x44.jpg 450w, https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/zoom_505-e1608993432315-768x75.jpg 768w, https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/zoom_505-e1608993432315.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px"></a></p>
<h3><span id="Tombow_Zoom_505">Tombow Zoom 505</span></h3>
<p>The Tombow Zoom 505 combines an affordable metal body with a pigmented refill that is permanent and surprisingly fun to use, even though Tombow is not typically known for their rollerballs. The build quality of this pen’s body is excellent for the price which is surprising right around $20.</p>
<p>The Tombow Zoom 505 also benefits from being sold as a set of instruments. So if you like the rollerball, you can also buy the 505 in a mechanical pencil and a fountain pen. The downsides of this rollerball are that it has a proprietary refill, the older models of which tend to leak, but it’s still a great writer.</p>
<h3><span id="Lamy_Vista">Lamy Vista</span></h3>
<p>The Lamy Vista (the clear version of the Lamy Safari) uses Lamy’s <a href="https://unsharpen.com/refill/lamy-m63/">M63 rollerball refill</a>. This means the pen is a combination of a good rollerball refill and a great pen body. The good news is that the refill is easy to swap out if you want to use a standard European rollerball refill, like a Waterman or even a Pilot G2 gel refill. This is just an all-round great pen that is ideal for everyday use and will last you for years of writing.l</p>
<p><a href="https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Pilot-Rollerballs.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Pilot-Rollerballs-450x226.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="226" srcset="https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Pilot-Rollerballs-450x226.jpg 450w, https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Pilot-Rollerballs-768x386.jpg 768w, https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Pilot-Rollerballs-1024x515.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px"></a></p>
<h3><span id="Pilot_Hi-Tecpoint_V7">Pilot Hi-Tecpoint V7</span></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://unsharpen.com/pilot-precise-and-hi-tecpoint-pen-guide/">Hi-Tecpoint V7</a> is a refillable rollerball pen that uses fountain pen-like cartridges and a liquid rollerball ink. The pen is great looking, with a flat paint job, and handsome aesthetics. The pen is like a better version of the Pilot Precise V7 — which is much more common in the US — because the Hi-Tecpoint looks better and is refillable using a cartridge.</p>
<p>Then pen is also sold in a very wet 1.0 mm and a smooth but precise 0.5 mm version, called the <a href="https://unsharpen.com/pen/pilot-v10-grip-hi-tecpoint/">V10</a> and V5 respectively.</p>
<p><a href="https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/stabilo-bionic-worker.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/stabilo-bionic-worker-450x46.png" alt="" width="450" height="46" srcset="https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/stabilo-bionic-worker-450x46.png 450w, https://4bdggq3b9eos1q9hpx466wnu-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/stabilo-bionic-worker.png 680w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px"></a></p>
<h3><span id="Stabilo_Worker">Stabilo Worker+</span></h3>
<p>While it’s not as popular as the rest of the pens on this list, the Stabilo Worker+ is an excellent roller, as is its refillable counterpart, the <a href="https://unsharpen.com/pen/stabilo-bionic/">Bionic</a>. These pens have confusing conventions, where the 0.5 mm Medium version writes more like a 1.0 mm, but they are both exceptionally smooth and comfortable pens.</p>
<p>The Worker+ is known for its bold orange body and comfortable rubber coating, but then pen is also available in black, grey, and now other colors if you want something more muted.</p>
<p>This is super smooth rollerball that deserves more attention.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>A DC woman said an FBI agent contacted her and said investigators were reaching out to the owner of every phone that touched a cell tower near the riot.</p><div>
                            <p>WASHINGTON — If you were anywhere near the Capitol on Jan. 6, you may be getting a knock on your door from the FBI.</p>
                    <p>A D.C. woman said an agent visited her neighbor and called her, telling them investigators were tracking people whose cell phones connected to wi-fi or pinged cell phone towers near the Capitol during the riots.</p>
                        
                    <p>"They don't call first, they just come to your house," Bree Stevens, a legal investigator who lives near Capitol Hill, said.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Stevens said an FBI agent told her they were reaching out to every single person whose cell phone put them near the Capitol during the riots.</p>
                    <p>She was out for a walk with a friend and his two young daughters on the afternoon of Jan. 6, but they were diverted by bomb scares until they ended up right next to the insurrection. Adults and kids were cordoned off and unable to get back to their apartments for four hours.</p>
                    <p>"You don't want to be anywhere where they're going to go!" she said on a video she shot while police officers in riot gear quick-stepped toward the Capitol.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>"His little girl had just painted his toenails, that was a little bit embarrassing," Stevens said.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Stevens was out of town, so the agent called her on the phone number that the FBI had tracked.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>"Extremely creepy, because he explained that they have everyone’s phone number from pinging off the cell phone towers, and they know basically exactly where you were, within the vicinity of the Capitol," Stevens said. "And they can actually pinpoint on Google Maps exactly where you were standing. Like, he knew where I was standing on the sidewalk, like specifically, based on my cell phone ping."&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Stevens said the agent told her she wasn't a suspect, but said he wanted pictures of things she might have seen.</p>

<blockquote>

  <p>Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, that they didn’t stop to think whether they should.</p>

  <p>- Ian Malcolm</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I would like to share a little experiment I did for no other reason than to show I could.</p>

<p>In this proof of concept application, the main application starts a pool of web workers that it later uses to offload a series of heavy tasks.</p>

<p>The task in question is to to render a single frame of a simple 3D scene using ray-tracing (path-tracing). The computationally intensive rendering is performed by a <code>rust</code> library compiled to WebAssembly.</p>

<p>These are the tools I used:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong><code>post-me</code></strong> to communicate with the workers using a <code>Promise</code> API: <a href="https://alesgenova.github.io/introducing-post-me/">Blog</a> - <a href="https://github.com/alesgenova/post-me">Github</a></li>
  <li>My own toy ray tracing engine I implemented in rust a couple of years ago: <a href="https://github.com/alesgenova/ray-tracer">Github</a></li>
  <li><strong><code>wasm-bindgen</code></strong> to compile rust to wasm and create js bindings: <a href="https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen">Github</a></li>
  <li>Small in-house task queue to dispatch tasks to workers when available.</li>
  <li><code>react</code> for the scheleton of the app.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you would like to run this madness, an instance of this application is deployed <a href="https://alesgenova.github.io/ray-tracer-app/">here</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://alesgenova.github.io/ray-tracer-app/"><img src="https://alesgenova.github.io/images/2021-1-16-concurrent-wasm-workers/ray_tracer.gif" alt="_config.yml"></a></p>

<p>If you would like to see the details of the implementation, you can find the source code of the app on <a href="https://github.com/alesgenova/ray-tracer-app">Github</a></p>

<h2 id="bonus">Bonus</h2>

<p>Using a similar approach, I also created an app that can detect the pitch of sounds being captured by the device’s microphone.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><p><span><p>IRMA is a set of free and open source software projects implementing the Idemix attribute-based credential scheme, allowing users to safely and securely authenticate themselves as privacy-preserving as the situation permits. Users receive digitally signed attributes from trusted issuer, storing them in their IRMA app, after which the user can selectively disclose attributes to others. Schematically:</p>
<p><img src="https://irma.app/docs/assets/issuance.png" alt="issuance-flow">
  <img src="https://irma.app/docs/assets/disclosure.png" alt="disclosure-flow">
</p>
<p>Using the issuer's digital signature over the attributes the verifier can verify that the attributes were given to the user in the past, and that they have not been modified since.</p>
<h2>IRMA session flow</h2>
<p>A typical IRMA session is depicted schematically below.</p>
<p><img src="https://irma.app/docs/assets/irmaflow.png" alt="IRMA session flow"></p>
<p>Software components:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Requestor backend and frontend</em>: Generally the requestor runs a website with a (JavaScript) frontend in the user's browser, and a backend server. During an IRMA session the frontend displays the IRMA QR that the <a href="https://irma.app/docs/irma-app">IRMA app</a> scans. All frontend tasks depicted in the diagram are supported by <a href="https://irma.app/docs/irma-frontend"><code>irma-frontend</code></a>.</li>
<li><a href="#irma-servers"><em>IRMA server</em></a>: Handles IRMA protocol with the IRMA app for the requestor.</li>
<li><a href="https://irma.app/docs/irma-app"><em>IRMA mobile app</em></a>: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.irmacard.cardemu">Android</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/irma-authentication/id1294092994">iOS</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Explanation of the steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Usually the session starts by the user performing some action on the website (e.g. clicking on "Log in with IRMA").</li>
<li>The requestor sends its <a href="https://irma.app/docs/session-requests">session request</a> (containing the attributes to be disclosed or issued, or message to be signed) to the <a href="#irma-servers">IRMA server</a>. Depending on its configuration, the IRMA server accepts the session request only if the session request is authentic (e.g. a validly signed <a href="https://irma.app/docs/session-requests#jwts-signed-session-requests">session request JWT</a>) from an authorized requestor.</li>
<li>The IRMA server accepts the request and assigns a session token (a random string) to it. It returns the contents of the QR code that the frontend must display: the URL to itself and the session token.</li>
<li>The frontend (<a href="https://irma.app/docs/irma-frontend"><code>irma-frontend</code></a>) receives and displays the QR code, which is scanned by the IRMA app.</li>
<li>The IRMA app requests the session request from step 1, receiving the attributes to be disclosed or issued, or message to be signed.</li>
<li>The IRMA server returns the session request.</li>
<li>The IRMA app displays the attributes to be disclosed or issued, or message to be signed, and asks the user if she wants to proceed.</li>
<li>The user accepts.</li>
<li>The IRMA server performs the IRMA protocol with the IRMA app, issuing new attributes to the user, or receiving and verifying attributes from the user's IRMA app, or receiving and verifying an attribute-based signature made by the user's app.</li>
<li>The session status (<code>DONE</code>, <code>CANCELLED</code>, <code>TIMEOUT</code>), along with disclosed and verified attributes or signature depending on the session type, are returned to the requestor.</li>
</ol>
<p>Additional notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which of these tasks are performed by the requestor's backend and which by its frontend differs case by case:
<ul>
<li>Often the session request is sent to the IRMA server by the requestor's backend, after which the IRMA server's reply in step 2 is forwarded to the frontend which renders it as a QR code. Step 1 can however also be done by <code>irma-frontend</code>, in which case <code>irma-frontend</code> automatically picks up the IRMA server's reply in step 2 and renders the QR code.</li>
<li>Similarly, <code>irma-frontend</code> can be instructed to fetch the session result in step 10, but this can also be done in the backend. In the latter, <code>irma-frontend</code> can fetch a custom result at your backend, if desired.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The IRMA server could be deployed on the same machine as the requestor's backend, but it need not be; possibly it is not even controlled by the requestor. Generally, steps 2/3 and 10 are done with REST HTTP calls to the IRMA server, but in case the <a href="https://irma.app/docs/irma-server-lib"><code>irmaserver</code></a> library is used, these steps are function calls. Alternatively, you could use one of the packages in <a href="https://irma.app/docs/irma-backend"><code>irma-backend-packages</code></a> to do these steps with function calls in other programming languages.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Session types</h2>
<p>In an IRMA session, the <a href="https://irma.app/docs/irma-app">IRMA mobile app</a> performs one of the following three <em>session types</em> with an <a href="#irma-servers"><em>IRMA server</em></a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Disclosure sessions</em>: Upon receiving a list of requested attributes from the IRMA server, the app discloses the required attributes to the IRMA server if the app user agrees, after which they are verified by the IRMA server.</li>
<li><em>Attribute-based signature sessions</em>: Similar to disclosure sessions, but the attributes are attached to a message digitally signed into an <a href="https://irma.app/docs/overview#attribute-based-signatures"><em>attribute-based signature</em></a>. The attribute-based signature can be verified at any later time, ensuring that the signed message is intact, and that the IRMA attributes attached to it were valid at the time of creation of the attribute-based signature.</li>
<li><em>Issuance sessions</em>: the IRMA app receives a new set of IRMA attributes including valid issuer signatures from the IRMA server, to use in later disclosure or attribute-based signature sessions. (Possibly the user is asked to disclose some attributes as well, within the same IRMA session, before receiving the new attributes. This is called a <em>combined issuance-disclosure session</em>.)</li>
</ul>
<p>This process is depicted schematically and explained in more detail in the <a href="https://irma.app/docs/what-is-irma#irma-session-flow">IRMA session flow</a> chapter. For the user, after scanning the QR in his/her IRMA app a disclosure session generally looks like the following. (Attribute-based signature sessions and issuance sessions are identical in terms of their flow (scan qr, provide permission, success screen); only the graphical interface is different.)</p>
<p><img src="https://irma.app/docs/assets/disclose-permission.png" alt="disclose-permission">
  <img src="https://irma.app/docs/assets/disclose-done.png" alt="disclosure-done">
</p>
<h2>IRMA servers</h2>
<p>Various existing software components documented on this website can perform the role of the IRMA server.
Apart from exposing an API that is used by the <a href="https://irma.app/docs/irma-app">IRMA app</a> during IRMA sessions, each of these components also offer an API with which IRMA sessions can be started and monitored, for use by the <a href="https://irma.app/docs/overview#participants"><em>requestor</em></a>: the party wishing to issue attributes to or verify attributes from an IRMA app. The IRMA server handles the IRMA session with the IRMA app for the requestor.</p>
<p>Currently the following IRMA servers exist:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>irma server</code> command of the <a href="https://irma.app/docs/irma-cli"><code>irma</code></a> binary: a standalone daemon exposing its requestor API as HTTP endpoints. <a href="https://irma.app/docs/irma-server">Documentation</a>; <a href="https://irma.app/docs/api-irma-server">API reference</a>.</li>
<li>The <code>irmaserver</code> Go library, exposing a HTTP server that handles IRMA sessions with the IRMA app, and Go functions for starting and managing IRMA sessions. <a href="https://irma.app/docs/irma-server-library">Documentation</a>; <a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/privacybydesign/irmago/server/irmaserver">API reference</a>.</li>
<li>The now deprecated <a href="https://github.com/privacybydesign/irma_api_server"><code>irma_api_server</code></a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>About this documentation</h2>
<p>IRMA uses JSON to pass messages within IRMA sessions. The majority of IRMA is <a href="https://github.com/privacybydesign/irmago">written in Go</a>, and the JSON messages generally correspond to specific Go structs. For example, the <a href="https://irma.app/docs/api-irma-server#get-session-token-result"><code>GET /session/{token}/result</code></a> endpoint of the <a href="https://irma.app/docs/irma-server"><code>irma server</code></a> outputs instances of the <a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/privacybydesign/irmago/server#SessionResult"><code>server.SessionResult</code></a>.  In such cases, a link to the corresponding Go struct will be included. This can tell you what fields you can use or expect. (Note that some structs have custom (un)marshalers. See also the <a href="https://blog.golang.org/json-and-go">Go documentation</a> on JSON and Go.)</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div> <p><span><span> </span><time datetime="2020-12-19T01:43:33+00:00">December 19, 2020</time></span> </p><p>During the current pandemic, the ability to rapidly acquire, test, and report samples for the novel coronavirus has been essential for labs’ survival. Every COVID-19 testing lab demands a <a href="https://thirdwaveanalytics.com/">Laboratory Information Management System</a> (LIMS) to coordinate the huge influx of samples. For any lab to quickly test and report samples, their sample management software must have certain features to facilitate rapid testing. (Read: <a href="https://thirdwaveanalytics.com/blog/what-does-a-lims-do/">What is a LIMS?</a>)</p><p>These eight features of a sample management LIMS ensure your lab can easily and quickly handle a large number of COVID-19 samples.</p><h2>Essential LIMS Feature #1: Highly Secure, Cloud-based, Accessible Anywhere on Any Device</h2><p>A variety of people will need to access your laboratory’s sample management software: physicians and nurses, laboratory testing personnel, management, and directors. The ideal solution is a cloud-based system they can all access on any internet-connected device.</p><p>A cloud-based LIMS can also be highly secure, able to manage any form of Protected Health Information (PHI). In fact, a large number of cloud-based systems currently store and process PHI every day, approved by and compliant with all pertinent regulatory agencies. To ensure PHI security, the LIMS system should absolutely require two-factor authentication (2FA) for anyone that accesses PHI.</p><h2>Essential LIMS Feature #2: An Interface for Physicians to Order Tests and Review Results</h2><p>Here’s a nightmare for testing labs: The lab knows about a sample only when it shows up at their lab (known as “bluebird” samples, as they appear “out of the blue”). You can’t properly staff a lab if you do not know the number of samples that require testing on any given day. When each sample arrives with a paper test request form, laboratory technicians must enter all sample information from that paper form.</p><p>The process is extremely cumbersome and error-prone. Reading paper test request forms is a common challenge due to poor handwriting, poor quality printing, or damage during delivery. Many samples suffer significant testing delays from errors caused by lab staff forced to enter data directly from test request forms.</p><h3>Improving the sample testing order process</h3><p>There’s a far more accurate, efficient process. A sample test is ordered prior to the physician or healthcare provider shipping the sample. This advance order occurs through a special interface in the LIMS, such as a portal specifically for physicians or healthcare providers. With this process, the laboratory gains efficiencies by knowing the number of samples that will require testing on any given day. Lab staff need only to verify that the information on the test request form is consistent with the information entered into the LIMS.</p><p>Finally, if the LIMS is a cloud-based system (see feature #1), any physician or provider can easily order a test from any healthcare facility or sample acquisition location, such as various drive-through sample collection tents.</p><h2>Essential LIMS Feature #3: Batched Sample Processing, Including Liquid Handlers</h2><p>Some available technologies make it extremely easy to test a single COVID-19 sample (such as single sample-single-use PCR amplification systems). But these systems are expensive for a single sample, and can generally only test a few samples per hour.</p><p>Any lab serious about performing COVID-19 testing can test hundreds of thousands of samples a day. To meet this throughput, the laboratory must have a sample management system that can process 96-well or 384-well plates that are full of samples.</p><p>The ability to simultaneously process 96 to 384 samples can require significant computation resources. <a href="https://thirdwaveanalytics.com/covid19/">A COVID-19 testing LIMS</a> must be able to handle this volume and process the appropriate controls concurrent with each sample.</p><p>Each lab may choose to batch samples differently or use different controls. Therefore, the LIMS must have the flexibility to be configured to the needs of each individual testing lab. This includes processing data files from different liquid handlers or qPCR instruments. Data files from each liquid handler program will likely be formatted differently, adding to the complexity the LIMS must be able to manage.</p><h2>Essential LIMS Feature #4: Automated Data Analysis and Result Generation</h2><p>Each testing lab generates raw sample data from different instruments. Each file has its own unique format and sample naming conventions. The LIMS must absolutely be able to properly harvest this data. Ensuring that all data is accurately associated with its correct sample can be a tricky process, especially since most COVID-19 tests generate multiple data points for each tested sample (e.g. CT values for the three SARS-CoV-2 genes, and a CT for a spiked internal control).</p><p>After all testing data is appropriately associated with each sample, the LIMS should instantaneously analyze the sample and generate a result. The data auto-analysis can be exceptionally complicated. The LIMS must first assess all controls that are run with samples. Then the LIMS assesses the sample itself. Finally,&nbsp;it reviews the possible re-testing data if a sample is run multiple times (see feature #8 below). While some testing workflows use vendor software for raw data analysis, all values from analysis must still be accurately imported into the LIMS, and all re-testing values analyzed.</p><h2>Essential LIMS Feature #5: Result Review and Automated Report Generation and Delivery</h2><p>After a the LIMS generates a sample result, a laboratory director (or other appropriate staff) must review the data. Considering the limited time these lab personnel usually have each day, it is paramount that they can review results for each sample easily.</p><p>They should be able to conduct the review of all negative samples in batch. Once the sample data are reviewed and approved, the LIMS should automatically generate a report. To prevent errors and save time, lab staff should never have to create a manual report, under any circumstances. The LIMS should always generate each sample report, even for amended reports.</p><p>All positive samples will likely require critical calls to the physician, healthcare provider, and/or patient. The LIMS must be able to easily and quickly document each critical call. If the LIMS also provides contact information for each individual sample — the contact may be different for each positive sample — that can be extremely helpful.</p><p>Finally, the LIMS should automatically deliver each report to the proper physician or healthcare provider. This delivery can take many forms, including a secure email or electronic fax, or by posting to the portal.</p><h2>Essential LIMS Feature #6: Queue-based Sample Tracking</h2><p>Any serious COVID-19 testing lab will process hundreds or thousands of samples in a single day. For those labs, <a href="https://thirdwaveanalytics.com/sample-tracking/">sample tracking</a> can feel like a massive traffic jam. Lab staff must act as traffic cop while also taking responsibility for testing samples. Sample sheets, such as an Excel document, are commonly out-of-date and full of inaccuracies. This leads to poor turnaround time for sample testing and potentially “lost” samples during the testing process.</p><p>A good LIMS provides an easy solution: the ability to track all samples in a queue-based manner. Queue-based sample tracking places every sample onto a list, based on that sample’s current status. As each sample is processed, the LIMS should automatically update its status, and push the sample to the next queue.</p><p>This queue-based system is perfect for high-throughput sample testing. No sample leaves a list until its status is updated — you can never lose or accidentally forget any sample. Every sample remains on the queue until it is tested.</p><h2>Essential LIMS Feature #7: Re-testing of Invalid or Inconclusive Samples</h2><p>All testing labs understand that samples frequently fail and require re-testing. Unfortunately, sample re-testing can be a messy process. Do you create a new sample record for the re-test or overwrite the first sample’s data? Do you have to put a new barcode on the sample to re-test it? Can the data auto-analysis manage re-test results?</p><p>A LIMS must address these re-testing problems in a COVID-19 sample testing environment. It is usually not acceptable to simply overwrite initial failed sample data, so the LIMS must generate a new sample record for re-testing.&nbsp; Each re-test record must be appropriately updated during the re-testing process, making sure the original sample record isn’t accidentally updated. The data auto-analysis must be able to accurately calculate a final patient result, accounting for all sample testing results.</p><p>Finally, few labs will run re-test samples in a separate batch. The LIMS must be able to process both original sample tests and sample re-tests <strong>at the same time</strong>.</p><h2>Essential LIMS Feature #8: The Ability to Report to Public Health Departments</h2><p>There is one final task after your COVID-19 lab completes all sample testing and reports all results. The lab must report each result to the appropriate Department of Public Health (DPH). Each DPH requires different information on the sample, within different timeframes.</p><p>To help the lab facilitate these challenging demands, the LIMS should export all recent results in a format that can be directly provided to the appropriate DPH. Even better, the LIMS might directly integrate with the DPH system. When integrated, the LIMS can automatically send the data in the requested timeframe and format (such as HL7 formatting).</p><h2>Summary: Essential Features for a COVID-19 Lab’s Sample Management Software</h2><p>Evaluating a LIMS to manage samples in a COVID-19 testing lab can be tricky. You’ll find plenty of potential features in a LIMS that may not deliver value. Consider the key features listed here as essential. Without them, you’ll be stuck with an inefficient, error-prone sample management system&nbsp;— and frustrated users spending an excessive amount of time managing sample data.</p><p><strong>Which LIMS features are essential for your lab? Here’s a quick checklist.</strong><br> 1. A cloud-based system anyone can access, on any device, from …</p></div></div></div>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>In a previous post <a href="https://brunocalza.me/discovering-and-exploring-mmap-using-go/">Discovering and exploring mmap using Go</a>, we talked about how databases have a major problem to solve, which is: <strong>how to deal with data stored in disk that is bigger than the available memory</strong>. We talked about how many databases solve this problem using <strong>memory-mapped files</strong> and explored <strong>mmap</strong> capabilities.</p><p>Knowing that databases use <strong>memory-mapped files </strong>to solve the problem was not enough for me. It solved part of the mystery but a question remained: <strong>how, exactly, databases use <em>mmap</em> to read and write data from disk?</strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>I decided to dig through a database source code to answer that question. There are plenty of databases that use mmap. Some of them decided to not use anymore. Some examples: <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/index.html">SQLite</a> has an option of accessing disk content directly using memory-mapped I/O<sup>[1]</sup>, it seems <a href="https://github.com/google/leveldb">LevelDB</a> used to use but it changed it<sup>[2]</sup>, <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/">Lucene</a> has an option with <em>MMapDirectory</em><sup>[3]</sup>, <a href="https://lmdb.readthedocs.io/">LMDB</a> uses mmap<sup>[4]</sup>, a simple key/value in-memory database from Counchbase called <a href="https://github.com/couchbase/moss">moss</a> uses mmap for durability of in-memory data<sup>[5]</sup> and <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a> removed <strong>mmap</strong> storage engine for <em>WiredTiger</em><sup>[6]</sup>.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>I chose <a href="https://github.com/boltdb/bolt">bolt</a>, a simple <strong>key/value store</strong> implemented in <strong>Go</strong> by <a href="https://twitter.com/benbjohnson">Ben Johnson</a> inspired by the <strong>LMDB</strong> project, for this endeavor. Mostly because of source code simplicity and my familiarity with Go language. I know a simple key/value store might not be the most complete source code for learning all the details of reading/writing data to disk, but as I have found out, it was more than enough to get a grasp of it. </p><p>The original bolt repository is no longer maintained. A fork of <strong>bolt</strong> called <strong>bbolt</strong> is maintained and used by <a href="https://github.com/etcd-io/bbolt">etcd</a>. If you are not familiar with <strong>bolt</strong>, I recommend the articles <a href="https://npf.io/2014/07/intro-to-boltdb-painless-performant-persistence/">Intro to BoltDB: Painless Performant Persistence</a> and <a href="https://www.progville.com/go/bolt-embedded-db-golang/">Bolt — an embedded key/value database for Go </a>.</p><h2 id="the-start">The start</h2><p>I download the code to my machine and opened it in my editor. I thought a good place to start digging was to find out where the database was initialized and look for any references of <strong>mmap</strong> there. Like most embedded databases, <strong>bolt </strong>has an <a href="https://github.com/boltdb/bolt/blob/fd01fc79c553a8e99d512a07e8e0c63d4a3ccfc5/db.go#L150">Open</a> method for opening the database or creating a new one if it does not exist. Inside it, I found a reference to a private <strong>mmap</strong> function. That's a good start. </p><pre><code>// Memory map the data file.
if err := db.mmap(options.InitialMmapSize); err != nil {
    _ = db.close()
    return nil, err
}</code></pre><h2 id="how-much-memory-should-i-allocate">How much memory should I allocate?</h2><p>The private <a href="https://brunocalza.me/p/b43be99e-c260-446b-a1b1-40261aaffcf3/func%20(db%20*DB)%20mmap(minsz%20int)%20error%20%7B">mmap</a> is responsible for opening the memory-mapped file. In order to do this, it needs to figure out how much memory it is going to allocate. This task is accomplished by another method called <a href="https://github.com/boltdb/bolt/blob/fd01fc79c553a8e99d512a07e8e0c63d4a3ccfc5/db.go#L308">mmapSize</a>. Given the size of the database, this method figures out how many bytes of memory should be allocated.</p><p>It starts by doubling the size from <strong>32KB</strong> to <strong>1GB</strong>. But if the database is larger than <strong>1GB</strong>, it grows <strong>1GB</strong> at a time.</p><pre><code>// Double the size from 32KB until 1GB.
for i := uint(15); i &lt;= 30; i++ {
	if size &lt;= 1&lt;&lt;i {
		return 1 &lt;&lt; i, nil
	}
}

...

// If larger than 1GB then grow by 1GB at a time.
sz := int64(size)
if remainder := sz % int64(maxMmapStep); remainder &gt; 0 {
	sz += int64(maxMmapStep) - remainder
}</code></pre><p>It is all fine by now. That's how <strong>bolt</strong> figured out how much to allocate. But there is a piece of the puzzle now that will be very important when we talk about database storage layout. After figuring out how much to allocate, it needs to ensure that the allocated size is a multiple of the <strong>page size</strong>. If you are not familiar with database storage and don't know what a <strong>page</strong> is, don't worry, we'll be back to this.</p><pre><code>// Ensure that the mmap size is a multiple of the page size.
// This should always be true since we're incrementing in MBs.
pageSize := int64(db.pageSize)
if (sz % pageSize) != 0 {
	sz = ((sz / pageSize) + 1) * pageSize
}</code></pre><p>Shouldn't it check if we are allocating more than we have available? That's the last piece of the <a href="https://github.com/boltdb/bolt/blob/fd01fc79c553a8e99d512a07e8e0c63d4a3ccfc5/db.go#L308">mmapSize</a> method.</p><pre><code>// If we've exceeded the max size then only grow up to the max size.

Here is the full code for <em>Unix</em>-like environments:</p><pre><code>// mmap memory maps a DB's data file.
func mmap(db *DB, sz int) error {
	// Map the data file to memory.
	b, err := syscall.Mmap(int(db.file.Fd()), 0, sz, syscall.PROT_READ, syscall.MAP_SHARED|db.MmapFlags)

		return err

	// Advise the kernel that the mmap is accessed randomly.
	if err := madvise(b, syscall.MADV_RANDOM); err != nil {
		return fmt.Errorf("madvise: %s", err)
	}

	// Save the original byte slice and convert to a byte array pointer.
	db.dataref = b
	db.data = (*[maxMapSize]byte)(unsafe.Pointer(&amp;b[0]))
	db.datasz = sz
	return nil
}</code></pre><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>It is a pretty straightforward code. I have some observations to make about <code>syscall.PROT_READ</code>, but I'll leave for the next session. It is nice to see the call to madvise there, although I don't know its benefits. I would love to know the importance of that call, if it improves performance or if another flag could be set to get different behavior from OS for different use cases.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>The mapped memory is set to the variables <code>db.dataref</code> and <code>db.data</code>.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><pre><code>db.dataref = b
db.data = (*[maxMapSize]byte)(unsafe.Pointer(&amp;b[0]))
</code></pre><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>I would like to know about the importance of keeping track of both variables. I could not grasp what is going on in the conversion to <code>db.data</code>. But anyway, what we have to keep in mind is that is through these variables that <strong>bolt</strong> will read data from disk.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h2 id="what-about-writes">What about writes?</h2><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>While skimming through the source code, I looked for evidence of how <strong>mmap</strong> was used for both reads and writes. I dug both <a href="https://github.com/boltdb/bolt/blob/fd01fc79c553a8e99d512a07e8e0c63d4a3ccfc5/bucket.go#L266">Get</a> and <a href="https://github.com/boltdb/bolt/blob/fd01fc79c553a8e99d512a07e8e0c63d4a3ccfc5/bucket.go#L285">Put</a> method. I could not find any place where the references to <code>db.dataref</code> or <code>db.data</code> were being updated. I discovered that the writes to disk happen when <a href="https://github.com/boltdb/bolt/blob/fd01fc79c553a8e99d512a07e8e0c63d4a3ccfc5/tx.go#L144">Commit</a> is called to a transaction. But there I could only find calls to <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/os/#File.WriteAt">WriteAt</a>. So I gave up my search of trying to understand how <strong>mmap</strong> was used for writes.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Then, suddenly, while looking back to the call of <strong>mmap</strong>, I noticed the  <code>syscall.PROT_READ</code> flag that I have not noticed the first time I looked at the code. So <strong>mmap</strong>, is only used for reads in <strong>bolt</strong>. Another place that indicates this is in the definition of <a href="https://github.com/boltdb/bolt/blob/fd01fc79c553a8e99d512a07e8e0c63d4a3ccfc5/db.go#L100">DB struct</a>:</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><pre><code>dataref  []byte   // mmap'ed readonly, write throws SEGV
data     *[maxMapSize]byte</code></pre><p>That made perfect sense to me. Since flushes to disk are very hard to control when using <strong>mmap</strong>, it is probably the safest approach. How <strong>bolt</strong> does writing is a topic of another post. </p><h2 id="how-the-database-file-is-structured">How the database file is structured?</h2><p>We know how and when<strong> bolt </strong>allocates memory and that <strong>mmap</strong> is not used for writes. But how, exactly, <strong>bolt</strong> can find the value of a key? To understand that, we have to understand how typically databases structure their files. I am not going to do deep here. Mostly because I don't understand enough to go deep. Just going to try to give a glimpse of what is going on. </p><p>A file is just an array of bytes. We have to apply some reasoning to this array of bytes to work with it effectively. Databases structure their files in disk into blocks (chunks of bytes) called <strong>pages</strong>. <strong>bolt </strong>is no different. The database file can be seen as</p><figure><img src="https://brunocalza.me/content/images/2021/01/image--17-.png" alt=""></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Each page has a <strong>fixed length of bytes</strong>, typically the same size as the OS page (usually <code>4096 bytes</code>). Here is the <a href="https://github.com/boltdb/bolt/blob/fd01fc79c553a8e99d512a07e8e0c63d4a3ccfc5/db.go#L40">part</a> of <strong>bolt</strong> that sets the <code>pageSize</code>.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><pre><code>// default page size for db is set to the OS page size.
var defaultPageSize = os.Getpagesize()
</code></pre><p>Every database has its own page layout. The page layout of <strong>bolt</strong> is defined at <a href="https://github.com/boltdb/bolt/blob/fd01fc79c553a8e99d512a07e8e0c63d4a3ccfc5/page.go#L28">page.go</a> as</p><pre><code>const (

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="1"><span>Need to know</span></h2><div><p>Human beings find comfort in certainty. We form governments, make calendars, and create organisations; and we structure our activities, strategies and plans around these constructs. These routines give us the satisfaction of knowing that, by having a plan, thereâ€™s a means of it coming to fruition.</p>
<p>But thereâ€™s another force, constantly at play in life, that often makes the greatest difference to our futures: the â€˜unexpectedâ€™ or the â€˜unforeseenâ€™. If you think about it, you already look out for the unexpected every day, but perhaps only as a defence mechanism. For example, whenever you use a pedestrian crossing on a busy road, you look out for the unexpected driver who might race through the red light. That â€˜alertnessâ€™ to, or awareness of, the unexpected is at the centre of understanding the science of (smart) luck and exploiting it to your benefit.</p>
<p>In my research into what makes individuals and organisations fit for the future, one insight has come up again and again: many of the worldâ€™s leading minds have developed a capacity, often unconscious, to turn the unexpected into positive outcomes. Developing this â€˜serendipity mindsetâ€™, as I <a href="https://theserendipitymindset.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">call</a> it, is both a philosophy of life and a capability that you can shape and nurture in yourself. (Note, while this approach has been <a href="https://ssir.org/books/excerpts/entry/cultivating_serendipity" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">successful</a> across many settings, it does need to go hand in hand with tackling the structural inequality related to factors such as race, gender and income.)</p>
<p>You might think of serendipity as passive luck that just happens to you, when actually itâ€™s an active process of spotting and connecting the dots. It is about seeing bridges where others see gaps, and then taking initiative and action(s) to create smart luck. Serendipity is a guiding force in great scientific discoveries but itâ€™s also present in our everyday lives, in the smallest of moments as well as the greatest life-changing events. Itâ€™s how we often â€˜unexpectedlyâ€™ find love, a co-founder, a new job, or a business partner â€“ and itâ€™s how inventions such as Post-it Notes, X-rays, penicillin, microwaves and many other innovations came about.</p>
<p>My research suggests that serendipity has three core characteristics. It starts with a serendipity <em>trigger</em> â€“ the moment when you encounter something unusual or unexpected. Next, you need to <em>connect the dots</em> â€“ that is, observe the trigger and link it to something seemingly unrelated, thus realising the potential value within the chance event (sometimes referred to as a Eureka moment). Finally, <em>sagacity and tenacity</em> are required to follow through and create an unexpected positive outcome. While a particular chance encounter is an event, serendipity is a multifaceted process, as the figure below shows (note that the trigger and connecting the dots often happen at the same time).</p>
</div><div><figure data-align="center"><img src="https://d2e1bqvws99ptg.cloudfront.net/user_image_upload/1434/new-inset-graphic-.jpg" alt="" title=""><figcaption>Figure supplied by the author.</figcaption></figure></div><div>
<p>To be lucky, itâ€™s often essential to be open and alert to the unexpected. Consider an entertaining experiment that the British psychologist Richard Wiseman carried out for a BBC TV show some time ago, which involved just two people: one who saw himself as â€˜luckyâ€™, and one who identified herself as â€˜unluckyâ€™. The researchers asked both participants to take separate trips to a coffee shop outside which theyâ€™d placed a Â£5 note on the pavement. Inside, someone posing as a successful businessman sat at the table by the counter. The â€˜lucky personâ€™ approached, spotted the money and picked it up. Inside, he ordered a coffee, sat next to the businessman and struck up a conversation with him. The self-described â€˜unluckyâ€™ person, on the other hand, failed to notice the money or talk to the businessman. Later, the researchers asked both participants how their day had been. The â€˜luckyâ€™ person reported having had a great day â€“ heâ€™d found money in the street, and made a new friend (who might lead him to additional opportunities). Meanwhile, the â€˜unluckyâ€™ person described her day as uneventful. So, although both participants had the same chances, only one was able to â€˜seeâ€™ them.</p>
<p>Such an experiment â€“ while lighthearted â€“ shows that your mindset, and how you think about possibility in your life, can affect your ability to be alert when opportunity occurs. In fact, the terms â€˜unexpectedâ€™, â€˜extraordinaryâ€™ and â€˜unlikelyâ€™ are misleading because accidents or coincidences happen all the time. But we must be able to see the opportunity in the moment.</p>
<p>Although being alert to the unexpected is vital for creating smart luck, there is another key factor: preparation. This is partly about removing the barriers to serendipity, both mental (your mindset) and physical (the spaces you live and interact in), such as: overloaded schedules; senseless meetings; and the inefficiencies throughout your day that rob you of time, curiosity and a sense of joy. You can prepare by strengthening your mental readiness to connect with opportunity, and creating an environment that enables the use of your skills and available resources to act on the moment. An unprepared mind often discards unusual encounters, thereby missing the opportunities for smart luck. But this is a learned behaviour. Preparation is about developing the capacity to accelerate and harness the positive coincidences that show up in life. In this Guide, I will show you the basics of how to do this.</p></div></div></section><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="2"><span>What to do</span></h2><div><p><strong>Recognise and challenge your biases</strong></p>
<p>Our habits of thought and preconceptions about the world can make it difficult to spot or harness serendipity. They shape our behaviour and how we interact with the world. There are three major biases that will require the most attention to overcome if weâ€™re to effectively cultivate serendipity: underestimating the unexpected; hindsight bias; and functional fixedness.</p>
<p><em><strong>Underestimating the unexpected.</strong></em> Itâ€™s natural to underestimate the unexpected, but when you do, you tune out opportunities to create smart luck. Yes, itâ€™s unlikely that, on the day of your big presentation, Zoom crashes. Itâ€™s unlikely that the person who was supposed to evaluate your presentation gets sick. Itâ€™s unlikely that you spill coffee over your laptop right before the presentation. But add up all these unlikely events, and it becomes relatively likely that something unexpected might happen. Experienced presenters will often have a joke for when things go wrong â€“ knowing that, often, they do â€“ which tends to bring the audience over to their side as they appear to be quick on their feet and comfortable sharing their humanness. The same logic applies to all the good things that can happen throughout the day. Only once we accept that the unexpected happens all the time do we start â€˜seeingâ€™ it (like the â€˜luckyâ€™ person who spotted the money planted on the street in the experiment above) â€“ and begin to view it as a potential benefit or opportunity rather than a threat.</p>
<p><em><strong>Hindsight bias.</strong></em> When we construct stories of past events, we often act as if there was a linear trajectory, even though reality most probably followed a squiggly path. This can lead us to perceive events as having been more predictable than they were (known as â€˜hindsight biasâ€™), and to construct narratives that conveniently explain everything, ignoring the role of chance. This post-rationalisation speaks to our human need to find familiarity in the unknown, and to control anomalies. However, if you continually airbrush the many unexpected events out of your (hi)stories, youâ€™ll miss the importance of the unpredictable parts and therefore fail to recognise â€“ let alone legitimise â€“ the critical role that serendipity will play in your future.</p>
<p><em><strong>Functional fixedness.</strong></em> Whenever we use a tool in everyday life, weâ€™re so accustomed to its usual specific function that weâ€™re often unable to see its usefulness in other contexts â€“ a bias known as â€˜functional fixednessâ€™. Similarly, <a href="https://philpapers.org/rec/ADAFFA-2" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">research</a> has shown that individuals who are familiar with specific problem-solving strategies are unlikely to devise simpler ones, even if and when it could be appropriate. In other words, we tend to do many things out of habit â€“ weâ€™ll often persist with â€˜the hard wayâ€™ simply because itâ€™s the way we already know. Having the mental agility to improvise, to see how a tool could be used in a new way, is essential to building your serendipity mindset. Think of fictional characters, such as Lara Croft or James Bond, and how â€“ thanks to their quick-wittedness â€“ they manage to turn any ordinary object into a deadly weapon. While this is a Hollywood clichÃ©, weâ€™re nonetheless impressed by these characters because we recognise their talent and resourcefulness â€¦ and perhaps how unlikely we might have been to think of that solution when faced with their predicament. Your own creativity will thrive when you abandon the physical and mental tools with which youâ€™re most familiar, and find new ways to work or think.</p>
<p><strong>Cultivate your serendipity mindset</strong></p>
<p>As well as challenging your innate biases and making a conscious effort to think beyond your usual models or fixed ways of thinking, there are many more practical steps you can take to help develop or strengthen your serendipity muscle. Here are four. Together, theyâ€™ll help you identify the clutter in your life, clean it up and create space for serendipity; forge more connections; and see opportunity in crisis.</p>
<p><em><strong>Get in the habit of journalling</strong></em><strong>.</strong> If you are new to <a href="https://psyche.co/guides/to-start-to-heal-from-trauma-in-your-life-write-about-it" rel="noopener">journalling</a>, donâ€™t overthink it. Set a timer for two minutes, then list out in two columns the parts of your day that led to positive outcomes and the parts of the day that did not. As you break down your day into these segments, examine the parts that worked really well for you, and the ones that were inefficient, stressful or unfulfilling. You might begin to notice some patterns that stand out, for good or bad. Journalling and reflection is a way to begin decluttering your life, to explore the areas that take you out of being present, and …</p></div></div></section></div></div>

<p>"The authority has decided to intervene as a matter of urgency following the terrible story of the 10-year-old girl from Palermo," <a href="https://www.garanteprivacy.it/home/docweb/-/docweb-display/docweb/9524224" target="_blank">the authority, called Garante, said in a statement Friday</a>.</p>

<p>Ordinarily privacy enforcement against TikTok would be led by the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC), since the platform is legally established in Dublin. But Garante said it is invoking an emergency procedure that allows it to act directly against the company. It said it had notified the Irish authority of the restrictions, which will initially be in place until February 15.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the Irish DPC declined to comment on Garante's order, but confirmed that the DPC has been TikTok's lead authority under EU rules since mid-December.</p>
<p>The action comes while Garante was already investigating TikTok, <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1558838">having initiated a formal procedure against the app in December.</a> TikTok did not respond to a request for comment. </p>

</p>
                    <p>I’ll start my article from the biggest myth about NixOS. And soon you’ll know why.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>DevOps-friendly. Declarative specs and safe upgrades make NixOS a great system for DevOps use. NixOps, the NixOS cloud deployment tool, allows you to provision and manage networks of NixOS machines in environments like Amazon EC2 and VirtualBox. (c) <a href="https://nixos.org/">NixOS.org</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I will continuously update this article each time I’ll face a new weird and challenging task that makes your life much harder if you’re using NixOS instead of traditional Linux distributions.</p>
<p>Well, I’m a lucky guy… I have no choice right now and have to spend most of my working time on NixOS automation. To this moment of time I have more than 10 years experience of using different Linux distributions and more than 6 months of NixOS experience. And most of my experience with NixOS is bad experience.</p>
<h2 id="why-you-may-want-to-use-nixos">Why you may want to use NixOS.</h2>
<p>I’ll try to write something here. Hope, I’ll be able to…</p>
<h3 id="determinism">Determinism.</h3>
<p>It is declared and provided to you by the system design, that you’ll get the same version of any software package from the derivation. Lie!</p>
<p>All it’s determinism is about that it deterministically gives you a lot of issues, which you need to overcome manually without any support.</p>
<p>You may install Nix tools on Linux and OS X, for example. But it is not always building the same derivation results on Linux and NixOS itself. So, it is not OS agnostic. There’re a lot of examples of such behavior, for example, <code>fetchgit</code> and <code>fetchFromGitHub</code> functions:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/28324">fetchgit/fetchFromGitHub fail to fetch submodules from “git@server:repo” URLs</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/NixOS/cabal2nix/issues/260">Use <code>fetchFromGitHub</code> instead of <code>fetchgit</code> when the source is a GitHub clone URL</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/27327">fetchgit -&gt; fetchFromGitHub where possible</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues/1880">How to manually replicate/reproduce/obtain the sha256 hash specified in Nix with fetchgit or fetchFromGitHub?</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Meanwhile in the official manual to the current and latest <a href="https://nixos.org/nixpkgs/manual/#version-18-09-1373-50fb6820759">version-18-09-1373-50fb6820759</a> they are still using <code>fetchgit</code>.</p>
<h2 id="why-you-should-never-ever-use-nixos">Why you should never ever use NixOS.</h2>
<p>Here I’m gonna collect all my daily pain in a single place, which I hope will help people not to make somebody’s else mistakes. This is my personal view on the problem space and it can not be affiliated with the company or project where I’m working right now.</p>

<p>Sure, there are a lot of enthusiasts who are playing with NixOS by installing it on their workstations of VMs, but in comparison with Ubuntu, CentOS, Debian or RedHat:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>That means you will not be able:</p>
<ul>
<li>To get fast or enterprise support.</li>
<li>To to hire people to manage it.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="documentation">Documentation.</h3>
<p>Official documentation is awful. Or it is just absent. NixOS is older than Docker. They are solving the same task, but NixOS is way less popular. Try to think why.</p>
<p>NIX CONFIGURATION LANGUAGE
It is functional language which name is also Nix and it is a core of this system configuration. If you’re coming from OOP world it will be very difficult to understand that “language”. You must go to swallow <a href="https://nixos.org/nixos/nix-pills/">Nix pills</a> to even try to understand something about it.</p>
<p>SOFTWARE MANAGEMENT
“Derivation” is a way of describing software distribution in NixOS. Each derivation represents software, plugin or a library. Common syntax of describing it looks like this (nginx derivation example):</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="nix">{ stdenv<span>,</span> fetchurl<span>,</span> openssl<span>,</span> zlib<span>,</span> pcre<span>,</span> libxml2<span>,</span> libxslt

</code></pre></div><p>Interesting, isn’t it?</p>
<p>If yes, get ready, you’ll not be able to live in the system without writing something like that. <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs">Nix Packages GitHub repository</a> will be your second home, where you’ll be looking for examples of Nix expressions, configuration approaches and other examples.</p>
<h3 id="configuration-management">Configuration management.</h3>
<p>System state and configuration described in a special file <code>configuration.nix</code>. It’s like an entry point to endless amount of functions and dependencies for your OS.</p>
<p>Want to customize something in the OS, be ready, you’ll need to write your custom <code>systemd</code> service to do that. Aaand, yes, service configuration file also need to be declared using Nix expression language.</p>
<p>All standard system configuration files like <code>/etc/fstab</code>, for example are generated by a weird code and read only.</p>
<p>Forget about Chef, Puppet or Ansible! Only Nix expressions! Only hardcore!</p>
<h3 id="kernel-upgrade">Kernel upgrade.</h3>
<p>It is not possible just to upgrade the kernel from “ver1” to “ver2”. New kernel will bring whole set of system packages and their dependencies with it. Do not know if it is safe. Will test it soon.</p>
<h3 id="cloud-support">Cloud support.</h3>
<p>Nix is not ready for a cloud. At all. I’m always facing the following situations on NixOS 18.03:</p>
<ul>
<li>OS is not booting from the AMI.</li>
<li>OS is not supporting newest AWS instance types (like m5.*, for example).</li>
<li>NixOS 18.03 is not always able to resize your hard drive when it’s boot.</li>
<li>Do not even try to use it in Auto Scaling group and passing configuration.nix content through user-data. You may easily get to the loop, when instance start building something new from the derivations during it’s boot process, 100% CPU utilizations will require AutoScaling Group to launch additional instances that also will build something, all the instances are unhealthy and Auto Scaling group will start terminating the first instance in a loop. Your service will never start.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cache">Cache.</h3>
<p>To speedup software installation in NixOS the community provides you with Nix Binary Cache, where they put everything they’ve built successfully. Every version of every derivation.</p>
<p>Problems start happening when you spinning up your personal cache, which is used, for example to store your proprietary build artifacts. You always need to keep eye on the community channel version you’re using as a base for your builds. And yes, your own cache size will also grow very fast!</p>
<p>Some very talented developers start using Nix binary cache to cache everything’s possible. For example NPM or Yarn packages. Good luck!</p>
<h3 id="security">Security.</h3>
<p>People are thinking, that NixOS deterministic approach of dealing with software is very secure. Maybe yes, it is really not possible to hijack the build results once the derivation bin build. But… You always need to pay for it…</p>
<p>During the upgrade from 18.03 to 18.09 Nix community decided to change Docker tools they’ve been use to calculate derivations checksums where you were dealing with Docker images.</p>
<p>As a result we rewrote all Docker based derivation declarations and more over to rebuild them all. It was really painful and unmanaged migration.</p>
<h3 id="windows-support">Windows support.</h3>
<p>Just forget about it.</p>
<h3 id="system-requirements">System requirements.</h3>
<p>It requires a lot of CPU power to build it’s stuff and really a lot of space to store its multiple versions. Much more, than you need in traditional Linux distros.</p>
<h3 id="once-invested">Once invested.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Try to change a technology stack as soon as possible.</li>
<li>Do not listen anybody.</li>
<li>Do not reinvent the wheel.</li>
<li>Just waste it.</li>
</ul>
<p>And, God, do not try to run Nix in Docker! It’s really, not, REALLY bad idea!</p>
<h3 id="what-to-do-next">What to do next.</h3>
<p>Run away! Not, seriously! Run. From. It. Away.</p>
<p>When you try to summarize all your thoughts around the topic you want to cover in a post, you’re starting from simple Google search. One of results to my “nixos pros and cons” query: <a href="https://alternative.me/nixos">NixOS alternatives</a>. Kinda joke, but really, think twice when you’re making decision to invest your time or money in it. And I would also think …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

January 23, 2021 | https://boris-marinov.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/03_monoid/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://boris-marinov.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/03_monoid/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <!--<h1>Monoids</h1> -->
        

<p>Since we are done with categories, letâ€™s look at some other structures that are also interesting - monoids. Like categories, monoids/groups are also abstract systems consisting of objects and rules for manipulating these objects.</p>



<p>Monoids are simpler than categories. A monoid is defined by a collection (set) of elements and an operation that allows us to combine two element and produce a third one of the same kind.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s take our familiar colourful balls.</p>

<p><img src="https://boris-marinov.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/03_monoid/balls.svg" alt="Balls"></p>

<p>In this case a monoid would be a rule (operation) for â€œcombiningâ€� two balls into one.</p>

<p>An example of such rule would be blending the colors of the balls, as if we are mixing paint.</p>

<p><img src="https://boris-marinov.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/03_monoid/balls_rule.svg" alt="A rule for combining balls"></p>

<p>You can probably think of other ways to define such a rule. This will help you realize that there can be many ways to create a monoid from a given set of items. The monoid is not the set itself, it is the set <em>together with the rule</em>.</p>

<h2 id="associativity">Associativity</h2>

<p>The monoid rule should, like functional composition, be â€œassociativeâ€� i.e. applying it on the same number of elements in a different order should make no difference.</p>

<p><img src="https://boris-marinov.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/03_monoid/balls_associativity.svg" alt="Associativity in the color mixing operation"></p>

<p>When a rule is associative, this means we can use all kinds of algebraic operations to any sequence of terms (or in other words to apply equation reasoning), like for example we can replace any element with a set of elements from which it is composed of, or add a term that is present at both sides of an equation and retaining the equality of the existing terms.</p>

<p><img src="https://boris-marinov.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/03_monoid/balls_arithmetic.svg" alt="Associativity in the color mixing operation"></p>

<h2 id="the-identity-element">The identity element</h2>

<p>Actually, not any (associative) rule for combining elements makes the balls form a monoid (it makes them form a â€œsemigroupâ€�, which is also a thing, but thatâ€™s a separate topic). In order to be a monoid, a set must feature what is called an â€œidentity elementâ€� of a given rule (or a <em>zero</em> element, if you prefer) - one that, when combined with any other element gives back that same element not the identity but the other one. Or simply <strong>x â€¢ i = x and i â€¢ x = x for any x</strong>. In the case of our color-mixing monoid the identity element is the white  ball (or perhaps a transparent one, if we have one).</p>

<p><img src="https://boris-marinov.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/03_monoid/balls_identity.svg" alt="The identity element of the color-mixing monoid"></p>

<p>As you probably remember from the last chapter, functional composition is also associative and it also contains an identity element, so you might start suspecting that it forms a monoid in some way. And it is really the case with one little caveat.</p>

<p>To keep the suspense alive, letâ€™s see some simpler monoids before we dwelve into that:</p>



<h2 id="monoids-from-numbers">Monoids from numbers</h2>

<p>Mathematics is not all about numbers, however numbers do tend to pop up in most of its areas and monoids are no exception. The set of natural numbers <em>N</em> form a monoid when combined with the all too familiar operation of addition (or to use the official terminology <em>N</em> <em>form</em> a monoid <em>under</em> addition).</p>

<p><img src="https://boris-marinov.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/03_monoid/numbers_addition.svg" alt="The monoid of numbers under addition"></p>

<p>(if you see a <strong>1 + 1 = 2</strong> in your textbook you know you are working on math foundations (or you are in kindergarten)).</p>

<p>The natural numbers also form a monoid under multiplication as well:</p>

<p><img src="https://boris-marinov.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/03_monoid/numbers_multiplication.svg" alt="The monoid of numbers under multiplication"></p>

<p><strong>Task:</strong> Which are the identity elements of those monoids?</p>

<p><strong>Task:</strong> Go through other mathematical operations and figure out why donâ€™t they are not monoidal.</p>

<h2 id="monoids-from-boolean-algebra">Monoids from boolean algebra</h2>

<p>Thinking about other operations that we covered (operation being a function which takes a pair of element of a given type and returns one element of the same type), we may remember the boolean operations <strong>AND</strong> and <strong>OR</strong>. which operate on the set, consisting of just two values <strong>{ True, False }</strong>. Those operations form monoids too. Proving that they do is easy enough by just enumerating all cases.</p>

<p>We can prove that <strong>AND</strong> is associative by expanding the formula <strong>(A AND B) AND C = A AND (B AND C)</strong> in all possible ways:</p>

<p><strong>(TRUE AND FALSE) AND TRUE = TRUE AND (FALSE AND TRUE)</strong></p>

<p><strong>(TRUE AND FALSE) AND FALSE = TRUE AND (FALSE AND FALSE)</strong></p>

<p><strong>(FALSE AND FALSE) AND TRUE = FALSE AND (FALSE AND TRUE)</strong></p>

<p>â€¦</p>

<p>And we can prove that <strong>TRUE</strong> is the identity element by expanding the other formulas that state that for all elements <strong>A</strong> <strong>I AND A = A</strong></p>

<p><strong>FALSE AND TRUE = FALSE</strong></p>

<p><strong>TRUE AND TRUE = TRUE</strong></p>

<p>â€¦and then do the same for <strong>A AND I = A</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="intuitions">Intuitions</h2>

<p>In order to form the correct intuition about monoids, try to avoid thinking of the elements in the set as objects, but instead think of them as <em>actions</em>. For example, when thinking about numbers donâ€™t think of them as <em>quantities</em> (as in two apples, two oranges etc.), but as <em>operations</em>, (e.g. as the action of adding one to a given quantity). In other words, donâ€™t think of the element by itself, but only think of it together with the operation (in this case addition).</p>

<p>This touches a programming concept which is very popular in category-theory inspired languages - currying - that is based on the idea that a function that accepts two arguments together with one of those arguments already supplied can be viewed as a function which takes one argument. e.g. the function <code>add(number, number)</code> together with the element <code>2</code> is equivalent to the <code>addTwo(number)</code> function.</p>

<p>In general, we use monoids and related structures as a way to model how a set of (associative) actions that are performed on a given object (or objects) alter itâ€™s state. We can do that, provided that the objectâ€™s state is determined solemnly by the actions that are performed on it, this allows us to leave the object out of the equation and concentrate on how the actions are combined. And as per usual in the actions (and objects) can be anything, from mixing colors in paint, or adding a quantities to a given set of things etc.</p>



<p>Monoid operations obey two laws - they are associative and there is an identity element. In some cases we come across operations that also obey other laws that are also interesting. Imposing more (or less) rules to the way in which actions are combinded results in the definition of other monoid-like structures.</p>

<h2 id="commutative-abelian-monoids">Commutative (abelian) monoids</h2>

<p>Looking at the monoid laws and the examples we gave so far, we observe that all of them obey one more rule (law) which we didnâ€™t specify - the order in which the operations are applied is irrelevant to the end result.</p>

<p><img src="https://boris-marinov.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/03_monoid/monoid_commutative.svg" alt="Commutative monoid operation"></p>

<p>Such operations (ones for which combining a given set of objects yields the same result no matter which one is first and which one is second) are called <em>commutative</em> operations. Monoids with operations that are commutative are called <em>commutative monoids</em>.</p>

<p>As we said, addition is commutative as well - it does not matter whether if I have given you 1 apple and then 2 more, or if I have given you 2 first and then 1 more.</p>

<p><img src="https://boris-marinov.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/03_monoid/addition_commutative.svg" alt="Commutative monoid operation"></p>

<p>All monoids that we examined so far are also <em>commutative</em>, but we will see some non-commutative ones later.</p>

<h2 id="groups">Groups</h2>

<p>A group is a monoid in which each element has what is called an â€œinverseâ€� element where the element and its inverse cancel each other out when applied one after the other, in other words , <strong>forall x, there must exist xâ€™ such that x â€¢ xâ€™ = i</strong> ( where <strong>i</strong> is the identity element).</p>

<p>If we view <em>monoids</em> as a means of modelling the effect of applying a set of (associative) actions, we use <em>groups</em> to model the effects of actions are also <em>reversible</em>.</p>

<p>An nice example of a group can be found in the realm of numbers (really, numbers are a nice example of almost all laws) - it is the set of integers under addition, where the inverse of each number is its opposite number (positive numbersâ€™ inverse are negatives and vice versa). The above formula, then, becomes <strong>x + (-x) = 0</strong></p>

<p>The study of groups is a field that is much bigger than the theory of monoids (and perhaps bigger than category theory itself).</p>

<p>And it all started with the what are now called the â€œsymmetry groupsâ€� which we will look into in more detail.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>The algebraic structures that we saw can be summarized based on the laws that define them in this table.</p>

<p>An interesting kinds of groups/monoids are the groups of <em>symmetries</em> of geometric figures. Given some geometric figure, a symmetry is an action after which the figure is not displaced (e.g. it can fit into the same mold that it fit before the action was applied).</p>

<p>We wonâ€™t use the balls this time, as they have just one position just one action - the identity action (which is itâ€™s own reverse by the way). So letâ€™s take this triangle (which for our purposes, is the same as any other triangle).</p>

<p><img src="https://boris-marinov.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/03_monoid/symmetry_group.svg" alt="A triangle"></p>

<h2 id="groups-of-rotations">Groups of rotations</h2>

<p>Letâ€™s first review the group of ways in which we can rotate our triangle i.e. its <em>rotation group</em>. A geometric figure can be rotated without displacement in positions equal to the number of its sides, so for our triangle there are 3 positions.</p>

<p><img src="https://boris-marinov.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/03_monoid/symmetry_rotation.svg" alt="The group of rotations in a triangle"></p>

<p>Connecting the dots (or the triangles in this case) shows us that there are just two possible actions that get us from any state to any other one - a <em>120-degree rotation</em> (i.e. flipping the triangle one time) and a <em>240-degree rotation</em> (i.e. flipping it two times (or equivalently, flipping it once, but in the opposite direction)). Adding the identity action of 0-degree rotation makes up for 3 actions in total.</p>

<p><img src="https://boris-marinov.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/03_monoid/symmetry_rotation_actions.svg" alt="The group of rotations in a triangle"></p>

<h2 id="cyclic-groupsmonoids">Cyclic groups/monoids</h2>

<p>Ennumerating all the rotations of a more complex geometrical figure looks quite messy at first.</p>

<p><img src="https://boris-marinov.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/03_monoid/symmetry_rotation_square.svg" alt="The group of rotations in a more complex figure"></p>

<p>But itâ€™s much simpler to grasp if we notice the following: although our group has many actions, and there are more still for figures with more sides (if I am not mistaken, the number of actions is equal to the number of the sides), all of those actions can be reduced to the repetitive application of just the simplest action, (the 120-degree rotation for triangles and the 30-degree rotation for octagons). Letâ€™s make up a symbol for this rotation.</p>

<p><img src="https://boris-marinov.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/03_monoid/symmetry_rotation_cyclic.svg" alt="The group of rotations in a triangle"></p>

<p>Groups and monoids that have this â€œmainâ€� action (called a â€œgeneratorâ€�) which when applied enough times can get you to any state that which is <em>cyclic groups</em>. All rotation groups are cyclic groups. Another example of a cyclic groups is, yes, the integers under addition. Here we can use <strong>+1</strong> or <strong>-1</strong> as generators.</p>

<p><img src="https://boris-marinov.github.io/category-theory-illustrated/03_monoid/numbers_cyclic.svg" alt="The group of numbers under addition"></p>

<p>Wait, how can this be a cyclic group when there are no cycles? This is because the …</p></div></div>

<p>Raspberry Pi 400 has sufficient power to run full-featured microservices written in Swift. Running Swift (together with MongoDB) on such a small gadget is serious fun!</p>

<p>I’ve tested this setup on Raspberry PI 400 which has a quad core processor, 4 GB of RAM and a speedy USB 3.0 SSD, however the instructions below are not limited only to this device. <br>
Even though base configuration was not overclocked, I’ve managed to run simple <a href="http://vapor.codes/">Vapor-based microservice</a>, and achieve over 10 000 req/sec on this little piece of silicon!</p>

<p><img src="https://www.marcinkliks.pl/uploads/pi-10k-24fa0e.png" width="800"></p>

<h2 id="installing-swift-on-rasperry-pi">Installing Swift on Rasperry PI</h2>

<p>If you want to use the latest Vapor 4, you need to upgrade Raspberry PI OS to 64 bits. Otherwise, this step may be skipped.</p>

<p>Ideal setup, as of 01/2020 is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Swift 5.3.1</li>
  <li>MongoDB 4.9.0</li>
  <li>Nginx</li>
</ul>

<p>For IDE we will use:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Visual Studio Code 1.52.1 (latest current version)</li>
  <li>sourcekit-lsp trunk (revision:6eb17c9a7bc00bec83d57d2399ba9f5ab14d3bcc )</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="upgrading-to-rasperry-pi-os-64-bit">Upgrading to Rasperry PI OS 64 bit</h2>

<p>Swift ARM builds are available here: <a href="https://packagecloud.io/swift-arm/release">https://packagecloud.io/swift-arm/release</a>. 
Unfortunatelly, the latest version for Rasperry PI OS (default distribution) is 5.1.3 and it’s not usable with the latest Vapor 4 version. We need to upgrade the operating system to 64 bits.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Install the beta version of Rasperry PI OS 64 bit <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?p=1668160">here</a> if you need the latest Swift.</li>
  <li>Install swift package from packagecloud.io <code>https://packagecloud.io/swift-arm/release/packages/debian/buster/swiftlang_5.3.1-3-debian-buster_arm64.deb</code> with <code>dpkg -i</code></li>
  <li>Swift REPL is not usable at the moment, but it’s not a big deal so don’t worry.</li>
  <li>Swap file. Swift needs a lot of memory during the compilation, so let’s find a spare SSD drive, and create some fast swap files, at least 5 GB.
    <div><div><pre><code>swapoff <span>-a</span>
<span>dd </span><span>if</span><span>=</span>/dev/zero <span>of</span><span>=</span>/media/[yourssd]/swap <span>ibs</span><span>=</span>1M <span>obs</span><span>=</span>1M <span>count</span><span>=</span>5000
mkswap /media/[yourssd]/swap
swapon /media/[yourssd]/swap
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>That’s it. Test if your code compiles. Vapor 4 should run just fine!
    <div><div><pre><code>swift package init <span>--type</span> executable
swift build
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="ide-on-raspberry-pi-with-visual-studio-code-lsp-and-swift">IDE on Raspberry PI with Visual Studio Code, LSP and Swift</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Install ARM64 DEB package from Visual Studio Code <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">https://code.visualstudio.com/download</a></li>
  <li>You need this package: <code>https://github.com/apple/sourcekit-lsp</code> to use the Auto-Completion functionality in Visual Studio Code, because version 5.3.1 is unusably slow. The new version is 10 times more performant. We will compile it from sources using this documentation <a href="https://github.com/apple/sourcekit-lsp/blob/main/Documentation/Development.md">here</a>. 
This will work for arm64:</li>
</ol>

<div><div><pre><code>swift build -c release -Xcxx -I/usr/lib/swift -Xcxx -I/usr/lib/swift/Block
cp .build/aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu/release/sourcekit-lsp /usr/local/bin/sourcekit-lsp

apt-get install npm
cd Editors/vscode
npm run createDevPackage
code --install-extension ./out/sourcekit-lsp-vscode-dev.vsix
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>After installation, every feature should work well, including: autocompletion, fix-its, documentation, go to definition.
If not, it’s probably because of the internal card speed - see below how to improve the performance by a factor of 10.</p>

<h2 id="optimization">Optimization</h2>

<p>SD cards tend to be slow. I recommend to either boot from an SSD entirely, or boot from an SD card, but in this case move the essential data to faster drive. It makes a huge difference during development.</p>

<p><strong>Directories to move to external faster drive:</strong></p>
<div><div><pre><code>~/.config/Code <span>(</span><span>for </span>Visual Studio Code<span>)</span>
~/.cache  <span>(</span><span>for </span>various developmnt tasks<span>)</span>
/tmp <span>(</span>e.g. lsp cache<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can tune your system for maximum performance:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288
cd /sys/devices/system/cpu
echo performance &gt; cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor 
echo performance &gt; cpu1/cpufreq/scaling_governor 
echo performance &gt; cpu2/cpufreq/scaling_governor 
echo performance &gt; cpu3/cpufreq/scaling_governor 
echo performance &gt; cpu4/cpufreq/scaling_governor 
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="mongodb-on-raspberry-pi">MongoDB on Raspberry PI</h2>

<p>Ok, this is an optional step. Chances are, your microservice needs a database, such as MongoDB. Yes, it works just fine, but you need to compile it from sources.</p>

<p>You need at least 20 GB of free space for compilation. Compilation will take at least 5-10 hours.</p>

<p>We will compile as usual using <code>https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/master/docs/building.md</code>, but have to provide additional flag since there are problems with crc32 because of missing instructions. <a href="https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-30893">More information here</a></p>

<p>Using flag <code>--use-hardware-crc32=off</code> will compile it fine. Full script should look similar to this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/mongodb/mongo.git

python3 <span>-m</span> vevn virtualenv
<span>source </span>virtualenv/bin/activate

python3 buildscripts/scons.py install-mongod <span>--disable-warnings-as-errors</span> <span>--use-hardware-crc32</span><span>=</span>off

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Congratulations, after 5-10 hours, you will get the 4,2 GB binary file called <code>mongodb</code>. It’s time to strip it to just ~40 MB with the instructions below:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>root@raspberrypi:/media/pi/rpi/mongo# <span>ls </span>build/install/bin/mongod
build/install/bin/mongod

root@raspberrypi:/media/pi/rpi/mongo# strip build/install/bin/mongod
root@raspberrypi:/media/pi/rpi/mongo# <span>cp </span>build/install/bin/mongod /usr/local/bin
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now it’s time to prepare a storage space for a database and logs. Use your external drive and mount it somewhere. E.g. create <code>mongo-data</code> and <code>mongo-logs</code> directories, and use the following configuration files as examples.
I used the simplest configuration possible. I recommend changing the default user <code>pi</code>, for security reasons.</p>

<div><p><a href="https://relayvibes.co/tag/Italianauthority">Italian authority</a> has blocked certain users from accessing TikTok. Users, who can’t definitely verify their age after the tragic death of a young girl who is taking part in a “blackout challenge”, from accessing Tiktok.</p>
<p>This girl’s death was firstly reported by ANSA on Thursday when it happened.</p>
<p>From the report:</p>
<p>A Italian girl,10, was pronounced brain dead by a Palermo hospital on Thursday after she took the Blackout Challenge on TikTok.</p>
<p>Her parents have accepted to donate the organs of the girl, who tied a belt round her neck to self-asphyxiate in the challenge on Tiktok.</p>
<p>Read also: <strong><a href="https://relayvibes.co/tiktok-star-tony-lopez-sued-for-sexual-battery/">TikTok Star, Tony Lopez Sued For Sexual Battery</a></strong></p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/23/italy-blocks-tiktok-for-certain-users-after-death-of-girl-allegedly-playing-choking-game#:~:text=Italian%20prosecutors%20have%20opened%20an,could%20not%20be%20proved%20definitively." target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Guardian</a>, an investigation has been opened by Italian prosecutors , and Italy has temporarily blocked users from gaining access to the popular social platform “whose age couldn’t be verified.”</p>
<p>TikTok had reported that it has not discovered any content on its site that may have persuaded the girl to participate in the challenge, but was assisting the authorities in probing the incident.</p>
<p>A Tiktok spokesperson said: “The safety of the TikTok community is our absolute priority, for this reason we do not allow any content which encourages, promotes or glorifies behavior that could be dangerous”</p>
<p>The report shows that the Italian Data Protection Authority had blocked TikTok till February 15th immediately till regulator’s demands are met. This challenge being referred to was also reportedly called “scarfing” or “the choking game”, involving participants blocking oxygen to their brain in order to get high. The girl’s parents told La Repubblica that they are not aware of the game and only aware of their daughter going on TikTok for dances, and to watch videos.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When they came to him, straightway he cast the serpent into the deep sea, where he lies about all the land; and this serpent grew so greatly that he lies in the midst of the ocean encompassing all the land, and bites upon his own tail.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>– Snorri Sturluson</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let me begin with a throat clearing. I’m all for free (as in free speech) software. I have contributed, in small ways at least, to free &amp; open source projects, I admire many of its proponents &amp; contributors &amp; am increasingly trading out proprietary tools &amp; services for free ones. The <a href="https://github.com/erwald/blog">code for this website</a> is free. Nearly every other software project I have undertaken privately is also free. I think that <a href="https://www.erichgrunewald.com/posts/evolution-of-programming-language-traits/">making software free is good for innovation</a>. It’s good for programmers. It’s good for people. It’s the kind of thing that everybody can get behind.</p>
<p>But (&amp; you knew there was going to be a “but”) the philosophy that Richard Stallman presents in <em><a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/shouldbefree.en.html">Why Software Should Be Free</a></em> goes too far for me. It goes so far that it bends into a circle &amp; eats its own tail, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%B6rmungandr">the world-serpent of the Norse sagas</a>. That is to say, there is a contradiction at its heart, precisely where its theory meets its praxis.</p>
<p>I will explain what I mean by that soon enough. But first I will try to summarise Stallman’s argument as clearly &amp; sympathetically as I can. The argument goes something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>When somebody has tailored themselves a jacket, they own that jacket. They are justified in controlling it because if they were not, somebody else could do something with it which would be bad for its owner, or somebody else could steal it which, again, would be bad for its owner as it would deprive them of a jacket. The same isn’t true for software. If someone copies your program, you still have your program. If someone modifies the copy, your program is still unmodified.</li>
<li>Hence no creator is justified, when their created thing is immaterial, in controlling that thing. The two are separate from one another. The creator is entitled to credit &amp; gratitude for their work but they are not – no matter how much time, skill or effort was involved in creating it – justified in controlling its spread or use.</li>
<li>Proprietary software is like private roads. Free software is like public roads. Either we could have a world where all roads are privately built &amp; funded by tolls, such that private actors would be incentivised to build roads because they profit directly from it; or we could have a world where all roads are publicly funded &amp; freely available to whoever wishes to use them. The latter is more beneficial to society &amp; less costly for it.</li>
<li>The utility of allowing free access to a program is greater than that of restricting access to it, which in fact causes harm, e.g. by preventing others from learning about it, by preventing them from building on it, by reducing innovation or by damaging social cohesion. Therefore, each person is not only justified but even obliged to spread programs freely, no matter who created them. Because this is what will maximise utility for those who use programs. As Stallman writes:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Suppose that both you and your neighbor would find it useful to run a certain program. In ethical concern for your neighbor, you should feel that proper handling of the situation will enable both of you to use it. A proposal to permit only one of you to use the program, while restraining the other, is divisive; neither you nor your neighbor should find it acceptable.</p>
<p>Signing a typical software license agreement means betraying your neighbor: “I promise to deprive my neighbor of this program so that I can have a copy for myself.” People who make such choices feel internal psychological pressure to justify them, by downgrading the importance of helping one’s neighbors – thus public spirit suffers. […]</p>
<p>Many users unconsciously recognize the wrong of refusing to share, so they decide to ignore the licenses and laws, and share programs anyway. But they often feel guilty about doing so. They know that they must break the laws in order to be good neighbors, but they still consider the laws authoritative, and they conclude that being a good neighbor (which they are) is naughty or shameful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think it’s important to distinguish between two senses of ownership here. The first is that of exerting control over a thing. The second is that of benefitting somehow, in a privileged way, from a thing. Stallman argues that the first is not only wrong but even incoherent in a way, since there can be no owner of software in that way. From what I can tell, Stallman is fine with a programmer benefitting from the programs they write. He writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We thus have a paradox: the developer of useful software is entitled to the support of the users, but any attempt to turn this moral obligation into a requirement destroys the basis for the obligation. A developer can either deserve a reward or demand it, but not both.</p>
<p>I believe that an ethical developer faced with this paradox must act so as to deserve the reward, but should also entreat the users for voluntary donations. Eventually the users will learn to support developers without coercion, just as they have learned to support public radio and television stations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, he seems to think that it’s only fine to the extent that benefitting is divorced from exerting control, viz. when the programmer benefits passively but doesn’t restrict their program in order to do so. I think this is somewhat disingenuous because recognising that the programmer is justified in benefitting passively from a program they wrote means recognising that the program they wrote is “tethered” to them in some way. It means that their having written the program gives them some rights with regard to it (specifically, the right to benefit from it). But if <em>that’s</em> true, there is reason to believe also that their having written the program gives them some rights to control it, which Stallman denies.</p>
<p>That’s not normally how we think about these things. We usually think whoever comes up with a new thing <em>is</em> justified in acting to benefit from it. Imagine a nobody approaches a Hollywood studio executive with an idea for a movie. The person is rebuffed but the studio goes on to make the movie anyway: it is a huge box office success. The person sees none of the money. Doesn’t it seem like the studio executive wronged that person? Like they used that person as a mere means to further their own ends? Under Stallman’s view there’d be nothing wrong with this; under his view, the only thing that’d be wrong is if the person had then decided to sue the studio for damages.</p>
<p>But let’s say, for the sake of argument, that Stallman can smoothen out that friction. Let’s say that the scenario with the studio executive <a href="https://www.erichgrunewald.com/posts/tolstoy-in-ryazan/">seems wrong intuitively</a> but is not wrong upon deliberation. Stallman holds that it is wrong to exert control over a program once you’ve written it. But the GNU General Public License (which I like) does exactly this. It restricts people in the way that they use the licensed program. <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html">GPL-3</a>, the latest of them, does this in a variety of ways, by requiring the user to:</p>
<ul>
<li>include information about where to find the original software,</li>
<li>include information about how the software has been modified,</li>
<li>include installation instructions,</li>
<li>retain the GPL-3 license &amp;</li>
<li>retain the original copyright.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these are ways in which the owner, who selected the license, exerts control over the program &amp; the user, who is bound by it. In other words, GPL-3 &amp; its ancestor licenses recognise the creator’s right to a measure of control over the thing they created even after it’s out there in the world. That makes some of Stallman’s arguments, such as the example of the neighbours that I quoted earlier, sound almost incoherent.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup> Thus the world-serpent bites its own tail.</p>
<p>There’s now no room for defence left on any ground outside utilitarianism. Ownership of a program is only bad to the extent that it produces bad outcomes; &amp; it is also good to the extent that it produces good outcomes. But there’s nothing inherently bad or incoherent about it. Stallman does speak of consequences &amp; cost-benefit analyses. Personally, I am neither a consequentialist nor a utilitarian. I am a Kantian, I think. I am, however, willing to consider utilitarian arguments. But in my opinion the argument from pure utilitarianism is not nearly strong enough to support the sort of conclusions that Stallman draws, such as that one is obliged to share a program with those who want it against the wishes of its creator. And I think no full account of software can be made without really considering which duties we have towards those who create it.</p>

</li>
<li id="fn2"><p>The example of the neighbours is a little strange in that it only seems to consider the utility of the neighbours &amp; not that of the creator of the program. I think that’s because, in Stallman’s view, there’s no such thing as an owner, so the creator has no rights over the program. This muddles things up a bit because it’s no longer a universal utilitarian argument.</p>
<p>One could argue against the example of the neighbours on consequentialist grounds. For instance, it could deprive the creator of monetary compensation, or it could create risks for them, e.g. from the neighbour’s using the program for something immoral, causing the creator to become associated with that immoral act.</p>
<p>But it would be hard to think of this reading Stallman’s presentation of the example because it magics away the programmer who wrote the program &amp; human agency generally. Hence he writes that “proper handling of the situation will enable both of you to use it” &amp; that “[a] proposal to permit only one of you to use [it] is divisive”. The acting agents here are a “proper handling” &amp; a “proposal”. <a href="#fnref2">↩︎</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Here’s a thing I don’t see appreciated enough about Rust: <code>loop</code>.
I know I don’t think about it all that much,
but pretty much every time I use it I feel a bit of satisfaction.</p>

<p><code>loop</code> is just an unconditional loop:
it loops forever, or until you write <code>break</code>, or <code>return</code>.</p>

<p>Most languages don’t have it.</p>

<p>Instead, loop constructs usually have some kind of termination condition,
your <code>while</code> and <code>for</code> loops.
Apparently <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sather">Sather</a></em> has an unconditional <code>loop</code> keyword like Rust.
I only know this because a programming language historian mentioned it <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/1906#issuecomment-4240501">on the bug tracker</a>.</p>

<p>Why do I love <code>loop</code>?</p>

<p>Because it frees me from thinking about how to end a loop
before I’ve even started writing it.</p>

<p>Many problems are easy to recognize as ones that require a looping solution:
I quickly realize, “I have to do something multiple times”.</p>

<p>Sometimes that loop just involves iterating over a container of things,
one at a time.
That’s easy to recognize as a <code>for thing in things { }</code> situation.
Other loops have more complex conditions though.
Often when I’m solving a looping problem,
I will know one or some of the steps I intend to do in a loop,
but will not envision the complete solution ahead of time.</p>

<p>So I just write</p>



<p>and start coding what I do know needs to happen,
and work from there.</p>

<p>For some reason this feels great.</p>

<p>Once I have solved my looping problem,
there will be a <code>break</code> or <code>return</code> somewhere in there,
or multiple <code>break</code>s and/or <code>return</code>s.
Maybe it makes sense to convert it into a <code>while</code> loop,
maybe not. But there’s not a great need
for <code>while</code> when you’ve got <code>loop</code>, <code>break</code>, and <code>return</code>.
Do readers really need to know the loop termination condition
before reading what happens in the loop?
Or, in languages with <code>do { } while (…)</code> loops,
after the very end of the loop?
I don’t know,
but writing the termination condition
naturally wherever it “wants” to live in the loop
seems reasonable to me.
One does though need to be considerate of
their readers by keeping the loop body a readable length.</p>

<p>Anecdotally, a small project I’m working on right now
contains 2 instances of <code>loop</code>, 2 of <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/flow_control/while_let.html"><code>while let</code></a>,
and 8 of <code>for … in</code>;
no standard <code>while</code> loops.
And I think the <code>loop</code> loops read better than if I had
tried to convert them to <code>while</code> loops.</p>

<p>Here’s one example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>(</span><span>tx</span><span>,</span> <span>rx</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>async_channel</span><span>::</span><span>unbounded</span><span>();</span>
<span>let</span> <span>handle</span> <span>=</span> <span>thread</span><span>::</span><span>spawn</span><span>(</span><span>move</span> <span>||</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>context</span> <span>=</span> <span>FsThreadContext</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>();</span>
    <span>loop</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>let</span> <span>msg</span> <span>=</span> <span>block_on</span><span>(</span><span>rx</span><span>.recv</span><span>())</span><span>.expect</span><span>(</span><span>"recv"</span><span>);</span>
        <span>match</span> <span>msg</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>Message</span><span>::</span><span>Run</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
                <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>context</span><span>);</span>
            <span>},</span>
            <span>Message</span><span>::</span><span>Shutdown</span><span>(</span><span>rsp_tx</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
                <span>context</span><span>.shutdown</span><span>();</span>
                <span>rsp_tx</span><span>.send</span><span>(())</span><span>.expect</span><span>(</span><span>"send"</span><span>);</span>
                <span>break</span><span>;</span>
            <span>}</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here’s the other:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>header</span> <span>=</span> <span>String</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>();</span>
<span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>line</span> <span>=</span> <span>String</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>();</span>

<span>loop</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>line</span><span>.truncate</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>);</span>
    <span>io</span><span>.read_line</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>line</span><span>)</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>

    <span>if</span> <span>line</span><span>.is_empty</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>Err</span><span>(</span><span>anyhow!</span><span>(</span><span>"broken frame header"</span><span>));</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>let</span> <span>maybe_body_marker</span> <span>=</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>line</span><span>[</span><span>..</span><span>line</span><span>.len</span><span>()</span> <span>-</span> <span>1</span><span>];</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>maybe_body_marker</span> <span>==</span> <span>FRAME_BODY_MARKER</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>break</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>header</span><span>.push_str</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>line</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s common in C-like languages to write an unconditional loop
with <code>while (true) { }</code>.</p>

<p>I’m steeped enough in Rust that I don’t know if writing <code>while (true) { }</code>
brings others the same satisfaction as I get from <code>loop { }</code>,
but I suspect not: it looks and feels just like a tiny bit of a hack.
And if I go into writing a loop by first writing <code>while …</code>
then I am immediately presented with the question,
“while <em>what</em>?”,
and sometimes I just don’t want to think about that yet.</p>

<p>Besides <em>feeling</em> good,
there is <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/1906">a technical reason that Rust has <code>loop</code></a>:
it helps analyze control flow.
With it, the compiler can trivially know that any code
after the loop is unreachable.
In Rust at least this is important for type checking.
This kind of analysis <em>is done</em> in other languages,
but by my recollection they sometimes actually
special case <code>while (true) { }</code> for this purpose.</p>

<p>Here’s an example of the differences in how Rust
treats <code>loop</code> vs. <code>while true</code> <a href="https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&amp;mode=debug&amp;edition=2018&amp;gist=010dce12fdd4c0818322717e161a2f91">on the playground</a>.
Run it and check out the warning the compiler
issues; try to alter the example as suggested in the comments.</p>

<p>Bonus Rust trivia:
did you know that <code>loop</code> is an expression,
with the same type as its <code>break</code> statements,
and the result of <code>loop</code> can be <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/reference/expressions/loop-expr.html#break-and-loop-values">assigned to a value</a>?</p>

<p>I did not!</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/1906">issue on the bug tracker</a> appears
to be the only remains of the design discussion around <code>loop</code> in Rust,
though it is insightful to the designers’ original thinking.
The <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/meeting-minutes/blob/master/weekly-meetings/2012-03-06.md">meeting minutes</a> where it was approved
just say there was consensus to add it.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>loop</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"Unconditional loops are unconditionally awesome"</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>X2GO is one of the easiest open source remote access applications to  install on Linux, including on the Raspberry Pi 3B/4B. If the host is  LinuxMint and the client is a Raspberry PI, you can have both the  LinuxMint panel on the bottom of the client screen as well as the  Rasbian panel on the top of the screen – that way you can run both  local and remote apps at the same time in a split screen,  or even full screen  on separate client  monitors, or x2go client window spanning both monitors.</p>



<p>The x2goserver can handle multiple  simultaneous client computers with distinct usernames and their home  directories – rather like thin clients without PXE booting. X2GO is not   integrated into the loginctl multi-seat system but functions beside  that capability. Thus the multi-seat behavior of the client is handled by the x2goserver but initiated by the x2go client,&nbsp; not the&nbsp; host side that loginctl controls. The Raspberry Pi 4B is fast enough to be used as a full desktop and supports two HDMI monitors. It only needs to become an x2go client of an x2go server when it needs more computing power or to save files. Its window on the server can span both monitors, or stay on one of the monitors so that the user can run apps both locally and remotely on the server at the same time, moving the mouse to control which desktop the keyboard is connected to.</p>



<p>While there is a x2goclient for Windows computers, there is no  x2goserver for Windows computers.  Supporting multiple independent client sessions would violate a  Windows single workstation license. The Windows malware problem can be  solved by running Windows as a guest OS under VirtualBox on a Linux  host server. Then there is no need for the Windows OS to be connected to the  internet because you can use the browser on the Raspbian local client desktop  when needed.</p>



<p>If multiple  network cards on the x2goserver, the default is to  listen on all for clients. With lots of simultaneous clients, you might want to configure the server to separate server internet traffic from  client traffic.</p>



<p><strong>Installation of server on Linux Mint 19:</strong></p>



<pre>asm32@M5A88-M:~$ sudo apt-get install x2goserver x2goserver-xsession
[sudo] password for (username):

... skipping output during installation process ...
 
asm32@M5A88-M:~$</pre>



<pre>asm32@M5A88-M:~$ sudo service x2goserver start
[sudo] password for (username): 
asm32@M5A88-M:~$
</pre>



<p>or, alternatively,</p>



<pre>asm32@M5A88-M:~$
asm32@M5A88-M:~$sudo systemctl start x2goserver
asm32@M5A88-M:~$</pre>



<p>To make it start automatically on boot:</p>



<pre>asm32@M5A88-M:~$ sudo update-rc.d x2goserver defaults
[sudo] password for asm32: 
asm32@M5A88-M:~$</pre>



<p><strong>Installation of client on Raspberry Pi3 B+&nbsp; running <strong>Raspberry Pi OS</strong></strong> <strong>with Desktop:</strong></p>



<p>x2goclient is already in the Raspberry Pi Raspberry Pi OS&nbsp; repository, so all that is needed is</p>



<pre>pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo apt-get install x2goclient</pre>



<p>Once installed, there will be a new menu item under Internet category.</p>



<p>When configuring x2goclient sessions, you can use server hostnames instead of IP addresses. There can be more than one server on a LAN but hostnames must be unique.</p>



<p><strong>X2goclient as Raspberry Pi software zeroclient!</strong></p>



<div><p>A new raspberry pi is approximately 1/3 the cost of a new network attached zero client. Raspberry Pi could be configured to initiate an x2goclient session immediately, much like a hardware zero client, with the difference  that the x2go client provides the login screen instead of the server. </p><p>You will want to install the perl script, wakeonlan, so that you can wake up the desktop server from any of the Pi zero clients. I have edited my version so that the desired server MAC address is in the script instead of needed on the command line or in a separate file.</p></div>



<p>While x2goclient is trivial to install on a Raspberry Pi with a desktop environment, for a single purpose network attached zero client, it is not required to have a windows manager and desktop environment so you could use the <strong>Raspberry Pi OS (32-bit) Lite</strong> image at 432 MB (compared to the desktop version at 1128 MB).</p>



<p>Download here: <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspberry-pi-os/"><strong>https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspberry-pi-os/</strong></a></p>



<p>Once you have downloaded and flashed a MicroSD card with this and done the initial configuration at first boot on the Raspberry Pi, add the following:</p>



<pre><code>sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends xserver-xorg</code></pre>



<pre><code>sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends xinit</code></pre>



<div><p>To start up the xserver automatically, edit the file .bashrc to append the line “/usr/bin/startx” without the quotes.</p><p>Next edit the file .xinitrc to delete or make a comment the line “. /etc/X11/Xsession” and append a new line ” /usr/bin/x2goclient –thinclient –session=session-name” without the quotes. The second option launches a named session that you have setup already. Leave this option off if you have more than one server and the user needs to choose a session. If you have more than one user, you should not fill in the user name for the session. If you have only one server and one user (you are using this to remotely administer the server, perhaps) then you can set up automatic login so that the Raspberry Pi boots directly to a desktop of the remote server computer.</p></div>



<p><strong>Auto login with ssh rsa</strong></p>

<div><p>Assuming you already have a x2go session working with login, several things in the x2go session are needed for auto login to work. You most have a username (server end) or it will not know where to look for the authorized public key on the server end. It is preferable to check the box for “Try auto login” and leave the path entry  just above empty so that it will use the default location.  There can be multiple authorized public keys on the server – it will look for the one matching the client private key. There can also be multiple client sessions, each with a different private key. It is the client end (at possibly multiple separate workstations) that initiates the conversation with the server.</p><p><strong>Setting up private and public keys</strong></p></div>

<p>Note that after the client end command,  ssh-copy-id,  the public key has been added to the server end .ssh/authorized_keys and the client end now has a .ssh/known_hosts.</p>



<p>The right panel of x2goclient has all the sessions you have configured. When you select one of these, it will move to the blue left panel. With auto login, it will immediately start to connect to the server.  If you leave it in the left panel when you exit the session, then the next invocation of x2goclient will immediately attempt to connect to the server. In the case of a <strong>Raspberry Pi OS (32-bit) Lite</strong> installation as described above, the Pi will boot directly into connecting to its configured session on the server – similar to the Phistek ZE7000 network attached zero client at less than 1/3 the hardware cost.</p>



<p>The Phistek ZE7000 has superior video performance. Its silicon USB over IP chip is transmitting compressed USB over IP protocol, whereas the x2go method is transmitting compressed X protocol graphic primitives which is more efficient for non video applications.</p>

Why? So far as I can tell, it’s because I’ve been using Facebook to advocate for decentralization of social media. And apparently the algorithm didn’t like that.</p> <p>This morning, sometime between 8:54am and 9:06am Mountain, Facebook disabled my account. Just after 8:54am, I copy-pasted the content of my latest Twitter post into a new post on Facebook. At 9:06am, a friend received a Facebook notification indicating that he needed to update his trusted contacts because I was no longer available. Here’s the exact text and link that I posted to both Twitter and Facebook:</p> <blockquote> <p>“Now is the time to build, promote, and adopt decentralized social networks. The future of humanity depends on it. Ben Goertzel gets it right. Read his explanation. <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/decentralized-social-networks-next-big-blockchain-opportunity">https://www.coindesk.com/decentralized-social-networks-next-big-blockchain-opportunity</a>” (<a href="https://twitter.com/LincolnCannon/status/1352645833569669121">22 January 2021</a>)</p> </blockquote> <blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Now is the time to build, promote, and adopt decentralized social networks.

I was able to login. But I wasn’t able to see anything except the following message:</p> <blockquote> <p>“Your Account Has Been Disabled. For more information please visit the Help Center. Your account was disabled on Jan 22, 2021. If you think your account was disabled by mistake you can submit more information via the Help Center for up to 30 days after your account was disabled. After that, your account will be permanently disabled and you will no longer be able to request a review.”</p> </blockquote> <figure><span><img src="https://lincoln.metacannon.net/images/posts/facebook-screen-shot-2021-01-22-at-11.04.16-am.jpg" alt="Facebook Screen Shot on 22 January 2021 at 11:04am Mountain"></span><figcaption>Facebook Screen Shot on 22 January 2021 at 11:04am Mountain</figcaption></figure> <p>I clicked on a link at the end of the message. It took me to the Help Center. There I found a link to request a review. Clicking on that link took me to a form which requested my full name and photo ID.</p> <p>I filled out the form, providing my name and a JPG of my government issued ID. Then I submitted the form. In response, I received the following message:</p> <blockquote> <p>“We Cannot Review the Decision to Disable Your Account. Your Facebook account was disabled because it did not follow our Community Standards. This decision can’t be reversed.”</p> </blockquote> <figure><span><img src="https://lincoln.metacannon.net/images/posts/facebook-screen-shot-2021-01-22-at-9.26.23-am.jpg" alt="Facebook Screen Shot on 22 January 2021 at 9:26am Mountain"></span><figcaption>Facebook Screen Shot on 22 January 2021 at 9:26am Mountain</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="why-facebook-disabled-my-account">Why Facebook Disabled My Account</h2> <p>I don’t know for sure why Facebook disabled my account. I didn’t receive an explanation. There was no reference to particular Facebook Community Standards that I might have broken. There was no indication of how I might have been violating Facebook’s terms of service.</p> <p>Moreover, I have never received a warning from Facebook. And I didn’t receive a warning today. They provided no information beyond what I’ve quoted above.</p> <p>I’ve never used Facebook or any other social media to advocate violence, political or otherwise. And I’m a political centrist. In fact, during the political controversies of 2020, I repeatedly insisted on civility to such an extent that it frustrated some of my more partisan friends. So we can’t plausibly look for an explanation there.</p> <p>We could imagine a conspiracy among people who dislike my religious views. There’s plenty of <a href="https://lincoln.metacannon.net/2018/09/this-post-is-brought-to-you-by.html">strong anti-Mormon and anti-Transhumanist sentiment</a> out there. Perhaps, banding together, a group of people reported or otherwise flagged my content on Facebook as inappropriate. But this seems a bit paranoid to me.</p> <p>I don’t think the cause was the link that I shared, in itself. Quite a few other people have shared that link on Facebook. In fact, at this moment, their API indicates that <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coindesk.com%2Fdecentralized-social-networks-next-big-blockchain-opportunity">the link has received at least 88 likes, shares, and comments across Facebook</a>. And that number has been increasing throughout the day without Facebook banning others for it, to the best of my knowledge.</p> <p>So I think the cause must have been the comment itself. Or, more generally, it may have been an emerging pattern in the comments of my posts. For a long time, I have advocated replacing Facebook with <a href="https://lincoln.metacannon.net/2015/05/the-reputation-web.html">decentralized social networks</a>. And current events have motivated me to increase the frequency of that advocacy.</p> <p>Several times over the last week or two, I have promoted decentralization in posts to both Facebook and Twitter. The content and links of the original posts were identical on the two platforms. So you can see them on my Twitter account. For easy reference, here are copies of my most recent cross-posts in reverse chronological order (as ordered on Twitter and previously on Facebook):</p> <ul> <li> <p>“Congratulations to President Biden and Vice-President Harris. May your term in office be peaceful and prosperous, for the United States of America and for our world.” (<a href="https://twitter.com/LincolnCannon/status/1351953891655520258">20 January 2021</a>)</p> </li> <li> <p>“The debate between capitalism and socialism is often framed as a choice between large corporations and large government. This framing is cultivated by political and economic elites. The truth is that there’s an alternative to both. Limit both. Decentralize ALL power.” (<a href="https://twitter.com/LincolnCannon/status/1351914808753307649">20 January 2021</a>)</p> </li> <li> <p>“In a recent discussion with the Christian Transhumanist Association, I presented and answered questions about the New God Argument. Here’s a recording. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCUrUnZavGk&amp;list=PL9Yc4oMKukRkMnBAkXNv9JWApl9D4Qe8j">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCUrUnZavGk&amp;list=PL9Yc4oMKukRkMnBAkXNv9JWApl9D4Qe8j</a>” (<a href="https://twitter.com/LincolnCannon/status/1351384453231230976">18 January 2021</a>)</p> </li> <li> <p>“Decentralization is a practical necessity. For Christians, it’s also a theological mandate. Essential to the Gospel is a transformative discipleship, wherein we each participate in the role of Christ and become joint heirs in the glory of God. Divine creation IS decentralization.” (<a href="https://twitter.com/LincolnCannon/status/1350943723908198406">17 January 2021</a>)</p> </li> <li> <p>“If God ensures the right spirit is associated with the right body during human-mediated procreation, why wouldn’t God ensure the same for human-mediated resurrection? If you build it, they will come. If they don’t come, you didn’t build it right. Seems straightforward to me.” (<a href="https://twitter.com/LincolnCannon/status/1350259207107317760">15 January 2021</a>)</p> </li> <li> <p>“‘The long view is a thriving decentralized marketplace, fueled by personal empowerment and collaboration.’ <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/10/technology/tim-berners-lee-privacy-internet.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/10/technology/tim-berners-lee-privacy-internet.html</a>” (<a href="https://twitter.com/LincolnCannon/status/1348662980175564802">11 January 2021</a>)</p> </li> <li> <p>“Let’s say you have enough spare cash to buy a gun, donate to a charity, or invest in some Bitcoin. What do you do and why? What does your choice say about your vision of the future? How does your choice impinge on the creation of that future?” (<a href="https://twitter.com/LincolnCannon/status/1348082874239524865">9 January 2021</a>)</p> </li> <li> <p>“Trump was banned from Facebook and Twitter. That may or may not be comparatively fair. But if it constitutes an infringement on freedom of speech then we’ve given far too much power to Facebook and Twitter. Centrally controlled freedom of speech should terrify us.” (<a href="https://twitter.com/LincolnCannon/status/1347931805370863617">9 January 2021</a>)</p> </li> </ul> <p>In addition, on 13 January 2021, I shared to Facebook some thoughts in support of a tweet from Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. I can no longer quote the text from my Facebook post because it wasn’t a cross-post like the others. But it essentially affirmed Jack Dorsey’s interest in supporting decentralized social media, as he expressed in a recent tweet:</p> <blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We are trying to do our part by funding an initiative around an open decentralized standard for social media. Our goal is to be a client of that standard for the public conversation layer of the internet. We call it <a href="https://twitter.com/bluesky?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@bluesky</a>: <a href="https://t.co/51or6OuNNv">https://t.co/51or6OuNNv</a></p>— jack (@jack) <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1349510780043988992?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 14, 2021</a></blockquote> <p>As you can see, almost all of my recent social media posts have been related to decentralization. Even the ones that aren’t obviously related to decentralization are still implicitly or indirectly related to decentralization. For example, decentralization is an important aspect of the <a href="https://new-god-argument.com/compassion-argument.html">Compassion Argument of the New God Argument</a>. And a theology that would include <a href="https://lincoln.metacannon.net/2019/04/how-to-raise-dead.html">human action toward resurrection</a> as an expression of God’s work is a decentralized theology.</p> <p>A machine learning algorithm would be capable of identifying accounts that publish posts with a pattern of negative sentiment toward centralized social media. The algorithm could also assign a score to the degree of negative sentiment. And Facebook could use that score to trigger automatic deactivation of accounts that surpass a relatively high score. None of this would require direct human intervention.</p> <p>Again, I don’t know for sure why Facebook deactivated my account. But based on what I know, I think the best explanation is that Facebook now implicitly hates decentralization. I suspect that one of its algorithms is checking for accounts that encourage use of alternative social networks. And it caught my account in its automated net.</p> <p>As an aside, perhaps some Facebook managers and engineers originally intended the algorithm to catch accounts that encourage use of social networks that focus on controversial politics. That seems possible. I’ve neither advocated for nor participated in those social networks. But I can see how my posts might have some syntactical commonalities with posts that advocate for those social networks.</p> <h2 id="why-facebook-doesnt-ban-everyone">Why Facebook Doesn’t Ban Everyone</h2> <p>Aren’t other people advocating for decentralized social networks without being banned? Maybe so. But the algorithm may have identified my account as a particularly useful target. Here’s why.</p> <p>Social network theory categorizes people according to how they function in networks. Some people are influencers within groups of similar persons. Some people are followers within groups. And some people are connectors between groups.</p> <p>Connectors facilitate transmission of ideas between dissimilar groups. Transmission of ideas can be good, promoting adaptability over time and creation of new value. But transmission of ideas can also be bad insofar as they undermine the coherence and survival of the group or system. All groups and systems, even the most creative, require a balance.</p> <p>As it turns out, my social connections are unusually diverse. For example, I have many politically progressive and many politically conservative connections. I have many religious, secular, and atheist connections. And these connections include many influencers in a wide variety of geographies around the world.</p> <p>I’m a connector. I …</p></div></div>

    <p>Recent events have made me reflect on a few things in my life I was already thinking about for a while. Also, responses on social media have made me realize that people have <em>strange</em> expectations from me, and what my role in the Bitcoin Core project is.</p>

<h2 id="growth">growth</h2>

<p>Bitcoin has grown a lot since I started contributing to it in 2011. Some arrangements that were acceptable for a small scale FOSS project are no longer so for one runing a 600 billion dollar system. Market cap is famously deceptive, but my point is not about specific numbers here.</p>

<p>One thing is clear: this is a serious project now, and we need to start taking decentralization seriously.</p>

<h2 id="moving-on">moving on</h2>

<p>I realize I am myself somewhat of a centralized bottleneck. And although I find Bitcoin an extremely interesting project and believe it’s one of the most important things happening at the moment, I also have many other interests. It’s also particularly stressful and I don’t want it, nor the bizarre spats in the social media around it, to start defining me as a person.</p>

<h2 id="spreading-out">spreading out</h2>

<p>I will start by delegating my own tasks, and decreasing my involvement. I do not intend to stop contributing to Bitcoin, or even to the Bitcoin Core project, but I would like to remove myself from the critical path and take (even more) of a background role.</p>

<p>Note that we had a nice growth in development activity, and that maintenance of the code itself has already been spread over multiple people for a while. I’m not the most active maintainer. Looking at the number of git merges</p>

<div><div><pre><code>bitcoin<span>$ </span>git log <span>--pretty</span><span>=</span><span>"format:%cn"</span> <span>--merges</span> <span>--since</span><span>=</span>2020-01-01 | <span>sort</span>| <span>uniq</span> <span>-c</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Only about 24% of the merges were done by me, last year.</p>

<h2 id="plans">plans</h2>

<p>But there’s plenty of things left to figure out, from the top of my head:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Decentralize distribution.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>In the short run, transfer bitcoincore.org to an organization instead of private ownership. Reduce the “bus factor”.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>I think it would be good if some other organizations set up mirrors, so there is less incentive to try to take bitcoincore.org down.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In the long run, move away from a website for code distribution completely. No matter who owns it, a website on the clearnet can be shut down with the press of a button, and it seems that the global internet is gearing up to make censorship increasingly easy. We need a decentralized web. For us, one option would be IPFS, which is starting to catch on. For the binaries themselves there’s already the option of downloading through torrents.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Decentralize the release process, and release signing.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Delegate more parts of the release process. Other maintainers should be able to do a release without my involvement.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Rename the GPG key used to sign <code>SHA256SUMS.asc</code> to “Bitcoin Core release signing key”, instead of having it in my personal title. Make some construct so that N of M (minimally) trusted gitian signers doing a succesful build automatically results in a signed distribution.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Same for the native code signing for Windows and MacOS.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Even better in the long run would be to split up the keys, e.g. though RSA threshold signing, so that the whole process is geographically distributed.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Decentralize the development hub.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>It’s not clear whether github can be trusted to act in our interest in the long run. Although issues and PRs are backed up through the API, having to move somewhere else could give significant interruption in development. And hopping from provider to provider would be awful—ideally the whole thing would not rely on a central server <em>at all</em>. For this I’ve been watching the <a href="https://radicle.xyz/">radicle</a> project, a P2P distributed code collaboration platform. It’s not quite there yet, but seems promising.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Bitcoin is quite different in some of the requirements here from other FOSS projects, so we’ll have to develop some tools as we go. We could also, definitely, use some help here.</p>

<p>Some smaller things to consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Find someone else who wants to do the IRC meeting chair instead of me. Or maybe rotate it between multiple people.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Release (and release candidate) mails to the <code>bitcoin-dev</code> and <code>bitcoin-core-dev</code> lists will no longer be necessarily signed and sent by me.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There’s some development specific tooling hosted by me (e.g. the PR notification bots on IRC and mastodon). As they are non-critical and only little time goes into maintaining them, I’m fine with this for now.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As for decentralizing Bitcoin’s node software itself:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Carl Dong’s <code>libbitcoin_kernel</code> work. Bitcoin Core is a large monolithic project which includes the consensus code, which is much more critical than the other parts. The kernel would be an isolated part with well-defined interface, and at some point, its own review flow for changes. The difference with previous <code>libbitcoin_consensus</code> plans is that the kernel is stateful: it includes UTXO management and validation. It however does not include P2P, mempool policy, wallet, GUI, and RPC code. It could be re-used in different clients, to have more diversity in clients, but without the risks of a deviating consensus implementation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Over the course of 2021 this will be my focus with regard to Bitcoin Core.</p>

January 23, 2021 | https://www.politico.eu/article/whatsapp-privacy-fine-data-protection-europe-50-million/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.politico.eu/article/whatsapp-privacy-fine-data-protection-europe-50-million/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
									<p>Facebook-owned messaging app WhatsApp could be fined up to €50 million over violations of the European Union's data protection rules, according to three people with direct knowledge of the procedure who spoke with POLITICO.</p>
<p>The preliminary penalty — the figure is now under consultation with the bloc's other data protection agencies — would be one of the largest-ever fines under the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, a set of privacy rules that came into force in 2018. </p>
<p>As part of Ireland's draft findings, the internet messenger may face a fine of between €30 million and €50 million for not living up to transparency requirements under Europe's privacy regime. Whatsapp could also be required to change how it handles its users' data, as the case relates to how the messenger may have failed to properly inform its EU users about how it would share their data with Facebook.</p>

<p>France's privacy authority <a href="https://www.cnil.fr/en/cnils-restricted-committee-imposes-financial-penalty-50-million-euros-against-google-llc" target="_blank">has fined</a> Google €50 million for separate privacy violations, while Ireland's Data Protection Commission, which has regulatory authority over Facebook, recently <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/irish-data-regulator-fines-twitter-e450000/">issued</a> a €450,000 penalty against Twitter. That represented its first levy against any Silicon Valley company, many of which fall under Dublin's jurisdiction because these firms are legally domiciled in Ireland, mostly for tax reasons.</p>
<p>The multi-million euro draft WhatsApp fine is an initial proposal from Dublin, and has been opened up to other European data protection agencies for their feedback. A final decision on how big the fine should be — and what other remedies WhatsApp should agree to — is not expected until later in the year.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Ireland's Data Protection Commissioner declined to comment. A spokesman for WhatsApp said the company was awaiting the final privacy decision.</p>
<p>In November, Facebook&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1521035">earmarked €77.5 million&nbsp;for a likely privacy fine against its messaging service WhatsApp,&nbsp;</a>which, unlike Instagram, is a separate legal entity in Ireland and therefore has its own set of financial records. The Irish data protection agency is conducting a separate investigation into whether WhatsApp can legally share its users' data with Facebook's other digital services, among other privacy-related concerns.</p>
<p>The draft penalty against WhatsApp, which Ireland <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1577539">submitted</a> to other EU agencies for review just before Christmas, comes as the messenger faces a global backlash over planned updates to its terms and conditions. Those include&nbsp;clarifying to its billions of users how their data is shared more widely with Facebook's other services.</p>
<p>Those changes will not affect WhatsApp European operations, but people across the bloc and elsewhere still have flocked to rivals like Signal because of privacy fears. On January 15, the messenger <a href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/giving-more-time-for-our-recent-update" target="_blank">said</a> it was delaying the upcoming privacy changes, in part because of the confusion generated by the proposed overhaul.</p>

<p>Johannes Caspar, Hamburg's privacy regulator who filed objections to a previous Irish decision against Twitter, told POLITICO earlier this week that he<a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1579886"> had not ruled out </a>doing the same in the WhatsApp case. </p>
<p>"WhatsApp has an enormous amount of users," he said. "It must be clear that the consent mechanism they use must be lawful and that consent is informed and freely given by the users."</p>

</p>
    
  </header>
  <p>Hello, in this article I would like to share my thoughts about the NixOS Linux distribution.  I've been using it daily for more than six months as my main workstation at work and on some computer at home too.  I also made modest contributions to the git repository. 
</p>
<p><a href="https://nixos.org/">NixOS official website</a></p>
<h2> Introduction</h2>
<p>NixOS is a Linux distribution built around Nix tool.  I'll try to explain quickly what Nix is but if you want more accurate explanations I recommend visiting the project website.  Nix is the package manager of the system, Nix could be used on any Linux distribution on top of the distribution package manager.  NixOS is built from top to bottom from Nix.
</p>
<p>This makes NixOS a system entirely different than what one can expect from a regular Linux/Unix system (at the exception of Guix sharing the same idea with a different implementation).  NixOS system configuration is stateless, most of the system is in read-only and most of paths you know doesn't exist.  The directory /bin/sh only contains "sh" which is a symlink.
</p>
<p>The whole system configuration: fstab, packages, users, services, crontab, firewall... is configured from a global configuration file that defines the state of the system.
</p>
<p>An example of my configuration file to enable graphical interface with Mate as a desktop and a french keyboard layout.
</p>
<pre><code>services.xserver.enable = true;
services.xserver.layout = "fr";
services.xserver.libinput.enable = true;
services.xserver.displayManager.lightdm.enable = true;
services.xserver.desktopManager.mate.enable = true;
</code></pre>
<p>I could add the following lines into the configuration to add auto login into my graphical session.
</p>
<pre><code>services.xserver.displayManager.autoLogin.enable = true;
services.xserver.displayManager.autoLogin.user = "solene";
</code></pre>
<h2> Pros</h2>
<p>There are a lot of pros.  The system is really easy to setup, installing a system (for a reinstall or replicate an installation) is very easy, you only need to get the configuration.nix file from the other/previous system.  Everything is very fast to setup, it's often only a few lines to add to the configuration.
</p>
<p>Every time the system is rebuilt from the configuration file, a new grub entry is made so at boot you can choose on which environment you want to boot.  This make upgrades or tries very easy to rollback and safe.
</p>
<p>Documentation! The NixOS documentation is very nice and is part of the code.  There is a special man page "configuration.nix" in the system that contains all variables you can define, what values to expect, what is the default and what it's doing.  You can literally search for "steam", "mediawiki" or "luks" to get information to configure your system.
</p>
<p><a href="https://nixos.org/learn.html">All the documentation</a></p>
<p>Builds are reproducible, I don't consider it a huge advantage but it's nice to have it.  This allow to challenge a package mirror by building packages locally and verifying they provide the exact same package on the mirror.
</p>
<p>It has a lot of packages.  I think the NixOS team is pretty happy to share their statistics because, if I got it right, Nixpkgs is the biggest and up to date repository alive.
</p>
<p><a href="https://search.nixos.org/packages">Search for a package</a></p>
<h2> Cons</h2>
<p>When you download a pre compiled Linux program that isn't statically built, it's a huge pain to make it work on NixOS.  The binary will expect some paths to exist at usual places but they won't exist on NixOS.  There are some tricks to get them work but it's not always easy.  If the program you want isn't in the packages, it may not be easy to use it.  Flatpak can help to get some programs if they are not in the packages though.
</p>
<p><a href="https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Packaging/Binaries">Running binaries</a></p>
<p>It takes disk space, some libraries can exist at the same time with small compilation differences.  A program can exist with different version at the same time because of previous builds still available for boot in grub, if you forget to clean them it takes a lot of memory.
</p>
<p>The whole system (especially for graphical environments) may not feel as polished as more mainstream distributions putting a lot of efforts into branding and customization.  NixOS will only install everything and you will have a quite raw environment that you will have to configure.  It's not a real cons but in comparison to other desktop oriented distributions, NixOS may not look as good out of the box.
</p>
<h2> Conclusion</h2>
<p>NixOS is an awesome piece of software.  It works very well and I never had any reliability issue with it.  Some services like xrdp are usually quite complex to setup but it worked out of the box here for me.
</p>
<p>I see it as a huge Lego© box with which you can automate the building of the super system you want, given you have the schematics of its parts.  Once you need a block you don't have in your recipes list, you will have a hard time.
</p>
<p>I really classify it into its own category, in comparison to Linux/BSD distributions and Windows, there is the NixOS / Guix category with those stateless systems for which the configuration is their code.
</p>

        <p>
          There are hidden HDR videos playing at the corners of this page. When a HDR-capable browser encounters one, it switches to HDR mode. For some reason, CSS backdrop-filter + brightness &gt;100% combo seems to behave like HDR—reaching beyond the user-controlled display brightness, up to the maximum HDR brightness—while the everything in between follow along. At least that's the overall idea, but I still don't know exactly why it works; especially why with those two CSS properties.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the system switches to HDR mode, it seems to affect the whole display. That says, as long as you can trigger HDR mode by any means—simply playing an HDR video on Movist, for example—the CSS trick works on Safari / Chrome / Edge with HDR-capable / SDR devices. This indicates this bug/feature is mostly tied to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/drawable_objects/displaying_hdr_content_in_a_metal_layer">the EDR system.</a>

<![CDATA[An Introduction to Time Representation, Serialization and Management in Software]]>

January 22, 2021 | https://mirkocaserta.com/posts/2013/04/an-introduction-to-time-representation-serialization-and-management-in-software/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://mirkocaserta.com/posts/2013/04/an-introduction-to-time-representation-serialization-and-management-in-software/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>Most issues in software development usually arise from poor,
inconsistent knowledge of the domain at hand. A topic apparently as
simple as time representation, serialization and management can easily
cause a number of problems both to the neophyte and to the experienced
programmer.</p>
<p>In this post, we’ll see that there’s no need to be a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Lord">Time Lord</a> to grasp the
very simple few concepts needed not to incur into time management hell.</p>
<p><img src="https://mirkocaserta.com/images/posts/time.jpg" alt="Time doesn’t exist. Clocks exist."></p>
<h2 id="representation">Representation</h2>
<p>A question as simple as <em>“What time is it?"</em> assumes a number of
contextual subleties that are obvious to the human brain, but become
absolute nonsense for a computer.</p>
<p>For instance, if you were asking to me what time is it right now, I
might say: <em>“It’s 3:39”</em> and, if you were a colleague in my office,
that’d be enough information to infer that it’s 3:39pm CEST. That’s
because you would already be in possession of some bits of important
contextual information such as</p>
<ul>
<li>it’s an afternoon because we’ve already had lunch</li>
<li>we’re in Rome, therefore our timezone is Central European Time (CET)
or Central European Summer Time (CEST)</li>
<li>we’ve switched to daylight savings time a few weeks earlier, so the
current timezone must be Central European Summer Time</li>
</ul>
<p><em>3:39</em> only happens to be a convenient representation of time as long as
we’re in possession of the contextual bits.  In order to represent time
in an universal way, you should have an idea what
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time">UTC</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_zone">timezones</a> are.</p>
<p>Now, suppose I have to schedule a skype chat with a fellow software
developer in the US. I could write him an email and say something along
the lines of <em>“see you on 2/3”</em>. In Italy, that would be the second day
in the month of march, but to an US person, that would be the third day
in the month of february. As you can see, how our chat is never going to
happen.</p>
<p>These are only a few examples of the kind of issues that might arise
when representing date and time information. Luckily enough, there is a
solution to the representation conundrums, namely the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601</a> standard.</p>
<p>Just to give you an example, in ISO 8601, <code>1994-11-05T08:15:30-05:00</code>
corresponds to November 5, 1994, 8:15:30 am, US Eastern Standard Time.
<code>1994-11-05T13:15:30Z</code> corresponds to the same instant (the <code>Z</code> stands
for UTC). Same instant, different representations.</p>
<p>The ISO 8601 standard also has the nice side effect of providing natural
sorting in systems that use lexicographical order (such as filesystems)
because information is organized from most to least significant, i.e.
year, month, day, hour, minute, second, fraction of a second.</p>
<p>Even if you’re only dealing with local times in your software, you
should know that, unless you also display the time zone, you can never
be sure of the time. I cannot remember how many times a developer has
asked me to <em>fix the time</em> on the server, only to discover that his
software was printing time in UTC.</p>
<p>At display time, it is okay to deal with partial representation of time
because the user experience requires so. Just make sure, when debugging,
to print out the whole set of information, including the time zone,
otherwise you can never be sure what you’re looking at is what you
actually think it is.</p>
<p>Although a given moment in time is immutable, there is an arbitrary
number of ways to express it. And we’ve not even talked about the Julian or
Indian calendars or stuff like expressing durations!</p>
<p>Let me summarize a few key points to bring home so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>get to know <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_zone">time zones</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time">UTC</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601</a> is your friend</li>
<li>always print the time zone while debugging</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://mirkocaserta.com/images/posts/bttf-clock.png" alt="Back to the future clock"></p>
<h2 id="serialization">Serialization</h2>
<p>Speaking of software, serialization is a process where you take an object’s
status and spell it out in such a way that it can be later entirely rebuilt,
exactly like the original, by using the spelt out (serialized) information.
Think of an xml or json file:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="json">{
  <span>"person"</span>: {
    <span>"name"</span>: <span>"Mirko"</span>,
    <span>"surname"</span>: <span>"Caserta"</span>,
    <span>"class"</span>: <span>"nerd"</span>
  }
}
</code></pre></div><p>This is the serialized form of a peculiar imaginary person class instance.</p>
<p>In the binary world of computers, time is usually serialized and stored
by using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time">Unix time</a>
convention. As I’m writing this, my Unix time is <code>1366191727 UTC</code>. That
is: <code>1366191727</code> seconds have passed since January 1st, 1970 at 00:00
UTC. Isn’t that a pretty clever, consistent and compact way of
representing a plethora of information, such as <code>April 17 2013 @ 11:42:07am CEST</code>?</p>
<p>Unix time is only another arbitrary representation of a given moment in time,
although a not very human readable one. But you can take that number, write it
on a piece of paper, stick it onto a carrier pigeon, and your recipient would
be able to decipher your vital message by simply turning to the Internet and
visiting a site such as <a href="http://www.unixtimestamp.com/">unixtimestamp.com</a> or
<a href="https://currentmillis.com/">currentmillis.com</a>.</p>
<p>Just like you can write that number on a piece of paper and later get
back the full instant back to life, you can store it in a file or a
row in your favorite RDBMS. Although you might want to talk to your
RDBMS using a proper driver and handing it a plain date instance; your
driver will then take care of the conversion to the underlying database
serialization format for native time instances.</p>
<p>By storing time using a native format, you get the nice time formatting,
sorting, querying, etc features of your RDBMS for free, so you might want to
think twice before storing plain Unix timestamps in, say, Oracle.</p>
<p>Just make sure you know what timezone your Unix timestamp refers to, or
you might get confused later at deserialization time.</p>
<p>ISO 8601 is also a serialization favorite. In fact, it is used in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#isoformats">XML
Schema</a> standard.  Most xml
frameworks are natively able to serialize and deserialize back and forth from
<code>xs:date</code>, <code>xs:time</code> and <code>xs:dateTime</code> to your programming language’s native
format (and viceversa). The same is true for json. Just be careful when dealing
with partial representations: for instance, if you omit the time zone, make
sure you agree beforehand on a default one with your communicating party
(usually UTC or your local time zone if you’re both in the same one).</p>
<h2 id="management">Management</h2>
<p>First of all, if you think you can write your own time management
software library, or even write a little routine that adds or subtracts
arbitrary values from the time of the day,
please allow me to show you the source code for the
<a href="http://www.docjar.com/html/api/java/util/Date.java.html">java.util.Date</a>
and
<a href="http://www.docjar.com/html/api/java/util/GregorianCalendar.java.html">java.util.GregorianCalendar</a>
classes from JDK 7, respectively weighting 1331 and 3179 lines of code.</p>
<p>Okay, these are probably not the best examples of software routines that
deal with time, I agree. That’s why Java libraries like
<a href="http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/">Joda Time</a> were written.
In fact, Joda Time has become so popular that it gave birth to
<a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=310">JSR-310</a> and is
<a href="http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/JSR-310-s-Date-and-Time-API-added-to-JDK-8-1708647.html">now</a>
<a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2013/02/java-time-api-jdk-8">part</a> of JDK 8.</p>
<p>Use of popular, well designed and implemented time frameworks will save your
life. Seriously. Take your time to get familiar with the API of your choosing.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>If you thought 2021 was going to be the year without big drama in the world of open source licensing, you didn’t have to wait long to be disappointed. Two stories have already sprung up in the first few weeks of the year. They’re independent, but related. Both of them remind us that open source is a <em>development</em> model, not a business model.</p>



<h2>Elasticsearch and Kibana</h2>



<p>A few years ago, it seemed like I couldn’t go to any sysadmin/DevOps conference or meetup without hearing about the “<a href="https://www.elastic.co/what-is/elk-stack">ELK stack</a>“. ELK stands for the three pieces of software involved: Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana. Because it provided powerful aggregation, search, and visualization of arbitrary log files, it became very popular. This also meant that Amazon Web Services (AWS) saw value in providing an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/">Elasticsearch service</a>.</p>



<p>As companies moved more workloads to AWS it made sense to pay AWS for Amazon Elasticsearch Service instead of paying Elastic. This represented what you might call a revenue problem for Elastic. So they decided to follow MongoDB’s lead and <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/licensing-change">change their license</a> to the Server Side Public License (SSPL).</p>



<p>The SSPL is essentially a “you can’t use it, AWS” license. This makes it decidedly <a href="https://opensource.org/node/1099">not open source</a>. Insultingly, Elastic’s announcement and follow-up messaging include phrases like “doubling down on open”, implying that the SSPL is an open source license. It is not. It a source-available license. And, as open source business expert VM Brasseur writes, it <a href="https://anonymoushash.vmbrasseur.com/2021/01/14/elasticsearch-and-kibana-are-now-business-risks">creates business risk</a> for companies that use Elasticsearch and Kibana.</p>



<p>Elastic is, of course, free to use whatever license it wants for the software it develops. And it’s free to want to make money. But it’s not reasonable to get mad at companies using the software under the license you chose to use for it. Picking a license is a <a href="https://anonymoushash.vmbrasseur.com/2019/06/07/the-problem-with-amazon-and-open-source-isnt-amazon/">business decision</a>.</p>



<p>Shortly before I sat down to write this post, I saw that <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/stepping-up-for-a-truly-open-source-elasticsearch/?sc_channel=sm&amp;sc_campaign=launch_&amp;sc_publisher=TWITTER&amp;sc_country=Global&amp;sc_geo=GLOBAL&amp;sc_outcome=awareness&amp;trk=launch__TWITTER&amp;linkId=109673114">Amazon has forked Elasticsearch and Kibana</a>. They will take the last-released versions and continue to develop them as open source projects under the Apache License v2. This is entirely permissible and to be expected when a project makes a significant licensing change. So now Elastic is in danger of a sizable portion of the community moving to the fork and away from their projects. If that pans out, it may end up being more harmful than Amazon Elasticsearch Service ever was.</p>



<h2>Nmap Public Source License</h2>



<p>The second story actually started in the fall of 2020, but didn’t seem to get much notice until after the new year. The developers of <a href="https://nmap.org/">nmap</a>, the widely-used security scanner, began using a new license. Prior to the release of version 7.90, nmap was under a modified version of the GNU General Public License version 2 (GPLv2). This license had some additional “gloss”, but was generally accepted by Linux distributions to be a valid free/open source software license.</p>



<p>With version 7.90, nmap is now under the Nmap Public Source License (NPSL). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201127221208/https://nmap.org/npsl/npsl-annotated.html">Version 0.92</a> of this license contained some phrasing that seemed objectionable. The Gentoo licenses team brought their concerns to the developers in a <a href="https://github.com/nmap/nmap/issues/2199">GitHub issue</a>. Some of their concerns seemed like non-issues to me (and to the lawyers at work I consulted with on this), but one part in particular stood out.</p>



<blockquote><p>Proprietary software companies wishing to use or incorporate Covered Software within their programs must contact Licensor to purchase a separate license</p></blockquote>



<p>It seemed clear that the intent was to restrict proprietary <em>software</em>, not otherwise-compliant projects from companies that produce proprietary software. Nonetheless, as it was written, it constituted a violation of the <a href="https://opensource.org/osd#fields-of-endeavor">Open Source Definition</a>, and we <a href="https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/legal@lists.fedoraproject.org/thread/GZIDC4DHXZP67LFU7P2OT2AQVDJRHZ2M/">rejected it for use in Fedora</a>.</p>



<p>To their credit, the developers took the feedback well and quickly released an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210113133517/https://nmap.org/npsl/npsl-annotated.html">updated version of the license</a>. They even retroactively licensed affected releases under the updated license. Unfortunately, version 0.93 still contains some problems. In particular, the annotations still express field of endeavor restrictions.</p>



<p>While the license text is the most important part, the annotations still matter. They indicate the intent of the license and guide the interpretation by lawyers and judges. So newer versions of nmap remain unsuitable for some distributions.</p>



<h3>Licenses are not for you to be clever</h3>



<p>Like with Elastic, I’m sympathetic to the nmap developers’ position. If someone is going to use their project to make money, they’d like to get paid, too. That’s an entirely reasonable position to take. But the way they went about it isn’t right. As noted in the GitHub issue, they’re not copyright attorneys. If they were, the license would be much better.</p>



<p>It seems like the developers are fine with people free-riding profit off of nmap so long as the software used to generate the profit is also open source. In that case, why not just use a professionally-drafted and vetted license like the AGPL? The NPSL is already using the GPLv2 and adding more stuff on top of it, and it’s the more stuff on top of it that’s causing problems.</p>



<p>Trying to write your business model into a software license that purports to be open source is a losing proposition.</p>

<p><b>Last change: 2014-12-30</b></p>




While browsing, I found this except from the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1565922603/heinersshelldora/002-6407720-0447242">Unix Power Tools</a>:

<blockquote>
   ... To fix it, first get the source, and then change it in the obvious three places in xec.c. You will have to learn <strong>Bournegol</strong> [the ALGOL-like dialect of C that Steve Bourne used to
   write the original Bourne shell-JP ]. Another alternative is to replace /bin/sh with one of the free sh look-alikes... (CT in comp.unix.questions on Usenet, 20 February 1990)
</blockquote>

I immediately asked myself: what could Bournegol look like? Well,
it's not that easy to find the <a href="http://minnie.tuhs.org/UnixTree/V7/usr/src/cmd/sh/">original Bourne
Shell</a> sourcecode, so,
after some googling, I thought I might put an example of Bournegol on
my homepage, so other people have the chance to find about "Bournegol"
without the tedious search.<p>

(many years later I found <a href="http://www.collyer.net/who/geoff/sh.tour.ps">this
paper</a>, A Partial Tour Through
the UNIX Shell, which makes for very nice reading).

Ok, without any further ado, here is an excerpt of the file
<tt>xec.c</tt>, referenced above, supposedly from the <a href="http://minnie.tuhs.org/UnixTree/V7/usr/src/">7th Edition UNIX</a>, that gives you an

					<h2><strong>Summary</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>We’ve built a machine learning-based Job Transitions Recommender System that can accurately predict the probability of transitioning between occupations. We showcase the system for workers forced to transition between jobs.</li>
<li>The system is based on a novel data-driven method to measure the similarity between occupations based on their underlying skill profiles from real-time job ads.</li>
<li>We’ve also developed a leading indicator of Artificial Intelligence adoption in Australian industries, outlining gaps, opportunities, and trends.</li>
<li>For full technical details, please read the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.11801">pre-print</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>People are forced to change jobs as new technologies automate labour, production is moved abroad, and economic crises unfold. Successfully transitioning between jobs, however, requires leveraging current skills and acquiring others, which can falter if the skills gap is too large.</p>
<p>In our latest research, <a href="https://au.linkedin.com/in/marian-andrei-rizoiu-063b19b0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marian-Andrei Rizoiu</a>, <a href="https://au.linkedin.com/in/maryanne" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mary-Anne Williams</a> and I developed a novel method to measure the ‘distance’ between <em>sets of skills</em> using real-time job ads data. We then use these measures to build a recommender system that accurately predicts the probability of transitioning from one occupation to every other possible occupation. Intuitively, two occupations have a high probability of successfully transitioning when their skill sets are highly similar (i.e. the distance is small). For example, an Accountant has a high probability of transitioning to become a Financial Analyst because their skill sets are similar; whereas a Speech Therapist has a low transition probability to becoming a Financial Analyst as their skill sets are very different. This isn’t to say that it’s not possible. Rather, the skills gap is large, so the probability of successfully transitioning is diminished.</p>
<h2><strong>The SKILL SPACE Method</strong></h2>
<h3>Distance between skills</h3>
<p>In order to measure the distance between occupations from their underlying skill sets, we first measure the distance between individual skills in job ads for each calendar year from 2012-2020. To achieve this bottom-up approach, we first use a method from Trade Economics, called ‘Revealed Comparative Advantage’ (RCA), to identify how important an individual skill is to a job ad (i.e. comparative advantage). Then, after some normalisation, we calculate the pairwise similarity between every skill for each year. The image below shows the skill distance embeddings for the top 500 skills by posting frequency in 2018.</p>
<p><img src="https://bitsandatoms.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/all_skills_inset.png" alt="" width="671" height="776"></p>
<p>Here, each marker represents an individual skill that is coloured according to one of 13 clusters of highly similar skills. As seen in the Software Development cluster (see inset), highly similar skills cluster closely together, such as ‘Python’ and ‘C++’. The skills map also provides useful insights, highlighting that specialised skills (such as ‘Software Development’ and ‘Healthcare’) tend to lay toward the edges of the embedding, whereas more general and transferable skills lay toward the middle, acting as a ‘bridge’ to specialist skills.</p>
<h3>Distance between occupations</h3>
<p>Next, we use the pairwise skill distances to measure the distance between <em>sets of skills</em>. In this example, we define sets of skills by their occupational groupings. But they can just as easily be defined by other groupings, such as companies, industries, or personalised skill sets. We calculate the distance between skill sets as the weighted average similarity between the individual skills in each set, where the weights correspond to the skill importance in their respective sets. The figure below visualises the distance between Australian occupations in 2018.</p>
<p><img src="https://bitsandatoms.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ANZSCO_automation_inset.png" alt="" width="749" height="689"></p>
<p>Each occupation is represented by a marker and coloured on a scale according to their automation susceptibility, as calculated by <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0040162516302244" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Frey and Osborne</a> – dark blue represents low-risk probability and dark red shows high-risk probability over the coming two decades. As seen in the magnified inset, similar occupations lie close together on the map. Further, occupations in low-risk of automation tend to be characterised by non-routine, interpersonal, and/or high cognitive labour tasks; whereas occupations in high risk of automation tend to require routine, manual, and/or low cognitive labour tasks. For example, in the inset of the Figure above, a ‘Sheetmetal Trades Worker’ is deemed to be at high risk of labour automation (82% probability) due to high levels of routine and manual labour tasks required by the occupation. However, the skill set demands of a ‘Sheetmetal Trades Worker’ are highly similar to an ‘Industrial Designer’, which is considered at low risk of labour automation over the coming two decades (4% probability). Therefore, an ‘Industrial Designer’ represents a transition opportunity for a ‘Sheetmetal Trades Worker’ that leverages existing skills and protects against potential risks of technological labour automation.</p>
<h2><strong>Constructing the <em>Job Transitions Recommender System</em></strong></h2>
<p>The SKILL SPACE Method described above achieves high levels of accuracy in predicting job transitions. However, these are symmetric measures and we know that <strong>job transitions are <em>asymmetric</em></strong> – it is more difficult to transition between jobs in one direction than the other. Therefore, transitions are determined by more than the symmetric distance between skill sets; other factors, such as educational requirements and experience demands, contribute to these asymmetries.</p>
<p>We account for the asymmetries between job transitions by training a machine learning classifier model that combines the SKILL SPACE distance measures with other labour market variables from job ads data and employment statistics (see the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.11801" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">pre-print</a> for full details). Our machine learning model is trained against a dataset of ‘actual’ (i.e. real life) job transitions from an Australian longitudinal household survey. We then apply the trained model to predict the probability for every possible occupational transition in the dataset – described as the transition probability between a ‘source’ and a ‘target’ occupation. This creates the <em>Transitions Map</em>, for which a subset of 20 occupations can be seen in the figure below.</p>
<p><img src="https://bitsandatoms.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/R_clusterheatmap_subset_transitions.png" alt="" width="1152" height="1152" srcset="https://bitsandatoms.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/R_clusterheatmap_subset_transitions.png 1152w, https://bitsandatoms.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/R_clusterheatmap_subset_transitions-150x150.png 150w, https://bitsandatoms.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/R_clusterheatmap_subset_transitions-300x300.png 300w, https://bitsandatoms.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/R_clusterheatmap_subset_transitions-768x768.png 768w, https://bitsandatoms.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/R_clusterheatmap_subset_transitions-1024x1024.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1152px) 100vw, 1152px"></p>
<p>The coloured heatmap shows the transition probabilities (‘source’ occupations are in columns and ‘targets’ are in rows). Dark blue represents higher transition probabilities and lighter blue shows lower probabilities, where the asymmetries between occupation pairs are clearly observed. For example, a ‘Finance Manager’ has a higher probability of transitioning to become an ‘Accounting Clerk’ than the reverse direction. Moreover, transitioning to some occupations is generally easier (for example, ‘Bar Attendants and Baristas’) than others (‘Life Scientists’). The dendrogram (the lines on the left and top of the chart) illustrates the hierarchical clusters of occupations where there is a clear divide between service-oriented professions and manual labour occupations.</p>
<p>Our model achieves high levels of performance, <strong>accurately predicting 76% of occupational transitions</strong>.</p>
<h2><strong>Recommending Jobs and Skills</strong></h2>
<p>The <em>Transitions Map</em> provides the basis for making qualified job transition recommendations.&nbsp;We call this the <em>Job Transitions Recommender System</em>. In the figure below, we make job recommendations for ‘Domestic Cleaners’ as an example – an occupation that has experienced significant declines in labour demand and employment levels during COVID-19 in Australia.</p>
<p><img src="https://bitsandatoms.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/transitions-example-updated.png" alt="" width="1401" height="628" srcset="https://bitsandatoms.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/transitions-example-updated.png 1401w, https://bitsandatoms.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/transitions-example-updated-300x134.png 300w, https://bitsandatoms.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/transitions-example-updated-768x344.png 768w, https://bitsandatoms.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/transitions-example-updated-1024x459.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1401px) 100vw, 1401px"></p>

<p>First, we use the <em>Transitions Map</em> to recommend the occupations with the highest transition probabilities; these are the named occupations on the right side of the flow diagram, ordered in descending order of transition probability. Segment widths show the labour demand for each of the recommended occupations during the beginning of the COVID-19 period (measured by posting frequency). The segment colours represent the percentage change of posting frequency during March and April 2019 compared to the same months in 2020; dark red indicates a big decrease in job ad posts and dark blue indicates a big increase. The first six transition recommendations for ‘Domestic Cleaners’ all experienced negative demand, which is unsurprising given that ‘non-essential’ services were restricted in Australia during this period. However, the seventh recommendation, ‘Aged and Disabled Carers’, had significantly grown in demand during the beginning of the COVID-19 period and there was a high number of jobs advertised. Given that it is generally favourable to transition to high demand jobs, we selected ‘Aged and Disabled Carers’ as the target occupation for this example.</p>
<h3>Skill recommendations for target occupations</h3>
<p>We then take the <em>Job Transitions Recommender System</em> a step further by incorporating skill recommendations. Transitioning to a new occupation generally requires developing new skills under time and resource constraints. Therefore, workers must prioritise which skills to develop. We argue that a worker should invest in developing a skill when (1) the <strong>skill is important to the target occupation</strong> <em>and</em> (2) the <strong>distance to acquire the skill is large</strong> (that is, it is relatively difficult to acquire). In the case of the ‘Domestic Cleaner’ in the figure above, the top recommended skills to assist in the transition to the ‘Aged and Disabled Carer’ occupation are specialised patient care skills, such as ‘Patient Hygiene Assistance’.&nbsp;Conversely, the reasons <em>not</em> to develop a skill are when (1) the <strong>skill is not important</strong> <em>or</em> (2) the <strong>distance is small to the target occupation</strong>. The figure shows that while some ‘Aged and Disabled Carer’ jobs require ‘Business Analysis’ and ‘Finance’ skills, these skills are of low importance for the ‘Aged and Disabled Carer’ occupation, so they should not be prioritised. Similarly, skills such as ‘Ironing’ and ‘Laundry’ are required by ‘Aged and Disabled Carer’ jobs but the distance is small, so it is likely that either a ‘Domestic Cleaner’ already possesses these skills or they can easily acquire them.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>Matrix Multiply forms the foundation of Machine Learning computations. We show Apple’s M1 custom AMX2 Matrix Multiply unit can outperform ARMv8.6’s standard NEON instructions by about <strong>2X</strong>.</p>
<p>Nod’s AI Compiler team focusses on the state of art code generation, async partitioning, optimizations and scheduling to overlap communication and compute on various A.I hardware from large datacenter clusters to edge A.I silicon. The basic computation building block for all of that is the venerable Matmul. In this post we focus on the the Matmul performance on the just released Apple M1 Chip since that translates directly to how much you can squeeze out of any A.I hardware.</p>
<p>Typically silicon teams work closely with the optimization teams to create highly optimized SGEMM ( <b>S</b>ingle precision&nbsp;<b>GE</b>neral&nbsp;<b>M</b>atrix&nbsp;<b>M</b>ultiply) and DGEMM (<strong>D</strong>ouble precision <strong>GE</strong>neral <strong>M</strong>atrix <strong>M</strong>ulitply) kernels for each silicon platform. Intel’s <strong>MKL</strong> provides these kernels for the Intel chipsets and Apple’s <strong>Accelerate Framework&nbsp;</strong>provides highly optimized kernels for Apple machines (both Intel and Apple Silicon).</p>
<p>Eigen provides a reasonably easy to use high-level template library of these linear algebra algorithms while also exposing building blocks like <strong>GEBP</strong> (GeneralBlockPanelKernel) “traits” for each SoC.&nbsp; These GEBP traits effectively allow you to use Compiler Intrinsics and custom instructions to target a particular SoC while still wrapping it up in higher level C++ for ease of use. BLIS (a BLAS like library) also follows a similar paradigm where the “inner most” microkernel is highly hand optimized assembly for a particular architecture and&nbsp; forms the foundation of the higher level computations that could be written in more portable code. There is a good read on the concepts used by BLIS <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/flame/pubs/blis2_toms_rev2.pdf">here</a>. However BLIS’s microkernel on ARM/NEON is woefully inadequate (See <a href="https://github.com/flame/blis/issues/421">this bug report</a> when building with clang). There have been other attempts to write the GEBP kernel in portable code (see <a href="http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~jingling/papers/cgo17.pdf">this</a>), but I think Eigen is probably the most successful with the backing of the Tensorflow and Android efforts.</p>
<p>Apple’s M1 SoC&nbsp; has received rave reviews on its performance. It includes extension to the ARM Architectural Specification to include a Matrix Co-Processor – commonly referred to as <strong>AMX (Apple Matrix Co-processor)</strong>. The version in the M1 SoC is supposedly a “Version 2” so let’s refer to it as AMX2. Supposedly the AMX2 is tightly coupled with the ARM core (has custom instructions to access it) than the <strong>ANE (Apple Neural Engine)</strong> which is a separate Neural Processing Unit on the SoC – which would behave more like an integrated GPU with higher latencies and higher throughput when compared to the inline AMX2.</p>
<p>Apple has not released the instructions to access the AMX2.&nbsp; This way there is no need to maintain backwards compatibility with compiled software. The only way you should (though not the only way you <em>can</em>) currently access AMX2 on&nbsp; M1 SoC is via the Accelerate Framework.&nbsp; ARM has just started adding support for Architecture ARMv8.7-a in <a href="https://reviews.llvm.org/search/query/OxQ0whlSn_CS/#R">LLVM</a> and specifically the support for Accelerators such as AMX <a href="https://reviews.llvm.org/D91775">here</a> . It includes the ability to add Accelerators such as the AMX but it is unclear if AMX will adhere to that specification. You can find out more about ARMv8.7-a <a href="https://youtu.be/CSUohi1XY78"><strong>here</strong></a></p>
<p>In this post we will evaluate a <strong>simple SGEMM with a size of 1000</strong> using AMX2 and Eigen’s Neon optimized version on the Apple M1.&nbsp; We have done some tests with other ARMv8 SoCs but it is not apples to apples since they were older generation parts or had different toolchain options etc.&nbsp; &nbsp;All tests were done with top of master Clang (12.0.0+) built with OpenMP support (for Eigen’s parallelism) and top of master Eigen. We run 10 iterations of the Matrix multiply as warmup (to initialize any lazy loading libraries or fill the instruction and data caches) and then run the test 20 times and average the run times.&nbsp; We have to use Eigen noalias() to make sure there are no unnecessary copies.</p>
<p>We compile the code with -O3 and validate with <em>“otool -L”</em> that we link against Accelerate when using it and just standard libs otherwise. Also “otool -tv a.out | grep fmla” should show you the NEON FMLA instructions being used as shown below:</p>
<pre><span>nodai@macbook-pro-2 pytorch % otool -tv a.out| grep fmla</span>
<span>00000001000025a8 fmla.2d v0, v2, v1<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>; Latency: 10</span>
<span>0000000100002700 fmla.2d v2, v4, v0<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>; Latency: 10</span>
<span>0000000100002704 fmla.2d v1, v5, v3<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>; Latency: 10</span>
<span>0000000100002a78 fmla.2d v3, v5, v1<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>; Latency: 10</span></pre>

<h3><strong>Results</strong></h3>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>CPU utilization:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>For the test matrix size of 1000 there is negligible cpu utilization so we tried increasing the matrix size large enough to see some impact. With AMX2 the CPU utilization delta is negligible but there is likely memory pressure to DMA into the AMX2, however with NEON we can saturate the CPU cores.</p>

<p>But is this the best NEON optimization possible ? Based on this <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i3GXUku9e76B7YwPnYiDx-d36ZuL85WRKEnNiIgA8rQ/edit#gid=1050198706">work</a> as part of GEMMLOWP project there should be more room. So we ran the “standalone NEON tests” on the M1. This should give us a good idea on the delta between Eigen’s GEBP and a fully hand optimized NEON kernel by ARM themselves (though for a Cortex-A57 class core).&nbsp; The results are below:</p>

<span>NEON_64bit_GEMM_Float32_WithScalar_A55r1,53.2717</span></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Based on the above we estimate there is another 20% or so we can squeeze out of the NEON implementation.&nbsp; An important point to consider is the overhead of using intrinsics vs full inline assembly – you still have to make a choice between portability and performance.</p>
<p><strong>Single Threaded FP32 Matmul AMX2</strong></p>
<p>After the post was initially written we found there is an environment variable <span>VECLIB_MAXIMUM_THREAD</span> that can control single threaded operation of Accelerate. Stay tuned for more controlled studies.</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>This is a first pass performance test of using AMX2 vs NEON on the <strong>Apple M1 </strong>that<b> shows AMX2 roughly twice as fast as the NEON implementation</b>. There are probably a lot of corner cases to consider and tweaks to be done to the the NEON code especially with the varying size of L2 caches between the different cores.&nbsp; Based on the GEMMLowP work we estimate there is atleast another 20% or so left on the table with NEON. Let us know if we missed anything. Right now the system (Core clocks, core types, scheduler priorities etc) is not in a controlled environment to test it throughly but hopefully this gives us a first order approximation of what performance to expect at the fundamental building block – a Matmul, on the Apple M1.</p>
<p><strong>Future Work:</strong></p>
<p>In our next blog post we will build on a MatMul and share some numbers of the Nod Compiler’s codegen capabilities to automatically generate these GEMM kernels and other common kernels used in Machine Learning and compare the performance to native frameworks like MKL/MKL-DNN, Accelerate / MLCompute and Cudnn/cuBLAS on the GPU.</p>

<h4>Update 1 (12/30): Add first pass ruy numbers and push source code</h4>
<p>Thanks the Benoit Jacob from the Google&nbsp; who has worked on Eigen, Gemmlowp, TFlite, IREE etc we have first pass ruy numbers below on the M1. Stay tuned for more detailed comparisons and numbers.</p>

		<p>When I posted the <a href="https://cakecrumbs.me/2013/05/24/commission-earth-structural-layer-cake/">Earth cake</a>, I did not expect it to get anywhere near the amount of attention it received. Getting featured on the Facebook pages Think Geek and I Fucking Love Science was a total highlight of my blogging life. I’m big fans of both pages so it was kind of surreal. A lot of my Zoology graduate mates are also fans of IFLS and you’d often hear conversations in the Masters office beginning with, “Did you see that post by IFLS today?” So I woke up to several of them messaging me about it and we all got super excited over it.</p>
<p>With the exposure those pages brought came a whole lot of people who wanted to know how to make it. I still get a couple of emails a week asking for a recipe. The cake was a total experiment on my part, and not one that went flawlessly. There were many imperfections within the cake and I never share recipes unless I know it’s absolutely tried and true. I’d hate to be responsible for a baking fail simply for giving a botched up recipe. But I also hate letting people down. So I decided to re-visit the concept so I could make a tutorial. That will come later in the week as I’m still editing it. But first, here’s the result of round 2.</p>

<p>One question I got asked a lot was if it was possible to make it a sphere. Absolutely it is. If you can make the hemisphere a sphere is easy. I didn’t want to make another Earth cake as I hate repeating bakes, so I opted to decorate it as something new. I threw around a few ideas ranging from something floral to a giant pokéball, but in the end I just wanted to make another planet.</p>

<p>Choosing a favourite planet was tough. As a kid I was fiercely passionate about two things: animals and the solar system. I ended up following the path of the former and never kept up to date with the latter, but the inner passion for astronomy has never died. Space is just <em>so freaking cool</em>. Our solar system alone is filled with so many fascinating planets, dwarf planets and all their satellites — choosing just one felt treacherous.</p>

<p>In the end I settled on Jupiter predominantly for one reason: its Great Red Spot. The giant anticyclonic storm has always been one of my favourite things and continues to be a subject of great fascination for me. At thrice the size of the Earth it’s bewildering to comprehend the actual magnitude of it. If I absolutely have to choose a favourite planet, it’s got to Jupiter for that storm alone. It’s also so iconic. It’s a characteristic feature almost everyone is familiar with, making it easier to create something that would be instantly recognisable.</p>
<p>The red spot is one of a number of storms you can see all over Jupiter. Some of them last hours, others last for centuries. The red spot had been around since the early 1800s, and it’s possible that it may remain as a permanent feature of the planet. It would be fascinating to see Jupiter if the storm did in fact die out, or if another large one were to appear. The smaller white storms are made up of cool clouds in the upper atmosphere, whereas the brown dots are composed of warmer clouds in the lower atmosphere.</p>

<p>I detailed the atmosphere of Jupiter by covering the cake with ivory marshmallow fondant, then dry brushing a combination of ivory, brown and maroon edible ink. The top ended up being a bit more saturated as I was largely experimenting with colours at that point and was throwing in a bit of yellow. I ended up sticking mostly with ivory and adding extra detail with the brown. Once all the base colours were down I started removing colour to create the storms or other distinguishing features and topping it off with highlights. The whole process took about 8 hours with teeny tiny brushes.</p>

<p>It was kind of difficult to get good reference shots of the non-red-spot sides of Jupiter, particularly to get consistent ones. They were all taken over many different years and influenced by many different weather events so there was lots of variation. But I got enough to get a rough guestimate of the more static features of Jupiter’s atmosphere. The rest I’ll just claim as artistic license.</p>
<p>Finally came time to cut the cake and see how there spheres lined up inside. It turned out better matched than I’d anticipated.</p>

<p>When my sister asked me what I was making and I said Jupiter, she said to me, “I didn’t even know Jupiter had layers.” It’s amazing how much we can forget after learning it in primary school. So here’s a rehashing for those of you who’ve also forgotten. Our knowledge is mostly theoretical of course, but the gas giants are thought to have a core comprised mostly of rock and ice. This is surrounded by a layer liquid metallic hydrogen, and the outer layer is composed of molecular hydrogen. *cake is totally not to scale</p>

<p>In cake speak, this translates to a core made of mudcake, surrounded by almond butter cake, surrounded by a tinted vanilla Madeira sponge. There’s a crumb coat of vanilla buttercream underneath the fondant.</p>
<p>This run went so much better than the first, informed by the mistakes and lessons learned in the mean time. So I feel much safer sharing the process with you guys now. Stay tuned for that later this week if all goes to plan.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
<p>Discomfort, a slight physical or emotional pain, developed as an evolutionary necessity; historically, considering the unpleasantness of discomfort during decision making was for the best of the species. Berries make your stomach uneasy? Stop eating them. Prickly bush scratches your skin? Don’t let it happen again.</p>
<p>On average your body does a good job correlating discomfort with actions that are bad for your well being, but it’s important to note that your body isn’t right 100% of the time!</p>
<p>The world has changed a lot since we developed the capacity to feel discomfort. I claim that people would be better off if they were to diminish or even eliminate the role that discomfort plays in the decision making process, opting instead for considering “long term” consequences. At least personally, this mentality shift has had a huge positive impact on my day to day life.</p>

<p>There are many things that people know they should be doing try to do but can’t do with success:</p>
<ul>
<li>eating healthy</li>
<li>getting 8 hours of sleep a night</li>
<li>exercising regularly</li>
<li>taking cold showers</li>
</ul>
<p>A common reason people don’t commit to these resolutions is that they rationalize them away on the basis of the required discomfort. People don’t want to miss out on the taste of junk food, or deal with the pain of a work out. After removing discomfort, the only reason left not to do build these healthy habits would be the cost of time, but even the busiest people can carve out a little bit of time for these activities that have much higher returns than the time investment (yes even you!).</p>

<p>Since the new year I have started every morning with a 20 minute workout. My workout consists of handstand pushups, pullups, hanging leg raises, and stretching. By framing the workout as having a cost of 20 minutes and forgetting about the discomfort I will experience during the workout, I am having an easier time maintaining the habit (knock on wood). It takes just 20 minutes and leaves me feeling energized for the rest of the day.</p>
<p>After my workout I hop into a cold shower. Similarly, I dispell thoughts relating to the discomfort of the cold water, and instead phrase the cold shower as a healthy experience that will take just 5 minutes. I wake right up and feel warm as soon as I get out of the cold.</p>

<p>The previous examples were activites of relatively minor discomfort that have compounding positive effects when incorporating them into daily life. Another benefit of making them ritual is to prepare you for dire needs which may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>a necessary confrontation</li>
<li>asking someone out</li>
<li>asking for a raise</li>
<li>building moral courage</li>
<li>generally getting out of one’s comfort zone</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the types of scenarios where people often regret not stepping out of their comfort zones; by building a tolerance for discomfort you will more easily take them on.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Keep the faculty of effort alive in you by a little gratuitous exercise every day. Do every day or two something for no other reason than that you would rather not do it, so that when the hour of dire needs draws nigh, it may find you not unnerved and untrained to stand the test - The Way To Willpower</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I hope that this mentality shift is as helpful to you as it was to me. Please leave any comments or reflections below :)</p>

   <p>When I encounter a new class of vulnerability or attack vector, I typically add a check for it in <a href="https://github.com/nccgroup/sobelow">Sobelow</a>. Occasionally, however, I see an opportunity for these issues to be mitigated at the library level. In these cases, I try to reach out to JosÃ© or Chris to talk through potential solutions.</p>
   <p>For example, I recently ran into the following issue:</p>
   <pre><code>&lt;%= form_for @conn, "https://third-party-site", fn f -&gt; %&gt;
  &lt;%= email_input f, :email %&gt;
  &lt;%= submit "Get notified!" %&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;</code></pre>
   <p>A developer building SiteA added a form for a third-party service (SiteB), using Phoenixâ€™s built-in <code>form_for</code> function. Because Phoenix forms include a valid CSRF token by default, these tokens were being leaked to the third-party<sup><a href="#g939451-footnote-1-definition" name="g939451-footnote-1-return">1</a></sup>. As a consequence, SiteB could cause a user to perform unwanted actions on SiteA, such as updating their password or deleting their account.</p>
   <p>This is the problem we were aiming to fix. But before getting to our solution, I want to flesh out the problem a little bit. Letâ€™s start with an overview of Cross-Site Request Forgery (or CSRF), one of the webâ€™s most common vulnerabilities.</p>
   <h2 id="what-is-csrf">What is CSRF?</h2>
   <p>The basic idea is this: Any website can create a form pointing to any other website. They can also automatically fill out and submit these forms. Because cookies are sent with every request, a CSRF attack allows untrusted applications to cause a userâ€™s browser to submit requests and perform authenticated actions on the userâ€™s behalf. Thankfully, web libraries such as Phoenix and Plug have adopted techniques to mitigate such attacks.</p>
   <p>The most common solution to this problem, and the one taken by Phoenix, is to store a unique, random token in the userâ€™s session. This token is then fetched by the client and sent along with every request. When an application processes the request, the submitted token should match the token stored in the userâ€™s session. This way, a malicious website can only cause a user to make valid requests if they have access to a valid CSRF token.</p>
   <p>Now, this is where our initial issue comes into play. When using form generation for third-party or dynamic endpoints, valid CSRF tokens will be leaked by default, leaving users vulnerable to attack. This is something that an experienced developer will probably catch, but itâ€™s a common enough occurrence that it would be nice if the issue could be addressed.</p>
   <p>So, the core issue is simple: In some cases, valid CSRF tokens are leaked by default. And the desired outcome is clear: Donâ€™t leak valid tokens by default. But, in achieving that solution, there are a few considerations:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>Tokens leaked in this manner shouldnâ€™t be useful to an attacker.</li>
    <li>A solution shouldnâ€™t increase burden on the developer, and it shouldnâ€™t sacrifice performance.</li>
    <li>Tokens should work across domains when desired.</li></ol>
   <h2 id="what-is-the-solution">What is the solution?</h2>
   <p>Ultimately, the solution is actually pretty simple. If the token is being generated for a path, as is typical, then everything stays the same. That is, fetching the CSRF token looks something like this:</p>
   <pre><code>get_csrf_token()</code></pre>
   <p>However, if a token is fetched for a fully qualified host, it looks more like this:</p>
   <pre><code>csrf_token = get_csrf_token()
key = KeyGenerator.generate(secret, csrf_token)
host_token = MessageVerifier.sign(host, key)</code></pre>
   <p>The userâ€™s CSRF token is fetched like normal. However, instead of returning the token directly, the token is used as a â€œsaltâ€� in a key derivation function. This newly derived secret key is then used to sign a message which includes the target host.</p>
   <p>On the receiving end of things, the CSRF tokenâ€™s signature is validated. If the signature verification succeeds, then the host is validated to ensure it matches a set of allowed hosts (or the host header). If either of these checks fails, the request is rejected as fraudulent.</p>
   <p>Letâ€™s look back at the initial problem, this time using our new host tokens.</p>
   <p>A developer building SiteA adds a form for a third-party service (SiteB), using Phoenixâ€™s built-in <code>form_for</code> function. Because Phoenix forms include a CSRF token by default, these tokens will be leaked to the third-party. Fortunately, these are now the signed host tokens. If the malicious site attempts to initiate a CSRF attack, the host signed in the token (SiteB) wonâ€™t match the host being requested (SiteA). As a consequence, SiteBâ€™s attack fails.</p>
   <p>This technique has a few benefits. First, and most importantly, nothing changes in the vast majority of cases. Most forms will continue to include plain, standard CSRF tokens. But now, if CSRF tokens are leaked in the described manner, we are safe from attack. Further, unlike other potential solutions, this solution will still work seamlessly across subdomains and domains the developer controls.</p>
   <p>With this solution, we prevent usable tokens from leaking by default, require no changes from the end-developer, and still allow the same range of functionality.</p>
   <p>These changes are live on Plug 1.5.0 and phoenix_html 2.10.0!</p>
