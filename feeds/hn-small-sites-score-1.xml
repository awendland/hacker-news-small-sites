                    <p>Passwords are dying. The cost of creating and maintaining passwords is becoming untenable. Which can be seen in the rise of users logging in with social products and developers outsourcing their pain to Auth0 and the likes. We decided to sidestep the password based authentication and went passwordless on our new product. Read on to see how you can go passwordless too.</p><p><strong>The cost of passwords</strong></p><p>Passwords create too much friction for users. It’s becoming difficult to come up with passwords that satisfy the ever growing password strength requirements - minimum 9 characters, 1 number, 1 upper case, 1 special character etc. And with the rise of data breaches where hackers steal and sell password data on the internet, passwords are only really effective when you don’t repeat them across different services. Which means you have to remember unique passwords or use a password manager.</p><p>Passwords are even more painful for developers to build and maintain. Imagine the work - 4 forms (signup, login, reset password, send forgot password link), storing passwords securely, managing email service providers for deliverability and spam scores. All this work just for the auth, which is not your core product and not what users come to you for. </p><p><strong>Magic links, the solution to the password problem</strong></p><p>An elegant solution to this mess is authenticating users using magic links sent on email. We all use email anyway as a core part of our online identity and authentication. So instead of logging in with email and password, you enter your email and get a login link sent to you. You might have seen Slack do this.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/2Yx1vwl0CygQi3k1aT9iKXiAETGQmsfaNuE2uA4-KsTWrGKN-WjwAGQv_XwPOpv3zainHdNZ29jbxiJYBIbVo-iKPAE9BMHIkVlKZQgVFzJK0dxaoaoJmQ6a-k5UuKDmNecYiqZY"><figcaption>Slack popularised magic links for logging in</figcaption></figure><p><strong>How we went passwordless with magic link</strong></p><p>When we were building our new product, we didn’t want to spend time building full blown password auth, so we decided on using magic links. And although the work involved building a magic link system is less than traditional auth, it is still valuable developer time spent on non-core plumbing. After some research, we found <a href="https://magic.link/">Magic</a> which provides magic links as a service. We loved the focus on security (the founders have built a security product in the past), the good design and the developer friendly docs. </p><p>The implementation involves a client SDK (for web and mobile) for showing the Magic overlay (screenshots below) and server code for managing sessions. We used the sample code provided to implement this. </p><p><strong>The user experience of magic links</strong></p><p>Login form</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/87Sh7Be5B83QExzyE2bF12OGsrTom6Lpw-haLYteMvUUaoFyZbe9FLozGgE1bcMgB7x0NyTThb0fj-uqwanGADb3OpA9x5srYvNqVGlKSvPoy9XvYR4xjDwEcKNKInFDNC8JUAqD"><figcaption>Sign up and Log in form</figcaption></figure><p>Email</p><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/EtAzDiIBqb7SpaSTW6W3qRB5J7E7uq-ThWLXWPczkdIKIXXbhRK74OlQkFMrcTIkWXI5YJC7blPMl5qblW4wF5mM_JpFOicTIXy_rr0R9Ijn0dsSJv4O-a0xfFBJRs38F0MYlxfk"><figcaption>Magic link email</figcaption></figure><p>You can <a href="https://incidents.sh/">try out the experience for yourself</a> on our new product. It’s a free timer for developers to keep track of major software incidents, built by the team who also built the simple <a href="https://spike.sh/">incident alerting</a> product for developers.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>After using magic links as a developer and as a user, I loved the experience. There are still some hiccups as with any new technology, but overall this looks like the future. And I am quite excited to watch it unfold!</p>

		<p>Python Notebooks provide interactive computing environment that is perfect for experimenting with data. The Notebooks are widely used by Data Scientists in data analysis and discovery tasks. Currently, there are many versions of Notebooks. The first, and the most used version is <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter Notebook</a>. There are also many cloud-based Notebooks, like <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/notebooks">Kaggle Notebooks</a> or <a href="https://cocalc.com/">CoCalc Notebooks</a>.</p>

<p>The transparency of created Machine Learning pipeline is very important in the <a href="https://github.com/mljar/mljar-supervised">MLJAR AutoML</a>. Starting from the version <code>0.9.1</code> the MLJAR AutoML provides support for displaying interactive reports from AutoML training directly in the Python Notebook.</p>

<p>If you didn’t try yet MLJAR AutoML, you can easily check it out. It is available at GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/mljar/mljar-supervised">https://github.com/mljar/mljar-supervised</a>. It is open-source, with MIT license. It works with tabular data and supports binary, multiclass classification, and regression.</p>

<h2 id="automl-training-report-in-the-notebook">AutoML Training Report in the Notebook</h2>

<p>The MLJAR <code>AutoML</code> class provides the <code>report()</code> method for displaying report directly in the Notebook. After training the <code>AutoML</code> just call <code>report()</code> on <code>AutoML</code> object. Some examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>MLJAR AutoML in <code>Explain</code> mode: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/mt77pp/mljar-automl-explain-tabular-playground-mar-21">link to the notebook</a>,</li>
  <li>MLJAR AutoML in <code>Compete</code> mode: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/mt77pp/8h-mljar-automl-tabular-playground-mar-202">link to the notebook</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-example-report">The Example Report</h3>

<p>Below is the screenshot from the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/mt77pp/mljar-automl-explain-tabular-playground-mar-21">example report</a>. You can click on <code>Automatic Exploratory Data Analysis Report</code> to open EDA plots. There is <code>&lt;&lt; Go back</code> link there, which will redirect you to the main view.</p>

<p><img src="https://mljar.com/blog/automl-notebook/automl_explain_in_notebook.png" alt="AutoML Explain in the Notebook"></p>

<p>Please click on the selected model name, for example on the <code>3_Default_Xgboost</code>. It will redirect you to model’s report, where you can check the model details, like: hyperparameters values, metrics, learning curves and explanations (if available).</p>

<p><img src="https://mljar.com/blog/automl-notebook/xgboost_details_1.png" alt="Xgboost 1 in the Notebook"></p>

<img src="https://mljar.com/blog/automl-notebook/xgboost_details_4.png" alt="Xgboost 4 in the Notebook"></p>

<p>There is <code>&lt;&lt; Go back</code> link at the top (and the bottom of each model report) that will redirect you to the main view. You can easily navigate the AutoML training report.</p>

<p>What is more, all reports data and files are available in the hard drive. They can be easily commited to the GitHub and displayed there. The report files are presented as <code>README.md</code> files.</p>

<p>Link to report in the Github: <a href="https://github.com/mljar/mljar-examples/tree/master/Iris_classification/AutoML_1">Iris classification with AutoML</a>.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>The MLJAR AutoML works perfectly with Python Notebooks. It provides interactive reports from the AutoML training. Reports can be displayed directly in the Notebook by calling the <code>report()</code> method.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div><p>
Quickly learn if a site speed change will have a positive impact, without hassling your dev team.
</p></div>
<p>Improving site speed can be <b>complicated</b>. It's surprisingly common to roll out a change that should lead to a performance improvement, only to find that - frustratingly - things have gotten slower.</p>
<p>And a lot of the time, this is how site speed works - you have to approach it like you're running an experiment, where you benchmark your baseline, make a change, and then test to see if you've made an impact.</p>
<p>But this approach can also be slow - especially if you're having to ask developers to make these changes, and then they have to find time in their schedule to implement them (and then, potentially, roll them back). In situations like that, you have a slow feedback loop - it takes a long time between "let's see if this works" to finding out the results.</p>
<h2>A fast feedback loop</h2>
<p>Chrome DevTools has a feature called <b>Local Overrides</b> that can drastically improve that feedback loop. Instead of having to wait for a developer to add your change, you can first try it out on your local machine to measure the potential impact.</p>
<p>It works by saving a copy of the page you're working on (or any other resource, like a JavaScript or CSS file), letting you edit that, and then serving that file instead of the live version.</p>
<p>Here's how I test whether site speed changes might work, without having to push those changes live first.</p>
<h2>Setting up local overrides</h2>
<p>The first step is to get overrides set up on your computer. Open Chrome DevTools (Option + ⌘ + J on mac, or right-click and inspect element), click on the Sources tab, and then click the &gt;&gt; button in the left-hand side bar to find the Overrides panel.</p>
<p><img src="https://tryblackbird.com/images/overrides.jpg" loading="lazy"></p><p>From here, click "Select folder for overrides", and choose somewhere to save your new editable copies of files. I just use a folder that's tucked away somewhere named "Local Overrides", but you do you.</p>
<h2>Finding the baseline</h2>
<p>You need to know what your baseline is before you can see if a change improves or harms performance. Most of the time, the metric I'm trying to improve is <a href="https://web.dev/lcp/">Largest Contentful Paint</a>, so I built a JavaScript snippet that's heavily inspired by <a href="https://gist.github.com/tkadlec/683b26344cde774170b94c0fcf0088b4">Tim Kadlec's perf-diagnostics.css</a>.</p>
<p>To add it, right-click on your Chrome bookmark bar, click <b>Add Page</b>, add the name "Highlight LCP", and then add this as the URL:</p>
<pre><code>javascript:(function(){var paintEntries = performance.getEntriesByType("paint");var entries = [];new PerformanceObserver((entryList) =&gt; {for (const entry of entryList.getEntries()) {entries.push(entry);}var element = entries[entries.length - 1];var lcp = entries[entries.length - 1]["loadTime"];var fcp = paintEntries[1]["startTime"];console.log("FCP is " + Math.round((fcp + Number.EPSILON) * 100) / 100 + " ms");console.log("LCP is " + lcp + " ms");element["element"].style.border="4px solid gold";}).observe({type: 'largest-contentful-paint', buffered: true});})();
</code></pre>
<p>When you click that bookmark it'll add a gold border to the LCP element, and show both the FCP and the LCP timings in the DevTools console.</p>
<p><img src="https://tryblackbird.com/images/wiggle.jpg" loading="lazy"></p><p>At this point, I like to run 3 tests on the new, locally stored page. You don't want to compare your edited local page with the live version - so to do that, I use local overrides to add an extra line-break into the code somewhere.</p>
<p>From the Overrides menu, it'll prompt you to hit Ctrl + P to open a file. Select the page that you want to edit, and you should see the source code appear. From here, I usually add an extra blank space or a line break, and then hit save. You want to make sure that there's a blue dot next to the file name, which tells you that it's now serving a local version of the file. Also, make sure you've got Enabled Local Overrides checked.</p>
<p><img src="https://tryblackbird.com/images/local-overrides-devtools.jpg" loading="lazy"></p><p>Under the Network tab, I'll usually throttle my connection to Fast 3G when running my tests. This is largely because I want to focus on users who have a slower connection because if you can improve performance for them then you'll also improve performance for the average user. It's also useful because it makes it clearer if a performance change is having an impact.</p>
<p><img src="https://tryblackbird.com/images/throttle-connection.jpg" loading="lazy"></p><p>Now that's all set up - I normally run 3 tests, making a note of the First Contentful Paint and Largest Contentful Paint values using the JavaScript bookmarklet.</p>
<p>To do that, I use Chrome's option to empty the cache and hard reload the page each time (if you have DevTools open, it appears as an option if you hold down the refresh icon).</p>
<p><img src="https://tryblackbird.com/images/hard-reload.jpg" loading="lazy"></p><p>Those 3 sets of numbers you have? Take the middle number for both FCP and LCP (even if they were in different test runs). That's your median - so those are the numbers that you'll be benchmarking any changes against. Feel free to run more tests if you want to be extra sure, but I find 3 normally does the trick.</p>
<h2>Removing the anti-flicker snippet</h2>
<p>I'm going to use the cycle page for <a href="https://www.wiggle.co.uk/cycle">Wiggle</a> as an example here. They're not a customer, and I have no connection there - I just noticed some potential speed optimisations that Local Overrides could show off. Also, this is very much not a dig at Wiggle - the site is well built, and there are very likely good reasons for some of these engineering decisions. I've only chosen them because I think there are a few tweaks that could result in speed improvements.</p>
<p>After throttling my connection to 3G and testing the page 3 times, my median First Contentful Paint was <b>5,231 ms</b> and my Largest Contentful Paint was <b>13,221 ms</b>.</p>
<p>I noticed that Wiggle were using the anti-flicker snippet from Google Optimize. A/B testing software sometimes suggests this - it effectively hides the page completely until either the Optimize JavaScript has loaded and run, or 4 seconds have passed - whichever is soonest. 4 seconds is a long time to hide content, and could explain why slower connections are seeing an FCP of over 5 seconds. Andy Davies' has <a href="https://andydavies.me/blog/2020/11/16/the-case-against-anti-flicker-snippets/">a really useful post on anti-flicker snippets</a>, which is worth checking out if you'd like to know more.</p>
<p><img src="https://tryblackbird.com/images/antiflicker-snippet.jpg" loading="lazy"></p><p>I wanted to see what impact removing that anti-flicker snippet would have. I used Local Overrides to delete that whole snippet, and then re-ran the test 3 times. The median First Contentful Paint dropped from <b>5,231 ms</b> to <b>2,217 ms</b> - an improvement of <b>58%</b>.</p>
<h2>Un-hiding the hero carousel</h2>
<p>With the JavaScript bookmarklet, I was able to see that the LCP element was the hero header image. Wiggle seem to use a carousel for this, but they only show the first slide. In either case - the approach seems to hide the carousel by default, and then unhide it with JavaScript. It looks like it adds a CSS class named <code>owl-loaded</code> to the carousel once it's loaded, which then reveals it to the user.</p>
<p>I wanted to see what it would look like if it didn't hide the carousel by default, so with Chrome's Local Overrides I added the <code>owl-loaded</code> class directly. This isn't perfect, and if the plan was to change how that carousel worked, I'm sure there would be much more elegant ways to approach this - but I wanted to get a sense of whether LCP could be improved by showing the hero carousel straight away.</p>
<p><img src="https://tryblackbird.com/images/owl-loaded.jpg" loading="lazy"></p><p>Re-running the tests after adding <code>owl-loaded</code> to the carousel resulted in the LCP dropping from <b>13,221 ms</b> to <b>5,429 ms</b>, an improvement of <b>59%</b>.</p>
<h2>Wrapping up</h2>
<p>Local Overrides allow you to experiment with site speed fixes on your local machine, so you have a really fast feedback loop. It's useful for helping you debug, spot issues, and test whether things like deferring JavaScript will break the page layout.</p>
<p>But for me, the biggest benefit is that it lets you be a lot more confident with the recommendations that you give.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>Uber is one of the leaders in ride-sharing in the US and in Europe. However, they are having troubles in expanding to Asian continent. For example Ubers expansion to China failed, and Uber in China was acquired by DiDi. </p>
<p>In Sri Lanka the monopoly in ride-sharing is held by PickMe, with Uber at the second place. PickMe started as a small startup in Sri Lanka. They saw what Uber is doing in the USA and basically cloned the idea in Sri Lanka, and instead of taxis they used TukTuks, a popular three-wheel vehicles found in Asia that are similar to a Taxi in New York.</p>
<p>When Uber announced that they are starting operations in Sri Lanka, I thought they are going to give a good run for PickMe’s money, because Uber has deep wallets than PickMe, Uber has better technology than PickMe. And with cash in hand, Uber might be able to give competitive rates, and attract more users than PickMe.</p>
<p>However, years have passed and Uber is still at the second place, while PickMe has expanded and they are way ahead of Uber in Sri Lanka. It’s not the lack of cash or technology that defeated Uber in Sri Lanka, which they have plenty more than PickMe. </p>
<p>So what made Uber less successful in Sri Lanka than PickMe?</p>
<h2>Uber didn’t have an office in Sri Lanka, customers weren’t happy</h2>
<p>Even though initially there was an Uber office in Sri Lanka, slowly it was replaced by an office in India, which handled operations in Sri Lanka. </p>
<p>This led to scores of unhappy customers because, </p>
<ul><li>There was no hotline that handled complaints on behalf of users. The local number of the Uber office never worked, because almost all operations were done by an office in India.</li><li>Customers could not get any refunds when they were charged incorrectly.</li><li>Even when a user complained via the app, there was very little response, because for the office in India, they never cared about giving a good customer service for Sri Lanka.</li></ul>
<p>These unsatisfied customers meant more rides for PickMe. Yes, PickMe riders are the same set of riders who are Uber riders, but at least PickMe has a working customer hotline, and are very responsive in their app. I have received multiple refunds though Pickme when I was overcharged, but Uber zero refunds.</p>
<h2>Uber didn’t process payments well, and drivers weren’t happy</h2>
<p>Uber had this policy where they transferred money received by users who paid by credit cards to their drivers at the end of each month. </p>
<p>This made the drivers very unhappy, because most of these TukTuk drivers made a daily wage from their rides, and they didn’t want to do rides where they received money at the end of the month.</p>
<p>I’m one of those users who pay to ride-sharing with my credit card, I was asked numerous times for where riders asked me to either pay by cash, or they will call upfront and if I’m paying via my credit card they will cancel the ride.</p>
<p>However, PickMe’s payments were instant, when someone paid by card, the driver will get the money to their account within several hours, not at the end of the month.</p>
<p>There were other reasons that made both drivers and customers both unhappy, but these were the to main reasons that I can remember which made people pick PickMe over Uber.</p>
<p>Uber was making both drivers and users both unhappy at the same time, a very bad combination to have. </p>
<p>Soon more and more people started using PickMe more, and drivers also given up Uber towards PickMe. </p>
<p>Now Uber is playing a catchup game with PickMe to win back their lost rides, but at times it feels as if Uber has given up on winning the ride-sharing battle and focusing on something different. </p>

<h2>Uber is now king in food delivery in Sri Lanka</h2>
<p>For some reason Uber is doing quite well in food delivering in Sri Lanka. Here PickMe was late to the party, and Uber started their food devilry before PickMe. </p>
<p>The Uber eats app is more polished than PickMe. And even though I haven’t tried both food delivery apps, so I don’t know the real reason why Uber is ahead of food delivery in Sri Lanka but not in ride-sharing.</p>
<p>Anyway, the take away message is, even if you have deep pockets, and technology, you still can lose to a startup with far less cash, and technology if you are providing a poor service.</p>

            <p>Many tests for an operation iterate over a mapping of different inputs to expected outcomes. By looking at the tests for a single operation as the same test with different inputs and output expectations, we can start to question how we should model those tests.</p>
<h2 id="tests-as-matrices">Tests as Matrices</h2>
<p>By simply enumerating every possible combination of input values, we can construct a matrix with as many dimensions as inputs. We can then define the expected result for each set of inputs, and write a generalised test function:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>∀ input∈{(a, b, …, n) | a∈A, b∈B, …, n∈N} f(input)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The number of possible test cases is thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>|<em>i</em><em>n</em><em>p</em><em>u</em><em>t</em><em>s</em>| = |A × B × ⋯ × N|</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As soon as our operation accepts an input that has more than a few possible values, that is any kind of number,<span><label for="sn-1"></label><span>With more than 8 bits at least. One could reasonably enumerate 256 different inputs for an operation, for correctness proven by test.</span></span> string, or complex data structure, enumerating every possible input combination becomes impractical. Instead we can resort to groupings of values via properties.</p>
<p>This is a test matrix for division which uses properties instead of values, with the rows being dividends, and the columns divisors:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>÷</th>
<th>Positive</th>
<th>Zero</th>
<th>Negative</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Positive</td>
<td>Positive</td>
<td>undefined</td>
<td>Negative</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Zero</td>
<td>Zero</td>
<td>undefined</td>
<td>Zero</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Negative</td>
<td>Negative</td>
<td>undefined</td>
<td>Positive</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Matrices like this are necessarily exhaustive,<span><label for="sn-2"></label><span>Unless we designate a special result to mean “<em>do not test this set of inputs</em>”.</span></span> and force us to think about the result for every possible combination of the input values we have included.</p>
<p>This is an implementation of the same property matrix in Clojure:</p>

<p>In this case we are testing a safe variant of the division function <code>/</code>, which returns <code>nil</code> if the divisor is zero. This simplifies the testing process, because we do not have to include any exception catching logic in our test function, or invent a notation to mean <em>this set of inputs should result in a thrown exception</em>.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that such a direct interpretation of a matrix is only possible in a language as malleable as Clojure. In other languages, we might have to resort to enumerating a set of <code>(dividend
divisor result)</code> tuples, losing the guarantee of covering all possible combinations.</p>
<p>But even in Clojure, more than two dimensions in this matrix will quickly become unwieldy and hard to follow, and a tuple-based approach would scale better to larger numbers of input parameters.</p>
<h2 id="tests-as-trees">Tests as Trees</h2>
<p>Another way we could structure our tests is as a tree. A tree does not have to be exhaustive the same way a matrix has to be.<span><label for="sn-3"></label><span>Again, assuming we are using a matrix based approach, rather than enumerating combinations manually.</span></span> We can omit certain combinations of inputs by pruning their branches. In this way we are implying that if a single input has a given value, it defines the result regardless of the other inputs’ values.</p>
<p>In the division example all branches with a divisor of zero could be collapsed into a single case, as the dividend does not matter in this case. This only works if the first level of branching describes the divisor, and the dividends are on the second level.</p>

<p>This might look more verbose, but in exchange we get a unique label for every tree branch,<span><label for="sn-4"></label><span>We can also make use of useful property of <code>clojure.test</code>: if a test fails, it will traverse the <code>testing</code> statements upwards and concatenate the names, providing us with the path of the failed test. For example “<em>with a negative divisor and a zero dividend</em>”.</span></span> which can improve readability. The nesting also naturally lends itself to lexical scoping, so we only have the values in scope which apply on a given branch.</p>
<p>A key advantage of the tree structure is flexibility. If one of the branches requires special code, we can confine it to that branch, avoiding complicating the remaining branches more than necessary.</p>
<p>Trees also scale better with larger numbers of inputs or options for inputs. A tree might grow overly wide or deep, but we can split it if that becomes a problem.</p>
<p>There is a downside to omitting branches though. If we change our <code>safe-divide</code> function to return different results depending on the dividend when the divisor is zero, our tests might still pass, depending on the specific inputs used, but we will lose test coverage for certain code paths. We have chosen to not test certain input combinations, and we need to be aware of this omission when we are changing the code under test.</p>
<h2 id="tests-as-definitions">Tests as Definitions</h2>
<p>Considering the formula describing the generalised test function above, we could also consider translating this directly into code. This can work, but only if we can test results without re-implementing large parts of the code under test, otherwise we are overly coupling the tests to the code. In the division case, we can decide the sign of the result<span><label for="sn-5"></label><span>Or the existence, for that matter.</span></span> based on the signs of the inputs.</p>

<p>This solution is specific to Clojure, though many other languages have property based testing tools that work similarly.</p>
<p>By adding a spec to our function, we can run a large number of different inputs against our function, and assert a property about the result based on the inputs. It will even shrink the inputs to find the simplest set of inputs to trigger a spec failure.</p>
<p>This means we do not have a programmer writing a matrix or a tree by hand anymore, which has some advantages. The main one being that a programmer might not consider all possible inputs.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The optimal shape of a test depends mainly on the structure of the inputs to the operation we are testing, as well as its nature.</p>
<p>For pure functions which we expect to use widely and change rarely, property-based testing can be desirable to avoid unintended consequences. There is also a certain speed requirement for test shrinking to work effectively.</p>
<p>Operations with a small number of possible inputs can also be tested via test matrices, which have fewer limitations, but do not guarantee …</p></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>In one of my recent training courses, a student informed me that both clang-tidy
and PVS-Studio were complaining about some code of the form</p>

<div><div><pre><code>std::vector&lt;Widget&gt; widgets;
~~~
widgets.push_back(Widget(foo, bar, baz));
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Both tools flagged this line as “bad style.”
clang-tidy even offered a (SARCASM ALERT) helpful fixit:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>warning: use emplace_back instead of push_back [modernize-use-emplace]
    widgets.push_back(Widget(foo, bar, baz));
            ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~             ~
            emplace_back(
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The student dutifully changed the line, and both tools reported their
satisfaction with the replacement:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>widgets.emplace_back(Widget(foo, bar, baz));
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The original line materializes a temporary <code>Widget</code> object on the stack;
takes an rvalue reference to it; and passes that reference to
<code>vector&lt;Widget&gt;::push_back(Widget&amp;&amp;)</code>, which move-constructs a <code>Widget</code>
into the vector. Then we destroy the temporary.</p>

<p>The student’s replacement materializes a temporary <code>Widget</code> object on the stack;
takes an rvalue reference to it; and passes that reference to
<code>vector&lt;Widget&gt;::emplace_back&lt;Widget&gt;(Widget&amp;&amp;)</code>, which move-constructs
a <code>Widget</code> into the vector. Then we destroy the temporary.</p>

<p><em>Absolutely no difference.</em></p>

<p>The change clang-tidy meant to suggest — and in fact <em>did</em> suggest,
if you pay very close attention to the underlining in the fixit — was actually this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>widgets.emplace_back(foo, bar, baz);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This version does <em>not</em> materialize any <code>Widget</code> temporaries. It simply
passes <code>foo, bar, baz</code> to <code>vector&lt;Widget&gt;::emplace_back&lt;Foo&amp;, Bar&amp;, Baz&amp;&gt;(Foo&amp;, Bar&amp;, Baz&amp;)</code>,
which constructs a <code>Widget</code> into the vector using whatever
constructor of <code>Widget</code> best matches that bunch of arguments.</p>

<h2 id="emplace_back-is-not-magic-c11-pixie-dust"><code>emplace_back</code> is not magic C++11 pixie dust</h2>

<p>Even a decade after C++11 was released, I still sometimes see programmers assume
that <code>emplace_back</code> is somehow related to move semantics. (In the same way that
some programmers assume lambdas are somehow the same thing as <code>std::function</code>,
you know?) For example, they’ll rightly observe that this code makes an
unnecessary copy:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>void example() {
    auto w = Widget(1,2,3);
    widgets.push_back(w);  // Copy-constructor alert!
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So they’ll change it to this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>void example() {
    auto w = Widget(1,2,3);
    widgets.emplace_back(w);  // Fixed? Nope!
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The original line constructs a <code>Widget</code> object into <code>w</code>, then
passes <code>w</code> by reference to <code>vector&lt;Widget&gt;::push_back(const Widget&amp;)</code>,
which copy-constructs a <code>Widget</code> into the vector.</p>

<p>The replacement constructs a <code>Widget</code> object into <code>w</code>, then
passes <code>w</code> by reference to <code>vector&lt;Widget&gt;::emplace_back&lt;Widget&amp;&gt;(Widget&amp;)</code>,
which copy-constructs a <code>Widget</code> into the vector.</p>

<p><em>Absolutely no difference.</em></p>

<p>What the student should have done is ask the compiler to make an
<em>rvalue</em> reference to <code>w</code>, by saying either</p>

<div><div><pre><code>widgets.push_back(std::move(w));
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>or</p>

<div><div><pre><code>widgets.emplace_back(std::move(w));
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It doesn’t matter which verb you use; what matters is the value category of
<code>w</code>. You must explicitly mention <code>std::move</code>, so that the language (and the
human reader) understand that you’re done using <code>w</code> and it’s okay for
<code>widgets</code> to pilfer its guts.</p>

<p><code>emplace_back</code> was added to the language at the same time as <code>std::move</code> — just
like lambdas were added at the same time as <code>std::function</code> — but that doesn’t
make them the same thing. <code>emplace_back</code> may “look more C++11-ish,” but it’s
not magic move-enabling pixie dust and it will never insert a move in a place
you don’t explicitly request one.</p>

<h2 id="when-all-else-is-equal-prefer-push_back-to-emplace_back">When all else is equal, prefer <code>push_back</code> to <code>emplace_back</code></h2>

<p>So, given that these two lines do the same thing and are equally efficient
at runtime, which should I prefer, stylistically?</p>

<div><div><pre><code>widgets.push_back(std::move(w));
widgets.emplace_back(std::move(w));
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I recommend sticking with <code>push_back</code> for day-to-day use. You should definitely
use <code>emplace_back</code> when you need its particular set of skills — for example, <code>emplace_back</code>
is your only option when dealing with a <code>deque&lt;mutex&gt;</code> or other non-movable type —
but <code>push_back</code> is the appropriate default.</p>

<p>One reason is that <code>emplace_back</code> is more work for the compiler.
<code>push_back</code> is an overload set of two non-template member functions.
<code>emplace_back</code> is a single variadic template.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>void push_back(const Widget&amp;);
void push_back(Widget&amp;&amp;);

template&lt;class... Ts&gt;
reference emplace_back(Ts&amp;&amp;...);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When you call <code>push_back</code>, the compiler must do overload resolution, but that’s all.
When you call <code>emplace_back</code>, the compiler must do template type deduction, followed
by (easy-peasy) overload resolution, followed by function template instantiation and
code generation. That’s a much larger amount of work for the compiler.</p>

<h2 id="the-benchmark-program">The benchmark program</h2>

<p>I wrote a simple test program to demonstrate the difference in compiler workload.
Of course <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law">Amdahl’s Law</a> applies:
my benchmark displays a massive difference because it’s doing <em>nothing but</em>
instantiating <code>emplace_back</code>, whereas any production codebase will be doing vastly
more other stuff relative to the number of times it instantiates <code>emplace_back</code>.
Still, I hope this benchmark gives you a sense of why I recommend “<code>push_back</code> over
<code>emplace_back</code>” and not vice versa.</p>

<p>This Python 3 script generates the benchmark:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>import sys
print('#include &lt;vector&gt;')
print('#include &lt;string&gt;')
print('extern std::vector&lt;std::string&gt; v;')
for i in range(1000):
    print('void test%d() {' % i)
    print('    v.%s_back("%s");' % (sys.argv[1], 'A' * i))
    print('}')
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Generate like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>python generate.py push &gt;push.cpp
python generate.py emplace &gt;emplace.cpp
time g++ -c push.cpp
time g++ -c emplace.cpp
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With Clang trunk on my laptop, I get consistently about 1.0s for the <code>push</code> version,
and 4.2s for the <code>emplace</code> version. This big difference is due to the fact that the
<code>push</code> version is merely code-generating a thousand <code>test</code> functions, whereas
the <code>emplace</code> version is code-generating that same thousand <code>test</code> functions <em>and</em>
another thousand template instantiations of <code>emplace_back</code> with different parameter
types:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>vector&lt;string&gt;::emplace_back&lt;const char(&amp;)[1]&gt;(const char (&amp;)[1])
vector&lt;string&gt;::emplace_back&lt;const char(&amp;)[2]&gt;(const char (&amp;)[2])
vector&lt;string&gt;::emplace_back&lt;const char(&amp;)[3]&gt;(const char (&amp;)[3])
vector&lt;string&gt;::emplace_back&lt;const char(&amp;)[4]&gt;(const char (&amp;)[4])
~~~
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>See, <code>push_back</code> knows that it expects a <code>string&amp;&amp;</code>, and so it knows to call the
non-explicit constructor <code>string(const char *)</code> on the caller’s side. The same
constructor is called in each case, and the temporary <code>string</code> is passed to
the same overload of <code>push_back</code> in each case. <code>emplace_back</code>, on the other hand,
is a dumb perfect-forwarding template: it doesn’t know that the relevant constructor
overload will end up being <code>string(const char *)</code> in each case. So it takes
an lvalue reference to the specific <em>array type</em> being passed by the caller.
Perfect-forwarding has no special cases for <code>const char *</code>!</p>

<p>If we change <code>vector&lt;string&gt;</code> to <code>vector&lt;const char *&gt;</code>, the compile-time-performance
gap widens: now it’s 0.7s for <code>push</code>, 3.8s for <code>emplace</code>. This is because we’ve cut
out some of the work that was common to both versions (constructing <code>std::string</code> objects)
without affecting the source of the gap (that one version instantiates a
thousand copies of <code>emplace_back</code> and the other doesn’t). Amdahl’s Law in action!</p>

<p>My conclusions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Use <code>push_back</code> by default.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Use <code>emplace_back</code> where it is semantically significant to your algorithm
(such as when the element type’s move-constructor is absent or has been
benchmarked as expensive).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Avoid mixing string literals and perfect-forwarding templates,
especially in repetitive machine-generated code.</p>
</blockquote>

      <p><strong>Ab 2021 können im Kanton Zug Steuerschulden mit Kryptowährungen beglichen werden. Akzeptiert werden die Währungen Bitcoin und Ether. Möglich wird dies dank einer Zusammenarbeit mit Bitcoin Suisse, einer Pionierin im Schweizer Crypto Valley. Zug ist damit der erste Schweizer Kanton, in dem Steuern mit Kryptowährungen bezahlt werden können.</strong></p>
<p>Der Kanton Zug wird seiner Rolle als Vorreiter in den neuen Blockchain-Technologien erneut gerecht und bietet als erster Schweizer Kanton die Möglichkeit an, Steuerschulden mit Kryptowährungen zu bezahlen. Die kantonale Steuerverwaltung akzeptiert dieses neue Zahlungsmittel ab Februar 2021.</p>
<p><strong>Kanton Zug fördert Kryptowährungen<br></strong>Der Kanton Zug beheimatet eine überdurchschnittlich grosse Anzahl Unternehmen aus der Krypto-Branche. «Als Heimat des Crypto Valleys ist es uns wichtig, den Einsatz von Kryptowährungen im Alltag weiter zu fördern und zu vereinfachen», sagt Finanzdirektor Heinz Tännler und fügt an: «Durch die Möglichkeit, Steuerschulden mit Bitcoin oder Ether bezahlen zu können, machen wir einen grossen Schritt in diese Richtung.» Die Steuerbegleichung mittels Kryptowährung wird sowohl Gesellschaften als auch Privatpersonen bis zu einem Forderungsbetrag von 100'000 Franken zur Verfügung stehen. Teilzahlungen werden nicht akzeptiert. In den kommenden Wochen findet ein Pilot statt, um die Prozesse zu testen, damit bis zum nächsten Steuerrechnungslauf im Februar 2021 alles bereit ist.</p>
<p><strong>QR-Code bei Steuerverwaltung beantragen<br></strong>Ermöglicht wird die Steuerbegleichung mit Kryptowährungen durch die Crypto-Payments-Lösung des im Kanton Zug ansässigen Unternehmens Bitcoin Suisse. Wollen Steuerzahlende ihre Rechnung in Kryptowährung bezahlen, können sie dies der Steuerverwaltung mitteilen. Sie erhalten danach den dafür notwendigen QR-Code (i.d.R. per E-Mail) zugestellt. Finanzdirektor Heinz Tännler stellt klar: «Wir gehen mit der neuen Zahlungsmethode kein Risiko ein, da wir den Betrag auch bei einer Bezahlung in Bitcoin oder Ether immer in Schweizer Franken erhalten.» Somit haben auch grössere Schwankungen im Krypto-Wechselkurs keinen Einfluss auf die geleistete Zahlung in Schweizer Franken.</p>
<p><strong>Zusammenarbeit mit Bitcoin Suisse<br></strong>Die Zuger Finanzdirektion hat sich für eine Zusammenarbeit mit dem 2013 gegründeten Unternehmen Bitcoin Suisse entschieden. Bitcoin Suisse bringt in die Partnerschaft mit dem Kanton Zug mehr als sieben Jahre Erfahrung in der Kryptotechnologie und im Zahlungsverkehr ein. Dr. Arthur Vayloyan, CEO von Bitcoin Suisse sagt: «Die Kombination von Handelstechnologie und Zahlungsverkehr mit Kryptowährungen ermöglicht uns, dem Steuerzahler eine gute Benutzererfahrung zu bieten und dem Kanton Zug einen ausgereiften Service zu offerieren.» Bitcoin Suisse hat das Krypto- und Blockchain-Ökosystem in der Schweiz massgeblich geprägt und war eine treibende Kraft bei der Entwicklung des «Crypto Valleys» und der «Crypto Nation Switzerland». Als regulierter Schweizer Finanzintermediär in der Lizenzierungsphase für die Schweizer und Liechtensteinische Banklizenz, bietet Bitcoin Suisse Prime Brokerage, Verwahrung, Crypto Payments, besicherte Darlehen, Staking, Tokenization und andere Krypto-Finanzdienstleistungen für private und institutionelle Kunden an.</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The year is 1721. You are a rich person, and you want to put your
                wealth to use. You are approached by various people who buy goods in
                one part of the world, and sell them in another. They want you to
                finance some of their initial purchase and transportation costs, in
                exchange for a share of the revenue.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, this being 1721, a significant fraction of shipments
                end up on the sea floor, or stolen by pirates, or gets lost to
                corrupt locals.</p>
            <p>You will be presented with a few shipments to finance, of varying
                value, ordered from low to high. They all have the same return
                relative to financing cost – your job is just to pick the most
                attractively sized suggestion.</p>
            <p>All proposed shipments have one thing in common: they will need to
                pass through a specific strait. This is critical information for
                your decision: different straits have different probabilities of
                losing the goods.</p>

            <p>You will have to consider three straits. Their true probability of
                success is unknown (and varies whenever you restart the game) but
                you get an estimation for each as a hint.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bering</strong>: Very dangerous. Probability of success
                    is around 50&nbsp;%. Shipments through Bering strait
                    often have a high payoff as a result.</li>
                <li><strong>Malacca</strong>: Somewhat unsafe. Probability of
                    success is estimated to be between 60&nbsp;% and 80&nbsp;%.</li>
                <li><strong>Gibraltar</strong>: Very safe. Probability of success
                    unknown, but it seems to be over 90&nbsp;%, maybe even as high
                    as 100&nbsp;%. These shipments have relatively low payoff.</li>
            </ul>
        </div><p>I've been lazy with dependencies. Please wait while

<p><em>This is a guest post from Perry Tiu. Enjoy.</em></p>



<p>Dear New Developer,</p>



<p>Ask for great hardware.</p>



<p>Ask for that latest MacBook. Ask for that extra built-in 2TB of flash storage. Ask for that 32-inch monitor. Ask for that additional vertical monitor. Ask for that standing desk. Ask for that Aeron chair. Ask for that expensive USB-C hub. Ask for that ergonomic keyboard.</p>



<p>Now you may be thinking that you don’t want to be perceived as a burden to the company, or that you’re coming off as greedy and needy. I get it. If you had to purchase all of this yourself, it would surely be an unpleasant hole in your pocket. We all get it.</p>



<p>Fortunately in the bigger picture, this amount is actually minimal for companies compared to all the other costs related to hiring a new developer (salary, staff hours spent on interviewing individuals, etc). Most well-run companies regularly take into account these costs as they grow and there are many reasons why they are willing to invest in their staff’s developer experience. </p>



<p>One of the more obvious reasons is improving efficiency and productivity: having a laptop with an additional monitor setup is generally better than without. Interestingly, there are also indirect, not exactly tech-related, benefits. For example, being able to satisfy a developer’s needs improves work satisfaction, which contributes to employee retention. As long as you justify using the amazing hardware at your disposal, the return of investment in the long run far outweighs the cost of the hardware.</p>



<p>So ask away, treat yourself and embrace what modern technology has to offer. Your company should be there to help you grow in your role so don’t be shy. But more importantly: <strong>share your experience</strong>. Let people know what works for you, what doesn’t. Countless times have I learned new quality-of-life improvements just from hearing or seeing someone else live it. Not only will your peers and friends appreciate the discussion, it is also a collective push to improve each other’s developer experience.</p>



<p>Oh and it is harder to ask for upgrades down the road than when you just joined.</p>



<p>Sincerely written on an outdated machine,</p>



<p>Perry</p>

March 3, 2021 | https://remyhax.xyz/posts/bitsquatting-windows/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://remyhax.xyz/posts/bitsquatting-windows/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure><img src="https://remyhax.xyz/image/dns.jpg"></figure><p>Earlier this month, I came back around to seriously considering an attempt at <a href="http://dinaburg.org/bitsquatting.html">bitsquatting</a>. While the prior link goes into great depth on the topic, I will attempt to give a <em>very</em> high level overview here:</p><p>If this sort of thing interests you: I tend to do stuff like this weekly. Give me a follow <a href="https://twitter.com/_mattata">@_mattata</a></p><p>When you try to access a site by it’s domain, that domain is stored in the memory of your computer, device, whatever… in a structure that looks something like this.</p><table><thead><tr><th>01110111</th><th>01101001</th><th>01101110</th><th>01100100</th><th>01101111</th><th>01110111</th><th>01110011</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>w</td><td>i</td><td>n</td><td>d</td><td>o</td><td>w</td><td>s</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Now let’s say that the computer is running too hot, a solar flare is happening, or a cosmic ray (very real thing) flips a bit on the computer.</p><table><thead><tr><th>01110111</th><th>01101000</th><th>01101110</th><th>01100100</th><th>01101111</th><th>01110111</th><th>01110011</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>w</td><td><strong>h</strong></td><td>n</td><td>d</td><td>o</td><td>w</td><td>s</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Oh no! Now the value stored in memory is w<strong>h</strong>ndows.com instead of windows.com! When the time comes to make a connection to that domain, what happens?</p><blockquote><p>nslookup whndows.com</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>*** can’t find whndows.com: Non-existent domain</p></blockquote><p>The domain doesn’t resolve to an IP!</p><hr><p>In fact, out of the 32 valid domain names that are 1-bitflip away from windows.com 14 were available for purchase! This is a rather odd occurance as usually these are bought up by a company like Microsoft to prevent their use for phishing attempts. So I bought them. All of them. For ~$126.</p><p>(<em>If you’re a verifiably responsible party, I’m more than happy to transfer ownership of the domains. Otherwise, I’ll just hold on to them and continue to sinkhole.</em>)</p><blockquote><p>windnws.com
windo7s.com
windkws.com
windmws.com
winlows.com
windgws.com
wildows.com
wintows.com
wijdows.com
wiodows.com
wifdows.com
whndows.com
wkndows.com
wmndows.com</p></blockquote><p>Now we need to point these domains somewhere. So I rent a VPS and configure IPv4/IPv6, and create wildcard DNS entries to point to them.</p><p>Wildcard DNS works so that if I create a record saying that whndows.com points to 123.123.123.123 and someone requests abs.xyz.whndows.com, they will still get the same 123.123.123.123 DNS record as a reply. Due to the nature of this research dealing with bits being flipped, this allows me to capture any DNS lookup for a subdomain of windows.com where multiple bits have flipped.</p><p>Once we have DNS configured, we use <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/tshark.html">tshark</a> to perform a packet capture on the public interface of our VPS and wait for something interesting to happen.</p><p>Below is a short snippet of some interesting things that can be shared without uniquely indentifying any users.</p><p>Usage of <strong><a href="https://greynoise.io/tech">GreyNoise.io</a></strong> was key in helping to differentiate between opportunistic scanning and actual bitflip scenarios. Great product!</p><h2 id="ntp-udp-port-123-timewindowscom">NTP UDP port 123 time.windows.com</h2><p>UDP packets destined for port 123 attempting to set their computer clock using the Network Time Protocol (NTP).
time.windows.com is the default NTP server configured for all Windows machines and they check for the time regularly. If they don’t succeed in getting the time, they try again, and again, and again.</p><p>In total, over the course of 14 days, my server recieved <strong>199,180 NTP Client connections from 626 unique IP addresses.</strong></p><p>The NTP client for windows OS has no inherent verification of authenticity, so there is nothing stopping a malicious person from telling all these computers that it’s after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem">03:14:07 on Tuesday, 19 January 2038</a> and wreaking unknown havoc as the memory storing the signed 32-bit integer for time overflows.</p><p>As it turns out though, for ~30% of these computers doing that would make little to no difference at all to those users because their clock is already <em>broken</em>.</p><p>Using the tshark filter “ntp.xmt” we can extract the Transmit Timestamp, which is the time that the computer thinks it is when it asks to update the time.</p><blockquote><p>tshark -r capture.pcap -T fields -e ntp.xmt -2 -R ntp.xmt | sort -u</p></blockquote><pre><code>Sep 28, 1984 19:41:12.638290998 EDT

The very name, Silicon Valley, comes from the birth of the semiconductor industry in the San Francisco bay area 60+ years ago. Large percentage of venture financing used to go to semiconductor startups, even as recently as 15 years ago. As a chip designer doing startups in the late ‘90s and early 2000s in the San Francisco bay area, I felt as if there was a semi startup on every street corner.</p><p>Not so much in the last 10 years. Maturing industry, high capital requirements, and dwindling exits have caused a huge decline in funding for semiconductor startups. The narrative of Silicon Valley moved to consumer internet and software-led businesses. Remember, software is eating the world. But in the last few years, we have seen a slow but steady resurgence of semiconductor startups and witnessed blockbuster financing and acquisitions. So, are semiconductor startups on the comeback trail? Or is it a mirage?</p><p>First, it is important to separate semiconductor startups from the overall semiconductor industry. Globally, the market for semiconductor products has been growing for several decades and in recent years led by growth in computers, smartphones, consumer electronics, and automotive and industrial electronics. Computers have gotten powerful, phones have faster internet speeds, consumer gadgets have gotten smaller – all because of the technological advances in semiconductors.</p><div><figure><img width="1024" height="497" src="https://www.karthee.vc/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Global-Semi-Sales-1024x497.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.karthee.vc/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Global-Semi-Sales-1024x497.jpg 1024w, https://www.karthee.vc/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Global-Semi-Sales-300x146.jpg 300w, https://www.karthee.vc/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Global-Semi-Sales-768x373.jpg 768w, https://www.karthee.vc/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Global-Semi-Sales-1536x745.jpg 1536w, https://www.karthee.vc/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Global-Semi-Sales.jpg 1628w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://www.karthee.vc/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Global-Semi-Sales-1024x497.jpg" data-srcset="https://www.karthee.vc/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Global-Semi-Sales-1024x497.jpg 1024w, https://www.karthee.vc/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Global-Semi-Sales-300x146.jpg 300w, https://www.karthee.vc/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Global-Semi-Sales-768x373.jpg 768w, https://www.karthee.vc/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Global-Semi-Sales-1536x745.jpg 1536w, https://www.karthee.vc/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Global-Semi-Sales.jpg 1628w"><figcaption>Source: “2020 State of the US Semiconductor Industry” from SIA</figcaption></figure></div><p>In a large growing market with improving technology why is there no place for new startups? While semiconductor is maturing as an industry, it is hardly a commoditized market with no place for innovation.</p><p>Well, structurally a few things happened:</p><ul type="1"><li>Cleantech, one of the prominent semiconductor sectors, had flopped badly, losing lots of capital for investors.</li><li>The technological advances made in internet infrastructure and mobile technologies led to a boom in the software application ecosystem across social, mobile, and cloud, moving entrepreneurial interest away from semiconductors.</li><li>China emerged as a large supplier of semiconductors, thus increasing competition while driving down premiums in the market.</li><li>Huge waves of consolidation happened in publicly traded semiconductor companies.</li></ul><p>Most sectors go through these phenomena – they are nothing new. When this happens, newer innovations kickstart the next disruption cycle. Why didn’t it happen with semi startups?</p><p>Well, the success of a startup ecosystem rests on the number and variety of experiments that are attempted. The more experiments across a wider variety of areas, the better the chances for a breakout success. For semiconductor startups, two main issues slowed down these experiments:</p><ul><li>It takes roughly $30M of financing to even get to a product and another $100M or more to get to volume production.</li><li>Buyer universe is limited because of the public market consolidation. The reduced list of buyers meant smaller acquisition premiums and smaller exits.</li></ul><p>Huge capital costs combined with a small buyer universe and small exits don’t make for an attractive investment area. Combine this with harder macro trend, we saw a vicious cycle of diminishing interest and funding in semiconductor startups.</p><p>Things have started turning around over the last few years. Since 2017, investments in semiconductor startups have increased significantly. So, what happened?</p><p>One of the main reasons is the explosion of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Innovative semiconductor products were required to meet the computing demand of AI. Advances in AI and Computer Vision helped make huge strides in autonomous vehicles and autonomous platforms. That drove demand for specialized semiconductor sensors and processor architectures.</p><p>The cost of building semiconductor products has come down significantly, especially if you are not operating at the cutting edge of semiconductor manufacturing processes. Most semiconductor products do not require these advanced processes. Today, you can build a first-generation semiconductor chip with $10M or less. That is lot less than $30M.</p><p>Expanding buyer universe – Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon, and other large internet and software companies have started building semiconductors for their internal use and consumer products. They have become new acquirers of semiconductor startups.</p><p>US-China trade tensions have centered around semiconductors and there has been an increased focus on self-sufficiency and nationalization. This has driven demand for US semiconductor suppliers. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-supply-chains-governors/eight-auto-state-governors-urge-biden-to-press-semiconductor-firms-on-chip-shortage-idUSKBN2AQ2MI">Chip shortages facing the automotive industry</a> is driving home the point of self sufficiency.</p><p>All these factors have driven huge investments and exits in Semiconductors recently. Just a few examples:</p><ul><li>Qualcomm acquired a two-year-old semiconductor startup, <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/01/13/qualcomm-will-acquire-nuvia-server-cpu-maker-led-by-ex-apple-chip-architect/">Nuvia for $1.4B</a></li><li>Automotive Sensor Semiconductor companies, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/lidar-startup-luminar-to-go-public-via-3-4-billion-spac-merger/">Luminar</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/02/lidar-startup-aeva-to-go-public-via-2-1-billion-spac-merger/">Aeva</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/aeye-becomes-latest-lidar-company-to-go-public-via-spac/">Aeye</a>, <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2020/12/22/lidar-startup-ouster-go-public-1-9b-spac-merger/">Ouster</a> and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-11/lidar-startup-innoviz-to-go-public-in-1-4-billion-spac-deal">Innoviz</a> all going public at valuation of $1B or more.</li><li>Investments flowing into semiconductor startups focused on AI, Quantum computing, Robotics, and others.</li></ul><p>So, are semiconductor startups back for good? As new areas come up including Quantum computing, Space technologies, Computational biology …&nbsp; the need for innovation and newer semiconductor products is on the rise. I remain bullish that the resurgence we have seen in semiconductor startups is here to stay. And once again, the name, Silicon Valley, will fit its description.</p><hr></div><!-- .entry-content .clear --></div></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
      

<p>Given that the Psyche-C compiler frontend is being renewed, I decided to start a blog about the project. This is my first post.</p>

<p>Without further ado, consider this C program (assume that its name is <code>test.c</code>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>v</span><span>,</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>d</span><span>);</span>

<span>int</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>p</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>p</span> <span>==</span> <span>v</span><span>)</span>
        <span>return</span><span>(</span><span>p</span> <span>-</span> <span>1</span><span>);</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To produce and dump an AST with Psyche-C, we invoke the <em>cnippet</em> driver adaptor with command line option <code>--C-dump-AST</code>. The output is as follows:</p>

<p><img width="609" alt="Screen Shot 2021-03-03 at 20 56 16" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2905588/109888794-e8d75f00-7c62-11eb-98bc-c62247df0c3e.png"></p>

<p>Now, I’ll briefly correlate the above AST with the one produced by <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/">Clang</a> for the same <code>test.c</code> program. Let’s take a look at it:</p>

<p><img width="789" alt="Screen Shot 2021-03-03 at 21 03 44" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2905588/109889407-17096e80-7c64-11eb-9ecd-b0bd56af902e.png"></p>

<p>Apart from the colors and extra decoration, what are the main differences between the two?</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>It’s that Psyche-C’s AST is a bit closer to the grammar of C.</em> For instance, you can’t see <em>declarator</em>s in Clang’s AST, they are absorbed by their containing <em>declaration</em>s.</li>
</ul>

<p>Whether or not this characteristic is good or bad will depend on a given application. For the purpose of static analysis implementation, I consider the refined syntax insights of Psyche-C’s AST an advantage.</p>

<p>I’m not saying that every <em>node</em> in a AST should correspond to a <em>terminal</em> of the grammar. If so, we’d end up with a rather <strong>concrete</strong> syntax (or parse) tree, instead of an <strong>abstract</strong> syntax tree. A comprehensible AST will contain just enough of a language’s meaning embedded into it. (The AST produced by the <a href="https://github.com/ltcmelo/psychec/tree/original">old parser of Psyche-C</a>, e.g., was too grammar-oriented.)</p>

<p>Consider this snippet from our <code>test.c</code> program:</p>



<p>In Clang’s AST, it’s represented through a <code>VarDecl</code> and a <code>FunctionDecl</code>; both these nodes <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/doxygen/classclang_1_1DeclaratorDecl.html">inherit from</a> <code>DeclaratorDecl</code> (i.e., a <em>declaration</em> with a <em>declarator</em>). But, in pedantic terms, that representation isn’t quite correct, given that a single <em>declaration</em> — one starting at <code>int</code> and ending at <code>;</code> — exists in that snippet.</p>

<p>In Psyche-C, I opted for a more rigorous representation in the AST:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A <code>VariableAndOrFunctionDeclaration</code> is created (just like Clang, this node <a href="https://ltcmelo.github.io/psychec/api-docs/html/classpsy_1_1_c_1_1_variable_and_or_function_declaration_syntax.html">inherits from</a> a <code>DeclaratorDeclaration</code>) with two child nodes: an <code>IdentifierDeclarator</code>, designating object of type <code>int</code>, and a <code>FunctionDeclarator</code>, designating a function whose return type is <code>int</code>. This choice makes the AST rewritable with accuracy as well.</li>
</ul>

<p>In general, the design “spirit” of Psyche-C’s AST is more aligned with that of <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn">Roslyn</a>, the .NET compiler platform. Although, because Psyche-C is a frontend for C, its AST will, of course, resembles that of Clang.</p>

<p>To wrap up, I’ll leave a C# version of <code>test.c</code> (well, <code>test.cs</code>), together with its AST.</p>

Like many other false starts in cutting-edge research, the patent may represent the next step in the expanding theory, or it could mean the practical, real-world design of a functioning warp drive is on the horizon.</span></p>
<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Background: How to Bend Space-Time with A Warp Drive</span></strong></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">After</span><a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0264-9381/11/5/001" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;first publishing</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;his groundbreaking 1994 warp drive concept in the journal Classical and Quantum Gravity, Mexican Mathematician and Physicist Miguel Alcubierre received significant positive and negative feedback. Most applauded his solution, which did indeed appear to create a working theory on how a warp drive might allow faster than light travel without violating the laws of physics. In contrast,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.space.com/17628-warp-drive-possible-interstellar-spaceflight.html#:~:text=Warp%20Drive%20May%20Be%20More%20Feasible%20Than%20Thought%2C%20Scientists%20Say&amp;text=Now%20physicists%20say%20that%20adjustments,of%20science%20fiction%20into%20science." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">others zeroed in</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;on the incredible amount of energy needed to propel his theoretical spacecraft.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><br>
The warp drive was further refined in 2007 by engineer H. David Froning Jr., who, among other things, previously worked for the U.S. Air Force, Boeing, and McDonnell Douglas. He</span><a href="https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.57491" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;published those refinements</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;in 2008 and later released a</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081NV86G7/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;2019 book</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;on his research.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Both theories took a giant leap forward in 2011 when</span><a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20110015936" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;a paper published</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;by NASA scientist Harold G. “Sonny” White further improved upon Alcubierre’s designs, dramatically reducing the amount of exotic matter needed to fuel the hypothetical drive from a Jupiter sized amount&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.space.com/17628-warp-drive-possible-interstellar-spaceflight.html#:~:text=Warp%20Drive%20May%20Be%20More%20Feasible%20Than%20Thought%2C%20Scientists%20Say&amp;text=Now%20physicists%20say%20that%20adjustments,of%20science%20fiction%20into%20science." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">to something akin to the</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;size of the NASA Voyager 1 probe. While this is still a significant volume and well beyond our current ability to manufacture, this dramatic reduction in fuel requirements seems to indicate that a real-world warp drive may one day be feasible.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">One practical attempt to build a drive is being made by Nebraska University Adjunct Professor David Pares and his company, </span><a href="http://paresspacewarpresearch.org/2019/03/27/space-warp-research/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Space Warp Dynamics</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. He posted a</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvEkQXbYds&amp;fbclid=IwAR2OIAOSN7hs0UBWUovJOQr4FMjfMVPEATbOf34m03h9kfO5Ip_HUqTsm4U" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;recent series of tests</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> to YouTube; however, his company’s </span><a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/space-warp-drive#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Indiegogo campaign to build such a device</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;has only reached 3% of the target goal. Their website and</span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/SWarpDynamics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;Facebook</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;pages show only incremental advancements since. Interestingly, the</span><a href="http://paresspacewarpresearch.org/2019/03/27/space-warp-research/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;company’s website notes</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;that Pares was “Inspired by his own craft sighting, at the age of 16,” although no other details of this sighting are provided. Apart from that, little is known about this project.</span></p>

<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Analysis: The New 2020 Warp Drive Patent</span></strong></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In April of 2020, two engineers from Chicago, Jessica Gallanis and Eytan Halm Suchard</span><a href="https://www.freepatentsonline.com/y2020/0130870.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;published a patent application</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;for a drive using the updated Harold White designs. A device aptly named the Alcubierre-White Warp Drive. Barely a month into the COVID 19 shutdown, the patent’s publication seemed to sneak under the radar, with a</span><a href="http://readmultiplex.com/2020/12/22/patent-application-alcubierre-white-warp-drive-machine/?fbclid=IwAR0_vLd_-oFPI7Fql4zjMBRX0kt3k6yAjg_sSLU48vg7UXBcZAGlkFu2XcM" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;lone report</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;by&nbsp;</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Read Multiplex</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;in December of 2020 (one that sits behind a paywall).</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In the summary portion of the patent, Gallanis and Suchard explain how “the invention uses two Alcubierre gravitational walls to achieve a warp drive effect as means of propulsion while surrounding or enclosing a cavity or space where passengers can travel.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This design is consistent with Alcubierre, who’s solution they point out “suggested a method for changing the metric of space-time and creating a space-time warp bubble such that while from outside the bubble, the bubble can advance in superluminal speed, from within the bubble the speed is much lower than the speed of light.”</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The patent also notes the work of Froning, who they say observed how, “if sufficient warping is achieved, ship speed is slower than light speed within the region that surrounds it-even if it is moving faster-than-light with respect to Earth.”</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“I had never personally heard of the Alcubierre drive until 2013,” Suchard admitted on a two-hour telephone interview with&nbsp;</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Debrief to&nbsp;</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">discuss his device, how the design came about, and how realistic building his patented Warp Drive was.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A software engineer by trade, Suchard was working on handwriting and signature recognition software when he had a revelation that would lead to his patented design.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“It occurred to me that we should be able to describe all physical phenomena as geometry. And that space-time was merely an emergent property, which is diametrically opposed to [Albert] Einstein’s approach.”</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Israeli-born engineer said this revelation launched him into a more in-depth study of things like dark matter, loop theory, quantum gravity, and ultimately, to the idea of a warp drive.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“I first stumbled across Alcubierre in 2013,” Suchard explained, a discovery that led to him spending the next three years trying to rectify his new take on classical physics with Dr. White’s theory. “I knew from my own calculations that energy itself must create gravity, and by extension anti-gravity,” he said. “And that this had to be the solution to Alcubierre.”</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">By 2017, Suchard’s wife and fellow engineer Jessica Gallanis told him that his theoretical work was sound, and it was time to try to file a patent. Unfortunately, the first try was unsuccessful. “They wouldn’t take it,” he said of the response by the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.uspto.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">United States Patent and Trademark Office</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;(USPTO). “I think they didn’t understand the physics.”</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Suchard said he spent the next two years going back and forth with the USPTO until, in 2020, they finally made a concession. “By then, they did not refute the fact that the patent is based upon a valid working theory, but still said I would need a physical device to prove the physics.” As a result of this concession, they accepted the application, leading to the 2020 publication.</span></p>

<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Outlook: Has History Been Made?</span></strong></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">When asked where his patent will go from here, Suchard was particularly critical in his response. “I don’t trust anyone else to do the experiments,” he said, “because too many do them in the wrong way.” To do those experiments, Suchard also admits that his expertise is not enough. “I would need other physicists involved. An RF engineer, a materials scientist, and many others with expertise in [areas like] heat dissipation, x-rays, and other related fields.”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Debrief</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;reached out to Dr. Jason Cassibry, a professor at the Propulsion Research Center at the University of Alabama Huntsville. He, and one of his students,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/ywaxeb/this-student-is-one-of-the-top-scientists-studying-faster-than-light-warp-drives" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Joseph Agnew</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, a researcher at the Propulsion Research Center, explained that there were problems with Suchard’s theory.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Cassibry and Agnew told&nbsp;</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Debrief</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;in an email that the use of highly concentrated magnetic fields to create gravity wells is a common aspect of warp drive theory.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“I’ve seen a number of people try to relate high-frequency electrical oscillations to warp drive. Based on some of the papers I’ve looked at, there is indeed a relation between highly concentrated magnetic field energy, like in a huge solenoid, and a positive gravity well. But the amount of energy required to be detectable is quite large, and, although doable, that experiment has not been run yet,” Agnew explained.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Agnew explained that the biggest problem is the “‘negative energy or ‘anti-gravity well'” part of the system that makes it an Alcubierre drive and not just a gravity well. Both Agnew and Cassibry concurred that aspects of the patent did jive with previous warp drive models; however, since there was no experimental data, it would be impossible to determine if the drive would work.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“I’m skeptical,” Agnew stated, “since it cites as-yet-unobserved phenomena as its basis for operation.”</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Dr. Cassibry echoed Agnew’s sentiment, adding, “I hope that someday, someone discloses an invention or a technology along with a demonstration of a real system, such as a video of a working propulsion system lifting itself off the ground, no strings attached. Short of that, experimental measurements, even on a subscale test, are highly valuable and encouraged. Short of experimental evidence, I will remain skeptical of any and all papers and patents.”</span></p>
<p><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Debrief&nbsp;</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">reached out to the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/ames" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">NASA Ames Research Center</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;for comment from Dr. White on this potentially groundbreaking patent and any work he may still be doing in this field. Their representative told&nbsp;</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Debrief</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;that White retired from the organization last year. They also indicated that the warp mechanics program he ran at Ames is no longer in operation as it was shuttered at the same time he left.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Debrief</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;tried to contact Dr. Whte at his new venture, the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.limitlessspace.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Limitless Space Institute</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, which appears to be continuing his Warp Drive research. They did not respond to requests for comment.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The patent by Suchard and Gallanis is still awaiting approval, and it is an approval Suchard is not expecting any time soon. Still, he says, the theory is sound, and if he were able to put together the team of experts he envisions, he thinks building a warp drive may be possible. Like most potential breakthrough propulsion theories, Suchard’s take on energy and gravity is unique. Still, unlike Alcubierre and White, he has taken that theory to the next step with an actual patent application. Time will tell if it ever leads to the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://thedebrief.org/no-china-did-not-build-a-time-machine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">real thing</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, but the work by other researchers in the field and the improvements to Alcubierre’s original theory made along the way may mean that warp speed may be closer than we think.</span></p>

<h2>It Can Happen to You</h2>
<p>A few days ago, a <a href="https://nee.lv/2021/02/28/How-I-cut-GTA-Online-loading-times-by-70/">fascinating article</a>
about Grand Theft Auto Online
made the rounds of the tech news ecosystem.</p>
<p>I'd encourage you to read the whole thing, but in short,
GTA Online had <a href="https://accidentallyquadratic.tumblr.com/">accidentally quadratic</a>
performance when parsing a large JSON blob
(due to repeated calls to <code>strlen</code>);
fixing this improved loading time by almost 70%.</p>
<p>This sparked a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26296339">great deal</a> of discussion:
Was this C's fault?
Perhaps <a href="https://twitter.com/Jonathan_Blow/status/1366452792563359744">"web shit"</a>?
<a href="https://twitter.com/fasterthanlime/status/1366187333507293184">Capitalism and incentives</a>?</p>
<p>Still, folks in the comments section generally agreed:
<em>they</em> wouldn't write anything that silly.</p>
<p>(<em>do you feel the foreshadowing?</em>)</p>
<hr>
<p>One of my side projects is a high-performance 3D viewer named <a href="https://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/erizo">Erizo</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.mattkeeter.com/blog/2021-03-01-happen/porsche.png" alt="Porsche"></p>
<p>Thanks to a lot of careful programming, it will open a 97 MB binary STL
file in about 165 milliseconds flat, on a <em>2013</em> Macbook Pro.
This is <strong>blinding</strong> fast.</p>
<p>In the interest of compatibility, I wrote a small parser for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)#ASCII_STL">ASCII STLs</a> as well.</p>
<p>ASCII STLs are a poorly-specified plain-text format that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>solid cube_corner
          facet normal 0.0 -1.0 0.0
            outer loop
              vertex 0.0 0.0 0.0
              vertex 1.0 0.0 0.0
              vertex 0.0 0.0 1.0
            endloop
          endfacet
          facet normal 0.0 0.0 -1.0
            outer loop
              vertex 0.0 0.0 0.0
              vertex 0.0 1.0 0.0
              vertex 1.0 0.0 0.0
            endloop
          endfacet
          ...
endsolid
</code></pre>
<p>I wrote an extremely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle">robust</a>
parser, described in a comment as</p>
<pre><code>/*  The most liberal ASCII STL parser:  Ignore everything except
 *  the word 'vertex', then read three floats after each one. */
</code></pre>
<p>Loading ASCII STLs always seemed a little slow, but I assumed
that's what you get for using an inefficient textual format.</p>
<p>(<em>foreshadowing intensifies</em>)</p>
<hr>
<p>Over the course of a few days, several things happened:</p>
<ul>
<li>I revisited Erizo for the first time in a few years to fix a <a href="https://github.com/mkeeter/erizo/commit/d4683f94a4aa0b674bdde0fa53fb6f92d6e1979c">focus issue on macOS</a></li>
<li>The GTA Online article was published</li>
<li>In a follow-up discussion, I learned that
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26302744">parsing could be quadratic due to repeated calls to <code>sscanf</code></a></li>
<li>I noticed that ASCII STL loading was <em>really quite</em> slow.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's the timestamped logs (in seconds), loading a 1.5 MB ASCII STL:</p>
<pre><code>[erizo] (0.000000) main.c:10      | Startup!
[erizo] (0.162895) window.c:91    | Created window

[erizo] (1.821291) instance.c:32  | Showed window
</code></pre>
<p>From startup to showing the window, it took over 1.8 seconds!</p>
<p>Looking at the ASCII parser with fresh eyes, the cause was glaringly obvious:</p>
<pre><code>    /*  The most liberal ASCII STL parser:  Ignore everything except
     *  the word 'vertex', then read three floats after each one. */
    const char VERTEX_STR[] = "vertex ";
    while (1) {
        data = strstr(data, VERTEX_STR);
        if (!data) {
            break;
        }

        /* Skip to the first character after 'vertex' */
        data += strlen(VERTEX_STR);

        for (unsigned i=0; i &lt; 3; ++i) {
            SKIP_WHILE(isspace);
            float f;
            const int r = sscanf(data, "%f", &amp;f);
            ABORT_IF(r == 0 || r == EOF, "Failed to parse float");
            if (buf_size == buf_count) {
                buf_size *= 2;
                buffer = (float*)realloc(buffer, buf_size * sizeof(float));
            }
            buffer[buf_count++] = f;

            SKIP_WHILE(!isspace);
        }
    }
</code></pre>
<p>You may notice <code>sscanf</code>, happily sitting there, reading a single float off
the front of the data stream and <strong>checking the length of the whole string each time</strong>.</p>
<p>Yes, I had made the exact same mistake as the programmers working on GTA Online:
I had an accidentally quadratic parser!</p>
<p>Replacing the <code>sscanf</code> call with <code>strtof</code> improved startup by nearly a factor of
10: from 1.8 seconds to 199 milliseconds.</p>
<pre><code>[erizo] (0.000000) main.c:10      | Startup!
[erizo] (0.178082) window.c:91    | Created window

<p>This is back down in the noise of
"how long does the OS take to give us an OpenGL context",
which is a great place for a high-performance tool.</p>
<hr>
<p>As someone that has been programming for many years,
this was a perfectly-timed reminder that there are <em>always</em> pitfalls out there.
The <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=cpp/io/c/fscanf&amp;oldid=125683">documentation for <code>sscanf</code></a>
does not include a time complexity,
so this is particularly tricky <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/footgun">footgun</a>,
and I'm sure it's not the only one lurking in the darkness.</p>
<p>You may not get such a perfectly-timed reminder, but it's worth remembering –
next time you read a fascinating story about bad programming –
that it <em>can</em> happen to you!</p>
<p>(Obviously, the moral of the story is to not use <code>sscanf</code> to repeatedly
parse single tokens off the front of a string; I'm sure you'll do <em>fine</em>
if you can just avoid <strong>that</strong>)</p>

March 3, 2021 | https://blog.min.io/object_storage_as_a_service_on_minio/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.min.io/object_storage_as_a_service_on_minio/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
                    <p>Object storage as a service is the hottest concept in storage today. The reason is straightforward: object storage is the storage class of the cloud and the ability to provision it seamlessly to applications or developers makes it immensely valuable to enterprises of any size. <br></p><p>The challenge is that object storage as a service has traditionally been very difficult to deliver. Overly complex, hard to tune for performance, prone to failure at scale etc. While systems like Kubernetes offer powerful tools for automating the deployment and management of these systems, the overall problem of <em>complexity</em> remains unsolved as administrators must still invest significant time and effort to deploy even a small scale object storage resource.<br></p><p>By combining Kubernetes with our new Operator and our Operator Console graphical user interface, MinIO is changing that dynamic in a big way. It should be stated upfront that MinIO has always obsessed over simplicity. It permeates everything we do, every design decision we make, every line of code we write.</p><p>Nonetheless, we saw even more opportunity for simplification. To do this we created the MinIO Operator and the MinIO kubectl plugin to facilitate the deployment and management of MinIO Object Storage on Kubernetes. While the Operator commands were critical for users already proficient with Kubernetes, we also wanted to address a wider audience so we created a Graphical User Interface for the Operator and incorporated it into our new MinIO Operator Console to enable anyone in the organization to create, deploy and manage object storage as a service.</p><p>Kubernetes is the platform of the Internet. Given its massive adoption, we chose to remain consistent with the Kubernetes way of doing things. This meant not using any specialized tools or services to setup MinIO. <br></p><p>The effect is that the MinIO Operator works on any Kubernetes distribution, be it OpenShift, vSphere 7.0u1, Rancher or stock upstream. Further, MinIO will work on any public cloud provider such as Amazon's EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Engine), Google's GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine), Google's Anthos or Azure's AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service). <br></p><p>Pretty much all you need to get started on any distribution of Kubernetes is some storage device that can be presented to Kubernetes either via Local Persistent Volumes or with a CSI Driver.<br></p><p>Let’s start with a review on using MinIO with the kubectl plugin and a kustomize based approach. You'll need to install the kubectl tool on a computer with network access to the Kubernetes cluster. See <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/">Install and Set Up kubectl</a> for installation instructions.

<p>A few days ago I obtained a malfunctioning dive computer along with some other SCUBA gear and decided to do another teardown. This one proved a bit more interesting since none of the chips were blobbed over. (See my <a href="http://www.chrisgreenley.com/projects/dive-comp-teardown">previous teardown</a> of a Genesis ReSource dive computer.)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.chrisgreenley.com/projects/dive-comp-teardown-versa-pro/pdfs/versa_pro_manual.pdf">Versa Pro Manual</a></p>

<h4 id="teardown">Teardown</h4>

<p>First step, remove the battery. It turns out the hard plastic cover with the copper layers both provides the surface for the o-ring to fit around, and is a piezo buzzer/speaker (more about that later).</p>

<p><br>
<img src="http://www.chrisgreenley.com/projects/dive-comp-teardown-versa-pro/teardown-1.jpg" alt="">
<br></p>

<p>The outer metal covering pops off easily with a small flathead screwdriver to pry the clips apart. The grey plastic ring underneath just slides off.</p>

<p><br>
<img src="http://www.chrisgreenley.com/projects/dive-comp-teardown-versa-pro/teardown-2.jpg" alt="">
<br></p>

<p>With that, the plastic covering the LCD screen comes right out, along with the o-ring.</p>

<p><br>
<img src="http://www.chrisgreenley.com/projects/dive-comp-teardown-versa-pro/teardown-3.jpg" alt="">
<br></p>

<p>And now the screen/circuit board module lifts out. You can see all the little springs which connect the circuit up to the external contacts.</p>

<p><br>
<img src="http://www.chrisgreenley.com/projects/dive-comp-teardown-versa-pro/teardown-4.jpg" alt="">
<br></p>

<p>The screen unclips from the circuit board with three little tabs.</p>

<p><br>
<img src="http://www.chrisgreenley.com/projects/dive-comp-teardown-versa-pro/teardown-5.jpg" alt="">
<br></p>

<p>The LCD itself is in the lower left. The polywELD object in the upper left is an electro-luminescent (EL) light which forms the backlight. In the upper right corner you can see two pieces of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastomeric_connector">zebra connector</a> which connect the LCD screen (the long piece) and the EL light (the short piece) to the circuit board.</p>

<p><br>
<img src="http://www.chrisgreenley.com/projects/dive-comp-teardown-versa-pro/teardown-6.jpg" alt="">
<br></p>

<h4 id="the-circuit">The Circuit</h4>

<p>Below you can see labels for all the main components of the circuit. Most of these will be discussed in more detail further down this post.</p>

<p>A closeup to show the text on the EEPROM chip.</p>

<p><br>
<img src="http://www.chrisgreenley.com/projects/dive-comp-teardown-versa-pro/eeprom.jpg" alt="">
<br></p>

<p>The reverse side of the PCB. Note the pads which connect to the springs I pointed out before.</p>

<p><br>
<img src="http://www.chrisgreenley.com/projects/dive-comp-teardown-versa-pro/bottomside-labeled.png" alt="">
<br></p>

<h5 id="pressure-sensor">Pressure Sensor</h5>

<p>The pressure sensor was giving bad readings according to the error the computer showed. Since the computer is from circa 2003, the manufacturer doesn’t service this model anymore, so no point in being non-destructive.</p>

<p>This is tiny module underneath the black protective goop inside the pressure sensor. It measures 1.5mm x 1.5mm x 0.9mm.</p>

<p><br>
<img src="http://www.chrisgreenley.com/projects/dive-comp-teardown-versa-pro/sensor-0.jpg" alt="">
<br></p>

<p>And this is the module under a microscope. You can see the locations the bond wires connected before I broke them by pulling it out of the housing.</p>

<p><br>
<img src="http://www.chrisgreenley.com/projects/dive-comp-teardown-versa-pro/sensor-1.jpg" alt="">
<br></p>

<p><br>
<img src="http://www.chrisgreenley.com/projects/dive-comp-teardown-versa-pro/sensor-2.jpg" alt="">
<br></p>

<p>There is definitely some 3-dimensionality to this module. From doing some reading I believe it is a Wheatstone bridge composed of piezo-resistive elements. There is probably a sealed chamber inside for use as a reference pressure. The output signal is a differential analog voltage which goes off to an  opamp circuit to prepare a signal which can be measured by the ADC in the microcontroller.</p>

<p>Update: I emailed SMI and asked if they could identify the sensor, and they responded a few hours later that it was the SM5106. In the snippets from the datasheet shown below, you can see that it is indeed a Wheatstone bridge composed of four piezoresistive elements.</p>

<p>The circuit below conditions the signal coming from the sensor, preparing it to be read by the ADC. It is composed of four opamps and various passives.</p>

<p><br>
<img src="http://www.chrisgreenley.com/projects/dive-comp-teardown-versa-pro/opamp-circuit.jpg" alt="">
<br></p>

<p>As shown in the schematic below, opamp C creates a constant current source pushing 330 uA through the Wheatstone bridge. Opamp D is just a buffer. Opamps A and B form something similar to an instrumentation amplifier, but not quite the standard configuration. The net result is that if the voltage at the non-inverting inputs of opamps A and B is identical, then the output of B will be 30 mV. If the voltage at the non-inverting input of A is higher than at the non-inverting input of B, then the voltage on the output of B will go up. In the reverse situation the voltage will go down, though of course it bottoms out pretty quickly at zero. I suspect the sensor is setup so this situation should never happen.</p>

<p>The output voltage which would be read by the microcontroller can be found using the equation show below. \(V_{A-} \) and \(V_{B-}\) are the voltages at the inverting inputs of opamps A and B. Since they are setup with negative feedback, these will equal the voltages at their non-inverting inputs AKA the voltages from the sense terminals on the Wheatstone bridge.</p>

<p>\( V_{out} = (3\frac{96e3}{26e3}+1)(\Delta V) + 0.03 \) where \( \Delta V = V_{A-} - V_{B-} \)</p>

<p>or approximately</p>

<p>\( V_{out} = (12)(\Delta V) + 0.03 \)</p>

<h5 id="backlight">Backlight</h5>

<p>The backlight consists of an electro-luminescent (EL) panel shaped to exactly match the LCD. EL panels are a capacitive load (this one measures about 6 nF) which need to be driven by a high voltage AC signal, typically 150 Vpp or more. The IC shown in the circuit diagram below is specifically designed to drive EL lights. It uses the inductor to generate very large voltage spikes at a frequency controlled by a clock signal from the microcontroller.</p>

<p>Below you can see the panel glowing. I have it connected to a stand-alone EL driver I have for use with EL wire.</p>

<p><br>

<br></p>

<h5 id="speaker-buzzer">Speaker/Buzzer</h5>

<p>I found this circuit especially interesting to understand, since I didn’t realize at first that the back disk behaved as a buzzer. For a while I was thinking that it might be a way to detect the intrusion of water to the battery compartment.</p>

<p>The buzzer consists of two copper plates separated by a small distance. The smaller plate is connected directly to the positive terminal of the battery. Why the positive terminal and not the negative “ground” terminal? I’m pretty sure just because it was more physically convenient, and whether that plate is held at “zero” or at three volts is irrelevant compared to the large voltages on the other plate.</p>

<p>The IC marked ACCM in the circuit below is a simple capacitive charge pump style voltage doubler (See my <a href="http://www.chrisgreenley.com/projects/charge-pump/">post</a> about building an inverting charge pump for more info on how these work). When transistor Q2 is turned on (by pulling the GPIO to ground) Node 2 gets connected to Vcc. This turns on the LED and provides the input voltage for the voltage doubler. Pin 2 is then at 6 volts (Vcc * 2).</p>

<p>The fun comes when Q1 is alternately turned on and off by a PWM signal from the microcontroller. When Node 1 is pulled to ground through the transistor, the inductor behaves like a simple wire (in the steady state). But, when the transistor is turned off, current through the inductor attempts to stop instantly and the collapsing magnetic field creates an induced current in the same direction but now this current has no where to go. The result is a large voltage spike at Node 1 which means a large potential difference across the capacitive load (about 12.3 nF) formed by the buzzer. This built up charge then goes back through the inductor resulting in an oscillation which is stopped when the transistor turns back on, pulling Node 1 back to ground.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.chrisgreenley.com/projects/dive-comp-teardown-versa-pro/pdfs/MAX1683_voltage_doubler_datasheet.pdf">Voltage Doubler Datasheet</a></p>

<p><br>
<img src="http://www.chrisgreenley.com/projects/dive-comp-teardown-versa-pro/speaker-schematic.jpg" alt="">
<br></p>

<p>The lower (yellow) trace is the approx 40% +duty cycle PWM signal from the microcontroller. The upper (blue) trace is the voltage at Node 1. The approx 40 volt peak-to-peak oscillation results in the buzzer vibrating at 2.5 kHz (plus harmonics).</p>

<p><br>
<img src="http://www.chrisgreenley.com/projects/dive-comp-teardown-versa-pro/speaker-scope.jpg" alt="">
<br></p>

<h5 id="lcd-voltage-generation">LCD Voltage Generation</h5>

<p>The LCD requires a few different voltages to operate. I couldn’t find a datasheet for the IC marked “MCAB P358” but the purpose is to generate the one third and two thirds Vcc voltages for the LCD driver IC. (See my <a href="http://www.chrisgreenley.com/projects/lcd-screen/">post</a> reverse engineering an LCD screen for more info on why these voltages are needed.)</p>

<p><br>
<img src="http://www.chrisgreenley.com/projects/dive-comp-teardown-versa-pro/P358-schematic.jpg" alt="">
<br></p>

<h5 id="light-sensor">Light Sensor</h5>

<p>The component beside the LED is (as far as I can tell) a photo-transistor which is used to sense the ambient light levels. The computer manual says it uses this information to only turn on the backlight above water if the computer is in a low light situation. This way battery isn’t wasted lighting up the screen when it isn’t needed. In low light the sense GPIO will remain high, pulled to Vcc by the resistor. In bright light the transistor will turn on, pulling the sense GPIO pin to ground. I suspect that other than for the moment when the microcontroller is checking the light level, both GPIO pins are tri-stated to save power.</p>

    <h2>A Terse Guide on Hiring Your First Engineering Manager</h2>
  </div><div>
    <p>Hiring an early-stage manager can bring up powerful fears of making a bad hire.</p>

<ul>
  <li>What if they ruin our culture?</li>
  <li>What if we lose good people because of them?</li>
  <li>What if they cause harm?</li>
</ul>

<!--more-->

<p>This mindset can lead to fear-driven-development of the job description. The “what-ifs” turn into a laundry list of requirements without much coherence between them, and this leads to stressful hiring experience both for the candidate (who feels like they need to be superhero to succeed) and for the folks doing the hiring (who feel like they might never find the right person.)</p>

<h2 id="what-makes-a-manager">What Makes A Manager?</h2>

<p>When it comes to defining a manager’s role, I encourage people to start with a simple baseline: Look for someone who is effective at <em>performance management.</em></p>

<p>That term might make you cringe depending on your experience. However, <a href="https://www.alancolquitt.com/book">modern performance management</a> is quite a bit different than the discipline that spawned the term decades ago.</p>

<p>This is a whole topic in its own right, but for our purposes, let’s define performance management as “bringing people and resources together to make the right things happen.” It’s simple, but it’s hard!</p>

<p><em>TL;DR The baseline for an effective manager is that they can lead their teams in getting from “why” to “what” to “how”</em>.</p>

<p>An effective performance manager has competency in three areas:</p>

<h3 id="direction">Direction</h3>

<p>They understand and contribute to the company’s strategy at an appropriate level.</p>

<p>This means that they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>See it as their job to understand and represent what the business is doing (in their area, at least)</li>
  <li>Help their reports and peers to understand that direction for themselves</li>
</ul>

<p>Red flags can look like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Seeing their job as “protecting” their team from “the business”</li>
  <li>Talking about “the business” like a foreign entity</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="alignment">Alignment</h3>

<p>They can lead their team from “why are we doing this?” to “what are we doing?”</p>

<p>This means that they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lead teams in designing solutions to problems</li>
  <li>Contribute well as peers with other disciplines (product management, design, etc.)</li>
  <li>Effectively guide people through conflict as it arises</li>
</ul>

<p>Red flags can look like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Viewing their teams as “order-takers” for product management / design / etc</li>
  <li>A need to control rather than influence (e.g. requiring direct reporting lines to any area where they need to get things done)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="progress">Progress</h3>

<p>They get results. This means going from “what are we doing?” to “we’re doing it!”</p>

<p>More specifically, they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Get the right things done</li>
  <li>Use simple, understandable measurements to know that the right things are getting done</li>
  <li>Continually grow and resource their team</li>
</ul>

<p>Red flags can look like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dogmatic belief in a particular project-management process</li>
  <li>Shying away from taking ownership of outcomes</li>
  <li>Can’t hold multiple priorities in balance with one another (e.g. treats people terribly to get results, or sacrifices results to treat people too gently)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-do-i-use-this">How Do I Use This?</h2>

<p>Starting with this short list of capabilities, you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Add a couple of other things that are important to the job (e.g. technical skills)</li>
  <li>Use the list of capabilities you came up with to write the job description</li>
  <li>Build an interview to test for these things</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re looking for more detail, <a href="https://mikedebo.com/work/2020/11/06/hacking-structured-interviewing-for-jobs-you-dont-understand/">I wrote a guide on hiring for jobs you don’t understand well</a> that should help you put it all together.</p>

<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3 id="q-why-isnt-there-a-communication-section-isnt-that-an-important-skill-for-a-manager">Q: Why isn’t there a “Communication” section? Isn’t that an important skill for a manager?</h3>

<p>It is common to test for communication directly. However, I don’t think it’s specific enough.</p>

<p>Think for a moment: Have you worked with a manager who was great at communicating with other engineering teams, but struggled in group sessions with product management, design, marketing, or other roles?</p>

<p>How about someone who was great at storytelling, but who had a hard time communicating how to turn that idea into reality?</p>

<p>These are all different types of communication, but they happen in different contexts.</p>

<p>The person who does well with their teams but poorly with product and design may be more comfortable with <em>making progress</em> than with <em>creating alignment.</em> Our storyteller may be great at communicating <em>direction</em> but not so good with the rest.</p>

<p>None of these gaps are necessarily deal-breakers on their own, but they do paint a clearer picture of where manager’s strengths might lie, and this extra specificity might help you make a better hiring decision.</p>

<h3 id="q-this-directionalignmentprogress-stuff-sounds-a-bit-fluffy-arent-there-better-words-for-it">Q: This direction/alignment/progress stuff sounds a bit fluffy. Aren’t there better words for it?</h3>

<p>I tend not to use these directly with folks unless I’m explaining the underlying model. When talking about it with everyone else, you can use something like “Strategy”, “Focus”, “Execution”; or, even more simply, “Why”, “What”, and “How”.</p>

<h3 id="q-you-havent-spoken-about-leadership-at-all-arent-leadership-qualities-important-in-a-manager">Q: You haven’t spoken about leadership at all. Aren’t leadership qualities important in a manager?</h3>

<p>This is a big topic. In short, my experience is this: It takes a lot of experience and pain to become a strong leader. There are some really interesting, deeply-thought-out leadership programs out there (e.g. <a href="https://coactive.com/training/leadership-training/">Co-Active Leadership</a>) but even those will push their trainees into different forms of suffering to develop their character.</p>

<p>Performance management, however, is a pretty distinct set of skills that can be learned quickly with some dedication. I think it’s a lot more reasonable to find someone who has these skills (or who can develop them on the job) than to expect them to have a lot of difficult-to-acquire leadership qualities, especially for front-line managers who tend to be earlier in their careers.</p>

<h2 id="need-help">Need Help?</h2>

<p>I like talking about hiring. Ping me on <a href="https://twitter.com/mikedeb0">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-dibernardo-5b19189/">LinkedIn</a> if you’d like to chat.</p>

Here's a <a href="https://www.kidsnews.com.au/money/what-is-cryptocurrency-and-how-does-it-work-in-the-digital-world/news-story/7f8105dbed5eb13916b379fab8b6c437" target="_blank">cryptocurrency explainer for kids</a> (I needed it), but the basic idea is that it's a secure, verifiable, digital alternative to cash money.</p><p><br>All you need to know for today is that the "verifiable" part of crypto is what makes it relevant to sustainability.</p><p><br><strong>Why does it matter to climate change?</strong></p><div><p>You acquire Bitcoin by "mining" it digitally. Let's use gold as an example — gold miners had to expend time, money, and energy to find and extract hidden nuggets.</p><p>Now lets imagine that the tools used to mine and verify the legitimacy of the gold consumed more power than your house, and the more gold you mined, the harder your miners had to work, and the more energy they consumed.</p><p>Bitcoin matters to climate change because it consumes a huge amount of energy, and the energy per transaction will continue to increase.</p></div><p><br><strong>How bad is it, really?</strong></p><p>From the sources above and a few more linked, here are some quick facts:</p><ul role="list"><li>A single Bitcoin transaction expends enough electricity to power the average US home for three weeks (<a href="https://thephoenix.substack.com/p/tuesday-thread-air-travel-bitcoin/comments" target="_blank">The Phoenix</a>/<a href="https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption/">Digiconomist</a>)</li><li>In Iceland more energy is likely used mining Bitcoin than for combined household use (<a href="https://fortune.com/2018/02/13/iceland-bitcoin-mining-electricity/" target="_blank">Fortune</a>)</li><li>Most electricity used to mine Bitcoin comes from fossil fuels, Bitcoin produces 37 million tons of carbon dioxide annually (same as the country of Switzerland) (<a href="https://thephoenix.substack.com/p/bitcoin-is-now-worth-50000-and-its" target="_blank">The Phoenix</a>)</li><li>If Bitcoin was a country, it would be in the top 30 energy users. It's exceeded Argentina - yikes</li><li>The top 0.01% holders of Bitcoin have 22x the combined Bitcoins as all the rest of us combined — it could be a bad income inequality multiplier (<a href="https://twitter.com/EricHolthaus/status/1363134206671532033" target="_blank">Eric Holthaus &amp; Bitinfocharts</a>)</li></ul><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f6db441319a46c10ca23b4d/603f6c4805d50a043f412fc5_fec4e604-5817-4795-ad41-e03d0f1d4933.png" alt=""></p></figure><p><br><strong>Is it all bad?</strong></p><div><p>I'm honestly still grappling with this, but the most compelling argument in favor of Bitcoin is that people want to make money off of it, existing energy is too expensive, so it incentivizes the production of solar energy. I'll share sources when I find something more credible than <a href="https://medium.com/@philgeiger/bitcoin-is-good-for-the-environment-fc5ff7448b9e" target="_blank">blog posts</a>.</p><p>My take (for now) is that Bitcoin is net negative, but there are so many other types of cryptocurrency like <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/vision/" target="_blank">Ethereum</a> acknowledging the planetary impacts of crypto technology and surfacing solutions. I need to learn more about why people are obsessed with Bitcoin and only Bitcoin when it seems like there are "better" cryptos out there.

<p>How much RAM on your laptop is sitting unused?  How much is empty?  How much is redundant?</p>

<p>In an ideal OS, the answer is none.  All RAM contains data of running programs, or buffers or cache to help speed up things you’re about to do.</p>

<p>But what about reality?   A quick <a href="https://gist.github.com/Hello1024/4902ff3bdba32a219adb4caa3563c23a">bit of python</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/Hello1024/devmem-full-access">a kernel module</a> later, and I now know!</p>

<p>System: Ubuntu 20.10 laptop, with 16 Gigs of RAM, running Chrome with +20 tabs, playing a bit of music and running a few other apps (Freecad, Deluge, Sublime).  Pretty typical desktop workload.</p>

<h3 id="results">Results…</h3>

<p>Of my 15.7 Gigs of RAM…   2.05 Gigs are exact duplicates of other memory (1.1Gigs of that are zeros), and 13.6 Gigs are unique.</p>

<h3 id="how-frequent-are-the-duplicates">How frequent are the duplicates?</h3>

<p><img src="https://omattos.com/images/dupemem-freqplot.png" alt="Frequency plot"></p>

<h3 id="what-data-has-the-most-duplicates">What data has the most duplicates?</h3>

<p>The most common are all zeros, all <code>0xff</code>’s, all <code>0xcc</code>’s (used by some memory debuggers?), and various patterns that I suspect are freelists of various memory allocators.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-a-typical-duplicate">What is a typical duplicate?</h3>

<p>Lets take a look at the 4k page of RAM with hash 0372a15ebe749b18d397c9dffdc55d21.  There are 5 copies of it.  The actual data is:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>gBFACQAJYAUgBUAC2AF4AYwA...lots more base64...A;gdpr=1;dc_adk=4100875739;ord=r2qk1l;click=https%3A%2F%2Fclicktrack.pubmatic.com%2FAdServer%2FAdDisplayTrackerSer
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So it’s a bit of a cookie.   Is it a good use of RAM to keep 5 copies?</p>

<h3 id="what-about-free-memory">What about free memory?</h3>

<p>This system claims:</p>
<div><div><pre><code># free
              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:       16153824     5098156     5662776      893616     5392892     9826072
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Most of those ‘free’ pages contain data from previous programs, and is counted in the above analysis.   Quite why we have so much free memory when we could be preloading potentially useful data is another question…</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>My RAM has a lot of duplicate data in.  This seems counter to good design practices which should keep just one copy of big chunks of identical data.   Anyone fancy running the same code on their system, tracking down who is copying and allocating this data, and sending patches to the relevant projects to keep just one copy of this data and allow the RAM to be used for better things?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
				<p>Crossplane is often compared to HashiCorp’s Terraform. It’s common for enterprise platform teams to find Crossplane as they outgrow Terraform and look for alternatives, so there are parallels between the two open source projects:</p><ul><li>Both allow engineers to model their infrastructure as declarative configuration</li><li>Both support managing a myriad of diverse infrastructure using "provider" plugins</li><li>Both are open source tools with strong communities</li></ul><p>The key difference is that Crossplane is a control plane, where Terraform is a command-line tool - an interface to control planes. This post touches on a handful of pain points that enterprises commonly face as they scale Terraform, and highlights how Crossplane addresses these&nbsp;issues.</p><h2 id="collaboration">Collaboration</h2><p>Enterprises often adopt Terraform via their operations team. It’s a great way for a small team of engineers to begin to wrangle their organisation’s infrastructure. Representing infrastructure as declarative configuration allows an operations team to benefit from software engineering best practices - keeping the configuration in revision control where changes can be peer reviewed and reverted when necessary.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.crossplane.io/content/images/2021/03/Cone@0.25x.png"></figure><p>Where Terraform can fall apart is when more engineers need to collaborate to manage their organisation’s infrastructure. Terraform relies on a monolithic state file to map desired configuration to actual, running infrastructure. A lock must be held on this state file while configuration is being applied, and applying a Terraform configuration is a blocking process that can take minutes to complete. During this time no other entity - no other engineer - can apply changes to the configuration. Similarly, Terraform uses a monolithic ‘apply’ process - there’s no recommended way to modify only one piece of infrastructure within a configuration. If you use the same configuration to manage your caches and your databases you must always update both - you can’t update only your caches.</p><p>Terraform recommends breaking a monolithic configuration up into increasingly more granular configurations. So while the operations team might start with a Terraform configuration that represents ‘production’, they’re encouraged to factor that out into scoped configurations like ‘production billing’ and ‘production auth’. It’s hard to get this right up front, so it can require <em>a lot</em> of refactoring over time, and often results in a complex mesh of Terraform configurations coupled by their inputs and outputs.</p><p>Collaboration scales in Crossplane because the Crossplane Resource Model (XRM) promotes loose coupling and eventual consistency. In Crossplane every piece of infrastructure is an API endpoint that supports create, read, update, and delete operations. Crossplane does not need to calculate a graph of dependencies to make a change, so you can easily operate on a single database, even if you manage your entire production environment with Crossplane.</p><h2 id="self-service">Self Service</h2><p>Modern organisations are evolving from centralised management of infrastructure to a self service model in which an operations team - often called a platform team - defines opinionated infrastructure abstractions that the development teams they support can consume on demand. Terraform has evolved to support this model through the use of <em>modules</em>. A module is not unlike a software library. Like Crossplane, Terraform resources are high-fidelity representations of an external API resource. A module provides a simplified abstraction atop a broader configuration of these resources - for example <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-aws-modules/rds/aws/latest">the RDS module</a> abstracts eight distinct Terraform resources into a single “RDS instance” concept.</p><p>Treating application teams as consumers of a “library” of Terraform configuration means they are subject to Terraform’s collaboration constraints. Application developers are invited to collaborate on their organisation’s infrastructure as if they were an operations team with a narrower focus. The platform team invites application development teams to share their workflow, rather than offering them a service. This means application teams must learn a new, special purpose toolset and language - Terraform and the HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL). It also raises the level of <em>configuration abstraction</em> for application developers without raising the level of <em>access control abstraction</em>. While the platform team can publish a module that allows an application team to manage “RDS instances”, access control remains down at the cloud provider API level and is thus framed around “database subnet groups” and “database parameter groups”.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.crossplane.io/content/images/2021/03/MulticloudCrane@0.5x-2.png"></figure><p>The Crossplane equivalent of a Terraform module is a Composite Resource - an XR. Each XR is exposed as an API endpoint. A platform team can define and document the OpenAPI schema of each XR - each API - and enforce Role Based Access Control (RBAC) at the API level. This means that if a platform team decides to frame the abstraction they offer to their development teams as “an AcmeCo PostgreSQL database” they can grant RBAC access to create, read, update, or delete an AcmeCo PostgreSQL database, rather than having to manage access to various underlying cloud concepts like RDS instances or subnet groups. Because Crossplane builds on the battle hardened Kubernetes RBAC system a platform team can easily support many teams of application developers within a single control plane. Each team can be granted access only to the abstractions they need - some might be able to manage only storage buckets, while others may be allowed to manage caches and databases.</p><p>Self service scales even further in Crossplane because any one XR may offer several classes of service. Crossplane decouples an XR’s inputs and outputs - its spec and status in Kubernetes parlance - from its implementation, which is described by a Composition. If an application developer has been granted access to create AcmeCo PostgreSQL databases, they may easily select from any of the classes of service - any of the Compositions - their platform team has declared to be compatible with said databases. These classes of service could represent production, staging, and development; AWS, Azure, and GCP; fast and slow; or any combination thereof.</p><h2 id="integration-and-automation">Integration and Automation</h2><p>Terraform sits in front of many APIs, but it does not offer its own. This leads many teams automate it by committing their Terraform configuration(s) to revision control - git - and executing Terraform as part of their CI/CD pipeline. This is an improvement relative to a team running Terraform from their laptops, but it exposes a key issue that organisations face when attempting to scale their use of Terraform. Terraform is a command line tool - not a control plane. Because it is a short lived, one-shot process it will only attempt to reconcile your desired configuration with actual infrastructure when it is invoked. Whether run from a CI/CD pipeline or a laptop Terraform is typically invoked only when an engineer <em>expects</em> that infrastructure needs updating.</p><p>Terraform’s conservative, ‘on-demand’ approach to reconciling desired with actual infrastructure state can lead to a novel deadlock. Recall that the process of applying a Terraform configuration is all-or-nothing - if you describe your caches and your databases in the same configuration you must always update both to update either. This means that if anyone in your organisation circumvents Terraform the next person to trigger a Terraform run will be faced with a surprising plan as it attempts to undo the change. Consider for example a scenario in which an engineer is paged in the middle of the night to handle an incident, makes some quick edits to the production cache configuration via the AWS console, and forgets to reflect those changes in Terraform. It’s not unheard of for infrastructure to drift so much that applying a Terraform configuration becomes a risky, intimidating proposition.</p><p>Crossplane, on the other hand, is built as a series of long lived, always-on control loops. It constantly observes and corrects an organisation’s infrastructure to match its desired configuration whether changes are expected or not. This disincentivizes teams from circumventing Crossplane. When Crossplane has been asked to manage a piece of infrastructure any change made outside it will automatically and persistently be reverted.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.crossplane.io/content/images/2021/03/Simple-Terraform-Stack.svg"></figure><p>A continued theme among the pain points organisations face with Terraform is that it does not offer an API. Integrating with Terraform is challenging because it is configured using a Domain Specific Language (DSL) - HCL - and invoked by calling a command line tool. Crossplane exposes a REST API - the lingua franca of automation. Whether a team writes mostly shell scripts, mostly Python, or mostly Erlang common patterns and libraries will exist for integrating with REST APIs and thus for integrating with Crossplane.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.crossplane.io/content/images/2021/03/Simple-Crossplane-Stack.svg"></figure><p>Crossplane doesn’t expose any old REST API. Building on the Kubernetes API means that teams can orchestrate all of their infrastructure - cloud and otherwise - using tools like kubectl. The same tools they use to orchestrate their containerised applications. Crossplane can even expose the details an application needs to connect to infrastructure as a Kubernetes secret to ease integration. It can be paired with projects like ArgoCD, Gatekeeper, or Velero to enable GitOps, advanced policy, and backups. Need bespoke automation? Leverage one of many well documented frameworks to build your own Kubernetes operator that integrates with Crossplane.</p><h2 id="why-not-both">Why Not Both?</h2><p>Crossplane and Terraform can both orchestrate an organisation’s infrastructure. There are similarities between the two, but each project approaches orchestration differently. Terraform offers a command-line interface to control plane APIs, while Crossplane is <em>itself</em> a control plane that can be used to build abstractions atop other control planes. Because Crossplane enables a platform team to offer their own control plane it avoids many of the challenges platform teams face when scaling Terraform.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.crossplane.io/content/images/2021/03/Simple-Crossplane-Stack-with-Terraform.svg"></figure><p>Savvy readers …</p></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">                                   
                    <p>Nearly 3 out of 4 cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy suffer from loss of memory, attention or concentration. This range of cognitive deficiencies referred to as chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment, chemobrain or chemofog severely hampers quality of life of patients undergoing treatment. Advanced neuroimaging analyses have identified structural white and gray matter damage following chemotherapy in patients treated for various types of cancer. Cognitive deficits associated with platinum-based therapeutics such as cisplatin have been observed for 5-10 years post-diagnosis. However, no United States Food and Drug Administration-approved therapeutic interventions are available to date.</p>

<p>Mitochondrial dysfunction, characterized by abnormal morphology, impaired bioenergetics, altered mitochondrial dynamics and mitochondrial DNA mutations, has emerged as an underlying mechanism of several pathologies, including neurodegenerative diseases, cerebral and cardiac ischemia , traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, cancer, and chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment and peripheral neuropathy. Following cerebral ischemia, astrocytes donate their healthy mitochondria to ischemic neurons with dysfunctional mitochondria to maintain adequate mitochondrial function and survival.</p>

<p>Studies in the 1930s already showed that nasally administered bacteria can cross the nasal epithelium within minutes, indicating a paracellular route of entry.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7847685/">In a recent study</a>, Jenolyn F. Alexander, Cobi J. Heijnen and colleagues demonstrated that nasal administration of mesenchymal stem cells restores cisplatin-induced cognitive impairment in mice and their data indicated that these mesenchymal stem cells act by repairing neuronal mitochondrial damage. 
<img src="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7847685/bin/thnov11p3109g001.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<p>It appeared that autologous mesenchymal stem cells work as well as human mesenchymal stem cells in their mouse model. The concept of mitochondrial administration is also being considered the treatment of Parkinson's disease, cerebral and cardiac ischemia, cancer, diabetic nephropathy and spinal cord injuries  and some clinical trials for evaluating the safety and efficacy of isolated mitochondria based therapies have also recently commenced.</p>

<p>These findings indicate that cisplatin-induced accumulation of mitochondrial p53 is the cause of the damage to brain mitochondria that leads to cognitive deficits in response to treatment with this chemotherapeutic. The authors recently showed that astrocytes donate their healthy mitochondria and rescue primary cortical neurons damaged by cisplatin in vitro.</p>

<p>Based on their above-mentioned findings that mitochondrial deficits underlie cisplatin-induced neuronal damage and cognitive deficits, and that healthy mitochondria can be taken up by damaged neurons, the scientists hypothesized that isolated mitochondria from healthy mesenchymal stem cells can be used to resolve cisplatin-induced cognitive deficits and the associated structural damage. This would provide an advantage from the perspective of safety because the scientists do not need donation of allogeneic intact cells.</p>

<p>Mice were intraperitoneally injected with cisplatin at 2.3 mg/kg for 5 consecutive days, followed by 5 days of rest and another 5 days of cisplatin injection. The two administrations of mitochondria on mice delivered nasally, completely restored within two weeks mice's executive functioning, spatial recognition and working memory previously impaired by cisplatin treatment. The entry of mesenchymal stem cells into the brain is facilitated by pretreatment of the nasal cavity with hyaluronidase. The scientists maintained the mitochondria in calcium-free mitochondrial respiration buffer until ready for nasal delivery when they were transferred to calcium-free PBS.</p>

<p>Within 30 min of nasal administration, the mitochondria were detectable in the meninges where they were predominantly internalized by macrophages. Within this 30 min, the mitochondria also arrived at the ventricles and choroid plexus, gaining access to the brain.</p>

<p>3 h after delivery, mitochondria were found distributed along the rostral migratory stream where they were internalized by GFAP+ cells. By this time the nasally administered mitochondria also reached the hippocampus. Evidently, these mitochondria that had entered the meninges and brain completely restored the cisplatin-induced white matter damage in the cingulate cortex, synaptic loss in the hippocampus, and the compromised synaptosome membrane integrity and structural mitochondrial defects in synaptosomes as observed 35 days after the second mitochondrial donation.</p>

<p>The scientists used mitochondria isolated from human mesenchymal stem cells in their mouse model for the primary purpose of being able to trace the administered mitochondria with a human-specific mitochondrial antibody.</p>

<p>One topic of concern usually raised with the administration of isolated mitochondria is the possibility that they may function as damage-associated molecular proteins (DAMPs) which could lead to neuroinflammation. However, the scientists did not see activation of inflammatory pathways in the hippocampal transcriptome using human mitochondria. Mitochondria lack many surface antigens including HLA-Class 1 antigens thereby exhibiting lower immunogenicity than mesenchymal stem cells. This is one advantage favoring the clinical translation of allogeneic donation of mitochondria over mesenchymal stem cells.</p>

<p>An important benefit of their approach is the nasal route of delivery. In case of central nervous system (CNS)-targeted delivery of therapeutics, intracranial administration poses serious risk of injury. Intravenous administration has the disadvantage that it may lead to accumulation in the lung and liver requiring high doses which may generate inflammatory reactions or other adverse effects. Systemic administration of therapeutics intended to reach the brain are also obstructed by the blood-brain and blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barriers. In contrast, the nasal route of delivery is simple, non-invasive and facilitates the delivery of therapeutics to the brain thereby reducing the amount of mitochondria required.</p>

<p>Questions are raised on the ability of isolated mitochondria to survive in high extracellular calcium levels upon administration and to generate sufficient energy to enter cells and continue to function after cellular uptake. Upon internalization, mitochondrial donation enhanced the bioenergetics of the damaged cells for at least 21 days.</p>

<p>It is still unknown how donated mitochondria repair damaged neuronal cells. Interactions between mitochondrial and nuclear genes are vital for fundamental cellular processes such as respiration, transcription and translation. The authors observed that the internalized mitochondria, in many instances were localized close to the nucleus (perinuclear), as if communicating with them. In the literature it has been suggested that donated mitochondria can fuse with mitochondria of damaged recipient cells and thereby repair the bioenergetic machinery or replenish mitochondrial DNA in the acceptor cell.</p>

<p>Although this might be true, it remains difficult to accept that the few mesenchymal stem cells-derived mitochondria can restore cellular respiration by physical fusion to the many acceptor cell mitochondria. It is more likely that the donated mitochondria activate a transcriptional program leading to enhanced Nrf2 signaling and subsequent recovery of host mitochondrial function by a host of antioxidants.</p>

<p>Their findings elucidate the therapeutic effects of nasally delivered mitochondria to resolve unmet needs in the treatment of cancer survivors with neurotoxicities and highlights its potential significance for clinical translation. It also provides promise for treatment of a range of cognitive and neuronal deficits warranting further investigation in large animal models.</p>

<p>A good archer is not known by his arrows but his aim</p>
<p>Thomas Fuller</p>
</div>
<p>Don’t know about you, folks, but I had a hard time remembering all the Haskell arrows that you can bump into in all different situations. For example, I guess I will never be able to use <code>ViewPatterns</code> correctly on the first attempt. For me, the digest of every use case of each arrow in Haskell sounds like a handy thing to have, at least this information will be structured somewhere, so here we go.</p>
<p>Each section of this post covers a specific arrow application, explains when and how it is used and gives examples. Some not that popular usages of the arrow syntax are mentioned in this writing too. So, if you are excited, let’s get started!</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://kowainik.github.io/images/posts/arrows/arrows-blue-knight.jpg" alt="Arrows Blue Knight">
</figure>
<h2 id="section">-&gt;<a href="#section">🔗</a></h2>
<p>The most frequently used arrow in Haskell – right-directed arrow <code>-&gt;</code> – is the one we are going to talk about first and foremost.</p>
<h3 id="types">Types<a href="#types">🔗</a></h3>
<p><code>-&gt;</code> is used in the type signatures to show the relation of types in functions. When just starting learning Haskell, we can think of this arrow as an indicator in the type. But later, we can figure out, that in reality, <code>-&gt;</code> is the built-in data type specified in the <code>GHC.Prim</code> module:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>infixr</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span> <span>-&gt;</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><span>data</span> (<span>-&gt;</span>) a b</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The arrow type operator is usually used in the infix form. It shows the direction from input to output type of functions.</p>
<p>For instance, we say that the standard <code>length</code> function takes a list and returns a single integer – the list’s size. With the arrow, it is written in the type like this:</p>

<p>We can use function type when defining a new data type:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><span>newtype</span> <span>ReaderT</span> r m a <span>=</span> <span>ReaderT</span></span>
<span id="cb3-2">    {<span> runReaderT ::</span> r <span>-&gt;</span> m a</span>
<span id="cb3-3">    }</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Another example of where you can use <code>-&gt;</code> as a type operator is <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/exts/gadt.html">GADT</a>:</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><span>data</span> <span>Expression</span> <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb4-2">    <span>Literal</span><span> ::</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Expression</span></span>
<span id="cb4-3">    <span>Const</span><span> ::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Expression</span></span>
<span id="cb4-4">    <span>BinOperation</span><span> ::</span> <span>BinOp</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Expression</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Expression</span></span>
<span id="cb4-5">    <span>...</span></span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="kinds">Kinds<a href="#kinds">🔗</a></h3>
<p>Like type signatures for functions and data types, we also use <code>-&gt;</code> to specify the kinds of the types (aka types of the types).</p>
<p>With the <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/exts/kind_signatures.html#extension-KindSignatures">KindSignatures</a> extensions, we can specify the kind for the type variables:</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><span>{-# LANGUAGE KindSignatures #-}</span></span>
<span id="cb5-2"></span>
<span id="cb5-3"><span>data</span> <span>IntBox</span> (<span>f ::</span> <span>Type</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Type</span>) <span>=</span> <span>IntBox</span> (f <span>Int</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>With the relatively new GHC extension – <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/exts/poly_kinds.html#extension-StandaloneKindSignatures">StandaloneKindSignatures</a>, which was added in GHC-8.10, we can specify the <strong>kind</strong> of the type similar to the way we do it for functions’ types:</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><span>type</span> <span>Pair</span><span> ::</span> <span>Type</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Type</span></span>
<span id="cb6-2"><span>data</span> <span>Pair</span> a <span>=</span> <span>Pair</span> a a</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Right-directed arrow is also used in the <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/exts/type_families.html">type families</a> declarations:</p>

<h3 id="lambda-function">Lambda function<a href="#lambda-function">🔗</a></h3>
<p>The syntax for lambda functions in Haskell uses the right arrow <code>-&gt;</code> but on the term-level and not type-level as in the previous use-case. The general scheme is the following:</p>
<pre><code>\variables with spaces (or patterns in parenthesis) -&gt; action with variables</code></pre>
<p>Here are a few examples:</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><span>doubleList ::</span> [<span>Int</span>] <span>-&gt;</span> [<span>Int</span>]</span>
<span id="cb9-2">doubleList <span>=</span> <span>map</span> (\x <span>-&gt;</span> x <span>*</span> <span>2</span>)</span>
<span id="cb9-3"></span>
<span id="cb9-4">foldl' (\hash el <span>-&gt;</span> HashSet.insert el hash) <span>mempty</span></span>
<span id="cb9-5"></span>
<span id="cb9-6"><span>ifM ::</span> <span>Monad</span> m <span>=&gt;</span> m <span>Bool</span> <span>-&gt;</span> m a <span>-&gt;</span> m a <span>-&gt;</span> m a</span>
<span id="cb9-7">ifM p x y <span>=</span> p <span>&gt;&gt;=</span> \b <span>-&gt;</span> <span>if</span> b <span>then</span> x <span>else</span> y</span>
<span id="cb9-8"></span>
<span id="cb9-9"><span>heads ::</span> [<span>NonEmpty</span> a] <span>-&gt;</span> [a]</span>
<span id="cb9-10">heads <span>=</span> <span>map</span> (\(x <span>:|</span> _) <span>-&gt;</span> x)</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="cases">Cases<a href="#cases">🔗</a></h3>
<p><strong>Case of</strong></p>
<p>In addition to pattern matching in the function declaration, you can also use the <strong>case-of</strong> expression. The main difference between the case-of and top-level pattern matching is that <code>case</code> uses arrows <code>-&gt;</code> instead of <code>=</code> for branch results.</p>
<div id="cb10"><pre><code><span id="cb10-1"><span>whenJust ::</span> <span>Applicative</span> f <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> f ()) <span>-&gt;</span> f ()</span>
<span id="cb10-2">whenJust ma f <span>=</span> <span>case</span> ma <span>of</span></span>
<span id="cb10-3">    <span>Just</span> x  <span>-&gt;</span> f x</span>
<span id="cb10-4">    <span>Nothing</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>pure</span> ()</span></code></pre></div>
<p><strong>Lambda case</strong></p>
<p>Similar to the <em>case-of</em> expression, <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/exts/lambda_case.html#extension-LambdaCase"><strong>lambda case</strong></a> is used to reduce syntax noise when using the case construction on the last argument in lambda functions.</p>
<p>The most common case is to use it on the last input argument in the functions:</p>
<div id="cb11"><pre><code><span id="cb11-1"><span>isEmpty ::</span> [a] <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span></span>
<span id="cb11-2">isEmpty <span>=</span> \<span>case</span></span>
<span id="cb11-3">    [] <span>-&gt;</span> <span>True</span></span>
<span id="cb11-4">    _  <span>-&gt;</span> <span>False</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p><strong>Case guards</strong></p>
<p>Just like <em>guards</em> in normal functions, you can use guards with cases as well in the same manner, but keeping the syntax of the <em>case-of</em> with <code>-&gt;</code>:</p>
<div id="cb12"><pre><code><span id="cb12-1"><span>maybeAddEven ::</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb12-2">maybeAddEven ma mb <span>=</span> <span>case</span> (ma, mb) <span>of</span></span>
<span id="cb12-3">    (<span>Just</span> a, <span>Just</span> b)</span>
<span id="cb12-4">        <span>|</span> <span>even</span> a <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>even</span> b <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Just</span> a <span>+</span> b</span>
<span id="cb12-5">        <span>|</span> <span>otherwise</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Nothing</span></span>
<span id="cb12-6">    (_, _) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Nothing</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p><strong>Lambda Case* </strong></p>
<p>Additionally, since GHC 9.0.1, combining <code>LambdaCase</code> with <code>Arrows</code> allows the <code>\case</code> syntax to be used as a command in the <code>proc</code> notation:</p>
<div id="cb13"><pre><code><span id="cb13-1">proc x <span>-&gt;</span> (f <span>-&lt;</span> x) <span>`catchA`</span> \<span>case</span></span>
<span id="cb13-2">    p1 <span>-&gt;</span> cmd1</span>
<span id="cb13-3">    <span>...</span></span>
<span id="cb13-4">    pN <span>-&gt;</span> cmdN</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="view-patterns">View Patterns<a href="#view-patterns">🔗</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/exts/view_patterns.html?highlight=viewpatterns#extension-ViewPatterns"><code>-XViewPatterns</code></a> is a handy extension that allows writing function application directly in the arguments specification. And, as you can guess, the <code>-&gt;</code> is part of its syntax too. First, you need to specify the function you want to apply and then, after the arrow, the variable that you can use later on in the function body. E.g.</p>
<div id="cb14"><pre><code><span id="cb14-1"><span>mkUser ::</span> <span>Text</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Text</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>User</span></span>
<span id="cb14-2">mkUser (Text.toLower <span>-&gt;</span> nickname) (Text.toLower <span>-&gt;</span> name) <span>=</span> <span>User</span></span>
<span id="cb14-3">    { userNickname <span>=</span> nickname</span>
<span id="cb14-4">    , userName <span>=</span> name</span>
<span id="cb14-5">    }</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can also use <code>ViewPatterns</code> with the concrete pattern, not the variable:</p>
<div id="cb15"><pre><code><span id="cb15-1"><span>startWithA ::</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span></span>
<span id="cb15-2">startWithA (<span>map</span> <span>toLower</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>'a'</span><span>:</span>_) <span>=</span> <span>True</span></span>
<span id="cb15-3">startWithA _ <span>=</span> <span>False</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Multiple <code>ViewPatterns</code> can be composed in a single pattern:</p>
<div id="cb16"><pre><code><span id="cb16-1"><span>maybeEven ::</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span></span>
<span id="cb16-2">maybeEven (fromMaybe <span>0</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>even</span> <span>-&gt;</span> isEven) <span>=</span></span>
<span id="cb16-3">    <span>if</span> isEven</span>
<span id="cb16-4">    <span>then</span> <span>"Even number"</span></span>
<span id="cb16-5">    <span>else</span> <span>"Other"</span></span></code></pre></div>
<blockquote>
<p>The above is equivalent to the usage of ordinary function composition and a single view pattern:</p>
<div id="cb17"><pre><code><span id="cb17-1">maybeEven (<span>even</span> <span>.</span> fromMaybe <span>0</span> <span>-&gt;</span> isEven)</span></code></pre></div>
</blockquote>
<div id="cb18"><pre><code><span id="cb18-1"><span>&gt;</span> maybeEven (<span>Just</span> <span>2</span>)</span>
<span id="cb18-2"><span>"Even number"</span></span>
<span id="cb18-3"><span>&gt;</span> maybeEven (<span>Just</span> <span>15</span>)</span>
<span id="cb18-4"><span>"Other"</span></span>
<span id="cb18-5"><span>&gt;</span> maybeEven <span>Nothing</span></span>
<span id="cb18-6"><span>"Other"</span></span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="multi-way-if">Multi-Way If<a href="#multi-way-if">🔗</a></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/exts/multiway_if.html#extension-MultiWayIf"><code>MultiWayIf</code></a> extension allows writing <code>if-then-else</code> constructions with <em>guards</em> to check more conditions on the same level, and it also uses the right-directed arrow (-&gt;). Check this one out:</p>
<div id="cb19"><pre><code><span id="cb19-1"><span>choose ::</span> [<span>String</span>] <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> ()</span>
<span id="cb19-2">choose allowedStrs <span>=</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb19-3">    input <span>&lt;-</span> <span>getLine</span></span>
<span id="cb19-4">    <span>if</span> <span>|</span> trim input <span>==</span> <span>""</span> <span>-&gt;</span></span>
<span id="cb19-5">           <span>putStrLn</span> <span>"Empty input"</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> choose allowedStrs</span>
<span id="cb19-6">       <span>|</span> <span>map</span> <span>toLower</span> input <span>`elem`</span> allowedStrs <span>-&gt;</span></span>

<span id="cb19-9">           <span>putStrLn</span> <span>"Choose wisely"</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> choose allowedStrs</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="linear-types">Linear types*<a href="#linear-types">🔗</a></h3>
<p>The brand new feature introduced in Haskell is <a href="https://ghc.gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/doc/users_guide/exts/linear_types.html"><strong>linear types</strong></a>. It only appeared in GHC-9.0 and is not yet that widespread, but it is nice to know that the arrow with the special syntax can represent linear types. The syntax is using <code>%m -&gt;</code> to specify the “linearity” of the function.</p>
<p>See the example of the <code>uncons</code> function, that consumes the input list only once (hence <code>%1</code>):</p>
<div id="cb20"><pre><code><span id="cb20-1"><span>uncons ::</span> [a] <span>%</span><span>1</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Maybe</span> (a, [a])</span>
<span id="cb20-2">uncons [] <span>=</span> <span>Nothing</span></span>
<span id="cb20-3">uncons (x<span>:</span>xs) <span>=</span> <span>Just</span> (x, xs)</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="section-1">&lt;-<a href="#section-1">🔗</a></h2>
<p>Now, let’s see where the opposite-direction arrow <code>&lt;-</code> is used. It is also quite popular and has different use-cases, which is good to distinguish in order to understand and control your code better.</p>
<h3 id="do">Do<a href="#do">🔗</a></h3>
<p>One of the main syntactic Haskell features is <strong>“do” notation</strong>. Do-notation is an alternative for building up monadic computations, using a pseudo-imperative code writing style with the named variables. In reality, do-notation is the syntax-sugar for the binding that uses the left arrow <code>&lt;-</code> operator to assign the result of binding into the variable.</p>
<p>There are a few types of do-notations. We are going to check out each of them separately here.</p>
<p><strong>Traditional Do-notation</strong></p>
<p>Any instance of the <code>Monad</code> class can be used in a traditional do-block in Haskell without any additional extension whatsoever.</p>
<p>The most conventional usage of do-notation is with the <code>IO</code> Monad:</p>
<div id="cb21"><pre><code><span id="cb21-1"><span>main ::</span> <span>IO</span> ()</span>
<span id="cb21-2">main <span>=</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb21-3">    input <span>&lt;-</span> <span>getLine</span></span>
<span id="cb21-4">    <span>putStrLn</span> <span>$</span> input <span>&lt;&gt;</span> <span>" is what you wrote."</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is the same as:</p>
<div id="cb22"><pre><code><span id="cb22-1">main <span>=</span> <span>getLine</span> <span>&gt;&gt;=</span> \input <span>-&gt;</span> putStrLin (input <span>&lt;&gt;</span> <span>" is what you wrote."</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<blockquote>
<p>Note how our new arrow <code>&lt;-</code> translates to the already familiar lambda-arrow <code>-&gt;</code> and the bind (<code>&gt;&gt;=</code>) operator.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do-notation could be written with any Monad: <code>Maybe</code>, <code>Either</code>, <code>Reader</code>, <code>State</code>, etc.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: do not confuse <code>&lt;-</code> binding and <code>let =</code> expressions in the do-notation. <code>let =</code> is used for simple variable assignment, when <code>&lt;-</code> is used to assign the “binded” variable.</p>
<div id="cb23"><pre><code><span id="cb23-1"><span>main ::</span> ()</span>
<span id="cb23-2">main <span>=</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb23-3">    input <span>&lt;-</span> <span>getLine</span></span>
<span id="cb23-4">    <span>let</span> reversedInput <span>=</span> <span>reverse</span> input</span>
<span id="cb23-5">    <span>putStrLn</span> <span>$</span> <span>"Reverse of what you wrote is "</span> <span>&lt;&gt;</span> reversedInput</span></code></pre></div>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Applicative-do</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/exts/applicative_do.html">ApplicativeDo</a> is a GHC extension that allows using do-notation with the <code>Applicative</code> representers. Unlike monadic <code>do</code>, this one uses do-notation to syntax sugar <code>&lt;$&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;*&gt;</code> operators of the <code>Applicative</code> typeclass.</p>
<p>Applicative-do is very useful for working with Applicative-based solutions, for example, with <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/optparse-applicative">optparse-applicative</a> – Haskell parsing library:</p>
<div id="cb24"><pre><code><span id="cb24-1"><span>{-# LANGUAGE ApplicativeDo #-}</span></span>
<span id="cb24-2"></span>
<span id="cb24-3"><span>userParser ::</span> <span>Parser</span> <span>User</span></span>
<span id="cb24-4">userParser <span>=</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb24-5">    userName <span>&lt;-</span> nameParser</span>
<span id="cb24-6">    userAge  <span>&lt;-</span> ageParser</span>
<span id="cb24-7">    <span>pure</span> (<span>User</span> userName userAge)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The above becomes the syntax sugar for:</p>
<div id="cb25"><pre><code><span id="cb25-1"><span>userParser ::</span> <span>Parser</span> <span>User</span></span>
<span id="cb25-2">userParser <span>=</span> <span>User</span> <span>&lt;$&gt;</span> nameParser <span>&lt;*&gt;</span> ageParser</span></code></pre></div>
<p><strong>Recursive-do</strong></p>
<p><code>RecursiveDo</code> is yet another extension to strengthen do-notation. It allows recursive bindings that won’t work with the ordinary do-notation.</p>
<div id="cb26"><pre><code><span id="cb26-1"><span>{-# LANGUAGE RecursiveDo #-}</span></span>
<span id="cb26-2"></span>
<span id="cb26-3"><span>data</span> <span>Node</span> <span>=</span> <span>Node</span> <span>Int</span> (<span>IORef</span> <span>Node</span>)</span>
<span id="cb26-4"></span>
<span id="cb26-5"><span>mkNode ::</span>  <span>IO</span> (<span>IORef</span> <span>Node</span>)</span>
<span id="cb26-6">mkNode <span>=</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb26-7">    rec nodeRef <span>&lt;-</span> newIORef (<span>Node</span> <span>0</span> nodeRef)</span>
<span id="cb26-8">    <span>return</span> nodeRef</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Alternatively to the <code>rec</code> keyword for the particular binding, <code>mdo</code> could be used instead of <code>do</code> to use recursive bindings on the whole block where GHC will cleverly apply it optimally.</p>
<p><strong>Qualified-Do</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/exts/qualified_do.html?highlight=qualifieddo#extension-QualifiedDo">QualifiedDo</a> extension is the most recent addition to the compiler that became available only with the GHC version 9.0.</p>
<p>The feature allows you to customise the do-notation sugaring rules (you can use the <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> function defined in some modules in the qualified <code>do</code> blocks). You would then be able to specify qualified for each particular case you want to use it with.</p>
<p>For example, if we have a <code>List</code> module that would define binding functions:</p>
<div id="cb27"><pre><code><span id="cb27-1"><span>module</span> <span>List</span> <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb27-2"></span>
<span id="cb27-3"><span>import</span> <span>Prelude</span> <span>hiding</span> (<span>Monad</span> (..))</span>
<span id="cb27-4"></span>
<span id="cb27-5"><span>(&gt;&gt;=) ::</span> [a] <span>-&gt;</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> [b]) <span>-&gt;</span> [b]</span>
<span id="cb27-6">(<span>&gt;&gt;=</span>) <span>=</span> <span>flip</span> <span>concatMap</span></span>
<span id="cb27-7"></span>
<span id="cb27-8"><span>(&gt;&gt;) ::</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> [a] <span>-&gt;</span> [a]</span>
<span id="cb27-9">(<span>&gt;&gt;</span>) <span>=</span> (<span>:</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then you can use it for the list do-notation:</p>
<div id="cb28"><pre><code><span id="cb28-1"><span>{-# LANGUAGE QualifiedDo #-}</span></span>
<span id="cb28-2"></span>
<span id="cb28-3"><span>import</span> <span>qualified</span> <span>List</span></span>
<span id="cb28-4"></span>
<span id="cb28-5"><span>list ::</span> [<span>String</span>]</span>
<span id="cb28-6">list <span>=</span> List.do</span>
<span id="cb28-7">    num <span>&lt;-</span> [<span>10</span>, <span>42</span>]</span>
<span id="cb28-8">    <span>"Hello"</span></span>
<span id="cb28-9">    <span>"number"</span></span>
<span id="cb28-10">    <span>show</span> num</span>
<span id="cb28-11">    <span>"…</span></span></code></pre></div></div></div></div></div>

<p>A hash table is a data structure that stores a collection of key/value pairs in a way that makes it very efficient to find them again later.</p>



<p>Have you ever wanted to know:</p>

<ul>
<li>How does the hash map, associative array or dictionary data structure in your language work?</li>
<li>When is it appropriate to use a hash table to store items?</li>
<li>How do we deal with ‘collisions’ in a hash table?</li>
</ul>



<p>Imagine we want to store a list of users so that we can find them later using their names.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.baseclass.io/hash-tables/1.png" alt="Our users"></p>

<p>We could simply store our users in an array. When we need to find somebody later, we could loop through all of the users looking for a matching name.</p>

<p>That’s fine when we only have 3 users. If we had thousands, though, that would be quite slow. We can do better by using a  <strong>hash table</strong>.</p>

<p>A hash table stores items in a way that makes it much quicker to find them later, compared to looping through an array.</p>

<h2 id="creating-our-hash-table">Creating our hash table</h2>

<p>To use a hash table, we need a unique value for each user - this is our <strong>key</strong>. We’ll use this key to store the item, and to retrieve it later.</p>

<p>Because it makes a nice example, we’ll assume that each user has a unique name, and use that as our key. In practice, we would use something that is <em>guaranteed</em> to be unique like an ID.</p>

<p>A hash table works by storing items in <strong>buckets</strong>:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.baseclass.io/hash-tables/2.png" alt="Hash table buckets"></p>

<p>Choosing the number of buckets is a topic in itself. For the sake of a simple example, we’ll use 4 buckets.</p>

<p>When we add a user to the hash table, we use their key to decide which bucket to store them in.</p>

<p>When we need to retrieve the user again, we can jump straight to the correct bucket to find them.. much quicker than checking every user in turn!</p>

<h2 id="storing-items-in-the-table">Storing items in the table</h2>

<p>Let’s store our first user, ‘Ada’.</p>

<p>Firstly, we need to decide which bucket to store her in. That means we need to go from a string (‘Ada’) to a bucket number. The process of doing this is our <strong>hashing function</strong>.</p>

<p>We’ll invent a simple hashing function for this example. Let’s take each letter in the user’s name and assign it a number; <code>A=0</code>, <code>B=1</code>, <code>C=2</code> etc.
At the end, we can add all of the values together. The result is our <strong>hash</strong>.</p>

<p>For ‘Ada’, that’s 3 - so we can store Ada in bucket 3:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.baseclass.io/hash-tables/3.png" alt="Ada in bucket 3"></p>

<p>When we need to retrieve ‘Ada’ later, we can perform the same hashing function on her name. That will tell us to look for her in bucket number 3, no looping through arrays required.</p>

<p>Let’s store our next user, ‘Grace’:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.baseclass.io/hash-tables/4.png" alt="Grace"></p>

<p>The hash for ‘grace’ is 29, but we don’t have 29 buckets!</p>

<p>Storing items using just their hashed value would mean we would need a very large number of buckets. Instead, we need a way to convert the hashed value (29) to a bucket number (from 0 to 3).</p>

<p>A common way to do this is to <strong>divide the hash by the number of buckets, and use the remainder as the bucket number</strong>.</p>

<p>The remainder after dividing two numbers is called the <a href="https://blog.mattclemente.com/2019/07/12/modulus-operator-modulo-operation.html">modulus</a>.  The hash of ‘grace’ is 29 and we have 4 buckets. The remainder after dividing 29 by 4 is 1, so ‘grace’ is stored in bucket number 1.</p>

<p>This operation can be written ad <code>29 % 4 = 1</code>, or <code>29 mod 4 = 1</code>.</p>

<p>This is what our hash table looks like when we calculate the buckets this way:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.baseclass.io/hash-tables/5.png" alt="Grace and Ada in buckets"></p>

<h2 id="collisions">Collisions</h2>

<p>A good hashing function aims to distribute items evenly throughout the buckets.</p>

<p>In practice though, we’re eventually going to end up computing the same bucket for more than one item. This is called a <strong>collision</strong>.</p>

<p>Let’s store ‘Tim’:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.baseclass.io/hash-tables/6.png" alt="Tim"></p>

<p>We now have two users that need to be stored in bucket 3:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.baseclass.io/hash-tables/7.png" alt="Collision"></p>

<p>There are a couple of ways to deal with this:</p>

<p>We could use an algorithm to keep picking new buckets until we find one that is empty, and then store our item there. The approach of only ever having one item in each bucket is called <strong>Open Addressing</strong>.</p>

<p>Alternatively, instead of storing just <em>one</em> item in each bucket, we could store a <em>collection</em> of items. When we find a collision using this method, we simply put both items in the same bucket.</p>

<p>When we need to retrieve the item later, we can still jump straight to the correct bucket. This time, though, the bucket could contain more than one item. In that case, we’ll check each item in the bucket in turn, looking for the one we want.</p>

<p>This is called <strong>Separate Chaining</strong>, and is commonly chosen for hash table implementations.</p>

<p>This is one reason why <strong>good hashing functions are incredibly important for performance</strong>.</p>

<p>A bad hash function won’t distribute items evenly, so they end up concentrated in only a small number of the available buckets.</p>

<p>In the worst case, where everything ends up in the <em>same</em> bucket, we’re potentially looping through <em>every item</em> to find what we’re looking for. That’s what we are trying to avoid by using a hash table in the first place!</p>

		<p>When people think about the WebGL API, they focus on one of the famous libraries
that use it. Typically <a href="https://threejs.org/">"three.js"</a> or
<a href="https://www.babylonjs.com/">"Babylon"</a>. There's barely any motivation
to use the WebGL API directly. But the WebGL API is still just as important to
know as it provides creative ways to place colors in browser pages.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/webgl/specs/latest/1.0/#1">WebGL spec</a> even starts by saying:</p>
<p><em>Given the many use cases of 3D graphics, WebGL chooses the approach of providing
flexible primitives that can be applied to any use case. Libraries can provide
an API on top of WebGL that is more tailored to specific areas, thus adding a
convenience layer to WebGL that can accelerate and simplify development. However,
because of its OpenGL ES 2.0 heritage, it should be straightforward for
developers familiar with modern desktop OpenGL or OpenGL ES 2.0 development to
transition to WebGL development.</em></p>
<p>WebGL was made closer to OpenGL ES 2.0 (a C/C++-oriented framework) than closer
to its sibling web APIs.</p>
<p>For a front-end developer, programing directly in WebGL feels like juggling
many unseen global variables while struggling to understand why functions take
those strange byte arguments.</p>
<p><img src="https://hugodaniel.com/images/maskontop.png" alt="Three colored COVID face masks on top of each other"></p>
<h2 id="graphics-frameworks-that-work-on-top-of-graphics-frameworks">Graphics frameworks that work on top of graphics frameworks</h2>
<p>Fortunately, there are a lot of frameworks that simplify our life when dealing
with the WebGL API. The most recent web-trend of these use threejs and tries to
bring back some helpful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VRML">VRML</a>-like concepts through tags/components. For React,
there is <a href="https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber">"react-three-fiber"</a>.
For Web Components, the <a href="https://aframe.io/">"a-frame"</a>, and recently
<a href="https://troisjs.github.io/">"troisjs"</a> for Vue, among many others.</p>
<p>These frameworks provide the same sort of standard graphical decomposition.
They use <em>"cameras"</em> pointed into a <em>"scene"</em> of <em>"objects"</em> with <em>"materials"</em>
and <em>"transformations"</em> applied to them.</p>
<h2 id="why-use-webgl-directly">Why use WebGL directly?</h2>
<p>Using the WebGL API directly, at the very least, helps you understand how it
works and consequently how those trendy high-level graphics frameworks get to
deploy their concepts. It is not for the faint of heart. WebGL is a low-level
API that inherits a lot of stuff from OpenGL ES, inheriting a lot from OpenGL,
inheriting a lot from the 90s. Oh, the 90s, the dark ages of API design.</p>
<p>All that taken into consideration, there are some <strong>real</strong> benefits for the
enthusiastic programmer:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Learn an abstraction of GPU graphics and primitives:</strong> in WebGL, there are
no <em>"cameras"</em> or even a <em>"scene"</em> with <em>"materials"</em>. Instead, you get to use
<em>"buffers"</em> and <em>"programs"</em>, and <em>"vertex array objects"</em> in <em>"shader"</em> code
written with a specific syntax.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on shaders:</strong> WebGL is all about the code that runs ultra fast in the
GPU, using specific techniques to leverage high-performance parallel runs.</li>
<li><strong>Immediate mode API:</strong> Learning how to use an immediate mode graphics API is
cool to understand how it is biased towards baking things in initialization
to reduce the draw calls that get executed at runtime.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are willing to go down that rabbit hole, <a href="https://www.khronos.org/webgl/wiki/Getting_Started">start here</a>
and proceed with the excellent <a href="https://webgl2fundamentals.org/">WebGL 2 Fundamentals</a>.</p>
<h2 id="abstract-the-frustration-away">Abstract the frustration away</h2>
<p>With WebGL, even simple things take quite a bit of code. A simple image is
never "simple". It can require pages of code in setup and initialization and a
whole WebGL global state system that needs to be maintained.</p>
<p><img src="https://hugodaniel.com/images/masksontree.png" alt="A tree with COVID masks as leafs"></p>
<p>As a result, 10 years ago, back in the early days of WebGL (which today has
its 10th anniversary!), a few libraries showed up that used a thin abstraction
layer on top of it and tried to deal with the boilerplate JS code.
<a href="https://github.com/evanw/lightgl.js/">lightgl.js</a> is one of these notorious
libs.</p>
<p>Writing and maintaining the WebGL boilerplate can be quite a traumatic
experience for the aspiring front-end developer. There are many formulations
of its concepts that have evolved through these 10 years.</p>
<h2 id="being-declarative-without-losing-the-webgl-domain">Being declarative without losing the WebGL domain</h2>
<p>The new graphics frameworks bring into the declarative space the primitives
that threejs handle in code. They do it subtly by bridging DOM libraries
(React, Vue, or even bare Web Components) and standard high-level graphics
primitives.</p>
<p>HTML tags are excellent in providing sequence and hierarchy in a declarative
way. Their structure is an easy match for scene graphs.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VRML">VRML</a> was onto something, and now we know
it.</p>
<p>What if this declarative tag-oriented approach could be used in the WebGL
domain primitives instead of the typical camera/scene graph representation?</p>
<h2 id="meet-shader-canvas">Meet <a href="https://hugodaniel.com/projects/shader-canvas"><code>&lt;shader-canvas&gt;</code></a></h2>
<p>In my life quest of making different drawing tools and apps, I find myself
leaning more towards using buffers and GLSL programs than with "cameras" and
nodes.</p>
<p>I am not a graphics programmer by trade and tend to start thinking about
shader code and how data will flow with it before any other graphical
abstraction. This was a strong motivation to create a low-level WebGL
abstraction that could be easily visible and declared with tags.</p>
<p><img src="https://hugodaniel.com/images/rainbowcube.png" alt="A cube defined by its edges, each edge is a rainbow"></p>
<p>The idea is simple and two-fold:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create an HTML tag for each WebGL function.</li>
<li>Have HTML tags to contain the instances of WebGL primitives.</li>
</ol>
<p>After experimenting for a while with Web Components, I have come up with the
library's initial version.</p>
<p><a href="https://hugodaniel.com/projects/shader-canvas">The shader-canvas project site.</a></p>
<p>It purposely has no graphics or fluffy examples to watch at this stage. It is
a proof-of-concept and the base of my future work.</p>
<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing thoughts</h2>
<p>Before I started doing <a href="https://hugodaniel.com/projects/shader-canvas">shader-canvas</a>, I repeatedly wrote the same WebGL code
with small nuances. I looked for inspiration in other libraries in how to
decompose graphical problems. The part that intrigued me most was the balance
between the WebGL API's low-level aspects and its high-level compositions. It
should be possible to target a lower-mid-level of abstraction.</p>
<p>Today is the 10th anniversary of WebGL. It felt appropriate to write about it
and introduce <a href="https://hugodaniel.com/projects/shader-canvas">shader-canvas</a> together with some of
the motivation behind it.</p>
<p><a href="https://hugodaniel.com/projects/shader-canvas">Shader-canvas</a> is a graphics framework that uses HTML
tags to perform the WebGL
API calls and manage its primitives. It does not have a camera or a scene.
Instead, there is a set of tags to declare most of the recurrent WebGL code
that I found myself writing over and over.</p>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>So I've been using my new M1-based MacBook Pro for a couple of months for a mix of development, email, and other things an <a href="https://github.com/earthly/earthly">open-source maintainer</a> does day-to-day.</p>
<p>The typical first reaction that you get when using this is "it runs my Docker stack without sounding like a plane taking off??".</p>
<p>It's a pretty amazing piece of engineering, and in many ways, I think that the ARM architecture is the future. A number of fast-growing tech giants (besides Apple) are pouring a ton of money into making ARM work for a ton of use-cases: Nvidia (trying to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/14/nvidia-to-buy-arm-holdings-from-softbank-for-40-billion.html">buy ARM Holdings from SoftBank</a>) and Amazon (deep investment in the new <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/">Graviton processors</a>) are the two that primarily come to mind.</p>
<p>As you might know, in processors low energy consumption (and low heat dissipation) often equates to the ability to scale processing efficiently for large workloads. It also means longer battery cycles for non-cloud use-cases (less waste, more bang for the buck). This is why I think ARM is the future, even if it might take a decade for the mainstream cloud to migrate over.</p>
<p>My Xeon Linux-based workstation suddenly feels old.</p>
<h2 id="compatibility">Compatibility</h2>
<p>All the software I need to use "just works". I found that if an ARM-native version is not available for an application, the emulated one works just fine and there's no performance drawback that I can notice. To emulate an application, you just need to install Rosetta 2. The OS will automatically detect that Rosetta is needed and prompt you to install it. However, you can also install it manually via</p>
<pre><code>/usr/sbin/softwareupdate --install-rosetta
</code></pre>
<p>The tools you use for development are likely still catching up to this architectural change, and will be for some time. We engineers sometimes use very low-level system capabilities. In some cases, I had to install preview editions of software, but everything worked very well for me. Here are some programs that I've tested:</p>
<ul>
<li>✅ Chrome (native)</li>
<li>✅ 1Password (emulated)</li>
<li>✅ Zoom (native)</li>
<li>✅ Backblaze (emulated)</li>
<li>✅ Signal (emulated)</li>
<li>✅ Spotify (emulated)</li>
<li>✅ VS Code. The amd64 version works perfectly well, however, the terminal will be an amd64 process, which may cause some programs to also run as amd64. The arm64 native version is available on the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/">VS Code Insiders</a> and works really well.</li>
<li>✅ Docker. M1 native version is a must. Emulation doesn't have virtualization features, which the Docker app requires. You can download the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/apple-m1/">Docker App for M1</a>, which is in preview. As mentioned on the documentation page, there are some limitations currently related to HTTP proxy, VPN clients, and performance, but the Docker team is making progress fast. (A month or two ago Kubernetes wasn't working, but now it is!).</li>
<li>✅ Brew (native, encountered some issues with git, but was able to fix them)</li>
<li>✅ iTerm 2 (native)</li>
<li>✅ OBS (emulated)</li>
<li>✅ Earthly (<code>v0.5.1+</code> now supports M1 natively - just <code>brew install earthly</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>I should also mention that during the first few weeks I had some issues with audio skips when using Bluetooth, but an OS update fixed it (just like <a href="https://www.imore.com/fix-way-m1-mac-bluetooth-problems">Apple promissed</a>).</p>
<p>I also use a ✅ YubiKey 5C Nano and a bunch of random peripherals like a ✅ USB microphone and a ✅ dock plugged into Ethernet.</p>
<p>Languages and frameworks I've tested - most of them in Docker containers:</p>
<ul>
<li>✅ Go. <a href="https://golang.org/doc/go1.16#darwin">1.16 RC adds support for building darwin/arm64 binaries</a>. I built binaries in Docker and ran them natively. Works great.</li>
<li>🟡 Java and Scala. I had issues with the JVM, experiencing random process hangs. It seems that there are no official OpenJDK builds for aarch64, however there are some community options. See more info below.</li>
<li>✅ C++ works fine on native architecture in Docker. Minimal testing though.</li>
<li>🔴 .Net didn't work for me natively nor emulated. I did not investigate why though.</li>
<li>✅ Elixir works fine on native architecture in Docker. Minimal testing though.</li>
<li>✅ gRPC works fine on native architecture in Docker. Minimal testing though.</li>
<li>✅ JavaScript / Node works fine on native architecture in Docker. Minimal testing though.</li>
<li>✅ Python works fine on native architecture in Docker. Minimal testing though.</li>
<li>✅ Ruby and Ruby on Rails works fine on native architecture in Docker. Minimal testing though.</li>
<li>✅ Cobol (yes, really) works fine on native architecture in Docker. Minimal testing though.</li>
<li>✅ Rust works fine on native architecture in Docker. Minimal testing though.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="howtotellwhatarchitectureaprogramisrunningas">How to tell what architecture a program is running as</h2>
<p>It's extremely easy to mistake the kind of architecture you run as. Rosetta 2 is that good.</p>
<p>The easiest way to tell the difference is by opening Activity Monitor and looking at the Architecture column: if it says <code>Apple</code>, it's ARM. If it says <code>Intel</code>, it's X86_64. Here's how I can tell that Zoom is an ARM process, while Spotify is an X86_64 process.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.earthly.dev/content/images/2021/02/img1.png" alt="Activity Monitor showing Zoom as an Apple process">
<img src="https://blog.earthly.dev/content/images/2021/02/img2.png" alt="Activity Monitor showing Spotify as an Intel process"></p><p>If you're not sure about the terminal you're using, you can type <code>uname -m</code>. It'll say either <code>X86_64</code>, <code>arm64</code> (mac) or <code>aarch64</code> (linux). <code>arm64</code> and <code>aarch64</code> are both ARM - <code>uname</code> on Mac just reports it differently compared to Linux.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.earthly.dev/content/images/2021/02/img3.png" alt="Terminal showing the output of 'uname -m' as 'arm64'"></p><h2 id="brewissues">Brew issues</h2>
<p>One issue I encountered on both my M1 laptop and also a <a href="https://www.macstadium.com/m1-mini">MacStadium MacMini</a> instance that we use for Mac testing is that Brew randomly started to complain about git missing. Not sure what the cause of this is, but it could be the fact that brew has been adding native arm support for many packages in the last few months and it's possible that this migration resulted in some inconsistencies. This is pure speculation, however, I've not researched this.</p>
<p>(In any case, a very impressive effort to switch architecture so quickly for a project that hosts so many packages!)</p>
<p>Back to fixing the issue now. Using <code>brew doctor</code> I was able to find out that Xcode needed a (re)install. Easy: <code>xcode-select --install</code>. However, the issue was still there. On the MacStadium instance, I was able to just uninstall brew and reinstall it and everything was fine. I was not as comfortable doing that on my laptop after having installed so much via casks. Instead, I was able to just remove the brew <code>git</code> via <code>brew uninstall git</code> and simply rely on <code>git</code> from Xcode, which seems to work just fine. (If anyone reading this knows what's up with my brew's git and can tell me how to fix it, ping me on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/VladAIonescu">@vladaionescu</a>)</p>
<h2 id="usingdocker">Using Docker</h2>
<p>The Docker preview worked almost flawlessly for me from day 1. Making use of multi-platform images seems daunting at first, but really it's actually pretty simple.</p>
<p>The Docker for Mac app comes packed with <a href="https://www.qemu.org/">QEMU</a> out of the box - so Docker is able to run either arm64 and amd64 images. Most official images are now supported on arm64 too. If you're building an image, by default it'll use your native architecture to execute the build (arm64) and most things will usually just work. Your mileage may vary, however, if you are <code>curl</code>ing some binary that may need to switch from <code>X86_64</code> to <code>aarch64</code> in its URL, or if you're doing lower-level stuff. I also noticed that some alpine packages are also not available for ARM (eg <code>shellcheck</code>).</p>
<p>The Docker team advise that QEMU is a best-effort approach and that it is best to run images natively as much as possible. I have encountered myself issues with some binaries when I tried to emulate them via QEMU. Here's a quote from <a href="https://twitter.com/thajeztah">Sebastiaan van Stijn</a>, member of the Moby Technical Steering Comitee (TSC).</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/docker/roadmap/issues/142#issuecomment-785013499"><img src="https://blog.earthly.dev/content/images/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-01-at-10.58.33-AM.png" alt="We will continue looking to improve the emulation, and are also in talk with 🍏, but it will remain a &quot;best effort&quot;, and mostly to help the transition to ARM becoming more mainstream (both on hosting platforms, and in images). Because of the above, the recommendation is to run images that match the architecture."></a></p>
<p>Almost all of the official images are available for either platform. Third party ones are a mixed bag, with most of the community only offering amd64 versions. As a sample, the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/wurstmeister/kafka">Kafka community image</a> is amd64 only. The <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/redis">Redis image</a> is multi-platform. How can you tell? Go to the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/layers/redis/library/redis/latest/images/sha256-bca6e887ba6b58ed572cfecd7043eae16213fd537aa4a65facb9e70eed9c4964?context=explore">Docker Hub page for a tag (eg <code>latest</code>)</a> and look for this dropdown. If the dropdown exists, it means that it's a multi-platform image.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.earthly.dev/content/images/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-02-at-1.15.36-PM.png" alt="Screenshot of Docker Hub tag page with multi-platform dropdown"></p><p>To build an image for a different architecture, you can use <code>docker buildx build --platform=linux/amd64 .</code> instead of the usual <code>docker build .</code>. For more details on building multi-platform images see <a href="https://medium.com/nttlabs/buildx-multiarch-2c6c2df00ca2">Akihiro Suda's blog</a>.</p>
<p>If you <code>docker pull</code> an image from the registry, it will again default to your native architecture (if available), unless you specify <code>--platform=linux/amd64</code>.</p>
<p>If you <code>docker run</code> an image, it will default to whatever version of the image you have available locally or it will attempt to pull the arm64 version from the registry. You can also override the platform via <code>--platform=linux/amd64</code> if you'd like to run the amd64 version specifically.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.earthly.dev/content/images/2021/02/img4.png" alt="Terminal showing the output of 'uname -m' for different platforms"></p><p>Docker Compose will happily run a mixture of various architectures. The same rules apply with regards to pulling and running. You can also specify <code>platform: linux/amd64</code> for the service definition in <code>docker-compose.yml</code> if you'd like to be specific.</p>
<p>One thing to note is that Docker-in-Docker is not supported by QEMU (<a href="https://github.com/moby/qemu/pull/7">abandoned PR here</a>). So you cannot run an arm64 Docker in an amd64 Docker or vice-versa. <strong>However</strong>, if you run your natively-supported Docker-in-Docker, the inner Docker can still run multi-platform images fine.</p>
<p>Another issue that I noticed with the Docker preview on the M1 is that there are currently performance issues with multi-processor use - so much so that performance using a single core is sometimes slightly better than the performance of using 8 cores. Or at least that's what <a href="https://github.com/docker/roadmap/issues/142#issuecomment-772732443">@jasmas claims</a>. I've also seen some <a href="https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/5389#issuecomment-785857638">benchmarks testing the import of a database like MySQL</a>, and it seems that there are some clear performance issues (~25X) with the Apple virtualization API. I've not seen such a drastic difference in common use, but hopefully these are addressed soon.</p>
<h2 id="usingvscode">Using VS Code</h2>
<p>Native support for Apple Silicon is not yet available in the generally available VS Code version, but running the amd64 emulated version works pretty well. You can also use the native version via a VS Code Universal build (contains both architectures in a single package) available via <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/#osx">VS Code Insiders</a>.</p>
<p>Edit: The <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">latest stable version of VS Code</a> now includes the Mac Universal variant.</p>
<p>An issue I ran into with the amd64 version was that I did not realize that the terminal was also an amd64 process (Again, Rosetta 2 is just …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="blog-post-text"><p>We finished our second data bounty Monday, March 1. The target of the bounty was <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/dolthub/hospital-price-transparency">hospital prices</a>. The results surpassed our expectations. </p>
<p>We built a database of 1,400 of approximately 6,000 US hospital's chargemasters, representing over 72.7M prices, all in the same SQL schema. The bounty cost $10,000 and ran for six weeks. Bounties are the cheapest, fastest way to wrangle a dataset into existence. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.doltdb.com/">Dolt</a> is a SQL database with Git-style versioning. It's the first SQL database you can branch and merge. <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/">DoltHub</a> is a place on the internet to share and collaborate on Dolt databases. Without both, data bounties would not be possible. Bounty participants submit their proposed changes back to the repository with Pull Requests, just like code changes on GitHub. This makes it possible for over a dozen people to sanely collaborate on the same dataset at once. Dolt and DoltHub radically reduce the cost of collaborating on databases.</p>
<h2>The Results</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/dolthub/hospital-price-transparency">resulting database</a> is 19.4GB. That's a lot of prices. To get a copy of the database, <a href="https://docs.dolthub.com/getting-started/installation">install Dolt</a> and run <code>dolt clone dolthub/hospital-price-transparency</code>. You'll have a full copy of the database and its history. </p>
<p> <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/dolthub/hospital-price-transparency/query/master?q=SELECT+count%28*%29%0AFROM+%60hospitals%60%0ALIMIT+200%3B%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A&amp;active=Tables">1400 hospitals</a>, <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/dolthub/hospital-price-transparency/query/master?q=SELECT+count%28*%29%0AFROM+%60cpt_hcpcs%60%0ALIMIT+200%3B%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A&amp;active=Tables">3,287,818 CPT or HCPCS codes</a>, and <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/dolthub/hospital-price-transparency/query/master?q=SELECT+count%28*%29%0AFROM+%60prices%60%0ALIMIT+200%3B%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A&amp;active=Tables">72,724,852 prices</a> are represented in the database. 79 Pull Requests (PRs) from 14 bounty participants were accepted. Since there are just over 6,000 US hospitals, this means we gathered price data for about 23% of them in six weeks, at a cost of about $7 each. The top participant earned $5,318 by contributing 158,223,996 cells.</p>

<p>We can confidently say that this is the best open US Hospital Price database available. We can't wait to see what people do with it.</p>
<h2>How can this database be used?</h2>
<p>Since we just finished this bounty Monday, we haven't had much time to do analysis of the data. We'll have some follow up blog posts with analysis over the next few weeks. This database can be used to answer questions like: </p>
<ul>
<li>What hospitals are complying with the <a href="https://www.cms.gov/hospital-price-transparency">federal chargemaster regulation</a>?</li>
<li>What is the cheapest/most expensive hospital? </li>
<li>Which insurer gets the best deals?</li>
<li>How do prices vary across procedure within a hospital? ie. Are hospitals uniformly expensive for all procedures or expensive for some procedures and not others?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.dolthub.com/bounties">DoltHub Bounties</a> are the fastest, cheapest way to build databases from open data. </p>
<p>Our plan is to run at least one bounty per month for the rest of the year across a number of distinct data disciplines. We're running a <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2021-02-22-course-catalog-bounty/">US Course Catalog Bounty</a> right now. We'll be launching one more over the next week or so. Hang out in <a href="https://discord.com/invite/RFwfYpu">our Discord</a> to keep up to date. Start wrangling data as your new side hustle.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-6c2d97ef28007e66bdeb"><div><p>A metaskill is a master skill—a skill that magnifies and activates other skills. In a period of great change, such as the one we’re living in now, our most important metaskill may be imagination. Imagination lets us invent new business models, create differentiated brands, and reframe a growing number of problems as opportunities. Yet it’s also our most mysterious skill. How is it possible to conjure up images, feelings and concepts that we can’t perceive through our senses?</p><p>It turns out that when people talk about “dreaming up” an idea, they’re not far from the truth—imagination has been closely linked to dream states. Neuroscientists Charles Limb and Allen Braun studied the brains of jazz musicians, revealing a “disassociated pattern of activity in the prefrontal cortex” when they played improvisational music. This pattern was absent when the musicians played memorized sequences. These disassociated patterns, they say, are similar to what happens during REM sleep. Dreaming is marked by a sense of unfocused attention, unplanned or irrational associations, and an apparent loss of control.</p><p>Dreams don’t simply visit us. While we’re asleep, we actively create them the same way we create our perceptions while we’re awake. What makes dreams so fascinating is the absence of logical narrative. Even though the scenes we create in our dreams may seem random, their emotional trajectory often makes complete sense; our emotions are fully engaged, while our reasoning is disconnected.</p><p>Dreaming can be harnessed for any purpose using what I call applied imagination. Once we learn the “trick” of dreaming—of disassociating our thoughts from the linear and the logical—we can become wellsprings of originality.</p><p><strong>The tar pits of knowledge</strong></p><p>It’s axiomatic that, to innovate, you need to move from the <em>known</em> to the <em>unknown</em>. You need to hold your beliefs lightly so that what you believe doesn’t block your view of what you might find out. &nbsp;</p><p>This is difficult for most people. When asked to imagine a new tool for slicing bread or a new melody for a song, they may stare blankly, as if to say, “How could there be such a thing?” They may recall many of the knives or popular songs they’ve known, but nothing new will come to mind. At most, they might try to combine the features of two or more existing examples to come up with a hybrid.</p><p>The number-one hazard for innovators is getting stuck in the “tar pits of knowledge.” While knowledge can free us to imagine new-to-the-world ideas, it can also trap us into believing opportunities are smaller than they are. When we’re stumped by a problem, or when we feel hurried to solve it, our brains can easily default to off-the-shelf solutions based on “what everyone knows.” You might say the problem-solving mind is a sucker for a pretty fact. What we know today may not be what we need to know tomorrow. So to avoid jumping to conclusions, we need to hold off on solving a problem until we can perceive the general shape of its solution.</p><p>There are three steps for generating a creative solution to a problem:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>discover <em>what is</em>;</p></li><li><p>imagine <em>what could be</em>;</p></li><li><p>and describe the <em>attributes of success</em>.</p></li></ol><p>Let’s examine each in turn.</p><p><strong>What is? </strong>This is the body of known facts about the problem: Why is it a problem? What is its history? What is the conventional thinking about it? How have similar problems been solved in the past, perhaps in other domains? And what are the practical constraints of the problem?</p><p><strong>Constraints </strong>are the limitations imposed by the context of a problem, which might include budgets, time, manpower, habits, conventions, or fears. They squeeze the problem down to a size you can focus on. Without constraints, solutions tend towards the ungainly, the unfocused, and the unimaginative. Unbounded challenges are anathema to innovators; bounded challenges provide not only a starting place, but a booster shot of adrenaline.</p><p>In a famous 1854 lecture at the University of Lille, Louis Pasteur said: “<em>Dans les champs de l’observation, le hasard ne favorise que les esprit préparés.</em>” In the field of observation, chance favours only the prepared mind. Pasteur’s statement is often used to support the idea that hard work trumps talent, but it also suggests that the better you understand the facts and constraints, the better your chances of solving the problem.</p><p><strong>What could be?</strong> Facts and constraints are necessary but insufficient. To envision what’s possible, you also need imagination. One way to get started is by asking deeper questions. For example, when Thomas Edison imagined the light bulb, he didn’t frame the question as, How can we create an alternative source of light? Instead, he framed it as, How can we make electricity so cheap that “only the rich will burn candles”? While you can easily overreach the possibilities by thinking too big, it’s much easier to tame a wild idea than to reanimate a dead one.</p><p><strong>The attributes of success. </strong>The shape of a missing answer is formed at the intersection of affordances and desiderata.</p><p><strong>Affordances</strong> are the counterpoint to constraints: they are creative possibilities that are native to the subject, the method, the tools, or the challenge. For example, a movie about the early days of movies contains the affordance of being a silent film (<em>The Artist</em>); a car designed for the poor population of India contains the affordance of being extremely minimal (Tata Motors); and a company with a breadth of experience but a commoditized product line has the possibility to become a consulting firm (IBM).</p><p><strong>Desiderata</strong> are secondary objectives that support a goal or a solution, and this principle can be applied to any number of problems. It’s really as simple as compiling a wish list. Ask yourself this question and fill in the blank: Wouldn’t it be great if ______? When you finish your list, call out the wishes that would create the most compelling outcome. These will form a sort of matrix that defines the shape of your answer.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_16_1478736556189_73766"><div><p>To make your wish list more than an ordinary shopping list, you’ll need to engage your imagination. Imagination is the key to originality, and originality is the key to building sustainable businesses and brands. By definition, originality is the only thing that can’t be copied. Let’s take a look at how to get started.</p><p><strong>Reviving the play instinct</strong></p><p>Imagination is the child of obstinacy and playfulness: it comes from a refusal to settle for the comfortable answer while having fun doing it. During the Industrial Age, fun was discouraged. It took time to have fun, and time was the non-renewable resource that needed to be maximized and measured. Employees were paid by the number of pieces they could complete or the predetermined function they performed, not by the number of new ideas they brought to the table. Time was money, and money was time.</p><p>After the clock came to Europe in 1307, it took less than a century for mechanical time to sweep the continent. With clocks, you could agree on the delivery of a shipment, regularize the baking of bread, and estimate the completion of a brick wall. Clocks paved the way for sophisticated banking, transportation, mass production, and eventually computers. They brought precision to business; but they also brought an undue emphasis on quantity over quality.</p><p>The ancient Greeks understood that time comes in two flavours: objective time, called chronos; and subjective time, called kairos. <em>Chronos</em><strong> </strong>could be measured by the sun, the moon or the seasons. <em>Kairos</em><strong> </strong>could not be measured, only judged by the quality of one’s experience. My kairos is different from your kairos, but our chronos is the same. Today we use the term quality time to describe the experience of living in unmeasured time. We find that as soon as we measure or limit quality time, it quickly turns into quantity time.</p><p>Think back to a day in your childhood when you were so busy playing that you lost track of the clock. The minutes and hours blended seamlessly, one into the next, while your mind focused on some engaging activity. As you grew older, this play instinct began to fade. The requirements of society demanded more attention to objective time—an adherence to deadlines, agreements and social courtesies—until play became more and more associated with non-productivity, a kind of time that had no commercial value.</p><p>Yet quality time is the state in which imagination flourishes best. You can’t decide to produce an insight in 30 minutes, or to have an idea by 3:15. But you can decide to forget about the clock and focus on the challenge at hand, in which case you may well have an idea by 3:15—or even five ideas. Imagination takes as long as it takes, and rushing it usually slows it down. This is the central conflict between the world of business and the world of creativity. They need each other, but can’t seem to understand each other. They’re working in two different kinds of time.</p><p>The solution to this dilemma, in my experience, is for business ‘doers’ and creative ‘dreamers’ to focus on goals instead of deadlines. Goals form the common ground that unites both workstyles. Focus on goals, take away the clocks, and start playing as soon as possible. What you’ll find is that generating ideas ‘out of time’ can produce results much faster than holding yourself to a deadline. If you wait until the last minute, however, leaving little opportunity for play, you’ll find yourself clutching the first idea that floats by. Quantity time will enter the picture and force a mediocre result.</p><p>If you could pry the roof off of all the mediocre companies in the world, you’d see an army of adrenaline addicts working on perpetual deadline, madly checking boxes instead of thinking ahead. You can get an immediate buzz from getting things done, but innovation requires something more: unmeasured time spent in the ‘dragon pit’, the space between what is and what could be.&nbsp; But what should you be doing there? What are the rules of creative play? How do you know when you’re winning?</p><p>Here’s where quantity plays a crucial role. The best creative thinkers are …</p></div></div></div>

                    <p>Did your last Yubikey just break? Perhaps you forgot an offline backup password. Maybe you're just tired of <a href="https://gist.github.com/grugq/03167bed45e774551155">living like a spy</a> and never using smartphones. Whatever it is, you're here, and you're finally ready to <a href="https://blog.filippo.io/giving-up-on-long-term-pgp">give up on PGP</a>. That's great!</p><figure><img src="https://blog.gtank.cc/content/images/2019/02/225357.jpg"><figcaption>We're here to help!</figcaption></figure><p>No one was sending you encrypted emails anyway, so that's easy enough. But the most widespread uses of PGP are machine-oriented, for needs like package signing and local file encryption. I recently got into this again on a thread that mentioned <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/30141">deprecating Go's OpenPGP package</a> and people always ask the same question: if not PGP, then what?</p><p>The thing is, there can't be a direct modern alternative to PGP. It's a do-everything design that predates modern cryptographic engineering and hasn't worked out well. The "modern alternative" is to use a much more specific and much less configurable solution to your problem.</p><p>Here are the most common uses of PGP and their modern, focused alternatives.</p><h2 id="signatures-for-os-or-package-updates">Signatures for OS or package updates</h2><p><strong>Original need:</strong> <a href="https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/tutorial-how-to-verify-ubuntu#0">Linux distributions</a> and many other software update mechanisms use PGP signatures to prevent malicious mirrors or network attackers from altering the contents of their packages.</p><p><strong>Modern alternative:</strong> a lightweight signing tool like OpenBSD's <a href="https://https.www.google.com.tedunangst.com/flak/post/signify">signify</a> or <a href="https://jedisct1.github.io/minisign/">minisign</a>, either of which you could quickly build in Go using <a href="https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/crypto/ed25519">x/crypto/ed25519</a>. I wrote one as a <a href="https://github.com/gtank/sshsign">party trick</a> last month – it's less than 200 lines of code and that includes some silly key parsing tricks.</p><p>These tools are extremely simple and robust because they only support one algorithm, lack state or any notion of a keyring, and are usually decoupled from complex messaging formats (which should be a separate concern from your signature cryptography). As a bonus they're mostly compatible with each other because the keys are all <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8032">EdDSA</a> keys. Need I even mention that EdDSA is much, much faster than RSA?</p><p>If you're a maintainer of self-serve packaging infrastructure or otherwise have more complex needs, you should take a look at <a href="https://theupdateframework.github.io/">TUF</a>. It's a modern toolkit meant to resist all kinds of update-related attacks that PGP signatures simply don't address. For an idea of how it works in practice, check out the designs for Python's package infrastructure (<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0458/">PEP 458</a>, <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0480/">PEP 480</a>).

It's based on a modern cryptographic technique called <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2018/10/19/lets-talk-about-pake/">PAKE</a>, which basically means it keeps your data safe in transit while giving an attacker no chance to crack the password. It generates those passwords for you, and they're short, one-time-use combinations of three English words – all your recipient needs to do is enter the words. There's nothing to remember long-term and no account information to lose in a data breach. Wormhole also works through firewalls and optionally supports Tor.</p><p>We live in the future.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<p>After a recent debugging session, discovering I had once again been the victim of a dishonest function signature, I was... Well, let’s just say I was unimpressed. Two thoughts popped up in my head – the first one was «ahh.. this thing again..», and the second was «wait, why is this still even a thing?». It left me in a state of frustration.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>The language was JavaScript, and the function was <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort"><code>Array.prototype.sort</code></a>. Now, before we go on, let me just say that this is far from yet another JavaScript rant. Enough of those exists on the internet already. In fact, I don’t have a lot of problems with the language itself – this exact issue probably exists in most languages. I would like to say <em>all</em>, but I’m sure I would be proven wrong by someone on the internet.</p>
<p>But enough of that. As said, my problem was with <code>Array.prototype.sort</code>. It’s a sorting function. It sorts arrays. You give it an array and a comparator function, and get a sorted array back. Should be easy enough?</p>
<p>Let’s see an example.</p>
<pre><code><span>const </span><span>unsorted </span><span>= [</span><span>0</span><span>, </span><span>99</span><span>, </span><span>50</span><span>]
</span><span>const </span><span>sorted </span><span>= </span><span>unsorted</span><span>.</span><span>sort</span><span>((</span><span>a</span><span>, </span><span>b</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt; </span><span>a </span><span>- </span><span>b</span><span>)
</span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>sorted</span><span>)
</span><span>// -&gt; [0, 50, 99]
</span></code></pre>
<p>Now, if we glance past the comparator function (which I dislike, but that’s the story of another blog post), there’s not too much going on here. The TypeScript definition makes a lot of sense as well:</p>
<pre><code><span>Array</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;.</span><span>sort</span><span>(compareFn</span><span>?: </span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>: </span><span>T</span><span>, </span><span>b</span><span>: </span><span>T</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt; </span><span>number) </span><span>| </span><span>undefined</span><span>): T[]
</span></code></pre>
<p><code>sort</code> is a function on <code>Array</code>s. We can even see that if we don’t supply a comparator function it should work anyway, as the return type says we always receive an array.</p>
<p>Now, let’s alter our example just a bit</p>
<pre><code><span>const </span><span>unsorted </span><span>= [</span><span>0</span><span>, </span><span>99</span><span>, </span><span>50</span><span>]
</span><span>const </span><span>sorted </span><span>= </span><span>unsorted</span><span>.</span><span>sort</span><span>((</span><span>a</span><span>, </span><span>b</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt; </span><span>a </span><span>- </span><span>b</span><span>)
</span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>unsorted</span><span>) </span><span>// &lt;-- this is the altered bit – we print the original array instead of the sorted one
// [0, 50, 99]
</span></code></pre>
<p>Wait a minute... What? Our unsorted array is now sorted, even though we never sorted it? Something weird is definitely going on here. Or, weird might be the wrong word – surprising and confusing are better alternatives.</p>
<p>Once you read the documentation over at <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort">MDN</a> the surprise starts to make sense quickly. <code>Array.prototype.sort</code> actually sorts the array <em>in place</em>. It’s even there in the absolute <em>first sentence</em>. There are at least two conclusions we can draw from this fact</p>
<ul>
<li>TypeScript definitions cannot tell the whole truth of how functions should be used</li>
<li>It’s the first thing mentioned in the documentation – I am probably not the first one to make this mistake</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, errors like these annoys me. It makes my day a lot harder than what it needs to be. I like making things. I don’t like wasting time when it could have easily been avoided.</p>
<h2 id="dishonest-functions">Dishonest Functions</h2>
<p>It’s easy to put the blame on me as a developer. I should have read the documentation, there’s no denying that. But, what if... what if I didn’t have to read the full documentation to understand this single function?</p>
<p><code>Array.prototype.sort</code> is an example of what I like to call dishonest functions. Functions that for some reason likes to hide who they really are, and surprise you when you least expect it. A function signature acts as a promise (an <em>actual</em> promise, not the programming construct) – a promise from the writer of the function to me as a user that this function will behave in a certain way. When a function breaks that promise, it acts dishonestly. Our example with <code>Array.prototype.sort</code> is a bit sneaky, though. The type system can’t tell me whether our unsorted array is mutated in any way, so you could argue that it doesn’t break any promises. But there is a catch here – by returning an array, there is an implicit expectation that it leaves the input alone. No matter how hard I try, I can’t see any valid case where mixing these two behaviors makes sense.</p>
<p>My biggest problem with <code>Array.prototype.sort</code> is that there is no single best way of using it. The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort">examples at MDN</a> seems to favor ignoring the return value. This works, but ignoring return values from functions is a code smell. Return values are there for a reason – ignoring them is just as bad as catching and swallowing exceptions. There are even linting rules to stop us from making such mistakes. But as we have seen, <em>not</em> ignoring the return value gives us another problem. In our first example, our array named <code>unsorted</code> is in fact <em>sorted</em>, so our code communicates the wrong thing. This is a sleeping bug just waiting to make your day really bad.</p>
<p>Let’s look at a different example – this time from Kotlin</p>
<pre><code><span>fun</span><span> String.</span><span>toInt</span><span>()</span><span>: </span><span>Int
</span></code></pre>
<p>A straight forward function signature. You have a String, you call <code>toInt</code>, you receive an <code>Int</code>. You might already have guessed where this is going – let’s see what happens if we do something completely unreasonable, such as calling it with something that is not a number.</p>
<pre><code><span>val </span><span>myString </span><span>= "</span><span>not-a-number</span><span>"
</span><span>val </span><span>myNumber </span><span>=</span><span> myString</span><span>.</span><span>toInt()
</span><span>// --&gt; java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: "not-a-number"
</span></code></pre>
<p>Oops! That’s not cool at all. You don’t want this in your production code. You might be thinking «yeah, as if I would ever do such a mistake...» right now, and I’m not here to argue with that. But what about your teammate who started programming professionally two months ago? Would they be able to catch these errors just as easy? I know <em>I</em> have done this mistake myself – several times.</p>
<p>The important part here is not the examples themselves, but rather that it’s impossible to know about these inconsistencies unless you have encountered them before, or happen to read the full documentation about every function that you use.</p>
<h2 id="honest-functions">Honest Functions</h2>
<p>Unlike dishonest functions, an honest function is, in lack of better words: honest. It tells you exactly how it behaves through its function signature, and possibly other, established norms. These norms might differ from language to language, but they should be consistent. In our world of honest functions, neither <code>Array.prototype.sort</code> or <code>String.toInt()</code> would exist in their current forms. They both hide their actual self, posing as something they’re not.</p>
<p>There are two important properties an honest function should honor: it has to be <em>pure</em>, and it has to be <em>total</em>. In essence, this means three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Given the same input (or same arguments, if you will), it should always produce the same output (or return value)</li>
<li>There should be no side effects.</li>
<li>The function has to be defined for all possible values of its input type(s)</li>
</ol>
<p>If a function follows these three properties, there’s a good chance it is honest. Well, unless you intentionally name your function something completely unrelated to the implementation, but let’s try to keep our intentions good here. There is one problem, though. IO is a side effect, and not allowing IO is taking things a bit too far. Some languages have explicit constructs to indicate on a type level if a function needs to perform IO, but you don’t <em>need</em> this to have honest functions. If a function has to print or log something in addition to its main purpose, just name it accordingly! This won’t tick the "no side effects" checkbox, but I will argue that it makes your function honest.</p>
<h2 id="functions-are-like-friends">Functions are like friends</h2>
<p>Let me end this blog post with something that’s really cheesy, but that also somewhat works. I will compare functions to friendship. Yeah. Sorry about that.</p>
<p>Just like we all favor honest friends, we should also favor honest functions. We can most likely tolerate the odd lie here and there as long as it’s small and doesn’t affect us too much, but once the lies grows too big, it starts to have real consequences. Programming is really not too different. If anything, it might be even less forgiving. We can tolerate small amounts of inconsistencies, but too much and it hurts both your ablity to deliver, and ability to reason about your code.</p>
<p>There is no reason we should tolerate dishonest functions when a clear and honest alternative version could be just as easily be implemented. And just to be clear: it <em>always</em> can. Don’t lie to your friends – stay honest, peeps!</p>

It was discovered by Sagi Tzadik, of Check Point Research<a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2020/resolving-your-way-into-domain-admin-exploiting-a-17-year-old-bug-in-windows-dns-servers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[1]</a>, who released an in-depth write up of the bug the day the patch was released. The vulnerability received a CVSS score of 10.0, the highest level of severity . On Windows, a DNS server is a Domain Controller, and its Administrators are part of the Domain Admins group. By default, the Domain Admins group is a member of the Administrators group on all computers that have joined a domain, including the domain controllers<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/active-directory-security-groups" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[8]</a>.

When a client makes a DNS query for the“evil” domain to the victim server, the victim server will query the DNS server above it. The DNS server will respond back with an NS record indicating that the malicious DNS server is the authority for that domain, and the record will be cached by the victim. Afterwards, when a client sends the victim a DNS <strong>SIG</strong> query for the domain, the victim server will query the malicious DNS server. The malicious DNS server will send a malformed DNS <strong>SIG</strong> record as a response. </span></p><div id="viewer-69nme"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img ariahidden="true" data-pin-url="https://www.graplsecurity.com/post/anatomy-of-an-exploit-rce-with-cve-2020-1350-sigred" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/aa91b3_adb7b85135e44f38bcca549851f38d68~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_804%2Ch_567%2Cal_c/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/aa91b3_adb7b85135e44f38bcca549851f38d68~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png"></p></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-8keh2"><span><em><span>How an attacker can exploit SIGRed</span></em></span></p><p id="viewer-72vq5"><span>The vulnerability is present in the function <strong>dns!SigWireRead </strong>(in the DNS service binary, <strong>dns.exe </strong>), which is used to cache a DNS <strong>SIG</strong> record response from another DNS server. </span></p><div id="viewer-6k85s"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img ariahidden="true" data-pin-url="https://www.graplsecurity.com/post/anatomy-of-an-exploit-rce-with-cve-2020-1350-sigred" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/aa91b3_ffb865d47c0b4f54925b8c2acb34b036~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000%2Ch_790%2Cal_c/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/aa91b3_ffb865d47c0b4f54925b8c2acb34b036~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png"></p></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-77caj"><span><em><span>Decompilation of the vulnerable function, dns!SigWireRead</span></em></span></p><p id="viewer-9het0"><span>Refer to line 11 in the decompilation of the vulnerable function <strong>dns!SigWireRead. </strong>The function <strong>RR_AllocateEx</strong> is passed a 16 bit unsigned integer for the size parameter.

If the requested size of a buffer is more than 0xA0 bytes, it will request the memory from the Windows native heap manager (<strong>HeapAlloc</strong>). Otherwise, it will use a memory pool bucket (sizes 0x50, 0x68, 0x88, and 0xa0). The buffers in each of the buckets are stored in a singly linked list. If there are no more available buffers in the selected bucket, a memory chunk will be requested from the native heap, divided into separate buffers, then added to the list of the corresponding bucket. For buffers of sizes 0x50, 0x68, 0x88, and 0xA0 memory chunks of sizes 0xFF0, 0xFD8, 0xFF0, and 0xFA0 are requested, respectively.</span></p><div id="viewer-urta"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img ariahidden="true" data-pin-url="https://www.graplsecurity.com/post/anatomy-of-an-exploit-rce-with-cve-2020-1350-sigred" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/aa91b3_3601d110d2484f8198fa362f9253d1cc~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000%2Ch_1000%2Cal_c/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/aa91b3_3601d110d2484f8198fa362f9253d1cc~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png"></p></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-7bhic"><span><em>Approximate decompilation of dns!Mem_Alloc</em></span></p><p id="viewer-d2jcj"><span>When buffers in one of the memory buckets are freed, they are not returned to the Windows native heap.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <p>Evolutionary forces drive a glaring gender imbalance in the occurrence of many health conditions, including autism, a team of genetics researchers has concluded.</p>
<p>The human genome has evolved to favour the inheritance of very different characteristics in males and females, which in turn makes men more vulnerable to a host of physical and mental health conditions, say the researchers responsible for a&nbsp;<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00239-021-09999-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new paper</a>&nbsp;published in the&nbsp;<i>Journal of Molecular Evolution</i>.</p>
<p>Their analysis shows that while there are certain conditions that occur only in women (cervical cancer and ovarian cancer, for example), or much more frequently in women (such as multiple sclerosis), men are more prone to medical conditions overall and, as a result, on average die sooner than women.</p>
<p>“Our cells have memories and they carry the accumulation of all the changes our ancestors have experienced over millions of years,” says Rama Singh, a McMaster biology professor who wrote the paper with his son, Karun Singh, an associate professor of neuropathology at the University of Toronto,&nbsp;and Shiva Singh (no relation), a biology professor at Western University.</p>
<p>The researchers looked at autism as an illustration of the general tendency for men to develop medical conditions more often than women. Though women and men inherit the same genetic blueprints from their parents, the way those blueprints are expressed is very different, depending on sex.</p>
<p>“If women and men were any more different, they would be different species,” jokes Rama Singh, the paper’s corresponding author.</p>
<p>The researchers’ work is part of a growing movement toward exploring genomic influences on health, using hereditary patterns to understand and project health impacts on individuals and populations.</p>
<p>“One of the reasons I think this is interesting is that it offers a perspective that is not well represented in the medical literature,” says Karun Singh. “This is a really good example of the perspective that geneticists and evolutionary biologists can add to health research.”</p>
<p>The paper explores hereditary forces that have evolved over millions of years, favoring mate selection and reproduction in the early years of male sexual maturity at the expense of longer-term well-being.</p>
<p>Though human behaviour regarding mate selection has changed, those genetic characteristics remain and continue to be expressed in the health and development of modern men.</p>
<p>Women, the researchers say, typically live longer and are less vulnerable to most health conditions because their genetic makeup has evolved in reaction to the unhealthy characteristics of the male genome, creating better immunity and greater longevity.</p>
<p>Understanding human health through the lens of genomics can and should guide the search for treatments and preventions, the researchers say.</p>
<p>Though the origins of mental health conditions are more complex, they are influenced by the same evolutionary factors, the authors say. Women are more prone to depression and anxiety, for example, while men are more likely to develop anti-social disorders.</p>
<p>In autism, male-female imbalance is especially pronounced.&nbsp;Boys are as much as four times more likely to have some form of autism and are also more likely to have severe symptoms.</p>
<p>Evolution appears to have created a higher threshold that protects more women from developing the condition, the authors say.</p>
<p>While autism is not solely attributable to inherited characteristics, it appears that boys are more likely to inherit characteristics that render them more vulnerable to environmental, developmental and other factors, creating more pathways that can lead to autism.</p>

The swedish car manufacturer plans to produce only pure electric vehicle before 2030, also aims at making online sales through the site.

The Swedish car manufacturer Volvo announced a few days ago that it will completely terminate the sales of gasoline and diesel engine cars in 2030. 
</p><p>
At the same time, in order to establish direct contact with customers, it plans to change the sales of electric vehicles from physical dealers to direct sales on the website.
</p><p>
Volvo said in 2018 that it plans to change half of its car models to all-electric in 2025. The latest plan is more aggressive than before.
</p><p>
In October last year, Volvo launched the first pure electric vehicle XC40 Recharge, and yesterday announced the latest C40 Recharge. 
</p><p>
Volvo has accelerated the pace of transformation because the group firmly believes that the fuel engine vehicle market is shrinking, and the internal combustion engine has no long-term future, so it decided to transform.
</p><p>
And now, the company has started working to become a pure electric vehicle manufacturer and complete the transformation ahead of schedule by 2030.

Volvo's method of selling cars will also be changed. Customers can order cars through the website in addition to the showroom or at home, and the price is controlled by Volvo centrally.
</p><p>
Current dealers also need to transform to provide Volvo with new car delivery, maintenance and repair services. They also need to provide test cars for customers who plan to buy cars, and cooperate to promote online sales.
</p>

<p>Error reporting is vital to web app development, and sentry is a popular solution for this. As such, it's now easier than ever to integrate it into your IHP app. Check out the plugin's readme for details on how to get it running inside your IHP app: <a href="https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp-sentry">https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp-sentry</a>.</p>

<h3>ihp-zip</h3>
<p>Sometimes your users want to download a lot of files at once. Especially with the DSGVO, users could always request all their data from your website. What better way to handle this than implementing a simple zip-download containing everything they ask for? Previously this might've been a hassle, but now with the new ihp-zip plugin, it's a breeze. Just like before, check out the plugin's readme for installation and usage instructions: <a href="https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp-zip">https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp-zip</a>.</p>

<h2>WebSockets</h2>
<p>IHP has always used websockets to update the frontend, and now you can easily use a custom websocket connection too! Just think of the possibilities: chat applications, real-time updates, games...</p>

<p>Of course, to get started you'll have to learn how to tap into this newfound power. Don't worry, we've got you covered: <a href="https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/Guide/websockets.html">https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/Guide/websockets.html</a>.</p>

<h2>Better Performance</h2>
<p>Everyone loves themselves a faster server. It's best when you don't even have to do anything to get the benefits. So, IHP v0.9 uses GHC's new non-moving memory, which should improve performance of all those awesome IHP apps out there! (Not that there was a performance issue before... But faster is always better, isn't it?)</p>

<h2>Logging</h2>
<p>We've already talked about error reporting. However, logging is just as important. And IHP now has its own Logging module ready for you to use! Say goodbye to <code>putStrLn</code>, and say welcome our new overlords <code>Log.debug</code>, <code>Log.info</code>, <code>Log.error</code>, <code>Log.warn</code>, <code>Log.fatal</code> and <code>Log.unknown</code>! You can even customize what a single line of logging looks like. Check out the detailed documentation: <a href="https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/Guide/logging.html">https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/Guide/logging.html</a>.</p>

<h2>Query Builder Functions</h2>
<p>There's a whole bunch of these:</p>

<h3><code>withTransaction</code></h3>
<p>...allows you to run multiple queries in a single database transaction.</p>

<h3><code>setJust</code></h3>
<p>...so you can simply do <code>project |&gt; setJust #userId (get #id user)</code> instead of <code>project |&gt; set #userId (Just (get #id user))</code>.</p>

<h3><code>distinct</code></h3>
<p>To remove duplicate rows from your query results.</p>

<p>...and more!</p>

<h2>Increased Magic</h2>
<p>Yepp, you heard that right. Actually this is related to AutoRoute. You can finally use more than just UUIDs and Id Project-like arguments for your controllers, without having to manually configure parseArgument. This simply means: less boilerplate, more magic, more productivity! We wrote it, so you don't have to.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This release held a bunch of awesome things, and we're happy that it's finally out there. If you want to read up on all the other awesome things that changed, here's the link to the changelog on Github: <a href="https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp/releases/tag/v0.9.0">https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp/releases/tag/v0.9.0</a>.</p>

Scientists will be <a href="https://iawn.net/obscamp/Apophis/" target="_blank">watching</a> the 370 meter-wide asteroid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/99942_Apophis" target="_blank">99942 Apophis</a> fly by the Earth this Friday, albeit from a safe 0.11 AU away. On Friday the 13th, April 2029, however, Apophis will pass within 31,000 km of the Earth’s surface, inside the orbit of geostationary satellites. Fortunately, while originally estimated at a 1-in-37 chance of a collision in 2029, that possibility has since been ruled out. At the recent “<a href="https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/apophis2020/program/" target="_blank">Apophis T-9 Years</a>” workshop there were proposals for CubeSats, small landers, and larger SLS-launched sample return missions targeting the 2029 flyby. It’s also possible that OSIRIS-REx, after dropping samples off at Earth, could head to Apophis as a mission extension with multiple flybys and finally a rendezvous. On average, an asteroid of Apophis’s size impacts the Earth every 80,000 years, and while Apophis won’t impact the Earth in 2029 or 2036, there is still a <a href="https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/sentry/details.html#?des=99942" target="_blank">small possibility of an impact in 2068</a> (but this too will likely be ruled out by <a href="https://echo.jpl.nasa.gov/asteroids/Apophis/apophis.2021.goldstone.planning.html" target="_blank">upcoming planetary radar measurements</a>). Until we are confident of a miss, however, we should be very careful because even “<a href="https://www.thespacereview.com/article/4080/1" target="_blank"><em>[a] tiny change in Apophis’ velocity before the April 2029 flyby, caused by the collision of a small satellite with the asteroid, could shift the asteroid’s trajectory by several Earth radii in 2068</em></a>.” Jeff Foust has a <a href="https://www.thespacereview.com/article/4080/1" target="_blank">good discussion</a>.</p></div><!--[if mso]> <![endif]--> <!--[if mso]></table><![endif]--></div><div> <!--[if mso]><table align="left" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" style="width:100%;"><tr> <![endif]--> <!--[if mso]><td valign="top" width="600" style="width:600px;"> <![endif]--><div><p><a href="#heavy-delays">¶</a><strong id="heavy-delays">Heavy Delays.</strong> This past week we learned of schedule changes for three in-development heavy lift rockets with very different development histories. NASA, after SLS failed its full-duration hot fire test in January, has now <a href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2021/02/prevalve-issue-delays-sls-green-run/" target="_blank">postponed the re-test for at least three more weeks</a> due to <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/artemis/2021/02/26/green-run-update-nasa-inspecting-valve-continuing-hot-fire-preparations/" target="_blank">LOX pre-valves on the Core Stage</a> that won’t open fully (the LH<sub>2</sub> pre-valves were repaired in the fall). Platforms have to be installed so that technicians can use specially-fabricated tools to access and repair the valves. This continues the litany of delays, overruns, and failures for the incredibly expensive and under-powered giant. In a recent scathing critique, <a href="https://caseyhandmer.wordpress.com/2021/02/24/sls-is-cancellation-too-good/" target="_blank">Casey Handmer calls for SLS’ outright cancellation</a>, claiming that its Shuttle heritage has hurt its safety, development speed, and ultimate usefulness, and that it is only propped up by lobbying, political maneuvering, and NASA’s unwillingness to acknowledge a failure. He quips, <em>“even if SLS wasn’t architecturally unsafe, poorly managed, incredibly expensive, a technological dead end, obsolete, and cursed by a low production rate, it would still have nowhere to go.”</em> SLS’s Block 1 design doesn’t have the power to send humans to the lunar surface (thus the need for the separately-launched <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/content/more-about-the-human-landing-system-program" target="_blank">Human Landing System</a>) or Mars, or to send large spacecraft to deep space exploration targets. While the allure of returning to the Moon permanently is strong, SLS feels more and more like an unrealistic way to accomplish that goal. Meanwhile, Blue Origin updated New Glenn’s first launch date to NET 2022Q4, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/03/so-what-really-happened-with-blue-origins-new-glenn-rocket/" target="_blank">roughly what CEO Bob Smith suggested it should be upon taking the helm in 2017</a>. New Glenn has struggled through development, in part due to its massive scale up from New Shepard—building a heavy lift rocket before ever reaching orbit is a monumental undertaking. Blue Origin <a href="https://www.blueorigin.com/news/new-glenns-progress-towards-maiden-flight" target="_blank">cast shade toward Space Force</a> for not selecting them in their recent contracting process—but blaming them can yield nothing positive for the company. It’s also probably not the real cause of the delay, with the company’s priorities being focused on leading the <a href="https://www.blueorigin.com/blue-moon/national-team" target="_blank">National Team’s bid to build the HLS</a> and delivering flight-qualified <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BE-4" target="_blank">BE-4 engines</a> to ULA for this summer’s maiden Vulcan Centaur launch—the staged-combustion methalox engine <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/10/ula-chief-says-the-be-4-rocket-engines-turbopump-issues-are-resolved/" target="_blank">suffered late-stage development hiccups with its turbo pump</a>. (Blue Origin recently released videos of their Cape Canaveral <a href="https://twitter.com/blueorigin/status/1364968313047162880?s=20" target="_blank">rocket factory</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/blueorigin/status/1364968720364429317?s=20" target="_blank">tank cleaning and testing facility</a>, and work at <a href="https://twitter.com/blueorigin/status/1364969291746074628?s=20" target="_blank">Launch Complex 36</a>.) In stark comparison, last week Starship SN10 performed a static fire (<a href="https://youtu.be/XE9K3W0ojjk" target="_blank">video</a>), a Raptor engine was swapped out (<a href="https://youtu.be/iuoZjizF_J8?t=127" target="_blank">video</a>), and a second static fire was performed in less than 48 hours (<a href="https://youtu.be/CshqxSkzSYg" target="_blank">video</a>)—the engine was removed <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1364473175279620096?s=21" target="_blank">due to suspect data</a> produced during the initial test. SN10 is now cleared for a flight and triple-engine landing attempt NET today, pushed back from last Friday. While SLS is further along, it’s been under development in some form since the late ‘90s. The difference in development velocity (we’ll call it ∆v) between these three vehicles is striking.

Neutron is targeting 2024 and will require Rocket Lab to pursue different techniques from Electron’s all-composite body and 3D printed engines. The next generation, reusable rocket will be built at an undecided location near NASA’s <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers/wallops/home" target="_blank">Wallops Flight Facility</a> in Virginia. Electron’s electric pump-fed 3D-printed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutherford_(rocket_engine)" target="_blank">Rutherford engines</a> are only 26 KN, so something larger will be required (for comparison, the original Merlin 1 engine was 340 KN).

Given <a href="https://impact.ese.ic.ac.uk/ImpactEarth/ImpactEffects/#:~:text=The%20minimum%20impact%20velocity%20on,sun%20is%2072%20km%2Fs." target="_blank">comets’ exceptionally high velocities</a> (an average of 51 km/s vs. 17 km/s for asteroids), this new model isn’t something we’re thrilled about. ☄️</li><li>ESA’s <a href="https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Cheops" target="_blank">Cheops</a> orbital telescope found a planetary system with six exoplanets locked into a pattern of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_resonance" target="_blank">orbital resonance</a>. It’s similar to the 4:2:1 resonance of Io, Ganymede, and Europa, in which Io completes four orbits of Jupiter in the time it takes Ganymede to complete two and Europa, one… but with the six planets forming a 18:9:6:4:3 orbital pattern. “<a href="https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Cheops/ESA_s_exoplanet_watcher_Cheops_reveals_unique_planetary_system" target="_blank"><em>The orbits in this system are very well ordered, which tells us that this system has evolved quite gently since its birth</em></a>,” making it surprising that their densities are in a seemingly-random order with a “<em>dense, terrestrial planet right next to a similar-sized but very fluffy planet ­­– like a mini-Jupiter, and next to [one that is] very similar to Neptune.</em>”</li><li>Speaking of resonance, <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/saturns-moon-titan-drifting-away-faster-than-previously-thought" target="_blank">Titan and its other moons are moving away from Saturn faster than previously estimated</a>, at about 11 cm per year.

<p>In sales, business-to-business (B2B) lead generation refers to the first step of an outbound sales process. It consists of sourcing contact information about potential new customers.</p>

<p>B2B lead generation is an important step for both sales &amp; marketing teams. However, in this blog post, we will focus more on relevant tactics and strategies for B2B sales teams selling online (i.e. via email, social media, etc).</p>



<p>It’s simple. You don’t want to waste your team’s resources (money and time) selling ice to Eskimos. Even if you’re able to convince a few of them, they will soon realize that your product/service is useless to them.</p>

<p>Having a great lead generation process means getting the right people to use your product/service. This leads to higher conversion rates in your sales &amp; marketing funnels and happier customers to provide good reviews and referrals.</p>



<p>A great B2B lead generation process is able to generate a considerable amount of leads at the top of the funnel. Of course, numbers will differ a lot between companies and industries, but the idea is that you’re able to source enough leads and still make sure you are targeting the niche of customers that truly benefit from your product / service.</p>

<p>Your ultimate goal is to find <strong>the leads</strong> with the most potential to become your next customers, by looking for purchase intent signals online.</p>

<p>How? Let’s get practical with a few examples of B2B lead generation tactics.</p>



<h2 id="1generateleadsfrompeopleinteractingwithlinkedincontent">1. Generate leads from people interacting with LinkedIn content</h2>

<p>Every day, many professionals open their thoughts for discussion on LinkedIn. Every time this happens, lots of interactions are generated. </p>

<p>People that are liking or commenting on those thoughts are publicly showing alignment with a topic that is relevant to them. This opens the possibility to find an entire audience out there that might be ready to start a conversation with you. How amazing is that?</p>

<p>We’ve recently written an article about this lead generation strategy, you can follow the <a href="http://blog.amplemarket.com/generate-leads-linkedin-content/?utm_source=blog_lead_gen&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=blog_lead_gen">complete step-by-step guide</a> of this approach or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4yVFRuycZQ&amp;feature=youtu.be">watch our 15min webinar here</a>.</p>

<p>PS: If you’re already thinking about how you’ll have the time to gather data from all the profiles on these posts, here’s the solution. Extracting leads from LinkedIn content is a seamless experience with Amplemarket’s LinkedIn extension:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/UMIcTfL.jpg" alt="[b2b lead generation]" title=""></p>

<h2 id="2generateleadsfromnewmanagersongrowingteams">2. Generate leads from new managers on growing teams</h2>

<p>Sales Navigator is a powerful tool for lead generation because LinkedIn has access to a lot of data that it’s virtually impossible to replicate. </p>

<p>This tactic uses Sales Navigator to find the decision-makers that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Have available money to spend right now</li>
<li>Want to shake things up with new processes and tools</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, LinkedIn doesn’t give you the data like this, but there are 2 really good proxies you can use.</p>

<ol>
<li>Filter accounts by headcount growth and department headcount growth</li>
</ol>

<p>On account filters, you should target companies that are growing in general, but also in specific departments relevant to your product. This will signal higher purchase intent because growing teams are certainly looking to adopt new processes and tools to accommodate their tool.</p>

<ol>
<li>Filter leads by decision-makers that changed jobs in the last 90 days</li>
</ol>

<p>Once you have your accounts list, you shouldn’t randomly target decision-makers within those companies. On lead filters, narrow to decision-makers that recently changed jobs. </p>

<p>Why? These people just entered a new role, on a growing team. This means, they are looking to shake things up internally and have available money to spend right now.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.amplemarket.com/how-to-find-purchase-intent-linkedin/?utm_source=blog_lead_gen&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=blog_lead_gen">In this article about how to find purchase intent on Sales Navigator</a>, we explain this approach step-by-step. </p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/xVPbzTX.jpg" alt="[b2b lead generation]" title=""></p>

<h2 id="3generateleadsfromconferenceattendees">3. Generate leads from conference attendees</h2>

<p>Industry-relevant events are a great way to connect with potential customers in your niche. Even with conferences going remote in 2020 (and expectably in 2021 too), this is a great opportunity to reach out to these people.</p>

<p>Using a lead generation tool like Amplemarket, you can easily filter for companies that are attending industry-relevant events. <a href="https://amplemarket.com/demo?utm_source=blog_lead_gen&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=blog_lead_gen">Check here</a> how this could work for you.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/dBPC59D.png" alt="[b2b lead generation]" title=""></p>

<p>You see? With a quick search, you can easily find hundreds or thousands of good leads to reach out to.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can also purchase the tickets for each conference and have access to the attendees' page.</p>

<p>Still not convinced?</p>

<p>Some other great companies have tested this strategy with success. You can see what a <a href="http://goodsalesemails.com/campaigns/pandadoc-1?utm_source=blog_lead_gen&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=blog_lead_gen">real outreach example from PandaDoc looks like here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="4generateleadsfromconferencenonattendees">4. Generate leads from conference <em>non-attendees</em></h2>

<p>Many times, the decision-makers within your Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) are not the ones attending the conferences. This strategy enables you to re-target companies that attended industry-relevant events with the "wrong" people. </p>

<p>Great! How?</p>

<p>You've got the companies from strategy #3. You just need to re-target your approach to decision-makers that better fit your ICP but didn't attend the conference and that's it!</p>

<p>In the end, you'll either have leads with more seniority or leads that belong to a different team.</p>

<p>Note: You can also add the companies that didn't convert in strategy #3.</p>



<p>Every day, you can find new lists online that feature / bundle companies in several topics. Depending on your industry, you might be interested in companies like: New Unicorn Companies in 2020 or Fortune 1000.</p>

<p>There are several ways you can find the relevant contacts for these companies. For instance, you may use advanced google searches or you may know some online resources. </p>

<p>Any tactic you choose, you can use these lists to leverage <em>relevancy</em> in a dedicated message.</p>

<p>💡 <strong>Hint:</strong> You can add an extra point to relevancy and personalization if you know which technologies these companies use and you integrate with. </p>

<p>Note: Find this information on websites like Crunchbase, reviews pages like G2, Capterra, and Featured Customers, or on the tool's website under the customer testimonials section</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>"I found you on the 2020 Unicorns list"</em> - this alone might not be enough</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Adding more value:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>"Congrats, I just saw your company made into the Unicorns list in 2020. I’m reaching out because I see that you use {{tool}} which we integrate... "</em> - <strong>this type of message will make you stand out from the crowd</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On <a href="https://amplemarket.com/demo">Amplemarket</a>, we do this for you:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/RizWaNy.png" alt="[b2b lead generation]" title=""></p>

<h2 id="6generateleadsfromyourparticipationinrelevantslacklinkedinandfacebookgroups">6. Generate leads from your participation in relevant Slack, LinkedIn, and Facebook groups</h2>

<p>Slack, LinkedIn and Facebook groups are a great and unexplored way of generating leads. While people ask questions about how to solve their issues, you can find unexplored opportunities by helping them out with your solution.</p>

<p>Whether your industry prefers Slack, LinkedIn or Facebook groups to hang out and debate relevant topics doesn’t really matter for the purpose of your lead generation efforts.</p>

<p>Example: For companies in the marketing technology industry, this Slack group has a channel where people share their issues with experts in the field. If your product solves the issue, you can easily jump into the conversation and potentially win a new customer. </p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/UZrvp8n.png" alt="[b2b lead generation]" title=""></p>

<p>This strategy may not be the top source of leads in terms of volume, but with the right process, you can easily approach prospects that are just looking to solve the issue you solve for.</p>

<p>Manually checking for each message on the channel isn’t very efficient. With <a href="https://zapier.com/">zapier.com</a>, create customized notifications on your slack whenever someone mentions a relevant topic to you.</p>

<h2 id="7generateleadswhencompaniesareapprovingnewbudgets">7. Generate leads when companies are approving new budgets</h2>

<p>For most B2B SaaS companies the last 2 months of the year is a period when a lot of companies approve budgets, renew contracts, or evaluate new vendors for the upcoming new year. From a timing perspective, this is one of the best moments to jump into a conversation and eventually win some customers. </p>

<p>At this time of the year, you can easily search for companies using your competitor tools and create a dedicated message on Amplemarket. </p>

<p>Just as an example, a message like this will trigger their curiosity to learn more about your tool:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>"I noticed you’re using {{competitor_tool}}, I reached out because for a lot of companies the end of the year is usually a period when they evaluate renewals with vendors. Is that the case for {{competitor_tool}}? If so, I would love to connect, we at XYZ..."</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="8generateleadsfromyourcompetitorproductreviews">8. Generate leads from your competitor product reviews</h2>

<p>Websites like <a href="https://www.g2.com/">G2</a>, <a href="https://www.capterra.com/">Capterra</a>, and <a href="https://www.featuredcustomers.com/">FeaturedCustomers</a> are a great knowledge source about your competitors. Not only you can use the reviews to learn more about issues that people usually feel, but you can also identify …</p></section></article></div></div>

How a brand is first positioned in the marketplace is often the snapshot people file in their minds.</p>  <p>Unfortunately, the same principles apply when branding a disease.</p>    <p>Maybe the best example is the Spanish Flu of 1918.</p>  <p>It is remembered as the deadliest pandemic in recent history, infecting one-third of the world's population and killing more than 50 million people worldwide. But the Spanish Flu has a very interesting — and telling — history. World War I&nbsp;was underway. As the pandemic began to spread like wildfire throughout Europe and the U.S., wartime media censorship was enforced.</p>  <p>Public officials in Germany, France, the United Kingdom and the United States all chose to either suppress the pandemic news or downplay the severity of the virus.</p>  <p>The reason: Governments didn't want to lower morale or cause panic during the costliest war in history. That decision would eventually kill more people than the war itself.</p>  <p>The one country that wasn't subject to media censorship was Spain. It had declared itself neutral in the First World War. As a result, public officials and the Spanish press in Madrid reported freely on the pandemic as it spread through their country. Spain's King Alonso XIII also fell gravely ill due to the virus and that only heightened the attention.</p>  <p>This extensive — and almost solitary — reporting of the disease in May of 1918&nbsp;amidst a virtual media blackout in most other countries gave the world the false impression the disease had originated in Spain.</p>  <p>While it is difficult to pinpoint the exact origin of the 1918 pandemic, one thing was certain. It did not start in Spain.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5525316.1586538974!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/winnipeg-free-press-spanish-flu-headlines.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5525316.1586538974!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/winnipeg-free-press-spanish-flu-headlines.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5525316.1586538974!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/winnipeg-free-press-spanish-flu-headlines.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5525316.1586538974!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/winnipeg-free-press-spanish-flu-headlines.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5525316.1586538974!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/winnipeg-free-press-spanish-flu-headlines.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5525316.1586538974!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/winnipeg-free-press-spanish-flu-headlines.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Headlines proclaim the impact of the Spanish flu in Winnipeg on Oct. 26, 1918.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Manitoba Free Press)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>One of the earliest recorded outbreaks of the pandemic came from the United States. Specifically, rural Kansas, of all places. Soldiers were crowded into a training facility there and — on day one — hundreds of recruits started checking into the infirmary complaining of severe flu symptoms that included high fevers, violent coughing and excruciating pain.</p>  <p>Many of these young men were healthy farm boys who were suddenly flattened by the virus. 500 were bedridden by the end of the week.</p>  <p>When boatloads of American soldiers were shipped out, they took the virus with them. The influenza tore across Europe. It was so serious, it impacted the war, with over 200,000 French and British soldiers becoming too ill to fight. The British Grand Fleet could not even be put out to sea as 10,300 men reported sick. Soon, the German forces were felled with the same virus.</p>  <p>That summer, the influenza seemed to finally subside. But that hope was dashed when the pandemic came roaring back in the fall, more lethal than ever.</p>  <p>The link between the war and the virus was undeniable and crushing. Troops took the virus with them on ships, on trains, into the barracks and into the trenches. Then it jumped to China, India, Japan and the rest of Asia.</p>  <p>When Spanish Flu health messages of 1918 finally emerged, they looked strikingly similar to COVID-19 messages of today.</p>  <p>Newspaper ads implored people to wash their hands multiple times a day. People were asked to quarantine and not gather in groups. Other ads had big headlines saying, "Wear a mask and save your life!" There was disdain for people who flouted the rules.</p>  <p>Brands also picked up on the Spanish Flu name and reinforced it with the public. One typical ad said the virus came by way of Spain and stated: "The best way to stay safe was to apply Vicks VapoRub at the first sign of a cold."</p>  <p>Medical professionals and officials in Spain protested. They said the Spanish people were being falsely stigmatized. Not only did the flu <em>not</em> originate in Spain, the outbreak there was brief and was much more serious in other countries. Nonetheless, the worldwide media overwhelmed the facts.</p>  <p>If you've ever wondered about the staying power of a brand, the "Spanish Flu" is a case in point.</p>  <p>A full 100 years later, the "Spanish Flu" is still referenced — and still remains a source of irritation in Spain.</p>  <hr>  <p><strong>For more stories about the Branding of Diseases, click or tap the "Listen" tab above to hear the full <a href="http://cbc.ca/undertheinfluence">Under the Influence</a> episode.

        <p>February 2021</p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://twitter.com/jessewilson">Jesse Wilson</a> once said to me:
          </p>
          <p>

“What if we could give customers a button. They’d press it at the end of the year and it would automagically file their taxes for them.”
</p>
<p>
At the time I thought the idea was appealing, but didn’t think much more about it. Today, I think this is the way TurboTax gets dismantled. It’s taking consumer finance companies with massive distribution, combining them with a tax preparation API and real-time visibility into users tax position. Tackling TurboTax head on is probably a waste of money. Tackling TurboTax asymmetrically has a real shot.
</p>

<h2>TurboTax is functionally a monopoly</h2>
<p>
From the outside looking in, TurboTax has a near impregnable moat. In taxes, there’s no clear second player with near the level of distribution, automation, community, trustworthiness, brand recognition and regulatory capture that they have. They’re incredible at playing regulatory defense by constantly and subtly opposing any government efforts to simplify taxes[1], which simultaneously makes their product more valuable and raises the bar for new entrants. Even the Justice Department recognizes TurboTax as a functional monopoly, and forced Intuit to sell CreditKarma Tax in order to complete the acquisition.[2]

They’re also strong at sniping competition early, before it becomes a serious threat. <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20130808/a-techstars-first-startup-goodapril-gets-acquired-before-demo-day/">GoodApril</a> is an example; the company went through TechStars in 2013 and was focused on tax planning, initially for gig economy workers. Intuit acquired them before demo day, pre-empting their Series A.[3] 
</p>
<p>

More recently, from the outside looking in, you’d think they missed CreditKarma Tax by acquiring Credit Karma and selling the tax business to Cash App. I think more likely, CK gained scale before threatening Intuit by launching the tax product. The acquisition was at least valuable for a) securing CK’s distribution for TurboTax’s use and b) reducing the likelihood that a good competitor would emerge. You might bet that Cash App successfully executes on the transaction, but it’s at least not a guarantee, from Intuit’s perspective. 
</p><p>

TurboTax also owns the namespace for consumer taxes. Every year between January and April they become the top finance app and a top 10 app in the US Appstore. It’s possible someone builds a better direct to consumer product focused on tax prep, but I’m skeptical.
        </p>

          </p>
        <p>
            All things considered, I think TurboTax is a fantastic business, and will be tough to compete with head on. It’s more likely that the following pieces come together to obviate TurboTax.
</p>
          <p>

Consumer finance distribution + tax prep API + differentiated tax planning (eg real-time tax computation)


        </p>
        <h2>The challenge</h2>
        
        <p>
Unseating TurboTax has been hard historically for a few reasons.
</p>

<h3>Superb distribution</h3>
<p>
As a startup, you have a 3.5 month window every year to acquire tax customers. During tax season, TurboTax already dominates the organic acquisition, Appstore rankings and paid acquisition channels. They’ve been doing it for years, they’re probably quite efficient, and you’re not going to outspend (or smartly out acquire) Turbotax from New Years day to tax day. [4]
</p>
      <div>
        
        <p><img src="https://kunle.app/images/appstore.jpeg">
        </p>
        
      </div>
            
          

<h3>Perception &amp; Quality</h3>
<p>
Doing taxes well for mainstream consumers is complicated, and the consequences of getting them wrong are both bewildering and material. Every year the tax code gets more complex. This benefits the player who already has internally encoded the complexity, and for whom additional complexity is incremental rather than absolute (starting from 0). Simply put, you have one shot to build customer trust, and if you get it wrong you really screw up the customer’s life. Why would any consumer take that risk? 
</p>
<p>

TurboTax has been doing your taxes for years, already has your previous filings, and will use them to prefill tons of fields for you. All the while, you’ve probably never been audited. It just works.
</p>

<h2>It’s time to build (tax prep software)</h2>
<p>
To defeat TurboTax, a lot of the ingredients exist already. They’re just in the process of being assembled.
</p>

<h3>Consumer Finance Distribution</h3>
<p>
To defeat Turbotax, you need consumer distribution that’s as good or better than what TurboTax has. Without this, they’ll outspend you on customer acquisition every tax season, long before you can make a dent. It helps to already have established consumer trust with an adjacent offering, because if the only benefit of your product is tax preparation, you’ll be forced to acquire customers during tax season and compete head on, and you’ll be outspent.
</p>
<p>
Today, multiple consumer finance products already have the distribution necessary to compete. These include products like Cash App, Chime, Venmo, Robinhood and others, which have wide ranging customer trust and customer bases in the tens of millions each. Crucially, these products acquire customers upstream of tax season - they provide financial services to consumers all year around. They also already have a partial picture into a customer’s financial life, and they’re already thinking about customers’ tax needs. Cash App has taken a first party approach (by buying Credit Karma Tax).
</p>
<div>
        
        <p><img src="https://kunle.app/images/robinhood.jpeg">
</p>
        
      </div>

<p>
 
Robinhood has taken a lead gen approach (by partnering with TurboTax). No one’s built on a tax API (because none currently exist). [5] For TurboTax this will be death by a thousand cuts - it will be years before a single player files more taxes than TurboTax. But the top 5 neobanks can drain enough volume to have a material impact.
</p>

<h3>Differentiated Tax Planning: Real time tax position</h3>
<p>
Turbotax is insanely focused on consumer tax needs during filing season. To date, this has been sufficient to win. Over the last 18 months, however, “new” things are possible around taxes that weren’t before. Today, high quality income and tax withholding data is available via API. With this data, you can compute your tax position in real time at any point in the year, which has two core financial benefits; a) you can know your tax liability at any point in the year with reasonable precision, and b) with that knowledge, you can optimize it. For instance, you could build a continuous W2 with Pinwheel’s <a href="https://docs.getpinwheel.com/docs/api/reference/pinwheel-api.v1.json/paths/~1accounts~1%7Baccount_id%7D~1paystubs/get">paystubs endpoint.</a>
</p>
<p>
This financial benefit wasn’t possible before the last couple of years, and it’s outside of TurboTax’s wheelhouse, because TurboTax optimizes and monetizes the tax transaction at year end, and essentially re-acquires taxpayers each season. Outside of tax season, I basically don’t log into TurboTax.
</p>
<p>
Over the last couple of years, several companies have emerged that provide programmatic, API based access to high quality income and wage data for consumers, including <a href="https://www.getpinwheel.com/">Pinwheel</a> (where I’m invested), <a href="https://argyle.com/">Argyle</a>, and <a href="https://atomic.financial/">Atomic</a>. I suspect <a href="https://plaid.com/docs/deposit-switch/">Plaid's deposit switch</a> team will eventually offer this as well.


Any consumer finance company can now provide a few foundational benefits to customers: 
</p><ul>
<li>Building the customer’s tax forms (eg W2 or 1099) continuously throughout the year using their payroll data</li>
<li>Providing the user a rolling, real-time view of their tax position (taxes owed, refunds) as they earn and spend throughout the year</li>
<li>Trust from the customer that you’re the right company to help file their taxes at year end. At year end - customers press a button, answer some qualifying questions, and electronically file the taxes</li>
</ul>

<p>
On top of these foundational benefits, there’s even more financial benefits that can be built. These are less straightforward, but no less valuable:
</p><ul>
<li><span>Tax refund factoring;</span> providing consumers access to refunds prior to tax season. There’s a bunch of regulatory complexity here and some fraud to account for, including users omitting crucial info to overstate their refunds. </li>
<li><span>Tax optimization;</span> recommending changes to income and spend behavior to improve year end tax liability positioning. This already happens a lot at the high end through concepts like tax loss harvesting and smb expense write offs; it’s just rarer for regular W2 and 1099 earners. In today’s world, by the time you’re logging into TurboTax, you’ve missed any shot at optimizing your tax position. Optimizations include amounts to save in tax advantaged accounts like HSA’s and 401Ks, tax allowances you’re eligible for, etc.</li>
<li><span>Spend categorization for tax purposes;</span> paired with an issued card, you can help categorize transactions and suggest which to save receipts for at year end. Mint and other PFMs focus on transaction categorization for budgeting; no one’s really focused on it for personal taxes. [6]</li>
<li><span>Advance capital gains optimisation;</span> tax loss harvesting tools exist, but with where rates are now there are interesting package strategies to allow customers finance instead of selling assets.[7] This starts with creating a live Schedule D and some scenario analysis tools which show customers their alternatives to getting cash today.</li>
</ul>


<p>
At its heart, this approach reaches the customer for a tax use case upstream of when TurboTax acquires them. This means a) you’re not competing at the time of year when TurboTax’s acquisition dollars will drown you, and b) you’re acquiring the customer mid-year, before taxes consume their attention. The best time to optimize your taxes are long before you have to pay them, and neobanks are well placed to provide this benefit.
</p>

<h2>What’s missing: tax preparation as an API</h2>
<p>
Today, there are lots of companies providing tax filing APIs, that would allow a tax preparer electronically file taxes that have already been prepared. From what I can see, no one’s building an API that manages the preparation of taxes. At a minimum you need a system that 
</p><ul>
<li>takes the various inputs (1099, W2 etc) and computes a tax position
asks a series of leading questions to learn more about the consumer (things like whether you’re married, head of household etc) to improve the tax …</li></ul></div></div>

<p>As a software engineer, I have spent (I figure) more than 10,000 hours writing
code, deconstructing simple to complex problems into pieces then weaving them
carefully together to create a program. It occurred to me that any piece of code
that is broken into different parts which call each other is itself a graph or
network. As my software career has also been firmly rooted in open-source,
I wondered what these graphs would look like for some of the most popular 
open-source projects. Being also a data engineer, and someone who has focused 
on development in the Java language, I decided to look at projects centered 
around data written in Java.</p>

<p>There are really two parts to doing this. First, find a way to parse Java code to
extract its network of logic. And second, to visualize then analyze it.</p>



<p>Fortunately, the difficult part of #1 has already been done. The github project 
<a href="https://github.com/gousiosg/java-callgraph">java-callgraph</a> by Dr. Georgios Gousios
will read through a jar file, and output a file describing its class and method
references. Great! I also want to thank the tremendous amount of effort that has 
been put into these open-source projects. Without them, most of what I do in my 
job would not be possible.</p>



<p>Once I compiled the java-callgraph project and ran it against a jar file, I then 
had to write code which could parse that output and save it in a graph file format 
that Gephi could read for the visualization. A couple hours of coding/testing later 
and I had a nice flexible tool that could do this (as well as store it in any graph
database I want that's supported by the <a href="http://www.tinkerpop.com/">Tinkerpop Framework</a>).</p>

<p>Simply loading the entire graph leads to two main network components (two
separated graph sections). That's because java-callgraph maps two types of
connections: class dependencies, and method calls. For simplicity reasons, I
chose to just focus on the class dependency aspect of the code graph where a
more pronounced topology appears. Another post sometime looking at the method
call graphs would be interesting. I also am filtering the nodes to only those
authored by the project itself rather than dependencies it has to the native
Java classes or other libraries.</p>



<p>I'm doing a pretty simple visualization: coloring based on simple community
detection, force separation layout, and sizing the nodes based on degree (in
this case, in-degree to highlight the classes most frequently referenced).</p>



<p>Here are the results.</p>





<p>Hadoop is a wildly popular framework that provides reliable, scalable,
distributed computing. It has had a very disruptive effect on how data is used
across diverse fields and industries. Often when people use the buzzword 
"Big Data" the technology they are describing includes Hadoop in some way.</p>

<p>For this one, I used the hadoop-core v4.3.7 library.</p>

<p><img src="http://allthingsgraphed.com/public/images/java-call-graph/hadoop-core-import-graph.png" alt="hadoop code graph network"></p>

<p>The top ten most referenced classes are:</p>

<ol>
<li>org.apache.hadoop.conf.Configuration</li>
<li>org.apache.hadoop.fs.Path</li>
<li>org.apache.hadoop.fs.FileSystem</li>
<li>org.apache.hadoop.util.StringUtils</li>
<li>org.apache.hadoop.mapred.JobConf</li>
<li>org.apache.hadoop.io.Writable</li>
<li>org.apache.hadoop.io.Text</li>
<li>org.apache.hadoop.security.UserGroupInformation</li>
<li>org.apache.hadoop.classification.InterfaceAudience</li>
<li>org.apache.hadoop.util.ReflectionUtils</li>
</ol>

<p>Prominent communities:</p>

<ul>
<li>The pink-purple community on the left roughly correlates to the HDFS,
datanode/namenode code.</li>
<li>The green community on the right has much of the map-reduce server code.</li>
<li>The yellow community at the top is mostly the map-reduce client and tracking code. </li>
<li>The red community at the top has a lot of map-reduce lib code. </li>
<li>The maroon community in the lower-left is the record.compiler package which is 
actually it's own isolated component.</li>
<li>And the violet community between the pink and maroon communities contains the HDFS 
web classes. </li>
</ul>

<hr>





<p>Spark brings many of the same concepts of reliable, scalable, distributed
computing and adapts it to the reality of falling RAM prices. As a result
you can experience 10-100x performance improvements in the latency of
distributed jobs which before worked primarily against disk in a Hadoop
environment. It isn't a competitor to Hadoop as much as it is an augmentation of
its capabilities; and it is showing tremendous potential to be just as
transformative as Hadoop was itself.</p>

<p>Here's the class import graph for spark-core v2.10-1.1.0:</p>

<p><img src="http://allthingsgraphed.com/public/images/java-call-graph/spark-core-import-graph.png" alt="spark code graph network"></p>

<p>This has some unique characteristics in its graph with nodes which fan out to
many other nodes. I believe this can be attributed to its being written in
Scala and the way that Scala code is packaged in jars.</p>

<p>Here are the top ten most referenced classes:</p>

<ol>
<li>org.apache.spark.Logging</li>
<li>org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD (Note: Spark is an implementation of
the <a href="https://www.cs.berkeley.edu/%7Ematei/papers/2012/nsdi_spark.pdf">RDD specification</a>)</li>
<li>org.apache.spark.util.Utils</li>
<li>org.apache.spark.util.JsonProtocol</li>
<li>org.apache.spark.storage.BlockManager</li>
<li>org.apache.spark.SparkConf</li>
<li>org.apache.spark.scheduler.DAGScheduler</li>
<li>org.apache.spark.ui.jobs.UIData</li>
<li>org.apache.spark.SparkContext</li>
<li>org.apache.spark.network.ConnectionManager</li>
</ol>

<p>Some prominent communities:</p>

<ul>
<li>The green community on the right (not the top) generally has most of the RDD classes.</li>
<li>The pink/purple community below it is mostly made up of the spark.deploy 
package with master/worker code.</li>
<li>The purple community below it is made up of spark.ui package.</li>
<li>The yellow community in the upper left is mostly the spark.storage package.</li>
<li>The pink community on the left has the spark.scheduler package.</li>
<li>The darker purple community on the bottom has a lot of classes involved in
tracking/reporting job progress and task execution.</li>
</ul>

<hr>





<p>Cassandra is a distributed, reliable, and highly scalable columnar storage
engine which grew out of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamo_(storage_system)">Amazon Dynamo</a>
specification. It too has been transformative and is used by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Cassandra#Prominent_users">many companies and
institutions</a>
in many different industries and fields.</p>

<p>I looked at Cassandra v2.1.1 to create this class import graph:</p>

<p><img src="http://allthingsgraphed.com/public/images/java-call-graph/cassandra-import-graph.png" alt="cassandra code graph network"></p>

<p>The top ten most referenced classes are:</p>

<ol>
<li>org.apache.cassandra.exceptions.InvalidRequestException</li>
<li>org.apache.cassandra.utils.ByteBufferUtil</li>
<li>org.apache.cassandra.config.CFMetaData</li>
<li>org.apache.cassandra.db.ColumnFamilyStore</li>
<li>org.apache.cassandra.db.marshal.AbstractType</li>
<li>org.apache.cassandra.db.ColumnFamily</li>
<li>org.apache.cassandra.utils.FBUtilities</li>
<li>org.apache.cassandra.config.DatabaseDescriptor</li>
<li>org.apache.cassandra.db.composites.CellNameType</li>
<li>org.apache.cassandra.db.Cell</li>
</ol>

<p>And a few of its communities:</p>

<ul>
<li>The blue community in the upper-left, is made up of cassandra.transport and cassandra.cql.</li>
<li>The green community in the center contains cassandra.thrift, cassandra.hadoop, and cassandra.cli.</li>
<li>The yellow-ish orange community in the lower right is mostly cassandra.db, cassandra.io, and cassandra.utils.memory.</li>
<li>The orange community on the right is a mixture of packages involving SSTables and compaction.</li>
<li>The red community on the bottom is mostly NodeTool classes.</li>
<li>The reddish pink community on the left has cassandra.cql3 classes.</li>
</ul>

<hr>





<p>Neo4j is a leading <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database">graph database</a>.
Graph databases have gained popularity recently as highly interconnected datasets 
and use cases to understand those connections have grown. Big drivers for 
this are the rise of social media, increasingly interconnected datasets, 
and advances in systems sciences. This is the "problem of organized 
complexity" described by Warren Weaver. I go more into this in my 
<a href="http://allthingsgraphed.com/about">about page</a>. I've also done an 
<a href="http://allthingsgraphed.com/2014/10/23/intro-to-graphs/">intro to graph databases</a> which talks about 
what graph databases, gives examples of how they've been used, and frames 
the history of graph/network science (see first part of that video).</p>

<p>For Neo4j, I used v2.1.4 of it's kernel library:</p>

<p><img src="http://allthingsgraphed.com/public/images/java-call-graph/neo4j-kernel-import-graph.png" alt="neo4j code graph network"></p>

<p>The top most referenced classes are:</p>

<ol>
<li>org.neo4j.kernel.impl.util.StringLogger</li>
<li>org.neo4j.helpers.Function</li>
<li>org.neo4j.helpers.Predicate</li>
<li>org.neo4j.helpers.collection.IteratorUtil</li>
<li>org.neo4j.helpers.collection.Iterables</li>
<li>org.neo4j.kernel.impl.nioneo.store.StoreChannel</li>
<li>org.neo4j.kernel.impl.nioneo.store.Record</li>
<li>org.neo4j.kernel.impl.nioneo.store.FileSystemAbstraction</li>
<li>org.neo4j.kernel.impl.transaction.xaframework.LogEntry</li>
<li>org.neo4j.graphdb.Path</li>
</ol>

<p>Some of its communities are:</p>

<ul>
<li>The green community on the bottom has much of the kernel.api and kernel.impl packages.</li>
<li>The red community on the right has neo4j.unsafe.impl.batchimport, kernel.impl.nioneo, 
and neo4j.helpers.</li>
<li>The orange community above that has a lot of kernel.impl.storemigration, 
kernel.impl.transaction, and kernel.impl.nioneo.store</li>
<li>The blue community in the upper-right has kernel.impl.transaction and 
kernel.impl.nioneo.xa.</li>
<li>Moving to the left, the yellow community has much of the graphdb.traversal classes.</li>
<li>Below that, the sea-green community has classes in the top-level neo4j.graphdb 
package, also has some in graphdb.traversal, and contains kernel.impl.core.</li>
</ul>

<hr>





<p>Elasticsearch is a distributed, real-time search and analytics engine. It has
become quite popular for real-time log analysis and visualization and is
commonly combined with <a href="http://logstash.net/">logstash</a> and 
<a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/overview/kibana/">kibana</a> (making the ELK stack).</p>

<p>This is what the class import graph looks like for Elasticsearch 1.4.0:</p>

<p><img src="http://allthingsgraphed.com/public/images/java-call-graph/elasticsearch-import-graph.png" alt="elasticsearch code graph network"></p>

<p>Top classes are:</p>

<ol>
<li>org.elasticsearch.common.io.stream.StreamOutput</li>
<li>org.elasticsearch.common.io.stream.StreamInput</li>
<li>org.elasticsearch.common.xcontent.XContentBuilder</li>
<li>org.elasticsearch.common.logging.ESLogger</li>
<li>org.elasticsearch.common.xcontent.ToXContent</li>
<li>org.elasticsearch.common.xcontent.ToXContent$Params</li>
<li>org.elasticsearch.common.settings.Settings</li>
<li>org.elasticsearch.ElasticsearchException</li>
<li>org.elasticsearch.common.base.Preconditions</li>
<li>org.elasticsearch.ElasticsearchIllegalArgumentException</li>
</ol>

<p>Some of its communities:</p>

<ul>
<li>The yellow community on the bottom is mostly elasticsearch.common.netty.</li>
<li>The orange community on the left is elasticsearch.search.</li>
<li>The blue community is a combination of elasticsearch.action, elasticsearch.cluster,
elasticsearch.discovery, elasticsearch.gateway, elasticsearch.index/indecies, 
elasticsearch.river, elasticsearch.snapshots, and elasticsearch.transport 
(a higher resolution of community detection would probably break these apart).</li>
<li>The red community on the right has the client and REST interface classes.</li>
<li>The purple …</li></ul></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Plugin GraphQL API for WordPress is now scoped. This means the plugin can be finally uploaded to the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/">WordPress plugin directory</a>.</p><p><img src="https://graphql-api.com/images/talking-business.jpg" alt="Talking business" loading="lazy" width="500" height="500"></p><p>To do it, I'm using the wonderful <a href="https://github.com/humbug/php-scoper">PHP-Scoper</a>. Using this library with WordPress does not go without its challenges, so I'll explain in this blog post how I managed to pull it out.</p><p>Sections:</p><ul><li><a href="#heading-taking-the-decision-to-scope">Taking the decision to scope</a></li><li><a href="#heading-checking-out-the-options">Checking out the options</a></li><li><a href="#heading-trying-out-mozart-and-failing">Trying out Mozart, and failing</a></li><li><a href="#heading-checking-php-scoper-and-coming-out-in-panic">Checking PHP-Scoper, and coming out in panic</a></li><li><a href="#heading-coming-back-to-php-scoper-this-time-for-good">Coming back to PHP-Scoper, this time for good</a></li><li><a href="#heading-php-scoper-the-easy-way">PHP-Scoper, the easy way 😎</a> 👈🏽 Here starts my solution</li><li><a href="#heading-show-me-the-real-stuff">Show me the real stuff</a></li><li><a href="#heading-testing">Testing</a></li><li><a href="#heading-check-out-the-results">Check out the results</a></li></ul><h2 id="heading-taking-the-decision-to-scope">Taking the decision to scope<a href="#heading-taking-the-decision-to-scope"><span> permalink</span></a></h2><p>A few weeks ago, Matt Mullenweg announced he'll be <a href="https://youtu.be/QI3qCoiuG3w?t=2268">keeping an eye on "the GraphQL plugin"</a>, obviously referring to <a href="https://www.wpgraphql.com/">WPGraphQL</a>. His expression demonstrates that he believes there is only one GraphQL plugin, when in fact there are two (the one left out is, well, mine). That made me realize how little visibility my plugin has, and I felt bad about it.</p><p>Matt didn't know my plugin existed. Nor does most of the WordPress community, for that matter. Clearly I'm not publicizing it well enough. I know that I suck in marketing and social media; I'm just OK with technical stuff (or so I believe). So I decided to do something about it, at least within my capabilities.</p><p>So this is what I'm working on:</p><ul><li>I just finished coding this same website, <a href="https://graphql-api.com/">graphql-api.com</a>, and launched it 2 weeks ago (yay! 🥳 Btw, how do you like it? Be welcome to give me feedback, via <a href="https://twitter.com/losoviz/">DM</a> or <a href="mailto:leo@getpop.org">email</a>)</li><li>3 days ago, I finally started scoping the plugin, and finished this task yesterday! (At 3 am, but it was worth it 😅)</li><li>And finally, I'm already working on the upcoming version <code>0.8</code>, which will be the first one available in the plugin repository</li></ul><p>Scoping the plugin is mandatory to upload it to the repository, because otherwise it could conflict with a different plugin, which requires the same dependency as my plugin, but with a different version. Having done it is a really big milestone; no other development is as important. For instance, I must still complete the GraphQL schema to fully match the WordPress data model, but that will be done steadily on each new release.</p><p>So in a few weeks from now, the plugin will show up when searching for "GraphQL", and the people who are actually needing to implement a GraphQL API will get to know of my plugin's existence.</p><p>Indeed, I do want my plugin to be seriously considered for the future of WordPress. I've been working on it for several years now. <a href="https://github.com/leoloso/PoP">The repo</a> was started back in August 2016; that is even before WPGraphQL existed, and at the beginning of GraphQL. But I didn't know that the project would become a GraphQL server; it took that direction only around 1.5 years ago.</p><p>(The project is actually a framework to build applications using server-side components, and a GraphQL server could perfectly be built using this architecture. So then I just built it).</p><p>WPGraphQL is an established plugin, and rightly so: it was started a few years ago, and a community was built around it. The work by <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonbahl">Jason Bahl</a> (who is employed by Gatsby) and <a href="https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql/graphs/contributors">the contributors to his project</a> has been outstanding: integrating WordPress into the Jamstack is now easier than ever.</p><p>But one thing is Gatsby and the Jamstack, and another thing is WordPress. WordPress is 40% of the web, not just an input to a static site generator.</p><p>So now, we can consider if WPGraphQL is the right option, without having this decision taken for us out of lack of alternatives. We can now analyze both plugins to see whose goals are more aligned to what's important for WordPress.</p><p>The GraphQL API for WordPress can also work with the Jamstack. But its main objectives are, I believe, more splendid: To "democratize data publishing", so that editing an API becomes as easy as editing a post (something everyone can do), and to make WordPress become the OS of the web.</p><p>Once the plugin is available on the repository, I hope more people will try it out and say "Hey, this is so friking awesome! How comes I didn't know about this stuff before?".</p><p>And then, the choice of "the GraphQL plugin" is not pre-determined, and the WordPress community can consider both WPGraphQL and the GraphQL API for WordPress based on their own merits.</p><p>Now that my motivations are out of the way, let's talk technical stuff 🤓.</p><h2 id="heading-checking-out-the-options">Checking out the options<a href="#heading-checking-out-the-options"><span> permalink</span></a></h2><p>Scoping a plugin involves running some tooling, that takes the plugin code as input, and spits out the scoped plugin. No big deal, right? How hard can that be?</p><p><img src="https://graphql-api.com/images/dog-scope-plugin.jpg" alt="Talking technical" loading="lazy" width="505" height="494"></p><p>Well, depending on the codebase, just executing the scope command alone won't be enough. After that, we need to check for errors in the console, fix them, test the application thoroughly, identify errors and why they happen, fix them, and iterate. To get it completely right, it might require some time.</p><p>There are 2 libraries for scoping, which have different goals:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/coenjacobs/mozart">Mozart</a>, for WordPress code</li><li><a href="https://github.com/humbug/php-scoper">PHP-Scoper</a>, for any PHP code, particularly when producing PHARs</li></ul><p>Because I have a WordPress plugin, I tried out Mozart first. Let's see how it fared.</p><h2 id="heading-trying-out-mozart-and-failing">Trying out Mozart, and failing<a href="#heading-trying-out-mozart-and-failing"><span> permalink</span></a></h2><p>I tried Mozart around 1 year ago. For what it says in the documentation, "the <code>mozart compose</code> command does all the magic". So I expected it all to be very quick and simple, and go enjoy a daiquiri for the rest of the day.</p><p>Alas, Mozart never worked for my codebase. It kept running into issues, so the scoping never materialized. And I couldn't get the required assistance: I submitted a PR, but <a href="https://github.com/coenjacobs/mozart/pull/36#issuecomment-633013728">it was not considered for merging</a>, and I was not even notified about it, so I kept waiting until I naturally lost interest in this project.</p><p>I believe that Mozart couldn't handle some of the dependencies in my plugin. I'm making use of several of Symfony's components, including <a href="https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/dependency_injection.html">DependencyInjection</a>, <a href="https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/cache.html">Cache</a> and <a href="https://github.com/symfony/dotenv">Dotenv</a>, with everything managed through Composer.</p><p>Scoping PHP is not just about PHP, so the scoper will have many hurdles to avoid and challenges to solve. For instance, Symfony DependencyInjection uses <code>YAML</code> files to set-up configuration, and these must be scoped too. And the <code>composer.json</code> file contains the configuration for <code>PSR-4</code> autoloading, and this must be scoped too. And, I believe, Mozart couldn't handle these complexities properly.</p><p>But I'm sure that my experience is not the only one, and that there are many happy users our there. Also, my failed attempt happened 1 year ago, so I wonder if the tool has been improved since then. And then, don't forget the saying: "All scoped plugins are alike; each unscoped plugin is unscoped in its own way", so possibly it fails just for me.</p><p>If your WordPress plugin is simple, with self-contained logic, and scoping must be performed within PHP code only, then chances are that Mozart will work. You just gotta find out.</p><h2 id="heading-checking-php-scoper-and-coming-out-in-panic">Checking PHP-Scoper, and coming out in panic<a href="#heading-checking-php-scoper-and-coming-out-in-panic"><span> permalink</span></a></h2><p>So I headed for PHP-Scoper. However, I never even tried to try it, because I got frightened immediately by it.</p><p>To start with, <a href="https://github.com/humbug/php-scoper#wordpress">this tool does not naturally support WordPress</a>. And to continue, they recommend to take a look at <a href="https://github.com/humbug/php-scoper/blob/master/Makefile">their own Makefile</a>, which looks like this:</p><pre><code><span></span><br><span>MAKEFLAGS <span>+=</span> --warn-undefined-variables</span><br><span>MAKEFLAGS <span>+=</span> --no-builtin-rules</span><br><span></span><br><span>.DEFAULT_GOAL :<span>=</span> <span>help</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span>PHPBIN</span><span>=</span>php</span><br><span><span>PHPNOGC</span><span>=</span>php -d zend.enable_gc<span>=</span><span>0</span></span><br><span><span>IS_PHP8</span><span>=</span><span><span>$(</span>shell php -r <span>"echo version_compare(PHP_VERSION, '8.0.0', '&gt;=') ?

It looks like a riddle. Believing that I needed to understand that code just to scope my plugin, made me flee unceremoniously.</p><p>(Well, understanding that code is their recommendation to test the scoped application, but it is not required. We can also just run the command <code>php-scoper add-prefix</code>, let it do all the magic, and go drink our daiquiris.)</p><h2 id="heading-coming-back-to-php-scoper-this-time-for-good">Coming back to PHP-Scoper, this time for good<a href="#heading-coming-back-to-php-scoper-this-time-for-good"><span> permalink</span></a></h2><p>So, 3 days ago, I took a decision to implement scoping, somehow. I had to make it happen.</p><p>I came back to PHP-Scoper, to try it out in earnest. I knew that WordPress could be scoped with it from reading <a href="https://deliciousbrains.com/php-scoper-namespace-composer-depencies/">PHP Scoper: How to Avoid Namespace Issues in your Composer Dependencies</a> (by the brilliant folks from Delicious Brains). It was just a matter of attitude, and perseverence.</p><p>I explored some of the existing solutions, including:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/humbug/php-scoper/issues/442#issuecomment-736598602">This one</a> by Lucas Bustamante</li><li><a href="https://github.com/Yoast/wordpress-seo/blob/11.3/src/config/dependency-management.php">This one</a> by Yoast</li><li><a href="https://github.com/google/site-kit-wp/blob/80e3bd88317bf20bc5e5d6600428692fa8e3fc08/includes/loader.php">This one</a> by Google Site Kit</li><li><a href="https://github.com/google/web-stories-wp/blob/main/scoper.inc.php">This one</a> by Google Web Stories</li></ul><p>But they all look not fully satisfying to me: either the code seems hacky, or fragile and waiting to break at some time or another.</p><p>For instance, the Google Web Stories plugin scopes the code, and then reverts back each one of the conflicts:</p><pre><code><span><span>return</span> <span>[</span></span><br><span>  <span>'patchers'</span>                   <span>=&gt;</span> <span>[</span></span><br><span>		<span>function</span> <span>(</span> <span>$file_path</span><span>,</span> <span>$prefix</span><span>,</span> <span>$contents</span> <span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><br>			<br><span>			<span>$contents</span> <span>=</span> <span>str_replace</span><span>(</span> <span>"\\$prefix\\_doing_it_wrong"</span><span>,</span> <span>'\\_doing_it_wrong'</span><span>,</span> <span>$contents</span> <span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>			<span>$contents</span> <span>=</span> <span>str_replace</span><span>(</span> <span>"\\$prefix\\__"</span><span>,</span> <span>'\\__'</span><span>,</span> <span>$contents</span> <span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>			<span>$contents</span> <span>=</span> <span>str_replace</span><span>(</span> <span>"\\$prefix\\esc_html_e"</span><span>,</span> <span>'\\esc_html_e'</span><span>,</span> <span>$contents</span> <span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>			<span>$contents</span> <span>=</span> <span>str_replace</span><span>(</span> <span>"\\$prefix\\esc_html"</span><span>,</span> <span>'\\esc_html'</span><span>,</span> <span>$contents</span> <span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>			<span>$contents</span> <span>=</span> <span>str_replace</span><span>(</span> <span>"\\$prefix\\esc_attr"</span><span>,</span> <span>'\\esc_attr'</span><span>,</span> <span>$contents</span> <span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>			<span>$contents</span> <span>=</span> <span>str_replace</span><span>(</span> <span>"\\$prefix\\esc_url"</span><span>,</span> <span>'\\esc_url'</span><span>,</span> <span>$contents</span> <span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>      <span>$contents</span> <span>=</span> <span>str_replace</span><span>(</span> <span>"\\$prefix\\do_action"</span><span>,</span> <span>'\\do_action'</span><span>,</span> <span>$contents</span> <span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>      </span><br><span>    <span>}</span></span><br><span>  <span>]</span></span><br><span><span>]</span></span></code></pre><p>I understand why they do it, but I don't like it. Whenever a new WordPress function gets referenced, they need to make sure it also makes it to this list. It's too manual, too fragile.</p><p>So this was my challenge: Isn't there a simpler way to scope a plugin, and relying on code that we can present to our friends and colleagues …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In this short guide I will show you how to quickly install an OpenVPN
 server using an existing Docker image. It is possible to install an 
OpenVPN server, but with Docker everything is much easier. You don't 
need to buy a third party service, everything is completely free.</p><p>You
 must have your own VPS server. If not, you can buy a VPS on 
DigitalOcean. You can buy the least expensive from
 $2 to $5 per month.</p><p>I will use an off-the-shelf VPN solution built on Docker: <a href="https://github.com/kylemanna/docker-openvpn" target="_blank">https://github.com/kylemanna/docker-openvpn</a><br></p><p><br>All you need for the first step is to install Docker. I use Ubuntu OS.<br>If Docker is installed, let's move on to the next step.</p><p>I will use the following variables: <br></p><p><b>ovpn-data-example-uk</b> - It is for data volume container.</p><p><b>vpn.yourdomain.com</b> - The value should be a domain name or IP Address.</p><p><b>uk.vpn.yourdomain.com</b> - It’ll be used as a client definition.<br></p><p><i>These variables are test variables. You must use your variables.</i><br></p>

<p>Let’s begin by creating docker volume.</p>
<pre>docker volume create --name ovpn-data-example-uk</pre>

<p>The next step is to initialize the container.</p>

<pre>docker run \
    -v ovpn-data-example-uk:/etc/openvpn \
    --log-driver=none \
    --rm \
    kylemanna/openvpn \
    ovpn_genconfig \
        -u udp://vpn.yourdomain.com</pre><p>The container will ask you for a passphrase to protect the private key used by the newly generated certificate authority.</p>

<pre>docker run \
    -v ovpn-data-example-uk:/etc/openvpn \
    --log-driver=none \
    --rm \
    -it \
    kylemanna/openvpn \
    ovpn_initpki</pre><p>After the previous process finished, we can start the OpenVPN server process.<br>
</p><pre>docker run \
    -v ovpn-data-example-uk:/etc/openvpn \
    -d \
    -p 1194:1194/udp \
    --cap-add=NET_ADMIN \
    kylemanna/openvpn</pre><p>We can generate a client certificate without a passphrase to be used on our local machine.<br></p>


<pre>docker run \
    -v ovpn-data-example-uk:/etc/openvpn \
    --log-driver=none \
    --rm \
    -it \
    kylemanna/openvpn \

Above-average compensation makes it easier to turn positive cash flow into investment capital that compounds over time. But more critically, owning equity in a startup offers an outside chance of exponentially increasing the financial baseline from which future compounding occurs.</p><p>Unfortunately, having a great startup mind does not necessarily translate into mastery of our complex financial and tax systems. Fortunately, there are a number of parallels between building startups and building wealth at startups that can help make the wealth building process a bit more intuitive.</p><p>The framework we’re introducing in this essay, <em>The Continuum of Building Wealth at Startups</em>, is borrowed from Will Larson’s approach to managing engineering teams outlined in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elegant-Puzzle-Systems-Engineering-Management/dp/1732265186/"><em>An Elegant Puzzle</em></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Whether building products or building wealth, you need to know where you are before you can figure out the appropriate steps to reach your desired outcome. Like building a great product, you will need to put together a team with the skill sets that will best fit the financial future you want to build. And, like a product, your financial future will constantly evolve as you learn more about what’s possible.<br></p><h4><strong>Teams, a Continuum with Four States</strong></h4><p>Larson offers a model for viewing engineering teams on a continuum with four states:&nbsp;</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Falling Behind</strong> (growing backlog of work)</li><li><strong>Treading Water</strong> (tackling critical work but not technical debt)</li><li><strong>Repaying Debt</strong> (paying down technical debt to create capacity for core product work)</li><li><strong>Innovating</strong> (creating something new because of sustainably low technical debt)</li></ol><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d60577d7a6c5d1ac084a849/6033f615e2aa87a35299461d_Continuum%20of%20Building%20Wealth.PNG" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>p 36</figcaption></figure><p>He writes “Teams want to climb from falling behind to innovating, while entropy drags them backward. Each state requires a different tact.” When a team is falling behind, it may be necessary to add more engineers. Treading water might require focusing on the core obstacle to scale and begin repaying debt. Innovation is possible when teams correctly navigate the different states of the continuum.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>At the risk of applying Larson’s map too literally, there are insights when used as a continuum of building sustainable wealth at startups.<br></p><h4><strong>Wealth, a Continuum with Four States</strong></h4><p><strong>1. Falling Behind</strong>, whether subjectively or objectively, can be a difficult burden. A variety of factors might influence it from a financial standpoint. Maybe salary from the current startup doesn’t even cover the bills or allow for 401(k) contributions. You may have launched a company that is yet to turn a profit and the debt is piling up. Or the opportunity cost of the current gig is unsettling relative to peers at FAANGs or other recently coronated unicorns.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benefits of Advice</em></strong>: In these situations, it’s important to focus on building resilience. Specifically, accumulating cash to lengthen the runway. It’s impossible to know what decisions or bets will pay off in the future. Building a safety net allows you to trust your intuition instead of letting scarcity drive your decisions.</p><p><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where to Get Advice</em></strong><em>: </em>A financial coach or hourly financial planner (generalist) should be able to help with these needs. The goal is to establish or refine habits that will help transition to treading water with positive momentum. Relying on a TurboTax-like automated return preparer is probably sufficient unless you’re exercising ISOs or making an 83(b) election.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>2. Treading Water</strong> means there’s enough excess cash flow to meet current goals and obligations. But it may not feel like there’s enough forward momentum for things to be materially different in the near-term. You might be paying off the student loans on schedule, but they remain uncomfortably high. You may have a large number of vesting stock options but it isn’t clear when to exercise them or if they are even worth exercising in the first place.</p><p><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benefits of Advice</em></strong>: Decisions in this state set the foundation and create the ability to take risks over a longer timescale. Understanding conflicts in resource allocation over the next 3-5 years becomes a superpower. It also determines the investment risk allocated toward startup equity. An exit may be 3+ years down the road, but establishing systems in advance of the “yikes, my company just filed their S-1” scramble can be worth its weight in long-term capital gains rates (or QSBS exemptions).</p><p><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where to Get Advice</em></strong><em>:</em> This level of complexity may justify upgrading to a human tax preparer and certainly justifies proactive tax planning. For quality tax planning, look for a tax preparer (CPA or EA) or a financial planner (CFP®) specializing in equity compensation. If there isn’t much complexity beyond equity compensation, layering an automated investment solution (like Wealthfront or Betterment) on top of the tax planning is a great starting step to diversify across the public markets. <em>*Endnote has more info on types of firms and professionals that provide advice*</em><br></p><p><strong>3. Repaying Debt</strong> with new cash might be possible due to a promotion or a moderate liquidity event. Debt is commonly financial, but it could also be social or physical from years of deprioritizing your health and personal relationships. Repayment could look like eliminating student loans, taking a sabbatical for self-care, or reducing barriers to do something new in the future.</p><p><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benefits of Advice</em></strong>: Wise capital allocation is necessary for making the most of this state. Because repaying debt is often early evidence of scale, the advice is most useful when highly personalized and provided by niche expertise. Progress down the wrong path can be as frustrating as no progress at all. At this point, inefficiency and miscommunication are increasingly expensive. Greater complexity could warrant building a core team for tax return prep, tax strategy, financial planning, and investment management.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where to Get Advice</em></strong><em>: </em>If looking for a one-stop solution, a boutique RIA<em>*</em> or large, multi-billion-dollar RIA<em>*</em> would provide the best experience. The best firms that specialize in startup wealth will do tax work in-house and operate as a board of directors for your household’s wealth. They may not handle everything directly, but they ensure continuity. The downside is that many larger RIAs have investment minimums, so hiring them may need to wait until a larger exit.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who prefer a DIY approach could hire an accounting firm<em>*</em> and pair that with DIY investing at a custodian<em>*</em> like Fidelity or Vanguard. Assets could also be parked at a wirehouse/bank<em>*</em>, like Morgan Stanley or First Republic, for more transactional investment services. This path is naturally less personalized, but some perks include niche banking features and discounts on lending rates. The responsibility of being proactive remains with you because of the nature of these types of relationships and the underlying business models.<br></p><p><strong>4. Innovating</strong> is easiest after a large exit or when investment capital produces enough cash flow to cover all lifestyle expenses. Uncertainty becomes less threatening because fewer things in the future need to be true to facilitate an experience you’d be happy with. You have the freedom to extend the timescale for strategic bets and leverage human capital for outsized impact and returns. New baselines of wealth allow for significantly greater control over your future and the financial flexibility that may have been unthinkable in the past.</p><p><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benefits of Advice</em></strong>: Advice in this state will be oriented around maintaining this state. To operate from a place of abundance over long periods of time, strategies should be comprehensive and coherent. Everything from customized investment strategies to risk management and estate planning to tax planning should be operationally efficient and aligned with your values.</p><p><strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where to Get Advice</em></strong><em>: </em>The same options make sense as for Repaying Debt but, depending on the size of the exit and desired client experience, a Family Office<em>*</em> style firm may be wise. A Family Office<em> </em>has a high-touch client experience like a boutique RIA does and offers a broader set of services such as lifestyle management and household staffing.<br></p><h4><strong>Deciding What’s Right for You</strong></h4><p>From a “jobs to be done” perspective, it’s important to prioritize function over features. Function helps you develop an intuitive understanding of trade-offs so you’re more confident navigating the continuum. Features are helpful to the extent they help staying engaged with the core function.&nbsp;</p><p>If DIY is not your style, be thoughtful about the team you put together. Consider the culture of the firm(s) you hire, their experience working with people like you, or alignment on the fundamental value exchange in the relationship. As part of due diligence, we encourage you to learn about the incentive structures and business model of the firm(s) you hire and make sure they always put your interest ahead of their own (not just when convenient). As you get the right team in place, you can be more attuned to what’s next.<br></p><h4><strong>Where Upstart Shines</strong></h4><p>We are world class at our craft but we aren’t right for everyone.</p><p>We work best with people who thrive on collaborative relationships and proactive planning. We do not have investment minimums and instead use complexity as a barometer for whether we’re the best fit for a prospective client. Upstart is structured to build long-term win-win relationships, whether that begins when a client is treading water or when they want help innovating.&nbsp;</p><p>Positioned somewhere between the boutique RIA and a Family Office, we serve as our client’s core team for strategizing about money and life. Our service offering reflects what we have learned is most relevant for folks in tech. Beyond the in-house tax return prep, this includes customized investment strategies - like integrating personal ESG values and managing concentrated stock positions - through individualized planning frameworks to navigate meaningful financial transitions from first principles.</p><p>A startup …</p></div></div>

            <div><p>These days the word "sustainability" gets thrown around a lot with respect to free and open source software (FOSS). What is sustainability, and what does it mean for your project?</p>

<p>The concept of sustainability didn't originate in the 1980s, but it gained a lot of mindshare at that time thanks to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Common_Future" target="blank">Brundtland Report</a>, which was released by the United Nations in 1987 after three years of research by a cross-functional team of scientists, policy makers, and business people. The report defines sustainability as "…development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs."</p>

<h2>The Sustainability Spectrum</h2>

<p>The development in question here is corporate, but this definition applies well to FOSS development also. However, across different projects the practical interpretation of the definition will look very different. At one end of the spectrum, for a small but popular Python library, sustainability may mean increasing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor" target="blank">bus factor</a> by doubling the number of core contributors, avoiding maintainer burnout, and thereby ensuring there will always be someone available to work on the project. Achieving this could require additional documentation, automation, and training in how to mentor new contributors, so it's not necessarily something that a project can do overnight.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the other end of the spectrum, there are projects like <a href="https://www.blender.org/" target="blank">Blender</a>, <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/" target="blank">Let's Encrypt</a>, <a href="https://inkscape.org/" target="blank">Inkscape</a>, and <a href="https://signal.org/" target="blank">Signal</a>. Relative to the number of users of these projects (frequently counted in the millions), they have few contributors (no more than a few hundred). Bringing on more contributors could be a goal for these mega-projects, but it may be a lower priority than providing for community and financial independence, scaling up infrastructure, or contracting for key development.</p>

<p>Frequently, discussions of FOSS sustainability end up couched in financial terms, but as you can see from the examples above it's not that simple. Paying a maintainer is great, but it doesn't contribute to the sustainability of a project if that maintainer is still working themselves to death trying to keep up with even basic project and community maintenance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Focusing primarily on money ignores critical sustainability elements such as <a href="https://archive.org/details/ato2019-successionplanning" target="blank">project succession planning</a>, which can provide breathing space for the maintainers of today while guaranteeing there will be maintainers to continue carrying the project into the future. This is a people problem, not necessarily a financial one, and it's complex.</p>

<h2>4 Big Questions</h2>

<p>In fact, upon closer inspection many projects may find that their path to sustainability involves a combination of people and financial elements that need to be balanced and prioritized. This inspection itself can be a difficult process, but it gets a little easier if the project community works its way through the Big Four Questions of FOSS sustainability:</p>

<ol><li><strong>Where is the project now? </strong>Now, be honest…what's the real state of the project at the moment? What are its pain points and bottlenecks? How many contributors are there and how do they feel? What sort of technical debt is the project carrying, including important but frequently overlooked things like documentation, user experience, security, and accessibility?</li>
	<li><strong>Where does the project want to be?</strong> Every project maintainer carries a "One day…what if…" picture of the project in their head. Share those pictures with the community—no matter how unrealistic they may seem right now. Have an open dialogue to coalesce all these pictures into one shared image that can act as an answer to "what do we want the project to be when it grows up." That image isn't a reality, and may not be for several years yet, but it can unify the community toward a common goal and help set a direction to better ensure the project evolves in a sustainable way.</li>
	<li><strong>How does the project get from where it is now to where we want it to be?</strong> Here's where the prioritization and balancing act comes in. You're probably familiar with creating a roadmap for software development, listing out a plan of features to work on and in which order. In answering this question you're creating a roadmap for project development. "Double number of core contributors" is a good feature for that roadmap, but it may have prerequisites and dependencies on "add contributor documentation" and "increase test coverage." Similarly, "Reach $25000 USD in yearly donations" can help to pay for scaling infrastructure, but it has its own dependency on "create a non-profit" or "find a fiscal sponsor," since managing that amount of money and the taxes involved aren't a trivial matter. Just as with software, thinking through these dependencies in advance can make project development less frustrating and more successful.</li>
	<li><strong>How does the project stay where we want it to be?</strong> Finally, this is the sustainability question. You can't answer this one—how the project can meet the needs of the present without compromising future needs—without answering the previous three questions. Thankfully, in answering the first three, most projects find that they've already been chipping away at this question. Answering it becomes a matter of sitting down and collecting all the existing thoughts, sharing them with the community, and revisiting them regularly to make sure the project is still on track toward sustainability.</li>
</ol><h2>Plan Your Approach</h2>

<p>Where are we now, where are we going, how will we get there, and how will we stay there? Being able to answer these questions is very empowering and can lead to stronger, more sustainable projects and communities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>How long it takes to answer these questions will depend a lot on the project, its needs, and its culture. Some will feel comfortable with something more agile, developing minimally viable plans and then iterating on them on a regular basis. Others may prefer a waterfall approach, coming up with a detailed roadmap to impress potential sponsors and contributors. The only wrong way to do it is not to do it at all, incorrectly thinking that project sustainability is something that you can put off until later.</p>

<hr>
This is a short, but to the point, piece i wrote, describing my dream of the 
Emulation Scene.
<hr>
<center><b><span size="+1">The Emulation Dream</span></b></center>
<hr>
	Heed these words, for this is the truth I speak and it lies in my heart.
<p>
	I haven't elsewhere to turn, but this page of my thoughts that, 
even though through time I may be forgotten, my words will live on.<br>
</p><p>
	It isn't about stealing software because you don't have the ability
of getting it through legal means.<br>
</p><p>
	Nor about creating the best emulator the quickest and charging the
most money for it.<br>
</p><p>
	Neither is it to be defined as an 'underground scene' where people
turn to for free handouts.<br>
</p><p>
	I hear the evil echos...of 'rom begging'... complaining...<br>
</p><p>
	But I have an epiphany...The Emulation Dream.<br>
</p><p>	
	This is my dream, hear me out and you shall enter my world...<br>
</p><p>
	I see a world where people, young and old alike, relive days gone
by when video games first entered my world.<br>
</p><p>
       Where people work together to help each other realize this dream, the
dream I have and others share, where the emulation world and its Nostalgic 
value exsists for one reason:<br>
</p><p>
	'Fun'.<br>
</p><p>
	In the days we are in, where Technology is advanced, and we have games
that 5 years ago would have required more money than anyone could afford, 
and yet we ask ourselves, have we REALLY advanced?<br>
</p><p>
	Mine is a world where we all strive to bring back those days, not a 
world where you exploit this dream of mine, of ours, to make money, not a world
where you seek free handouts like a welfare line, nor a pirate's haven, nor a 
hacker's shelter.<br>
</p><p>
	This is the Emulation Dream. It's not about 'releasing the most roms'
and it is not about 'making the best emulator the fastest and making money off
of it'. It is about that one single solitary thing that many modern games
lack.<br>
</p><p>
	'Fun'.<br>
</p><p>
	And for all of the emulation 'scene' not to beg for these game images
that most of us treasure for its wonderous gaming value would be a new day and
age in the world of emulation.<br>
</p><p>
	Maybe some of us shall move on, maybe life will change, but this world,
this dream of mine will not expire with me.<br>
</p><p>
	Or With us.<br>
</p><p>
	It will go on, it will continue to grow, this isn't my world anymore,
this is OUR world.<br>
</p><p>
	And may it always remain as such.<br>
</p><p> 
	Emulation Forever.<br>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>The Korean Stockholders’ Alliance is located in Yeouido, Seoul’s financial and political district, on the fifth floor of an officetel building mostly occupied by financial companies. Jung Eui-jung, the 62-year-old head of the Alliance and the sole resident of its office, points out the window to a large, bright-yellow bus parked outside on Eunhaengro (“bank street”), so named because it is home to South Korea’s two main state banks. The Alliance is an advocacy group that represents retail investors, with around 41,000 members. Its current mission statement is displayed in block letters on the side of the bus: “I hate short selling!”</p>



<p>Jung unveiled the bus at the end of January, not long after retail investors in the U.S. gathered on the Reddit forum r/WallStreetBets to drive up the share price of the video game retailer GameStop by 1,700% in a meme-fueled challenge to hedge funds who had shorted — in other words, bet against — the company’s stock. Helmed by a single driver, the Stockholders’ Alliance bus shuttles between Gwanghwamun, a public plaza often used for protests, and Yeouido, passing the stock exchange, financial regulators, and the National Assembly, in the hopes of igniting a similar movement in Korea.</p>



<p>Retail traders like Jung say that short selling is an exclusionary method of profiteering used by hedge funds to drive down stock prices and run roughshod over the little guys. That’s why the “David vs. Goliath” narrative surrounding GameStop has been so enthusiastically received by small investors in South Korea, who are known locally as “ants” — a nickname that captures their underdog identity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Not a lot of people really knew what short selling was,” said Jung, who founded the Alliance in 2019. “But the GameStop incident provided the spark of curiosity and awakened the public to the problem.”</p>



<p>As the story made local headlines, it stirred talk of a Korean copycat movement online. On Naver Cafe, the South Korean equivalent of Reddit, Jung later named the Alliance’s anti-short-selling campaign “kstreetbets.” The forum is where most of the group’s organizing — planning protests, petitioning regulators, and writing letters to lawmakers — is done.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As South Korea undergoes a <a href="http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/economy/economy_general/979164.html">retail trading boom</a> during the pandemic that has sent the country’s benchmark KOSPI index to record highs, this sort of activism has turned ants into a symbol of “<a href="http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/economy/finance/982101.html">economic democratization</a>” and an unlikely political force.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pressure from retail traders like Jung pushed the government to extend a temporary ban on short selling, which was initially imposed in March of 2020. Now, with the current ban set to expire in May, Jung is campaigning for an additional <a href="https://www.chosun.com/economy/2021/02/02/L67EV46KXBGGDEWOIAGAPSI2EU/">year-long extension</a>, if not an outright abolition of the practice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>South Koreans have historically tended to steer clear of stocks, preferring to <a href="https://biz.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2020/04/03/2020040302464.html%2523:~:text=%2525EC%25259A%2525B0%2525EB%2525A6%2525AC%2525EB%252582%252598%2525EB%25259D%2525BC%2525EC%252597%252590%2525EC%252584%25259C%252520%2525EA%2525B0%252580%2525EA%2525B5%2525AC%2525EB%25258B%2525B9%252520%2525EB%2525B6%252580%2525EB%25258F%252599%2525EC%252582%2525B0%252520%2525EC%25259E%252590%2525EC%252582%2525B0,%2525EC%25258B%2525AC%2525EB%2525A6%2525AC%2525EB%25258F%252584%252520%2525EB%252582%252598%2525EB%2525B9%2525A0%2525EC%2525A7%252580%2525EA%2525B3%2525A0%252520%2525EC%25259E%252588%2525EB%25258B%2525A4.">invest in real estate</a>. Recently, however, government curbs on property investments, stagnant wages, low interest rates, and high property prices have left people searching for a quicker buck. Jung estimated that the number of active ants has increased from <a href="https://biz.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2021/01/07/2021010702594.html">6 million to 10 million</a> over the past year alone.</p>



<p>Much of that increase has been among <a href="https://investpension.miraeasset.com/contents/view.do?idx=12857">millennials</a> — known as the “2030 generation” — who are <a href="http://economy.chosun.com/client/news/view.php?boardName=C03&amp;page=3&amp;t_num=13609701">approaching stocks</a> with a generational pessimism, embodied in <a href="https://imnews.imbc.com/news/2021/society/article/6076397_34873.html">terms like <em>yeoung-ggeul</em></a><em> </em>(a Korean portmanteau that translates to “scraping together your soul to invest”) and <em>bittu</em> (taking out debt to invest). <a href="https://biz.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2021/01/12/2021011202205.html">Shunning conventional long-term investment vehicles</a> like index trackers or exchange-traded funds, they <a href="https://biz.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2021/01/07/2021010702594.html%2523:~:text=%2525EA%2525B1%2525B0%2525EB%25259E%252598%2525EB%2525B9%252584%2525EC%2525A4%252591%2525EC%25259D%252580%25252065.8%252525%2525EB%2525A1%25259C,%2525EB%2525B0%2525A9%2525EC%25258B%25259D%2525EC%25259C%2525BC%2525EB%2525A1%25259C%252520%2525EC%2525B0%2525B8%2525EC%252597%2525AC%2525ED%252595%252598%2525EA%2525B3%2525A0%252520%2525EC%25259E%252588%2525EB%25258B%2525A4.">have</a> preferred to <a href="https://biz.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2021/01/12/2021011202205.html">buy and sell their stocks directly</a>, seeking mid-to-high returns. For many, according to one <a href="https://investpension.miraeasset.com/contents/view.do?idx=12857">poll</a>, stocks <a href="https://www.sedaily.com/NewsVIew/1Z5HQ1TAEZ">represent</a> a ticket to home ownership.</p>

<p>Technology has also lowered the barrier to entry since Jung began investing in stocks as a salaryman bank worker in the mid-1990s. The new wave of retail investors tends to gravitate toward easy-to-use <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-02/a-retail-trading-army-has-been-roiling-korean-stocks-for-months">brokerage apps</a> with low commissions and to finding trading strategies and tips online. “Back in the day, you’d study by reading books about stocks, but now the overwhelming trend is watching YouTube videos, especially for the 2030 generation,” Jung said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That has brought its own perils. YouTube can be a valuable resource for the wise, but a minefield of fraudulent advice for the gullible. In legally ambiguous KakaoTalk or Telegram group chats known as “<a href="http://h21.hani.co.kr/arti/economy/economy_general/48901.html">leading rooms</a>,” anonymous stock tipsters (“leaders”) sweet-talk credulous ants with promises of windfall profits before bilking them. Some leaders <a href="https://www.mk.co.kr/news/stock/view/2021/01/39881/">turn out to be running pump-and-dump schemes</a>. Or “they’ll pull tricks like pretending to be offering a free service before directing you to a room with a subscription fee,” said Jung, who noted that he has reported some of the chat rooms to financial regulators.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jung is also concerned by what financial experts have <a href="https://biz.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2017/03/06/2017030603181.html">cautioned</a> is the tendency of ants to go after risky, short-term bets. “South Korea might have one of the highest literacy rates in the world, but our level of financial literacy is very poor,” said Jung. “Ants do a lot of quick-hit trading — selling when prices rise a little but also when prices drop just slightly.” One popular <a href="https://news.joins.com/article/23875703">rule of thumb</a> for young ants has been “hitting five,” or cashing out whenever you reach a 5% return or make $45 (50,000 won) in profit. Many have also turned to margin trading, essentially borrowing money to buy stocks, which has recently become <a href="https://www.ytn.co.kr/_ln/0102_202101181804220081">more popular</a> than ever. With the Korean stock market <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228425122_Why_are_Korean_markets_so_volatile">notoriously volatile</a>, investors can easily end up losing more than they put in.</p>



<p>But when the ants work together, they can move markets. Last March, foreign and institutional investors, worried about the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, sold off a combined $46 billion (50 trillion won) of the benchmark KOSPI, pushing the market down to a dismal 1,457.64 points. <a href="http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_business/977810.html">Ants countered</a>, buying $43.58 billion (47.4 trillion won), propelling the KOSPI index over the 3,000 mark for the first time in history, in January of this year. The feat has been named the <a href="http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/economy/finance/976027.html">Donghak Ant Movement</a>, a tongue-in-cheek reference to the Donghak Peasant Revolution, an 1894 uprising of farmers against corrupt government officials and economic destabilization at the hands of foreign powers.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“The problem is that the Korean stock market system is designed to the advantage of certain players. Short selling is emblematic of that.”</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>“The stock market index has historically fallen before rebounding in times of crisis, and it seems like retail investors anticipated this scenario this time,” said Kim So-young, a finance professor at Seoul National University. “Once it became apparent that a lot of them were holding the line, more piled on, causing the surge.”</p>



<p>The ants’ ability to collectively flex their power has given them <a href="https://news.kbs.co.kr/news/view.do?ncd=5090525">undeniable political leverage</a>. In late 2020, the Alliance <a href="https://biz.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2020/11/03/2020110302008.html">successfully rallied against a government proposal</a> to expand capital gains taxes on stock investments for the top 5% of retail investors. Since December 2020, over 200,000 people have signed a <a href="https://www1.president.go.kr/petitions/595214">presidential petition</a> calling for the abolition of short selling, meeting the requirement for an official response from the government.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Proponents of short selling argue that it functions as a kind of safety valve for the stock market. By allowing investors to bet in both directions, the practice skims the fat off overvalued stocks and keeps the market efficient. But “the problem is that the Korean stock market system is designed to the advantage of certain players,” said Jung. “Short selling is emblematic of that.”</p>



<p>Short selling comprises only about 4% of total trades in South Korea, compared to around 40% in other major markets, but the point, according to Jung, is the inequality. “The dynamic is always one side disproportionately profiting, while retail investors are losing,” said Jung. “That’s what needs to change.”</p>



<p>Shorting a stock requires first borrowing the shares, which you then later buy back at a lower price to make a profit. Individual investors <a href="https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20210113116200502%2523:~:text=%2525EC%25259E%252590%2525EB%2525B3%2525B8%2525EC%25258B%25259C%2525EC%25259E%2525A5%2525EB%2525B2%252595%252520180%2525EC%2525A1%2525B0%2525EB%25258A%252594,%2525EB%2525B6%252588%2525EB%2525B2%252595%2525EC%25259C%2525BC%2525EB%2525A1%25259C%252520%2525EC%2525B7%2525A8%2525EA%2525B8%252589%2525EB%252590%252598%2525EB%25258A%252594%252520%2525EA%2525B2%252583%2525EC%25259D%2525B4%2525EB%25258B%2525A4.">face high collateral rates and fees</a>, <a href="https://www.msn.com/ko-kr/money/markets/%2525EA%2525B3%2525B5%2525EB%2525A7%2525A4%2525EB%25258F%252584%2525EC%25259D%252598-%2525EC%2525A4%252591%2525EC%25258B%2525AC-%2525EB%2525A6%2525AC%2525ED%252585%25258C%2525EC%25259D%2525BC%2525ED%252592%252580%2525EC%25259D%252598-%2525EB%2525B9%252584%2525EB%2525B0%252580/ar-BB1cDqVv">limited selections</a> of shares, and a repayment period capped at 60 days. Foreign investors and institutions, on the other hand, have no fixed repayment deadline — although lenders can technically recall their shares at any time. Moreover, capital gains from short selling are untaxed. Consequently, <a href="https://www.mk.co.kr/news/economy/view/2019/12/1054426/">just 1%</a> of short sellers in South Korea are small investors.</p>



<p>Retail investors, particularly those trading on margins, are also uniquely vulnerable to market volatility, which short selling can amplify — particularly in small stocks that are already sensitive to large movements. “There is definitely an aspect of short selling that stokes volatility,” said Kim So-young, the finance professor. “For stock that might not fall as dramatically if it weren’t being shorted, a short sell can exacerbate the decline.”</p>



<p>This has heightened the sense among ants that big institutional and foreign investors can use short selling to siphon money from retail traders. A <a href="https://biz.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2021/01/17/2021011700419.html">recently published study</a> by researchers at Hanyang University found that short sellers in Korea <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-28/short-sellers-under-siege-everywhere-have-it-really-bad-in-korea">averaged about $2 million in daily profits</a> from 2016 to 2019, while investors who traded on margin lost an average of $900,000 per day. “The rule here is that the money flows out from the wallets of individual investors to short sellers,” Jung said. “It’s a staggering gap.”</p>



<p>Although short selling alone is unlikely to cause the index to plummet, some analysts worry that the market is approaching a bubble and that <a href="https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20210203165200004">overleveraged new ants</a> could soon find themselves in trouble.</p>



<p>Jung said that authorities should use this moment to put in place protections and education for retail investors so that they can better handle volatility. He is also studying the fallout from the r/WallStreetBets incident. Many retail investors lost out as GameStop shares slumped again after the rush was over.</p>

                        <p><span>31-01-2021</span></p><h2>Using LiveView and GenServers to track BTC price</h2>

                        <p>My assumption was that price of Bitcoin varies from one cryptocurrecy exchange to another and that I could earn just by buying and selling BTC on different platforms. In order to check that I could just get prices from last few days from few exchanges and use Excel to do the comparison or I could use this idea to improve my knowledge on <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveView.html">LiveView</a> and <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/GenServer.html">GenServer</a>. As you have already guessed I picked latter option.</p>

                        <p><img src="https://cmdarek.com/images/ebisu.svg"></p>

                        <p>Our solution consist of two application: ebisu and ebisu_web. First one is responsible for periodically check BTC price in exchanges, saving this data in db and notifying ebisu_web about new pices. Ebisu_web is simple web application that shows BTC price from few exchanges in real time. To not add unnecessary complexity I'm going to describe solution only for <a href="https://bitbay.net/">BitBay exchange</a>.</p><p><img src="https://cmdarek.com/images/ebisu.gif"></p>

                        <h3>Main components</h3>
                        <p>To fetch data from exchanges we use <a href="https://github.com/edgurgel/httpoison">HTTPoison</a> which is simple yet powerfull HTTP client. Ebisu.Utils.Http is wrapper around this library. It is done that way to reuse it in multiple places and to mock it in tests. This component should be moved to separate application where we could test it with real api and in tests for ebisu app we should use mocks.</p>                       
                        <pre>                        <code>
defmodule Ebisu.Utils.Http do
  @timeout 5000
  @callback get(String.t()) :: term() | no_return() | {:error, term()}

  def get(url) do
    case HTTPoison.get(url, [{"content-type", "application/json"}], recv_timeout: @timeout) do
      {:ok, %HTTPoison.Response{body: body, status_code: 200}} -&gt;
        Jason.decode!(body)

      {:ok, %HTTPoison.Response{body: body}} -&gt;
        {:error, body}

      {:error, %HTTPoison.Error{reason: reason}} -&gt;
        {:error, reason}
    end
  end

  def new do
    Application.get_env(:ebisu, :http_client)
  end
end
                        </code>
                        </pre>
                        <p>To simplify code we have yet another layer of abstraction for http client. For each exchange we have specific http client. In <a href="https://bitbay.net/">BitBay</a> example we are going to fetch BTC price in PLN which we then convert to USD.</p>
                        <pre>                        <code>
defmodule Ebisu.Bitbay.Clients.Http do
  alias Ebisu.Utils.Http

  def get_ticker do
    Http.new().get("https://bitbay.net/API/Public/BTCPLN/ticker.json")
  end

  def get_rate do
    rate = Http.new().get("http://api.nbp.pl/api/exchangerates/rates/a/usd/?format=json")

    rate
    |&gt; Map.get("rates")
    |&gt; Enum.at(0)
    |&gt; Map.get("mid")
  end
end
                        </code> 
                        </pre>

                        <p>In heart of our application is exchange module which main responsibility is to get last price of BTC, converte it to USD and save it to db. Data is going to be stored in PostgreSQL using Ecto. For this to work we also have to define schema and migration.</p>
                        <pre>                        <code>

<![CDATA[How to Make a Contract Legal]]>

March 3, 2021 | https://www.lawdistrict.com/articles/how-to-make-a-contract-legal | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.lawdistrict.com/articles/how-to-make-a-contract-legal">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <div>
          <p>A <strong><a href="https://www.lawdistrict.com/">legal contract</a></strong> is an enforceable set of promises made between two or more parties. Both written and oral contracts can be legally valid, as long as all of the elements required to form a valid contract are satisfied.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-legal-contracts">Types of Legal Contracts</h2>
<p>There are <strong>two types of legal contracts</strong>: bilateral contracts and unilateral contracts.</p>
<p>The majority of contracts are bilateral. In a <strong>bilateral contract</strong>, <strong>each party makes a promise to the other party</strong>. A contract to purchase goods is a classic example of a bilateral contract. The seller agrees to deliver the goods to the buyer, and the buyer agrees to pay the buyer for the goods once they are received.</p>
<p>In a <strong>unilateral contract</strong>, <strong>one party makes a promise</strong> to be carried out on a future date in exchange for a present action <strong>by the other party</strong>. A good example of this type of contract is a liability Insurance policy: you perform a present action by paying your monthly premium in exchange for the insurance company's promise to pay your claims in the future.</p>
<h2 id="what-makes-a-contract-legal">What Makes a Contract Legal</h2>
<p>Contract law is governed by both the <strong>common law and statutory law</strong>. The <a href="https://www.lawdistrict.com/legal-dictionary/common-law">common law</a> is created through decisions made by judges, whereas statutory law is written by state and federal legislative bodies, such as Congress. </p>
<p>Generally, contracts do not have to be committed to writing to be enforceable. However, each state has its own <strong>“<a href="https://www.lawdistrict.com/legal-dictionary/statute-of-fraud">Statute of Frauds</a>”</strong>, which requires certain types of contracts to be written to be legally valid. However, all legally binding contracts must involve the exchange of something of value, such as goods, services, or money.</p>
<p>Legal contracts must also <strong>clearly and accurately describe the agreement between the parties.</strong> Errors, ambiguous or omitted terms, and mistakes can all render a contract invalid. For a contract to be as clear as possible, it should specify all the terms of the contract, accounting for any possible contingencies that may occur, when and how the contract will terminate, and any <a href="https://www.lawdistrict.com/non-disclosure-agreement/">Non-Disclosure Agreement</a> the parties want to include in the contract.</p>
<h2 id="elements-of-a-contract-legally-enforceable">Elements of a Contract: Legally Enforceable</h2>
<p>Every legally enforceable contract must satisfy four basic elements: Offer, Acceptance, Consideration, and Legality. Each of these elements must exist to make a contract legally valid.</p>
<ul><li>An <strong>offer</strong> occurs when one party makes a promise to do something or refrain from doing something.</li>
<li><strong>Acceptance</strong> occurs when the offer is accepted unambiguously by the other party. Acceptance can be given through words, actions, or performance of the promise required by the contract.</li>
<li><strong>Consideration</strong> means that the accepting party promised something of value in exchange for the offered action or nonaction. Consideration law is what distinguishes a contract from a gift. </li>
<li>The <strong>legality</strong> element requires that the contract serve a legal purpose. A contract cannot be used to enforce illegal and/or criminal activities. </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-can-a-contract-be-signed">How Can a Contract Be Signed?</h2>
<p>For a written contract agreement to be valid, it must be signed by both parties. The signatures are legally recognized as each party’s agreement to the terms of the contract and to be bound by the obligations of the contract. </p>
<p>Contracts can generally be <strong>signed either by hand or electronically</strong>. Until recently, “wet ink” physical signatures were the only type of legally-accepted signature. However, with the increase in international business and the improvements in modern technology, <strong>digital signatures are now a common and legally-recognized practice</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="termination-of-a-contract">Termination of a Contract</h2>
<p>Most written contracts will <strong>include terms that explain when the contract will terminate</strong>. Contracts generally terminate on a certain date, upon the performance of the duties of the contract, or at the request of either party.</p>
<p>Many written contracts will also include terms regarding <strong>how parties can terminate the contract</strong> if the one party fails to perform their duties under the contract. This failure to fulfill contract obligations is called a “breach of contract”, or just a “breach”. If the contract does not contain terms allowing for the termination of a contract upon a breach, then the non-breaching party can pursue compensation from the breaching party through the court system. </p>
<p>In court, there are <strong>several remedies for a breach of contract</strong>. Most commonly, the non-breaching party can sue for damages, requesting that the breaching party compensate for the loss suffered because of the breach. However, in certain situations, a judge may order that the breaching party perform the obligation required by the contract (this is called “specific performance”) or terminate the contract.</p>
<h2 id="what-makes-a-contract-invalid">What Makes a Contract Invalid?</h2>
<p>There are a variety of reasons why a contract can be considered invalid. Generally, a contract that was made with someone who did not <strong>have contractual capacity is not considered a binding contract</strong>, nor is a contract that was not mutually assented to.</p>
<p>People who are under the legal age of consent, who are mentally disabled or mentally ill, or who are intoxicated are not considered to have the mental capacity to form a contract. This means that any <strong>contract that is made with someone without contractual capacity is voidable by that party</strong>. The party who lacked capacity can choose to honor the contract or they can render it invalid.</p>
<p>Additionally, for a contract <strong>to be valid, all parties must have agreed to the terms of their own free will</strong>. This concept is called “mutual assent”. If one party induced the other party to agree to the contract through <strong>fraud, force, threats of violence, or other undue influence</strong>, the agreement is a <strong>voidable contract</strong>. Contracts may also lack mutual assent if both parties had the same mistaken belief about a fact at the time the contract was made.</p>
<p>Finally, a contract may be invalidated if <strong>one party fails to perform its duties.</strong> For example, in a contract for the sale of goods, if the seller never delivers the goods, the buyer will not have to pay. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><strong>In short:</strong> Microsoft Teams iOS client login screen can be bypassed after organization mandated login (refresh token) expiration has expired by dismissing the login view and tapping on the enabled user-interface elements. This behavior can be repeated an unlimited amount of times to browse section of the app and view protected data meant for a successfully authenticated user.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Expiration example: <em>Organization mandates re-authentication period of 18 hours. The user is no longer authenticated 19 hours after initial login.</em></li>
  <li>Cached data such as notification, teams, and chat are available.</li>
  <li>New Teams voice calls can be successfully joined with two way voice communication.</li>
  <li>The only thing needed for this is quick fingers.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7rak6WZwSI&amp;feature=youtu.be"><img src="http://ansonliu.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/team_poc_2_sanitised.gif" alt="MS Teams iOS vulnerability proof of concept 2"></a></p>

<p><em>Click above image for video version of PoC screen recording.</em></p>

<p>This behavior can be viewed in the iOS Microsoft Teams app on at least version 2.3.1 (tested working on 03MAR21). I have not tested this on the equivalent Android Teams app. Steps to access user data after your login expires are below:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Login to MS Teams account under an organization with a relogin (refresh token) expiration time of N. (Ex: Max lifetime of refresh token of 18 hours) MS Teams may be set to use a authentication method similar to <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-oauth-2">OAuth 2.0</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Wait N hrs for the refresh token to expire.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Open Teams iOS app. iOS client app will popup webview loading a login page at <em>https://login.microsoftonline.com/XXX/oauth2/v2.0/<strong>authorize</strong></em>.
&nbsp; - Before the login webview popup, the iOS client will find that the refresh_token is expired by a response from a request to <em>https://login.microsoftoline.com/XXX/oauth2/v2.0/<strong>token</strong></em>.
    <ul>
      <li>See <a href="https://oauth.net/2/">OAuth 2.0</a> for details on the <em><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-oauth-2#grant-type-authorization-code">Authorization Code</a></em> grant type login flow.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click <strong>“Cancel”</strong> button in upper-left of the popup webview containing login page. The popup webview will dismiss by sliding down off the screen.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Full interaction and information viewing is possible in the iOS client app for a brief period. Examples of tested data access:
&nbsp; - Bottom tab bar can be clicked to view different Teams data such as notifcations, chats, calendar.
&nbsp; - Pull to refresh on notifications view will intiate a refresh and load new data
&nbsp; - Clicking “join” meeting on calendar view will successfully join a team meeting and audio. (connection to <em>api.flightproxy.teams.microsoft.com</em> made) Creation of the meeting is logged and can be seen in the “chat” view of an event showing who entered the meeting.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="http://ansonliu.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/teams_call_history_blur.png" alt="MS Teams call chat history"></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>iOS client app may display a dialog indicating auth failure and an option to sign out. Click <strong>“cancel”</strong>. iOS client app will popup the login webview again.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Go to step 4. Repeated user privileged data access is possible by cancelling the popup login webview and tapping on parts of the graphical user interface during the few seconds before the login alert and webview pop up again.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>This login bypass and information disclosure vulnerability was submitted to Microsoft and assigned case #63474. Screen recordings demonstrating bypass of the login screen and ability to successfully join a call were shared as well. 
A month later, Microsoft replied that this “behavior is considered to be by design”.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We determined that this behavior is considered to be by design because after the tokens expire, the device still has cached data locally which is accessible to the Teams client.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Caching data locally to alleviate the need to redownload user Teams data is a normal design philosophy. However, the graphical user interface should not be designed to allow free access to cached data once the user access to the data is known to be expired/invalid. The separate data storage and data presentation functionalities of the Microsoft Teams iOS client application should be designed to mask or hide the cached data from view until the user has successfully reauthenticated.</p>

<p>Microsoft’s response also suggests that being able to join, speak, and hear Teams calls when not authenticated is expected behavior.</p>

<p><img src="http://ansonliu.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/teams_separation_clipart_diagram.jpg" alt="MS Teams Backend/Frontend role separation"></p>

<p>A simple and effective solution would hide visibility of the main Teams user interface when the user authentication has expired. Once the user has successfully reauthenticated, enable interaction and make the main GUI containing cached user data visible again. The Teams call infrastructure should also be patched to check if the authentication has expired before allowing a client to join a call.</p>

<p>If this is apparently intended functionality - maybe a helpful feature to peek at messages and join Teams calls when the user’s authentication is not verified - people should know more about the functionality of <strong>“Quick Fingers”</strong> when the user “forgets” their password.</p>

<p>01FEB21 - Reported bug to <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/">Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) Researcher Portal</a></p>

<p>02MAR21 - MSRC informs me that login bypass and information disclosure described is unavoidable “by design”.</p>

Why does the number of YAML files have an impact on the satisfaction level with the GitOps approach? To explain this, I came up with the following thought-experiment.<br></p><p>You’re tasked with building a factory lane. The inputs are pre-processed pieces of steel. You need to build an assembly line that takes those pieces and presses them to different screws. Those screws will go into extremely sensible medical equipment. If this equipment fails, this has severe implications. You need to have end-to-end auditability of what screw came from what piece of steel.</p><p><span id="hs-cta-wrapper-84799b9f-56cb-4884-bee8-6bd0d067207e"><span id="hs-cta-84799b9f-56cb-4884-bee8-6bd0d067207e"><!--[if lte IE 8]><div id="hs-cta-ie-element"></div><![endif]--><a href="https://cta-redirect.hubspot.com/cta/redirect/5890440/84799b9f-56cb-4884-bee8-6bd0d067207e"><img id="hs-cta-img-84799b9f-56cb-4884-bee8-6bd0d067207e" height="628" width="1200" src="https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/5890440/84799b9f-56cb-4884-bee8-6bd0d067207e.png" alt="Webinar: GitOps from the Trenches"></a></span></span></p><p>‍<br>So far, so good. Not a simple exercise but doable if you can control the input, right? If you get the exact same piece of metal in the exact same quality every time, it’s straightforward to ensure that the output is consistent.<br></p><p>Let’s assume the assembly line is perfect and is never the cause of failure. This assumption leaves the input as the only reason a screw can fail. Let’s say we only have one screw. This case can be characterized with the following graphic:</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5c73bbfe3312822f153dd310/602f7d784ef0c349adb1e5b5_screw-from-1-supplier.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>If the probability that the steel delivered by &lt;it&gt;supplier 1&lt;it&gt; works by 90%, the system’s (the medical equipment) overall probability to function as expected equals the probability of &lt;it&gt;screw 1&lt;it&gt; to work. This takes us to the following likelihood to fail:<br></p><blockquote>P(system fails) = 1- P(steel supplier 1 fails)<br></blockquote><p><strong>Solution:</strong> In the single supplier example, the failure probability equals 10%.<br></p><p>Unfortunately, life is more complicated. You now have three steel suppliers. Again, for sake of simplicity, we assume that steel from each supplier is used for exactly one screw in the machine. And our machine now consists of three screws that can each fail. In a graphical representation, it looks something like this:</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5c73bbfe3312822f153dd310/602f7d9aec665260b33367f8_screws-from-supplier-1-2-3.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>To keep the formula easy, we will assume the steel from all three suppliers works with the exact same probability of 90%.<br></p><blockquote>P1=0.9, P2=0.9, and P3=0.9<br></blockquote><p>The combined probability of the medical equipment to function as expected can be calculated by multiplying all probabilities.<br></p><p>We can simplify:</p><blockquote>P(system works) = P1*P2*P3 to P(system works)=P^n<br></blockquote><p>Which means the likelihood of the system not to work equals:<br></p><blockquote>P(system fails)=1-p^n<br></blockquote><p><strong>Solution</strong>: Putting in the actual numbers this leaves us with 27.1% likelihood that this system fails at some point.<br></p><blockquote>P(system fails) = 1-0.9^3 = 0.271 or 27,1%<br></blockquote><p>Reality is even more screwed (haha). You will have several screws made from steel from different suppliers. We will refrain from complicating this further. You get the idea now.<br></p><p>&lt;it&gt;What does this tell us?&lt;it&gt; With an increasing number of suppliers (with their own unique likelihood of supplying failing pieces), your overall probability of failure rises. Remember, the likelihood of failure with a single supplier and screw was 10%. Where with three suppliers of three screws, the likelihood of failure equals 27.1%.<br></p><p>It also tells us that if you start simple, you can go for quite some time without experiencing any failures; You can actually statistically calculate how long you can go on before you experience the first failure.<br></p><p>In general, with a growing number of processes, failure will hit. Once failure hits, it also gets increasingly hard to ensure your audit trail. You’ll soon find yourself trying to understand what piece of steel - by which supplier - was used to produce the specific screw that then failed.<br></p><h2>So what?<br></h2><p>Why am I telling you this nonsense about screws, you ask?<br></p><p>Because it’s a good way to understand the fundamental problem with GitOps. The problem is not the toolchain (although mostly immature at the moment), but in particular, the nature of its input. Let’s translate the above example into our software world!<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Your assembly line is your GitOps toolchain and workflow.&nbsp;</li><li>Your suppliers are individual developers.&nbsp;</li><li>Steel is now a set of configuration files written in YAML</li><li>Your screws are microservices.</li><li>The machine you’re building is an application.<br></li></ul><p>If we have one service from one supplier, the world looks like this:</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5c73bbfe3312822f153dd310/602f7dc23cb13acb7b1e9b65_microservice-from-one-developer.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Now, let’s add microservices from different developers:</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5c73bbfe3312822f153dd310/602f7de3741d50926b298565_microservices-developer-1-2-3-yamls.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Your likelihood of failure rises with the same formula. It depends on the number of YAML files from individual developers that configure an individual microservice and the number of suppliers.<br></p><p>You will likely go without any trouble for some time and YAML volume. But the time will come where it will fail. And when it fails, GitOps becomes a nightmare to audit where the system failed: Finding what introduced the problem and why becomes a real challenge.<br></p><p>Using a version control system to browse and try to trace an error in <a href="https://humanitec.com/blog/tame-your-zoo-of-scripts">unstructured scripts</a> is a horrible endeavor (and gets more horrible with the total number of YAML files rising.)<br></p><p>Let’s change our original screws graphic. Also, we can swap the Y-axis with the probability of <strong>not</strong> experiencing failure of the system:<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5c73bbfe3312822f153dd310/602f7df94572daa055338527_probability-of-working-system-vs-number-of-yaml-files.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>This matches well with how the Director of Platform of a huge global delivery company has recently described his experience with the GitOps approach:<br></p><blockquote>“GitOps is like magic if it works, and like magic if it doesn’t.”<br></blockquote><p>In short, as you do not control the quality and consistency of the input, and the system is hard to audit, throwing an assembly line (or automation framework) on top is a terrible idea. It will not fail immediately, but it will eventually. If it does, it’s bad. Things get worse with time and the number of services in the system.</p><h2>So what to do now?</h2><p>You have exactly one way of solving this problem: You focus on the input.<br></p><p>Your problem lies with the unstructured nature of the “YAML” format. If you can solve this, you can use the GitOps approach (or anything else), and it will work. But if you decide not to eradicate the root cause, you’ll run into GitOps’ scalability and auditability problems.<br></p><p>Ádám Sándor from Container Solutions actually wrote a <a href="https://blog.container-solutions.com/gitops-limitations">great piece</a> on this. So how do you fix the input? How is configuration as code possible (with all its advantages), while load balancing the down-sides (the unstructured format and the lack of control.)?<br></p><p>The key is to remove or minimize the human error when creating those YAML files, which is the main cause of an increased probability of failure. The fewer “suppliers” you have, the less likelihood of failure you’ll have.<br></p><p>So how do you actually do that? You cannot erase it entirely, because it’s unlikely to believe that a.) a single set of manifests can rule them all and b.) the Ops team can write all manifests themselves. The solution is to work with “baseline configurations'' and let developers apply changes to those baseline configurations in a standardized way. Developers can create different baseline configuration profiles.<br></p><p>In those profiles, they set specific standards such as “the default CPU allocation on a workload always equals 0.25.”&nbsp; Developers can make changes against these default templates via a centralized UI or CLI. At deployment time, a tool (an <a href="https://humanitec.com/blog/what-is-an-internal-developer-platform">Internal Developer Platform</a>, for instance) can apply the changes to the baseline configurations and create the manifests.<br></p><p>As you can see, we are now “creating” new manifests from a set of clearly auditable rules for every single deployment. This is an immutable record of the state of application configurations at deployment time. Whether you use GitOps to then execute those configurations or any other method doesn’t really matter. As we are now tightly controlling the input, the assembly line isn’t as important.<br></p><p>This strategy provides the Ops team with more control over the YAML files and prevents any “surprise” changes by developers while still giving them the needed freedom to configure their applications.<br></p><p>In other words, developers aren’t restricted as they can still apply all changes if necessary while you eradicate input variability. But the nature of creating one set of new manifests per deployment makes it traceable, auditable, and simple to roll back to the previous version.<br></p><h2>Do you have a different experience?&nbsp;</h2><p>Look at our little formula. If you are a small team, or you work with a limited amount of services, your likelihood of regularly hitting problems is low, maybe very low.</p><p><span id="hs-cta-wrapper-84799b9f-56cb-4884-bee8-6bd0d067207e"><span id="hs-cta-84799b9f-56cb-4884-bee8-6bd0d067207e"><!--[if lte IE 8]><div id="hs-cta-ie-element"></div><![endif]--><a href="https://cta-redirect.hubspot.com/cta/redirect/5890440/84799b9f-56cb-4884-bee8-6bd0d067207e"><img id="hs-cta-img-84799b9f-56cb-4884-bee8-6bd0d067207e" height="628" width="1200" src="https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/5890440/84799b9f-56cb-4884-bee8-6bd0d067207e.png" alt="Webinar: GitOps from the Trenches"></a></span></span></p><p>If this makes it feasible for you, I’m not saying you should change anything. But if you are running 5+ apps with 10+ services, each in production, you should seriously consider whether getting into GitOps is a good idea.<br></p><p>&lt;it&gt;From my experience: it isn’t.&lt;it&gt;<br></p></div></div>]]>

<p>Today I am going to discuss quite a new idea for Python users, an idea of making tests a valuable part of your application.</p>

<p>Let’s jump into it.</p>


      <h2 id="current-status">
        
        <a href="#current-status">Current status</a>
        
      </h2>

<p>Right now the status-quo for source code/tests dualism is that you ship source code to your library users and most often do not include your tests in any manner.</p>

<p>Sometimes people also attach the <code>tests/</code> folder to a release, so they are just laying around just in case. Most of the time they are useless to the end-user.</p>

<p>And what is the most important part of it all is that our users are often find themselves in a situation when they have to reimplement some tests for library-specific things.</p>

<p>Let me give you an example: you have a Django view for authorized users only.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>django.contrib.auth.decorators</span> <span>import</span> <span>login_required</span>
<span>from</span> <span>django.http</span> <span>import</span> <span>HttpRequest</span><span>,</span> <span>HttpResponse</span>

<span>@</span><span>login_required</span>
<span>def</span> <span>my_view</span><span>(</span><span>request</span><span>:</span> <span>HttpRequest</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>HttpRespose</span><span>:</span>
    <span>...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So, in our tests we would have to write at least two tests:</p>
<ol>
  <li>For the successful auth case and our business logic</li>
  <li>For the failed auth case</li>
</ol>

<p>Wouldn’t it be amazing if we could just skip the second one and rely on some existing test-logic that we can re-use from the library itself?</p>

<p>Imagine an API like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># tests/test_views/test_my_view.py
</span><span>from</span> <span>myapp.views</span> <span>import</span> <span>my_view</span>

<span>def</span> <span>test_authed_successfully</span><span>(</span><span>user</span><span>):</span>
    <span>"""Test case for our own logic."""</span>

<span># Not authed case:
</span><span>my_view</span><span>.</span><span>test_not_authed</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And then - boom - we have our second use-case tested with just a single line of code!</p>

<p>And it goes further than this. For example, in Django you can stack function <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/http/decorators/">decorators</a> to do multiple things. Imagine this situation:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>django.views.decorators.cache</span> <span>import</span> <span>never_cache</span>
<span>from</span> <span>django.contrib.auth.decorators</span> <span>import</span> <span>login_required</span>
<span>from</span> <span>django.views.decorators.http</span> <span>import</span> <span>require_http_methods</span>

<span>@</span><span>require_http_methods</span><span>([</span><span>'GET'</span><span>,</span> <span>'POST'</span><span>])</span>
<span>@</span><span>login_required</span>
<span>@</span><span>never_cache</span>
<span>def</span> <span>my_view</span><span>(</span><span>request</span><span>:</span> <span>HttpRequest</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>HttpRespose</span><span>:</span>
    <span>...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So, the API might be a little more magical to include a test for all the possible cases:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># tests/test_views/test_my_view.py
</span><span>from</span> <span>myapp.views</span> <span>import</span> <span>my_view</span>

<span>my_view</span><span>.</span><span>run_tests</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And it can potentially execute:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Tests for http methods that are not allowed</li>
  <li>Tests for http methods that are allowed</li>
  <li>Test that <code>Cache-Control</code> header is there and has a correct value</li>
  <li>Test that unauthorized users are not allowed</li>
  <li>And possibly others!</li>
</ol>

<p>All you have to do is testing your green path with a possibility to customize some particular generated test cases if you have some specifics, like returning a custom http code for unauthorized users.</p>

<p>The bad part of this chapter is that the discussed API does not exist. And probably won’t ever exist in Django.</p>

<p>But, there are other less-known projects (but ones that I help to maintain) that already have these features. Let’s see what you can do with them!</p>


    
      <h2 id="deal">
        
        <a href="#deal">deal</a>
        
      </h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/life4/deal"><code>deal</code></a> is a library for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract">Design-by-Contract</a>.</p>

<p>In other words, it allows decorating your functions and classes with some extra checks that are not representable by types (at least in Python-land).</p>

<p>Let’s say you have a function to divide two positive integers (which are just <code>int</code> in Python):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>deal</span>

<span>@</span><span>deal</span><span>.</span><span>pre</span><span>(</span><span>lambda</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>:</span> <span>a</span> <span>&gt;=</span> <span>0</span> <span>and</span> <span>b</span> <span>&gt;=</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>
<span>@</span><span>deal</span><span>.</span><span>raises</span><span>(</span><span>ZeroDivisionError</span><span>)</span>  <span># this function can raise if `b=0`, it is ok
</span><span>def</span> <span>div</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>float</span><span>:</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>/</span> <span>b</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It has all the contract information in the function’s definition:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>@deal.pre(lambda a, b: a &gt;= 0 and b &gt;= 0)</code> checks that passed arguments are positive</li>
  <li><code>@deal.raises(ZeroDivisionError)</code> allows this function to explicitly raise <code>ZeroDivisionError</code> without breaking the contract, by default functions cannot raise any exceptions</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: type annotations like in <code>(a: int, b: int) -&gt; float</code> are not enforced, you should use <code>mypy</code> to catch typing errors.</p>

<p>Usage (remember, it is still just a function!):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>div</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span>  <span># ok
</span><span>div</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>  <span># ok, runtime ZeroDivisionError
</span>
<span>div</span><span>(</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>  <span># not ok
# deal.PreContractError: expected a &gt;= 0 and b &gt;= 0 (where a=-1, b=1)
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Ok, the simple use-case is clear. Now, let’s put a bug in this function on purpose:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>deal</span>

<span>@</span><span>deal</span><span>.</span><span>pre</span><span>(</span><span>lambda</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>:</span> <span>a</span> <span>&gt;=</span> <span>0</span> <span>and</span> <span>b</span> <span>&gt;=</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>
<span>@</span><span>deal</span><span>.</span><span>raises</span><span>(</span><span>ZeroDivisionError</span><span>)</span>  <span># this function can raise if `b=0`, it is ok
</span><span>def</span> <span>div</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>float</span><span>:</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>a</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>50</span><span>:</span>  <span># Custom, in real life this would be a bug in our logic:
</span>        <span>raise</span> <span>Exception</span><span>(</span><span>'Oh no! Bug happened!'</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>a</span> <span>/</span> <span>b</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Luckily, <code>deal</code> follows the core idea of this article and ships tests with itself. To run them all we need to do is write just a single test case:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>deal</span>

<span>from</span> <span>my_lib</span> <span>import</span> <span>div</span>

<span>@</span><span>deal</span><span>.</span><span>cases</span><span>(</span><span>div</span><span>)</span>  <span># That's all we have to do to test deal-based functions!
</span><span>def</span> <span>test_div</span><span>(</span><span>case</span><span>:</span> <span>deal</span><span>.</span><span>TestCase</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>None</span><span>:</span>
    <span>case</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here’s what the output would be like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>» pytest test_deal.py
============================= test session starts ==============================
collected 1 item

test_deal.py F                                                            [100%]

    def div(a: int, b: int) -&gt; float:
        if a &gt; 50:
&gt;           raise Exception('Oh no! Bug happened!')
E           Exception: Oh no! Bug happened!

============================== 1 failed in 0.35s ===============================
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As you can see our tests did find the bug! But how?</p>

<p>There are a lot of questions to ask:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Where did the data for the test come from?
It comes from another awesome library called <a href="https://github.com/HypothesisWorks/hypothesis"><code>hypothesis</code></a>. It smartly generates lots of different test data according to some specific rules we define.</p>

    <p>In our case, we have two rules. First rule generate two <code>int</code> arguments as defined in <code>def div(a: int, b: int)</code>. The second rule is that these integers must be <code>&gt;= 0</code> as defined in <code>@deal.pre(lambda a, b: a &gt;= 0 and b &gt;= 0)</code>.</p>

    <p>We can control how many examples would be generated and do other small tweaks.
More about it is in the <a href="https://deal.readthedocs.io/basic/tests.html">docs</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why <code>ZeroDivisionError</code> didn’t break the test while raw <code>Exception</code> did?
Because that’s how contracts work: you clearly define all possible cases. If something strange happens - the contract is violated. In our example, <code>ZeroDivisionError</code> is a part of the contract via <code>deal.raises</code> decorator. So, we know that it can (and will) happen. That’s why we don’t treat it as a test failure, while raw <code>Exception</code> is not a part of our contract and we treat it as a failure.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will it find all bugs in my code?
That’s the most interesting question. And the answer is <strong>no</strong>. Sad, but true.
There are endless use-cases, logic, combitations, and bugs in them. And I know for sure that it is impossible to catch all bugs your app has.</p>

    <p>But, in reality, it will catch <strong>a lot</strong> of bugs. In my opinion, it is still worth it.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We can even go one step further and represent our contracts as <a href="https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3">Theorems to be proved</a>.
For example, <code>deal</code> has an ongoing research companion project - <a href="https://github.com/orsinium-labs/deal-solver"><code>deal-solver</code></a> - that can help with that. But, this is a subject for another article of its own, so let’s move on for now.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/dry-python/returns"><code>dry-python/returns</code></a> is a library with primitives that make typed functional programming in Python easier.</p>

<p>Inside we have a bunch of interfaces that our users can extend for their own primitives/objects. In the recent article about <a href="https://sobolevn.me/2020/10/higher-kinded-types-in-python">Higher Kinded Types</a> I have shown how this can be done in a type-safe way.</p>

<p>Now, I am going to show that it is not enough on its own. And most likely you will need some extra laws on how your objects should behave.</p>

<p>We call this feature “Monad laws as values”.</p>


    
      <h3 id="identity-laws">
        
        <a href="#identity-laws">Identity laws</a>
        
      </h3>

<p>Let’s start from the easiest Higher Kinded Interface we have: <a href="https://github.com/dry-python/returns/blob/master/returns/interfaces/equable.py"><code>Equable</code></a>. It is an interface that allows type-safe equality checks. Because you can use <code>==</code> for everything in Python. But, our <code>.equals()</code> method will allow us to only check the object of the same type which has real values inside.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>returns.io</span> <span>import</span> <span>IO</span>

<span>IO</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>1</span>  <span># type-checks, but pointless, always false
</span>
<span>IO</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>).</span><span>equals</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>  <span># does not type-check at all
# error: Argument 1 has incompatible type "int";
# expected "KindN[IO[Any], Any, Any, Any]"
</span>
<span>other</span><span>:</span> <span>IO</span><span>[</span><span>int</span><span>]</span>
<span>IO</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>).</span><span>equals</span><span>(</span><span>other</span><span>)</span>  <span># ok, might be true or false
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here’s how it looks like at the moment:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>_EqualType</span> <span>=</span> <span>TypeVar</span><span>(</span><span>'_EqualType'</span><span>,</span> <span>bound</span><span>=</span><span>'Equable'</span><span>)</span>

<span>class</span> <span>Equable</span><span>(</span><span>object</span><span>):</span>
    <span>@</span><span>abstractmethod</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>equals</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>:</span> <span>_EqualType</span><span>,</span> <span>other</span><span>:</span> <span>_EqualType</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>bool</span><span>:</span>
        <span>"""Type-safe equality check for values of the same type."""</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s say we want to create a bad implementation for this interface (because of science):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>returns.interfaces.equable</span> <span>import</span> <span>Equable</span>

<span>class</span> <span>Example</span><span>(</span><span>Equable</span><span>):</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>__init__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>inner_value</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>None</span><span>:</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>_inner_value</span> <span>=</span> <span>inner_value</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>equals</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>other</span><span>:</span> <span>'Example'</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>bool</span><span>:</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>False</span>  <span># it breaks how `.equals` is supposed to be used!
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>It is clearly wrong because it always returns <code>False</code> without actually checking the <code>inner_value</code> of an object. But, it still satisfies the interface definition: it will type-check. That’s how we can tell that just the interface is not enough. We need to test the implementation as well.</p>

<p>But, equality has known laws from math to catch cases like this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Reflexive law: a value must be equal to itself</li>
  <li>Symmetry law: <code>a.equals(b) == b.equals(a)</code></li>
  <li>Transitivity law: if <code>a</code> equals <code>b</code> and <code>b</code> equals <code>c</code>, then <code>a</code> equals <code>c</code></li>
</ul>

<p>We can create a test that will ensure that our implementation holds these laws. Or we might forget about it. Or make a mistake in our test logic.</p>

<p>That’s why it is important for library authors to think about their users and ship tests with their apps.</p>

<p>For example, we encode laws into the interface definition itself:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>abc</span> <span>import</span> <span>abstractmethod</span>
<span>from</span> <span>typing</span> <span>import</span> <span>ClassVar</span><span>,</span> <span>Sequence</span><span>,</span> <span>TypeVar</span>

<span>from</span> <span>typing…</span></code></pre></div></div></div></div>

<p>Django 3.2 is just around the corner and it's <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/3.2/" rel="noopener">packed with new features</a>. Django versions are usually not that exciting (it's a good thing!), but this time many features were added to the ORM, so I find it especially interesting!</p>
<p><strong>This is a list of my favorite features in Django 3.2</strong></p>
<figure>
<figcaption>Image from the Django welcome page</figcaption>

<p>A lot of great people worked on this release and none of them is me. I included links to the tickets of each new feature to show my appreciation to the people behind it.</p>
<details open="">
    <summary>Table of Contents</summary>

<hr>
<details markdown="1">
<summary>⚙ Setup local environment with the latest version of Django</summary>
<p>To setup an environment with the latest version of Django start by creating a new directory and a virtual environment:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>$</span> mkdir django32
<span>$</span> <span>cd</span> django32
<span>$</span> python3.9 -m venv venv
<span>$</span> <span>source</span> venv/bin/activate
</pre></div>


<p>To install the latest version of Django you can either install using <code>pip</code>, or if it hasn't been released yet, install directly from git:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>(venv) $</span> pip install git+https://github.com/django/django@3.2a1
</pre></div>


<p>Start a new project and app:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>(venv) $</span> django-admin startproject project
<span>(venv) $</span> ./manage.py startapp store
</pre></div>


<p>Add the new app to the list of <code>INSTALLED_APPS</code>, and configure a PostgreSQL database:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span># settings.py</span>

<span>INSTALLED_APPS</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
    <span># ...</span>
    <span>'store'</span><span>,</span>
<span>]</span>

<span>DATABASES</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>'default'</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>'ENGINE'</span><span>:</span> <span>'django.db.backends.postgresql'</span><span>,</span>
        <span>'NAME'</span><span>:</span> <span>'django32'</span><span>,</span>
        <span>'USER'</span><span>:</span> <span>'postgres'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>To try out some of the new features, create a <code>Customer</code> model:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span># store/models.py</span>
<span>import</span> <span>datetime</span>

<span>from</span> <span>django.db</span> <span>import</span> <span>models</span>

<span>class</span> <span>Customer</span><span>(</span><span>models</span><span>.</span><span>Model</span><span>):</span>
    <span>joined_at</span><span>:</span> <span>datetime</span><span>.</span><span>datetime</span> <span>=</span> <span>models</span><span>.</span><span>DateTimeField</span><span>()</span>
    <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span> <span>=</span> <span>models</span><span>.</span><span>CharField</span><span>(</span><span>max_length</span><span>=</span><span>1000</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Finally, create the DB, generate and apply the migrations:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>(venv) $</span> createdb django32 -O postrges
<span>(venv) $</span> ./manage.py makemigrations
<span>(venv) $</span> ./manage.py migrate
</pre></div>


<p>Great! Now add some random customer data:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>import</span> <span>string</span>
<span>import</span> <span>datetime</span>
<span>import</span> <span>random</span>
<span>import</span> <span>pytz</span>

<span>DAY</span> <span>=</span> <span>datetime</span><span>.</span><span>timedelta</span><span>(</span><span>days</span><span>=</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>

<span>Customer</span><span>.</span><span>objects</span><span>.</span><span>bulk_create</span><span>((</span><span>Customer</span><span>(</span>

<span>)</span> <span>for</span> <span>__</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>_000</span><span>)))</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Congratulations! You now have 10K new customers, you are ready to go!</p>

<h2 id="covering-indexes"><a href="#covering-indexes">Covering Indexes</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/30913" rel="noopener">Ticket #30913</a></p>
<p>Covering indexes let you store additional columns in an index. The main benefit of a covering index is that when a query only uses fields that are present in the index, the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/indexes-index-only-scans.html" rel="noopener">database can use an index-only scan</a>, meaning the actual table is not accessed at all. This can make queries faster.</p>
<p>Django 3.2 added support for PostgreSQL covering indexes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The new Index.include and UniqueConstraint.include attributes allow creating covering indexes and covering unique constraints on PostgreSQL 11+.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If for example you are searching for names of customers that have joined during a certain period of time, you can create an index on <code>joined_at</code>, and include the field <code>name</code> in the index:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>class</span> <span>Customer</span><span>(</span><span>models</span><span>.</span><span>Model</span><span>):</span>
    <span>class</span> <span>Meta</span><span>:</span>
        <span>indexes</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span>
            <span>models</span><span>.</span><span>Index</span><span>(</span>
                <span>name</span><span>=</span><span>'</span><span>%(app_label)s</span><span>_</span><span>%(class)s</span><span>_joined_at_ix'</span><span>,</span>
<span>                <span>fields</span><span>=</span><span>(</span><span>'joined_at'</span><span>,),</span>
</span><span>                <span>include</span><span>=</span><span>(</span><span>'name'</span><span>,),</span>
</span>            <span>),</span>
        <span>)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The <code>include</code> arguments makes this a covering index.</p>
<p>For queries that only use the fields <code>joined_at</code> and <code>name</code>, the database will be able to satisfy queries using just the index:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>print</span><span>(</span>
<span>... </span>  <span>Customer</span><span>.</span><span>objects</span>
<span>... </span>  <span>.</span><span>filter</span><span>(</span><span>joined_at__lt</span><span>=</span><span>pytz</span><span>.</span><span>UTC</span><span>.</span><span>localize</span><span>(</span><span>datetime</span><span>.</span><span>datetime</span><span>(</span><span>2021</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>)))</span>
<span>... </span>  <span>.</span><span>values_list</span><span>(</span><span>'name'</span><span>)</span>
<span>... </span>  <span>.</span><span>explain</span><span>()</span>
<span>... </span><span>)</span>

<span><span>Index Only Scan using store_customer_joined_at_ix on store_customer</span>
</span><span>  Index Cond: (joined_at &lt; '2021-02-01 00:00:00+00'::timestamp with time zone)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The query above finds names of customers that joined before February 2021. According to the execution plan, the database was able to satisfy the query using just the index, without even accessing the table. This is called an "index only scan".</p>
<p>Index only scans can be a bit confusing at first. As described in the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/indexes-index-only-scans.html" rel="noopener">official documentation of PostgreSQL</a>, it might take some time before PostgreSQL can actually use <em>just</em> the index:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But there is an additional requirement for any table scan in PostgreSQL: it must verify that each retrieved row be “visible” to the query's MVCC snapshot [...]. Visibility information is not stored in index entries, only in heap entries; so at first glance it would seem that every row retrieval would require a heap access anyway.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another way to check if a table page can be viewed by the current transaction is to check the table's visibility map, which is significantly smaller and faster to access than the table itself. It may take some time for PostgreSQL to update the visibility map, so until then you might see an execution plan like this one:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>Bitmap</span> <span>Heap</span> <span>Scan</span> <span>on</span> <span>store_customer</span>  <span>(</span><span>cost</span><span>=</span><span>27.07..117.02</span> <span>rows</span><span>=</span><span>876</span> <span>width</span><span>=</span><span>16</span><span>)</span>
  <span>Recheck</span> <span>Cond</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>joined_at</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>'2021-02-01 00:00:00+00'</span><span>::</span><span>timestamp</span> <span>with time zone</span><span>)</span>
  <span>-&gt;</span>  <span>Bitmap</span> <span>Index</span> <span>Scan</span> <span>on</span> <span>store_customer_joined_at_ix</span>  <span>(</span><span>cost</span><span>=</span><span>0.00..26.86</span> <span>rows</span><span>=</span><span>876</span> <span>width</span><span>=</span><span>0</span><span>)</span>
        <span>Index</span> <span>Cond</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>joined_at</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>'2021-02-01 00:00:00+00'</span><span>::</span><span>timestamp</span> <span>with time zone</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>To check if your index can really be used for index only scans, you can speed up the process by manually issuing <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-vacuum.html" rel="noopener">vacuum analyze</a> on the table:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>VACUUM</span> <span>ANALYZE</span> <span>store_customer</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Executing <code>VACUUM</code> will also <a href="https://hakibenita.com/postgresql-unused-index-size#index-and-table-bloat">reclaim some unused space</a> and make it available for re-use.</p>
<p><em>UPDATE 2020-03-04</em>: I originally suggested using <code>VACUUM FULL</code> instead of plain <code>VACUUM</code>. <a href="https://twitter.com/Adrien_nayrat/status/1367153917239427078?s=20" rel="noopener">A commenter on twitter</a> mentioned that using <code>VACUUM</code> will be sufficient for this purpose, and will be much less intrusive and disruptive, so use that instead!</p>
<p>It is also important to keep in mind that inclusive indexes are not free. Additional fields in the index will make the index bigger.</p>

<h2 id="provide-timezone-to-truncdate"><a href="#provide-timezone-to-truncdate">Provide Timezone to TruncDate</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/31948" rel="noopener">Ticket #31948</a></p>
<p>I write a lot about <a href="https://hakibenita.com/sql-dos-and-donts">mistakes in SQL</a> and timezones are usually at the top of the list. One of the most dangerous mistakes when working with timestamps is <a href="https://hakibenita.com/sql-dos-and-donts#be-aware-of-timezones">truncating without explicitly specifying a timezone</a>, which can lead to incorrect and inconsistent results.</p>
<p>In Django 3.2 it becomes easier to avoid this mistake:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The new tzinfo parameter of the TruncDate and TruncTime database functions allows truncating datetimes in a specific timezone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In previous Django versions, the timezone was set internally according to the current timezone:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span># django/db/models/functions/datetime.py</span>
<span>tzname</span> <span>=</span> <span>timezone</span><span>.</span><span>get_current_timezone_name</span><span>()</span> <span>if</span> <span>settings</span><span>.</span><span>USE_TZ</span> <span>else</span> <span>None</span>
</pre></div>


<p>As of Django 3.2, you can explicitly provide a timezone to the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/database-functions/#django.db.models.functions.TruncDate" rel="noopener"><code>TruncDate</code></a> functions family:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>import</span> <span>pytz</span>
<span>from</span> <span>django.db.models.functions</span> <span>import</span> <span>TruncDay</span>

<span>Customer</span><span>.</span><span>objects</span>
<span><span>.</span><span>annotate</span><span>(</span><span>joined_at_day</span><span>=</span><span>TruncDay</span><span>(</span><span>'joined_at'</span><span>,</span> <span>tzinfo</span><span>=</span><span>pytz</span><span>.</span><span>UTC</span><span>))</span>
</span><span>.</span><span>values</span><span>(</span><span>'joined_at_day'</span><span>)</span>

<span># SELECT DATE_TRUNC('day', "store_customer"."joined_at" AT TIME ZONE 'UTC') AS "joined_at_day"</span>
<span># FROM "store_customer"</span>

<span>Customer</span><span>.</span><span>objects</span>
<span><span>.</span><span>annotate</span><span>(</span><span>joined_at_day</span><span>=</span><span>TruncDay</span><span>(</span><span>'joined_at'</span><span>,</span> <span>tzinfo</span><span>=</span><span>pytz</span><span>.</span><span>timezone</span><span>(</span><span>'America/New_York'</span><span>)))</span>
</span><span>.</span><span>values</span><span>(</span><span>'joined_at_day'</span><span>)</span>

<span># SELECT DATE_TRUNC(</span>
<span>#     'day',</span>
<span>#     "store_customer"."joined_at" AT TIME ZONE 'America/New_York'</span>
<span># ) AS "joined_at_day"</span>
<span># FROM "store_customer"</span>
</pre></div>


<p>A step in the right direction!</p>

<h2 id="building-json-objects"><a href="#building-json-objects">Building JSON Objects</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/32179" rel="noopener">Ticket #32179</a></p>
<p>Building JSON objects in PostgreSQL is very handy, especially if you are working with unstructured data.</p>
<p>As of Django 3.2, the function <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html#FUNCTIONS-JSON-CREATION-TABLE" rel="noopener"><code>json_build_object</code> from PostgreSQL</a> that accepts arbitrary key-value pairs was added to the ORM:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Added the JSONObject database function.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One interesting use case is serializing objects directly in the DB, bypassing the need to create ORM objects:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>from</span> <span>django.db.models</span> <span>import</span> <span>F</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>from</span> <span>django.db.models.functions</span> <span>import</span> <span>JSONObject</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>Customer</span><span>.</span><span>objects</span><span>.</span><span>annotate</span><span>(</span><span>obj</span><span>=</span><span>JSONObject</span><span>(</span>
    <span>id</span><span>=</span><span>F</span><span>(</span><span>'id'</span><span>),</span>
    <span>name</span><span>=</span><span>F</span><span>(</span><span>'name'</span><span>),</span>
    <span>joined_at_day</span><span>=</span><span>TruncDay</span><span>(</span><span>'joined_at'</span><span>,</span> <span>tzinfo</span><span>=</span><span>pytz</span><span>.</span><span>UTC</span><span>),</span>
<span>)</span><span>.</span><span>values_list</span><span>(</span><span>'obj'</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>first</span><span>()</span>

<span>({</span>
    <span>'id'</span><span>:</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span>
    <span>'name'</span><span>:</span> <span>'Haki Benita'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>'joined_at_day'</span><span>:</span> <span>'2021-04-25T00:00:00'</span><span>,</span>
<span>},)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>We already showed how crucial <a href="https://hakibenita.com/django-rest-framework-slow">serialization performance</a> can be, so this is something to consider.</p>

<h2 id="loud-signal-receiver"><a href="#loud-signal-receiver">Loud Signal Receiver</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/32261" rel="noopener">Ticket #32261</a></p>
<p>A while back I <a href="https://twitter.com/be_haki/status/1335921247306264579?s=20" rel="noopener">twitted about a mysterious bug</a> I had that went unnoticed for a long time because it happened inside a signal receiver.</p>
<p>When you use <code>send_robust</code> to broadcast signals, if the signal fails, Django keeps the error and moves on to the next receiver. After all of the receivers processed the signal, Django returns a list with the receivers' return values and exceptions. To check if any of the receivers failed, you need to go over the list and check for instances of <code>Exception</code>. Signals are often used to decouple modules, and handing exceptions from receivers this way defeats that purpose.</p>
<p>To make sure I don't miss exceptions in signal receivers again, I created a "loud signal receiver" that logs exceptions:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>from</span> <span>django.dispatch</span> <span>import</span> <span>receiver</span>

<span>def</span> <span>loud_receiver</span><span>(</span><span>signal</span><span>,</span> <span>logger</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>kwargs</span><span>):</span>
    <span>"""Subscribe to Django signal and log errors from the receiver function.</span>

<span>    When using `send_robust` to send Django Signals, errors happening in the</span>
<span>    receivers are kept and returned. Because signals are mostly used for decoupling</span>
<span>    modules, the return value from `send_robust` is often dismissed.</span>
<span>    To make it easier not to miss errors from Django signal receivers, use this decorator</span>
<span>    instead to log the exceptions to a specific logger.</span>

<span>    NOTE: Not necessary as of Django 3.2</span>

<span>    Example:</span>
<span>        logger = logging.getLogger('some.logger')</span>
<span>        @loud_receiver(signals.SomeSignal, logger=logger, dispatch_uid='uid')</span>
<span>        def receiver_func():</span>
<span>            pass</span>
<span>    """</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>_decorator</span><span>(</span><span>func</span><span>):</span>
        <span>def</span> <span>loud_func</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>func_args</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>func_kwargs</span><span>):</span>
            <span>try</span><span>:</span>
                <span>func</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>func_args</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>func_kwargs</span><span>)</span>
            <span>except</span> <span>Exception</span><span>:</span>
                <span>logger</span><span>.</span><span>exception</span><span>(</span><span>'exception from signal receiver'</span><span>)</span>

<h2>Intro</h2>



<p>A couple of weeks ago I read an interesting post on Reddit (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FPGA/comments/jvjskn/anyone_have_experience_with_chinese_zynq_boards/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.reddit.com/r/FPGA/comments/jvjskn/anyone_have_experience_with_chinese_zynq_boards/" target="_blank">here</a>, and also <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hackaday/comments/jwf3h4/hacking_the_fpga_control_board_from_a_bitcoin/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.reddit.com/r/hackaday/comments/jwf3h4/hacking_the_fpga_control_board_from_a_bitcoin/" target="_blank">here</a>). Seems like some crypto-mining farms were closed or reworked and therefore the online market was flooded with what seems to be crypto-miner control boards. The interesting stuff is that these are based on a Zynq z7010 and are sold for as low as 10€ per piece on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?SearchText=zynq+7000" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?SearchText=zynq+7000" target="_blank">Aliexpress</a>. If you compare these PCBs with the price of the Zynq alone, this is really really cheap! Although there are already multiple <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/xjtuecho/EBAZ4205" data-type="URL" data-id="https://github.com/xjtuecho/EBAZ4205" target="_blank">posts</a> mentioning the schematic and hardware in use, most of them lack details on the FPGA and Linux point of view. In the upcoming series of posts, I will try to tests its functionality, document problems or pitfalls (if any) encountered during the hardware “bring-up”, and provide some form of BSP (Board Support Package) for the board so that it can be used in any project.</p>



<h2>The Hardware</h2>



<p>No matter where you order, usually have two options, the board as is (with boot device NAND Flash) or with modifications so that the boot mode is set to SD-Card. I ordered the version with SD-Card, UART- and JTAG-Header already mounted. The condition of the board was quite nice, with only some small scratches on the bottom. After I cleaned the soldering pads, the PCB was almost perfect.</p>







<p>Some of the main components on the board, including headers, are highlighted below. The best resource for the schematic is probably <a href="https://github.com/xjtuecho/EBAZ4205" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. However, be aware, that the schematic does not reflect the state of the board to 100% when ordered with “SD-Card mounted”, since the boot mode pins were altered!</p>

<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Zynq XC7Z010-1CLG400C (green)</li><li>Ethernet PHY 10BASE-T/100BASE-TX (orange)</li><li>EtronTech 256MB DDR3 (yellow)</li><li>Winbond NAND Flash 128MB (blue)</li><li>33.333MHz Oszillator for PS (orange)</li><li>UART-Header J7 (white)</li><li>JTAG-Header J8 (magenta)</li><li>…</li></ul>




</div>
</div>



<h2>The Setup</h2>



<p>With the version of the PCB that I received, it was not possible to power the board with J4 (power connector at the bottom right in the image above). The reason for this is, that D24 is marked on the schematic as NC (not connected), and indeed, the diode is missing on the PCB. Therefore I had to use Pin 1/3 on any of the connectors DATA1-3. The board requires 12V on these pins and uses about 60mA if no SD-Card is inserted (in case you want to make sure it does not light up when connected for the first time). A simple USB to UART module connected to the pins on J7 (see above) will provide us a debugging interface.</p>

<h2>The Software</h2>



<p>I used the following <a data-type="URL" data-id="https://drive.google.com/file/d/16wQKpiYsH0gQ7KmnnYMrmFdCxwkF3WS4/view?usp=sharing" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/16wQKpiYsH0gQ7KmnnYMrmFdCxwkF3WS4/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Buildroot image</a>, which was already verified to work in order to boot the board for the first time. I also created a <a data-type="URL" data-id="https://mega.nz/file/sN4kgQCS#7P3qanUhiiZYH8z0iqO4ExUfTPlSWlgE7A2JuavI8C4" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://mega.nz/file/sN4kgQCS#7P3qanUhiiZYH8z0iqO4ExUfTPlSWlgE7A2JuavI8C4" target="_blank">mirror</a> in case the link does not work any longer (MD5 of the image: e5349351fc30bfcf91e4fa5b8e3b3cbe). If you are on Windows, Win32 Disk Imager can be used to write the image to an SD-Card. On Linux, using dd is probably the simplest method.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="405" height="205" src="https://embed-me.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/win32_disk_imager.png" alt="" srcset="https://embed-me.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/win32_disk_imager.png 405w, https://embed-me.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/win32_disk_imager-300x152.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 405px) 100vw, 405px"></figure>



<p>Once the system is up and running you are greeted with a serial terminal. For this image the login is <em>root/root</em>.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="938" height="68" src="https://embed-me.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ebaz4205_login_preb.png" alt="" srcset="https://embed-me.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ebaz4205_login_preb.png 938w, https://embed-me.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ebaz4205_login_preb-300x22.png 300w, https://embed-me.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ebaz4205_login_preb-768x56.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 938px) 100vw, 938px"></figure>



<p>At this point, we have come quite far with minimal work. We already know that the Power Supply, Zynq, DDR, and hardware modifications for SD-Boot are fine! I decided that the PHY/Ethernet is probably something that also needs to be checked at this point. Therefore, I modified the existing network configuration in <em>/etc/network/interface</em>s to make use of DHCP:</p>



<pre><code>auto eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp</code></pre>



<p>Finally, I made sure that the Port on my local gateway supports 100MBit (correlates with the PHYs capabilities) and also that DHCP is enabled. The figure below shows the end of the boot process when <em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://udhcp.busybox.net/README.udhcpc" data-type="URL" data-id="https://udhcp.busybox.net/README.udhcpc" target="_blank">udhcpc </a></em>gets an IP address assigned and we are able to send some greetings to google.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="942" height="680" src="https://embed-me.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ebaz4205_phy_preb.png" alt="" srcset="https://embed-me.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ebaz4205_phy_preb.png 942w, https://embed-me.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ebaz4205_phy_preb-300x217.png 300w, https://embed-me.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ebaz4205_phy_preb-768x554.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 942px) 100vw, 942px"></figure>



<p>I know, there is still some part missing in our verification – the NAND Flash, however, since there was no device in <em>/sys/class/mtd/</em>, I assume that the flash was not part of the device-tree and/or the driver is not compiled into the kernel. TBH, I don’t really care about this right now and will deal with it at a later point.</p>



<h2>What’s next</h2>



<p>I think we came quite far with only a couple of minutes of work! Of cause, this post relied on work that has previously been done by others, but it acts as a starting point. We did not write a single line of code, nor we had to deal with Yocto, Buildroot, or a bare-metal application for verification, and still, we can be quite certain that our hardware works.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://embed-me.com/ebaz4205-recycle-cheap-crypto-miner-part-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Part 2</a> of this series, we will make our own FPGA design using Vivado. This will then act as a starting point for our custom Linux distribution for the EBAZ4205 board.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Hot on the heels of Linode offering up AMD EPYC processors, DigitalOcean has
started to offer “premium” CPUs as part of their Shared CPU Basic plans.
Unfortunately, this new offering comes with a slightly elevated price, clocking
in at $6 per month instead of $5.</p>
<p>This new product offering lines up with Vultr’s “High Frequency” plans, with not
just a choice of Intel or AMD processor, but also NVMe SSDs. With the price
being a bit higher, I won’t be reviewing that particular plan on this post. If
the trend happens to continue with another provider, I’ll probably end up doing
a $6 Showdown as well as this $5 one.</p>
<p>As always, I spun up 3 instances of each provider’s $5 instances, in or around
the New York area, running Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. I’ve averaged the results where
applicable.</p>

                    <p>Cloud provisioning is a critical element of the modern cloud computing model.
We live in the age of microservices, where <a href="https://steampunk.si/blog/the-benefits-of-it-automation-and-why-you-should-start-using-it-now/" title="Post about automation benefits">automation</a> is not a
nice-to-have anymore. It became an integral part of everyday operations.</p>
<p>Luckily, there is a wide variety of <a href="https://steampunk.si/blog/introduction-to-configuration-management-tools/" title="Introduction to configuration management">automation and orchestration
tools</a> out there. Those tools can save us time while simultaneously
increasing the performance and accuracy of provisioning and configuration
management processes.</p>
<p>In this article, we will explore the benefits of <strong>cloud automation with
Ansible</strong>.  We will discuss several use cases that illustrate the power this
tool presents in the areas of provisioning, configuration, and compliance.</p>
<h2 id="ansibles-role-in-cloud-automation">Ansible’s role in cloud automation</h2>
<p>Ansible is, first and foremost, an automation tool. Given the right content
(roles, modules, and other plugins), Ansible can automate almost anything. And
cloud management is no exception, which means that we can automate our
provisioning processes with relative ease.</p>
<p>With a little help from continuous integration and continuous deployment
(CI/CD) products, Ansible can transform into a mighty orchestration tool. We
can start combining standalone tasks into complex workflows that automate
complex IT processes.</p>
<p>And if we bind workflow executions to events from our monitoring systems, we
made some serious steps towards self-healing infrastructure.</p>
<p>But none of the previously described things are possible if we do not have
<strong>Ansible integration for the cloud provider</strong> of our choice.</p>
<h2 id="why-should-cloud-providers-have-ansible-integrations">Why should cloud providers have Ansible integrations?</h2>
<p>The traditional model for many businesses is to have infrastructure
provisioning processes separated from the configuration management workflows.
And while configuration management is often (at least partially) automated, it
is not uncommon for system administrators to manage infrastructure manually,
which is slow, laborious, and error-prone.</p>
<p>By provisioning cloud infrastructure with Ansible, system administrators can
perform day one and day two operations using a modern and reliable tool. And
the Ansible playbooks used to manage cloud resources also serve as
human-readable and machine-executable documentation.</p>
<p>Many users already use Ansible for their non-infrastructure automation needs.
Having a high-quality Ansible integration offers a seamless transition for such
users, unifying their management tools.</p>
<p><strong>Providing Ansible integration as a cloud provider will raise the confidence
and improve cloud customers’ user experience.</strong></p>
<h2 id="benefits-of-using-ansible-for-cloud-automation">Benefits of using Ansible for cloud automation</h2>
<p>Ansible is not the only tool that we can use to manage cloud resources. But
because of its simplicity and flexibility, it does offer quite a few advantages
compared to similar utilities.</p>
<p><strong>No need for a separate configuration management tool.</strong>Â&nbsp;Ansible is so
powerful, we can provision cloud resources, configure the operating system, and
then install and configure the application on top. We can do this using a
single Ansible playbook if we wish. Chaining together multiple Ansible
playbooks is a more flexible alternative.</p>
<p><strong>Less vendor lock-in.</strong>Â&nbsp;Ansible modules serve as a thin abstraction layer over
the cloud provider’s application programming interface (API). Abstraction gives
the freedom and flexibility to switch between different cloud providers at any
time with minimal effort. And it enables us to work with multiple clouds
simultaneously without risking the cloud-specific tools overload.</p>
<p><strong>User-friendly automation layer.</strong>Â&nbsp;Ansible playbooks are YAML files that
describe the desired state of the system we want to manage. Writing Ansible
playbooks requires no prior development or programming experience. And there
are plenty of online resources to help us with the Ansible playbook authoring
process.</p>
<h2 id="ansible-use-cases-for-cloud">Ansible use cases for cloudÂ&nbsp;</h2>
<p>As already stated before, we can use Ansible to manage almost anything. But in
this section, we will look at three different cloud-related use cases that
benefit significantly from Ansible’s involvement.</p>
<h3 id="creating-new-cloud-resources">Creating new cloud resources</h3>
<p>Creating a new virtual machine does not sound too complicated. We need to click
a few buttons, and that is it. Right? Well, in reality, things are never this
simple. Because before we create a new virtual machine, we may need to create a
virtual private cloud that will host our resources. And set up a security group
(think firewall). And create an internet gateway. And make sure we have our SSH
keys ready. The list goes on and on.</p>
<p>We can describe all those steps in a reusable Ansible playbook once and then
run them as many times as needed. We can also parameterize our Ansible
playbook. Parameterization allows us to modify the deployment process without
having to edit the Ansible playbook. And with a little help from Ansible Tower,
we can package our parameterized Ansible playbook into a self-service catalog
item anyone can use.</p>
<h3 id="managing-existing-cloud-resources">Managing existing cloud resources</h3>
<p>Ansible can use a cloud provider as a source of information about existing
resources. This dynamic approach makes manual inventory management a thing of
the past. We can now manage hundreds of servers without breaking a sweat.</p>
<p>Combining dynamic inventory with Ansible’s ability to execute operations in
batches, we get a potent tool for performing rolling updates of clusters.</p>
<h3 id="ensuring-compliance">Ensuring compliance</h3>
<p>If we follow the best practices when authoring our Ansible playbooks, we will
produce a concise description of the desired state. We already know that
Ansible will, when executing the instructions, robustly enforce this state on
the managed node.</p>
<p>But we can reuse the same description to detect unauthorized or unintentional
configuration changes, commonly referred to as configuration drift. Running
Ansible in check mode will produce a list of deviations from the desired state.
For example, we can detect changes to security group rules.</p>

<p>Although we focused our attention on the cloud today, we looked at it through
the eyes of an Ansible user. For example, we talked about the desired state of
resources and change detection, which are the two most fundamental things
Ansible users expect from Ansible integration.</p>
<p>Cloud providers often only think about the cloud functionality they offer when
setting up an Ansible integration. Typically, this leads to poorly-designed
Ansible content that feels out of place when used in Ansible playbooks.</p>
<p>Creating a high-quality Ansible integration is far more than just wrapping an
existing cloud API. Ensuring modules have a public API that follows Ansible’s
best practices, setting up a robust test suite, and properly documenting the
content are just a few things each high-quality Ansible Collection needs.</p>
<p>By <a href="https://steampunk.si/blog/should-you-build-or-outsource-the-development-of-ansible-collections/" title="Article with pros and cons of outsourcing Ansible Collection development">outsourcing the development of Ansible Collections</a> to experts,
cloud providers get a high-quality Ansible integration while allowing them to
focus their efforts on their primary product.</p>
<h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap Up</h2>
<p>Ansible is probably the only widely-used automation tool that <strong>allows us to
describe the whole deployment uniformly</strong>: from the provisioning phase to the
holistic configuration of the applications that run on top of the cloud
resources.</p>
<p>Ansible Collections play a central role in Ansible’s flexibility. They provide,
among other things, integrations with cloud providers that unlock
cloud-management capabilities. If appropriately designed, Ansible Collections
significantly improve user experience and remove barriers to adoption, bringing
benefits to both customers and cloud providers.</p>

    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>For this sonification project, our team chose to map the contemporaneous spread of the Coronavirus from China to the rest of the world. This is obviously a phenomenon that is ongoing, so being able to update the sonification as new data came in was an important consideration.</p>

<p>After initial discussions, we developed a game plan to create our sonification using widely-available data from John Hopkins, CDC, etc. on the following parameters of the pandemic:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Confirmed cases</li>
  <li>Total Recovered</li>
  <li>Total Fatalities</li>
</ol>

<p>Our initial idea was to create a worldwide “orchestra” of sounds by superimposing the layout of a traditional symphony orchestra over a map of the world. By rotating the symphonic layout 90 degrees counter-clockwise, we centered the strings over China with the rest of the orchestra fanning out in a westward direction (see fig.1). We quickly realized that it would be better to assign instruments by general region rather than country, because with over 80 countries reporting at the time of this writing, we would not only quickly run out of instruments, but also run the risk of creating sonic soup out of the data.</p>

<p>Figure 1 shows our initial thinking on how to approach the instrumentation by region.</p>

    <figcaption>Fig 1 Initial Instrument Assignments By Region</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This mapping made sense to us, as the strings make up the traditional core of the symphony orchestra, and situating them over the “epicenter” of the pandemic puts the bulk of the instruments in the same area where the bulk of the data is coming from. At the same time, our hope was that the remaining instruments, representing areas with much less data, would still be distinct in the overall soundscape.</p>

<p>Our plan was to sonify the data in the following way:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Daily-updated confirmed cases data for each region would be assigned to pitch data and sent to individual instruments in a DAW. As the number of cases reached a certain threshold, a new note would be triggered, and the sound would become more complex.</li>
  <li>Recovery data would be represented by a percussion instrument, such as crotales, which would sound a single note each time the data crossed a pre-set threshold.</li>
  <li>Fatalities would be represented in the same way as recoveries, using a lower- pitched percussion instrument such as the tympani to place it in a different sound spectrum to keep it distinct.</li>
</ol>

<p>As we will describe later, we decided to drop the second and third points in this plan, focusing only on the confirmed-cases data. However, we did add one additional data stream we had not noticed initially, the daily rate of increase in the numbers. After observing a few large spikes in these numbers, we decided that this was important data that could not be ignored.</p>

<h3 id="implementation">Implementation</h3>

<p>Python programming for real-time data delivery was done by Simon in Trondheim. The program is designed to grab the needed data from the web and send it to Pd as OSC messages. Although we did not wind up using the Python program in our final demonstration on Friday (06.22.20), as the Oslo contingent had set up Pd to read data from a static csv file, this work will not be wasted, as we will need this to further implement our sonification in a dynamic webpage (see: Future Work, below.)</p>

<p>Rayam, Paul, and Dongho on the Oslo side collaborated on implementing the sonification in PureData and Logic. The first task was to separate the data by region, and assign an instrument or set of instruments to each. We created eight regions, with each region’s center point represented by it’s latitude and longitude. See fig. 2.
Every reporting country’s coordinates are compared with these set numbers to determine which region they belonged in. Using the Pythagorean theorem (a2+b2=c2) we triangulated the location in comparison to the predetermined set points, and then sent each data string to one of eight channels assigned to each one of the selected regions.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://mct-master.github.io/assets/image/2020_03_09_aleksati_Instrumentation_By_Region.png" width="640" height="180">
    <figcaption>Fig. 2 Final Orchestral Layout</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Each incoming data string consists of Country, Lat, Long, Day #1, Day #2, etc. Each day’s number represents the increase in either confirmed cases, recovered cases, or deaths. Using the (zl slice) object in Pd, we separate the map coordinates from the daily numbers. Each data string is then separated by region, using the method described above. The daily numbers are used to trigger midi notes, a new note being added every time the daily numbers exceed a certain threshold, and sent to the DAW.</p>

<p>After working with the “confirmed cases” data for a while, we became aware of an important parameter in the numbers that we had initially ignored. The day-to-day cases occasionally registered huge spikes in the numbers that seemed quite significant. We wished to devise a way to represent this in the sonification. For this reason, we decided to focus on only the sonification of the confirmed-case data for this stage of the project, in consideration of our time constraints.</p>

<p>In order to make sense of the spikes in the numbers, we created a sub-patch in Pd that compares each day’s number with the previous day, subtracting the prior day’s number from the current. This number is converted to midi note information and sent to DAW, triggering an arpeggio that becomes more complex as the numbers grow in value. Hence, larger daily spikes in daily case numbers are reflected in the soundscape as arpeggios covering a wider note range.</p>

<p>Figure 2 shows the assignment of instruments by region. Instrument one represents the daily increase in confirmed cases, while instrument two represents the rate of increase between consecutive days.</p>

<p>Implementation in Logic was reasonably straightforward, though involved quite a bit of routing work and setting proper ranges for each instrument, setting up the arpeggiator, etc. We tried to stay within “appropriate” ranges for each instrument, although properly constraining each instrument with its idiomatic bounds would take more time than we had for the project.</p>

<h3 id="sonification">Sonification</h3>

<p>There was a huge amount of data to work with, and we needed to narrow our focus on just a few data points in order to be able to create a sonification that was faithful to the data without creating an aurally confusing soundscape. Therefore, we chose to work with only the confirmed cases dataset, from which we also derived the daily rate of increase. Extracting the data, making sense of it in Pd, then configuring the DAW took quite a bit of time, with much thanks to Georgio, Jarle and others for their invaluable input.</p>

<p>Each day’s worth of data is allotted 3000ms of sonic space to unfold. Each region’s data is delayed slightly from the prior region to allow the data sonic space to be better understood by the listener. See fig. 3.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://mct-master.github.io/assets/image/2020_03_09_aleksati_Delay_Onset.png" width="398" height="304">
    <figcaption>Fig. 3 Delay Onset By Region</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In the final mix, care was taken to level each track so that all instruments could be heard. Binaural panning was used to give each region (and its instruments) its own position in the sonic landscape, though this only apparent when listening through headphones.</p>

<h3 id="result">Result</h3>

</p>

<h3 id="future-work">Future Work</h3>

<p>There is still much that could be done to fully implement this data.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Implement more data. The recovery and fatality data could be added to the overall sonification, with some care taken toward not overloading the listeners’ ears with too much information. One possible way to convey meaning with the recovery and fatality data is to consider them as “resolved” cases, and at set threshold levels in the resolved cases, remove a commensurate amount of confirmed cases from the sonification. In this way, the composition would eventually come to an end as the coronavirus is either contained and defeated.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instrumentation. We feel that the data is mostly well-represented by our instrument choices, but with careful listening and experimentation, it’s quite possible that we could improve the clarity of the sonification by changing instruments, adjusting range parameters, etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dynamic webpage. A very worthy addition to this project would be to create a dynamic webpage that incorporates a time-elapsed heat map to provide a visual reference for the unfolding sonification, as well as tools for the viewer/listener to rewind, change speed, and play the data by region. This would involve the creation of an online orchestra using a sample library, as we would not be able to use Logic. Also we would need to implement the ongoing updates pulled from the GitHub database that Simon created tools for in Trondheim.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Although there is a lot more work that could be done to fully implement all of our ideas, we are encouraged by our results and will continue to work towards a full implementation of this sonification.</p>

<p>It can take weeks to train a neural network on large datasets. Luckily, this time can be shortened thanks to model weights from pre-trained models – in other words, applying <strong>transfer learning</strong>.</p>



<p><a href="https://machinelearningmastery.com/transfer-learning-for-deep-learning/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Transfer learning </a>is a technique that works in image classification tasks and natural language processing tasks. In this article, you’ll dive into:</p>


<div>
<ul><li>what transfer learning is,</li><li>how to implement transfer learning (in Keras),</li><li>transfer learning for image classification,</li><li>transfer learning for natural language processing</li></ul>
</div>


<p>Well then, let’s start learning! (no pun intended… ok, maybe a little)&nbsp;</p>





<h2 id="transfer-learning-overview">What is transfer learning?</h2>



<p><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/transfer-learning-from-pre-trained-models-f2393f124751" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Transfer learning is about leveraging feature representations from a pre-trained model</a>, so you don’t have to train a new model from scratch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The pre-trained models are usually trained on massive datasets that are a standard benchmark in the computer vision frontier. The weights obtained from the models can be reused in other computer vision tasks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These models can be used directly in making predictions on new tasks or integrated into the process of training a new model. Including the pre-trained models in a new model leads to lower training time and lower generalization error.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Transfer learning is particularly very useful when you have a small training dataset. In this case, you can, for example, use the weights from the pre-trained models to <strong>initialize the weights</strong> of the new model. As you will see later, transfer learning can also be applied to natural language processing problems.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The advantage of pre-trained models is that they are generic enough for use in other real-world applications. For example:</p>


<div>
<ul><li><strong>models trained on the ImageNet</strong> can be used in real-world image classification problems. This is because the dataset contains over 1000 classes. Let’s say you are an insect researcher. You can use these models and fine-tune them to classify insects.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>classifying text requires knowledge of word representations</strong> in some vector space. You can train vector representations yourself. The challenge here is that you might not have enough data to train the embeddings. Furthermore, training will take a long time. In this case, you can use a pre-trained word embedding like GloVe to hasten your development process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>
</div>


<p>You will explore these use cases in a moment.</p>



<h3>What is the difference between transfer learning and fine-tuning?</h3>



<p><strong>Fine-tuning </strong>is an optional step in transfer learning. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/post/What-is-the-difference-between-Transfer-Learning-vs-Fine-Tuning-vs-Learning-from-scratch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fine-tuning will usually improve the performance</a> of the model. However, since you have to retrain the entire model, you’ll likely overfit.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Overfitting is avoidable. Just retrain the model or part of it using a <strong>low learning rate</strong>. This is important because it prevents significant updates to the gradient. These updates result in poor performance. Using a callback to stop the training process when the model has stopped improving is also helpful.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Why use transfer learning?</h3>



<p>Assuming you have 100 images of cats and 100 dogs and want to build a model to classify the images. How would you train a model using this small dataset? You can train your model from scratch, but it will most likely overfit horribly. Enter transfer learning. Generally speaking, there are two big reasons why you want to use transfer learning:</p>


<div>
<ul><li><strong>training models with high accuracy requires a lot of data</strong>. For example, the ImageNet dataset contains over 1 million images. In the real world, you are unlikely to have such a large dataset.&nbsp;</li><li>assuming that you had that kind of dataset, you might still <strong>not have the resources required to train a model </strong>on such a large dataset. Hence transfer learning makes a lot of sense if you don’t have the compute resources needed to train models on huge datasets.&nbsp;</li><li>even if you had the compute resources at your disposal, you still have to<strong> wait for days or weeks to train such a model</strong>. Therefore using a pre-trained model will save you precious time.&nbsp;</li></ul>
</div>


<h3>When does transfer learning not work?</h3>



<p>Transfer learning will not work when the high-level features learned by the bottom layers are not sufficient to differentiate the classes in your problem. For example, a pre-trained model may be very good at identifying a door but not whether a door is closed or open. In this case, you can use the low-level features (of the pre-trained network) instead of the high-level features. In this case, you will have to retrain more layers of the model or use features from earlier layers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When datasets are not similar, features transfer poorly. This <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.1792.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">paper</a> investigates the similarity of datasets in more detail. That said, as shown in the paper, initializing the network with pre-trained weights results in better performance than using random weights.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You might find yourself in a situation where you consider the removal of some layers from the pre-trained model. Transfer learning is unlikely to work in such an event. This is because removing layers reduces the number of trainable parameters, which can result in overfitting.&nbsp; Furthermore, determining the correct number of layers to remove without overfitting is a cumbersome and time-consuming process.&nbsp;</p>







<h2 id="transfer-learning-implement">How to implement transfer learning?</h2>



<p>Let’s now take a moment and look at how you can implement transfer learning.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Transfer learning in 6 steps</h3>



<p>You can implement transfer learning in these six general steps.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="40785" data-permalink="https://neptune.ai/blog/transfer-learning-guide-examples-for-images-and-text-in-keras/transfer-learning-steps" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Transfer-learning-steps.png?fit=921%2C68&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="921,68" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Transfer-learning-steps" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Transfer-learning-steps.png?fit=300%2C22&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Transfer-learning-steps.png?fit=921%2C68&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" width="921" height="68" src="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Transfer-learning-steps.png?resize=921%2C68&amp;ssl=1" alt="Transfer learning steps" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Transfer-learning-steps.png?w=921&amp;ssl=1 921w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Transfer-learning-steps.png?resize=300%2C22&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Transfer-learning-steps.png?resize=768%2C57&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Transfer-learning-steps.png?resize=270%2C20&amp;ssl=1 270w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Transfer-learning-steps.png?resize=21%2C2&amp;ssl=1 21w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Transfer-learning-steps.png?resize=140%2C10&amp;ssl=1 140w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Transfer-learning-steps.png?resize=50%2C4&amp;ssl=1 50w" sizes="(max-width: 921px) 100vw, 921px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>











<h4>Obtain the pre-trained model</h4>



<p>The first step is to get the <a href="https://keras.io/api/applications/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">pre-trained model</a> that you would like to use for your problem. The various sources of pre-trained models are covered in a separate section.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Create a base model</h4>



<p>Usually, the first step is to instantiate the <strong>base mode</strong>l using one of the architectures such as ResNet or Xception. You can also optionally download the <strong>pre-trained weights</strong>. If you don’t download the weights, you will have to use the architecture to train your model from scratch. Recall that the base model will usually have more units in the final output layer than you require. When creating the base model, you, therefore, have to remove the final output layer. Later on, you will add a final output layer that is compatible with your problem.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="40787" data-permalink="https://neptune.ai/blog/transfer-learning-guide-examples-for-images-and-text-in-keras/transfer-learning-base-model" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Transfer-learning-base-model.jpg?fit=1367%2C1000&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1367,1000" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Transfer-learning-base-model" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Transfer-learning-base-model.jpg?fit=300%2C219&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Transfer-learning-base-model.jpg?fit=1024%2C749&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Transfer-learning-base-model.jpg?resize=512%2C375&amp;ssl=1" alt="Transfer learning base model" width="512" height="375" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Transfer-learning-base-model.jpg?resize=1024%2C749&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Transfer-learning-base-model.jpg?resize=300%2C219&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Transfer-learning-base-model.jpg?resize=768%2C562&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Transfer-learning-base-model.jpg?resize=98%2C72&amp;ssl=1 98w, https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Transfer-learning-base-model.jpg?resize=21%2C15&amp;ssl=1 21w, https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Transfer-learning-base-model.jpg?resize=55%2C40&amp;ssl=1 55w, https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Transfer-learning-base-model.jpg?resize=41%2C30&amp;ssl=1 41w, https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/Transfer-learning-base-model.jpg?w=1367&amp;ssl=1 1367w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<h4>Freeze layers so they don’t change during training</h4>



<p>Freezing the layers from the pre-trained model is vital. This is because you don’t want the <strong>weights in those layers to be re-initialized</strong>. If they are, then you will lose all the learning that has already taken place. This will be no different from training the model from scratch.&nbsp;</p>



<pre>base_model.trainable = <span>False</span></pre>







<h4>Add new trainable layers&nbsp;</h4>



<p>The next step is to <strong>add new trainable layers</strong> that will turn old features into predictions on the new dataset. This is important because the pre-trained model is loaded without the final output layer.&nbsp;</p>







<h4>Train the new layers on the dataset</h4>



<p>Remember that the pre-trained model’s final output will most likely be different from the output that you want for your model. For example, pre-trained models trained on the ImageNet dataset will output 1000 classes. However, your model might just have two classes. In this case, you have to train the model with a new output layer in place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Therefore, you will add some new dense layers as you please, but most importantly, a final dense layer with <strong>units corresponding to the number of outputs expected by your model</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Improve the model via fine-tuning</h4>



<p>Once you have done the previous step, you will have a model that can make predictions on your dataset. Optionally, you can improve its <strong>performance through fine-tuning</strong>. Fine-tuning is done by unfreezing the base model or part of it and training the entire model again on the whole dataset at a very low learning rate. The low learning rate will increase the performance of the model on the new dataset while preventing overfitting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The learning rate has to be low because the model is quite large while the dataset is small. This is a recipe for overfitting, hence the low learning rate. Recompile the model once you have made these changes so that they can take effect. This is because the behavior of a model is frozen whenever you call the compile function. That means that you have to call the compile function again whenever you want to change the model’s behavior. The next step will be to train the model again while monitoring it via callbacks to ensure it does not overfit.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Pretty straightforward, eh?</p>



<h3>Where to find pre-trained models?</h3>



<p>Let’s now talk about where you can find pre-trained models to use in your applications.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Keras pre-trained models</h4>



<p>There are more than two dozen pre-trained models available from Keras. They’re served via <a href="https://keras.io/api/applications/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><strong>Keras applications</strong></a><strong>.</strong> You get pre-trained weights alongside each model. When you download a model, the weights are downloaded automatically. They will be stored in `~/.keras/models/.` All the Keras applications are used for image tasks. For instance, here is how you can initialize the MobileNet architecture trained on ImageNet.&nbsp;</p>



<pre>model = tf.keras.applications.MobileNet(
    input_shape=<span>None</span>,
    alpha=<span>1.0</span>,
    depth_multiplier=<span>1</span>,
    dropout=<span>0.001</span>,
    include_top=<span>True</span>,
    weights=<span>"imagenet"</span>,
    input_tensor=<span>None</span>,
    pooling=<span>None</span>,
    classes=<span>1000</span>,
    classifier_activation=<span>"softmax"</span>,
)</pre>



<h4>Transfer learning using TensorFlow Hub</h4>



<p>It’s worth mentioning that Keras applications are not your only option for transfer learning tasks. You can also use models from <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/hub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><strong>TensorFlow Hub</strong></a>.</p>



<pre>model = tf.keras.Sequential([
 hub.KerasLayer(<span>"https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/mobilenet_v2_100_224/feature_vector/4"</span>,
                   trainable=<span>False</span>), 
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(num_classes, activation=<span>'softmax'</span>)
])</pre>



<h4>Pretrained word embeddings</h4>



<p><strong>Word embeddings </strong>are usually used for text classification problems. In as much as you can train your word embeddings, using a pre-trained one is much quicker. Here are a couple of word embeddings that you can consider for your natural language processing problems:</p>

<p>Remember when we used to joke around, debate about politics, have a drink afterwards and hug your  friend with a  different political view. Remember when we would switch on the news and just casually criticize whatever dumb shit both the  political parties were doing. Ahh those were the days.</p>

<p>Remember when we used to hug our friends with a slightly different political view than us. Remember when we switch on the news and make fun of whatever dumb shit those politicians were pulling of. Remember when opinions were objective and not personal.</p>

<p>Now everyone and their grandmother has a political opinion that is so well formed, so true,  that neither of them is going to entertain any counter argument. I have seen decade old friendships end, careers destroyed, families torn apart because of differing political opinions.</p>

<p>We do have faint memories  of  a time before this, where everyone didn’t make everything a part of their identity. Where you could have a reasonable discussion with someone without it ending in a fist fight. Those times are long gone, but how the hell did we arrive here.</p>



<p>There is point on the slope where shit goes downhill, and for us it was that point when Social Media appeared. Social Media in all it’s glorious forms aren’t  inherently bad, it’s when you add big data magic and billions of dollars of advertisement budget to the mix that messes everything up. Suddenly  the thing  that you use to keep tabs of your friends and family, start to keep tabs on you.</p>

<p>Advertisement has always been about attention, that’s why big billboards are lit up in the middle of the  night showing scantily clad women with legs pointing to some shit your won’t need. The sole purpose is to turn your head and to make you take notice. They don’t care who sees it, they just care a lot of us do.</p>

<p>A lot of advertisement on the early days of the internet were similar, they would put banner ads on the  most busiest sites hoping to gather the most eyeballs. It worked  like that for some time  until they  realized rather than billboards  on the side of the  road,  you could target your users. Rather than  advertising on a generic forum about the world, you could advertise on a blog about cars for your new useless engine oil. The people who would be visiting the car blog would probably be the ones who would be most interested in buying your shitty snake oil. Hence targeting was born. The ROI of Internet advertisement skyrocketed, and everyone wanted a piece of the pie.</p>

<p>Then Social Media came along with a totally different game. They started  to  track your each and every move  building up intricate profiles of you neatly kept on an offshore data-center, opening up an even better gold mine for those sleazy salesmen. Rather than waiting for someone to show up for that stupid  blog post  about that broken down car, they could put the ad for the snake oil right in the feed of a person who loves clicking on car pictures. It was all christmas  in ad town from  then on, and the companies  who had the best  tracking profiles  started swimming in money, and the ones who didn’t started dying out. (Too far ? yeah too far)</p>

<p>After spending a couple of billions and tracking every sneeze and every turn of everyone  who ever set foot in their world,  they started to  realize some thing else. The people who bought the snake oil on the first impression was not the normal person who kind  of loved cars, but the obsessed ones who believed that snake oil was the best oil in the  world and that the best way to save the world was to buy more snake oil. Those were the people that had the most ROI ever, and  the people who wore nice suits in big office buildings decided they wanted more of these obsessed fanatics, and Big Social gladly served them up on a plate.</p>

<p>But even in a large  enough population pool  the people who are obsessed about a lot of shit is really hard to find, and to keep the money flowing they needed more of them. So they did what anyone with a degree in Operations would do, they started manufacturing them.</p>

<p>Big Social realized that the people who  engage  most, who  drive the most revenue are the ones obsessed with the content. They are the most  revenue generating cattle of the ranch, and since everything is a numbers game they started to maximize obsessiveness. Well how do you manufacture people who would die for their views ? How do you manufacture obsessiveness ? Bubbles.</p>

<h2 id="enter-bubbles">Enter Bubbles</h2>

<p>The more the number of positive reinforcement that a person receives about their already existing viewpoints and the more number  of negative reinforcements they see around the opposing ones, the more likely they are to believe their beliefs are true. The more they are engrossed in their bubbles the more they are susceptible to being obsessed.</p>

<p>The  first  time we sign-up for it, they don’t know anything about us. So they ask us for our interests and to add our closest friends. Based on that they show us some generic content  based on our and  our friends interests. Then we start interacting with them, each and every interaction, each and  every pause is recorded and measured and converted  to a  data point. Initially the content is neutral, leaning just to the side  of our interests and our beliefs. The more we interact with it, the more the virtual  profile of ourselves get optimized. With our likes and shares and comments  we build an echo chamber around ourselves, with help from a  black box algorithm designed to optimize  for obsessiveness.</p>

<p>But an echo chamber doesn’t make you and obsessed radical, what makes you one is shock.</p>

<h2 id="enter-shock">Enter Shock</h2>

<p>Shock is what pushes your towards the edge of obsessiveness. Content that has high shock value are borderline impossible to believe. They rock your belief system and lingers on the edge of possibility. It’s purpose is not to make you believe the content right away, but to expand and reinforce your viewpoint so much so that you believe a little more polarized content than what you are used to. That is how you manufacture obsessiveness, that’s how your manufacture  polarization. The cycle is repeated indefinitely nudging you little by little to the edge, until you fall  o ver. Is  it  intentional or  a  byproduct  of an algorithm optimized for profit and engagement maximization is up for debate.</p>

<p>Consider me and Youtube. Like every teenager I had trouble with the ladies and like any other teenager I turned  to the internet for help. I started with dating videos, content which I  was looking for. Then slowly my recommended feed stared to show just one or two videos on how women were the problem of modern society, not enough to turn me to a believer but just enough to shock me. Having been exposed to that I started to normalize videos that bash feminism, SJW’s being owned and rants about how women are the problem. Then my feed started to get populated with  even more  anti-women and videos around red-pill and the manosphere. I am not saying these viewpoints are right or  wrong, but they were shocking  and normalized  a lot  of stuff that I would never have accepted if I was shown then from the start. After a while I started believing a lot of the what was being said, I was starting to suffocate in my own bubble. Luckily I used to read a lot outside the internet and hence had access to contrasting view points. That’s when I realized how deep in the rabbit hole I was. This prompted me to seek out alternate viewpoints and form my own opinions.  If I had kept going I would most probably have turned  into an angry fanatic thirsty for blood on the internet, shouting on some obscure forum on the edge of the internet.</p>

<p>That’s what  the algorithms are designed to do. They have the maximum engagement and attention from how obsessed their users  are. For being obsessed it’s not only vital that you  push the view point forward but also to demean and dehumanize the opposing one, so much so to the point that you believe the views that they hold are clearly wrong.  It pushes us into an us vs them mentality, where we are on right ones  and they are the wrong ones.</p>

<p>After a while we start to internalize what we interact with, it becomes a part of your identity.You start to believe the extreme content that you are exposed to as your own, you start to defend it with all your might.  You can’t entertain an  argument  because it is no  longer an argument  against your opinion,but one against  your identity. To entertain any argument is to acknowledge you are wrong and to prove everything you have interacted with for a long time to be wrong. This is  what  polarizes  us, this is what makes having a friendly conversation about opposing  views impossible in this  day and age. This is what is being done to us. We are divided  by opinions cocooned in our own bubbles, our own  echo chambers which enforce our beliefs and makes us immune to any counter  argument no matter how right or wrong.</p>

<h2 id="breaking-out">Breaking Out</h2>

<p>It’s not easy and fun getting out once you are inside. It’s like the matrix you see and hear and interact with an artificial world designed to hook you in, and like Neo it’s one hell of a ride to unplug. It’s hard but it’s possible, this is how I  did it.</p>

<ul>
<li>Clear the data that they have on you, take away the data and take away the power.</li>
<li>Humanize the opposing view points and the people who make  them. Realize they too have a valid point and that they believe it enough to defend it with all their heart.</li>
<li>Seek out alternate view points, it’s kind of a fun exercise. When you start everything looks stupid and dumb, persist and after a while you will feel a switch inside your brain, when you realize they also have a valid point.</li>
<li>Take some time off and  think deeply about everything and put together a version of the reality and form your own opinions based on them.</li>
<li>Refine those opinions  as you learn more about reality.</li>
</ul>

<p>OR</p>

<li>Logout of all your Social Media, it’s not that useful anyway</li>

<h2 id="org9a27545">What to expect from this Essay</h2>
<p>
I’m going to clear up common misconceptions, explain what’s important for a first programming language, introduce the most interesting languages and point to the best (free) learning resources and books.<br>
</p>
</div><div id="outline-container-org2b3e512">
<h2 id="org2b3e512">The hard Part</h2>
<div id="text-org2b3e512">
<p>
“Learning a programming language” is what applies foremost to programmers who already know how to program. For them, picking up a new language is possible within a couple of weeks (and for you too, once you’ve gained some experience), and it does’t matter really that much which one – because the patterns how to accomplish most things are roughly overlapping.<br>
</p>

<p>
But if you start out, you don’t need to just learn a programming language. <b>First, you want to learn how to program</b>. It means learning how to analyze a problem you want to tackle, finding a solution and express it in code, which is often not intuitive. Plus, you still have to learn a programming language with syntax and semantics, too. So that is two things at once.<br>
</p>
</div>
</div><div id="outline-container-org0cd2593">
<h2 id="org0cd2593">What do you want to do?</h2>
<div id="text-org0cd2593">
<p>
Is it your plan to become a software developer? Software is built in different areas – the most obvious within the web, is obviously the development of itself. But there are other areas than web frontend and web backend; like fintech, aircraft systems, robotics, telecom, water supply or internet of things. If you know exactly what your intentions are, you could start with a language of your specific field and go form there. Or maybe better not?<br>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
“It’s crucial that you understand<br>
the principles behind programming<br>
that transcend the specifics<br>
of any specific language.”<br>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The industry workhorse is probably not the right one, because it could be either highly specific and/or come with a lot of distracting things that don’t matter for you right now. There’s a reason one does not take the very first driving lessons on a bucket wheel excavator, but on a … yes, car. Or motorbike. If you pick the wrong one, you might not follow through.<br>
</p>

<p>
Life changes and programming is hard. So you should go with a language that’s interesting to you – for whatever reason – and which is particularly suitable for learning, according to the criteria I lay out below. Read on, I will describe the most interesting languages further down.<br>
</p>

<p>
You may want to learn programming, even if you have no plans to become a part of the software producing workforce, like me. I’ve worked quite a long time as a designer and in the online marketing industry, but have barely written any code at all, since there were always developers working alongside me and tasked with the wizardry.<br>
</p>

<p>
But I have always been interested in computer stuff, so I’ve dabbled a lot with Linux, server administration and tweaking my configs as a means of procrastination. Real programming was the magical border I haven’t crossed – until recently.<br>
</p>

<p>
For my part, I want a tool in which I can think, and I’d like to be able to prototype an idea if I have one. Further, I think programming can help us tremendously to develop our minds. I must say that hated mathematics in school and have been really bad at it, but I’m fascinated and eventually I want to know what is this all about.<br>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
“Life is short –<br>
pull down the curtain,<br>
cast some spells<br>
and wield some magic!”<br>

<h2 id="orgae6d7f1">What makes a Programming Language beginner-friendly?</h2>

<div id="outline-container-org96ebe92">
<h3 id="org96ebe92">Available Learning Materials</h3>
<div id="text-org96ebe92">
<p>
For which programming language is the right learning material available? This point is huge!<br>
</p>

<p>
Most programming books or courses are not made for absolute beginners, but for programmers who want to <i>learn yet another language</i>. Remember, you want to <i>learn programming</i>, not just a language.<br>
</p>

<p>
“Regular” programming books are not “too advanced” to grasp; it’s just that they <b>teach you the wrong things</b> instead of what you actually need to learn.<br>
</p>

<p>
Beware, there’s a lot of crap out there. And the more popular a programming language, the more crap you’ll run into. First, learn how to learn things by yourself (in a way that fits your personality). That skill is likely the most valuable one you’ll ever develop.<br>
</p>

<p>
I recommend a textbook or e-textbook <b>with exercises</b> as your main forge of knowledge, because books are still the most accessible media – you can read a chapter even if you’re queueing up somewhere, re-read each chapter until you got it, and <i>do the exercises</i>.<br>
</p>

<p>
Generally, I suggest to use material from university profs and/or other reputable personalities to make sure you adopt a well rounded foundation and good style, instead of jumping between random tutorials and bootcamps.<br>
</p>

<p>
I’ve linked the best books below. Most of them come for free! Prepare to dabble with your textbook for quite some time. <i>So you really want an enjoyable one!</i> The most recommended book may not neccesarily be the right one for you; individual taste matters a lot.<br>
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org2d02828">
<h3 id="org2d02828">What kind of Animal are you?</h3>
<div id="text-org2d02828">
<p>
It seems there are two different groups of programmers. Those that see programming languages primarily as a means of production (category 1) and those who see it as instrument of human reason (categories 2 and 3):<br>
</p>

<ol>
<li><b>Pragmatic languages:</b> conservative, efficient, worse-is-better, boring.<br>
<i>“A programming language is a tool to get the job done”</i><br>
(C, Java, Go)<br></li>
<li><b>Hackish languages:</b> multi-paradigm, anything goes, flexibility, unopinionated.<br>
<i>“I pursue absolute freedom and like to explore the problem domain interactively”</i><br>
(Lisp, Scheme, Javascript)<br></li>
<li><b>Constraining languages:</b> single-paradigm, protecting you from yourself, the-right-thing, opinionated.<br>
<i>“I prefer one correct way according a fixed set of rules”</i><br>
(Elm, Haskell, Python)<br></li>
</ol>

<p>
Programming languages are created by different minds, within different eras, significantly influenced by fashion. One language may be a natural fit for a certain personality type, and a less fortunate choice for another. That even applies to programming itself – it’s easier for some and harder for others (doesn’t mean those are more stupid – ok, some really are).<br>
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgcbae123">
<h3 id="orgcbae123">Readability and Syntax</h3>
<div id="text-orgcbae123">
<p>
As a novice coder, you’ll need enough brain capacity left to maintain focus on the concepts and what (your) code does, without the language getting in your way. So you want a simple syntax that’s easy to pick up and remember. You don’t want surprises and gotchas.<br>
</p>

<p>
Code is also more often read than written. A clean syntax enables the reader to understand what’s going on in the program. Consistency enables you to derive further things from things you already have learned before and speeds up your learning process.<br>
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgd46675f">
<h3 id="orgd46675f">Expressive Power and Abstraction</h3>
<p>
Expressivity means how simple it is to say certain things. There are a couple of factors who determine how expressive a programming language can be:<br>
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgd1205f4">
<h4 id="orgd1205f4">Low-level or High-level?</h4>
<div id="text-orgd1205f4">
<p>
Low-level does not mean “worse” or “inferior” than high-level – it just refers to the fact that computers are built in many layers on top of each other, and the levels close to the physical machine are called the “low level”. You could also call it “foundation”, if you prefer a less judgementally sounding term xP<br>
</p>

<p>
High-level languages tend to be more expressive than low-level languages, because with each layer up, the grade of <i>abstraction</i> increases and more powerful ways to express complex things come into play.<br>
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgeab952a">
<h4 id="orgeab952a">How simple is it to build Abstractions?</h4>
<div id="text-orgeab952a">
<p>
What is abstraction? It means hiding the foundational workings of the level(s) below (eg. the physical machine) so you don’t have to deal with them directly and can focus on your problem/idea instead.<br>
</p>

<p>
An analogy: A console used to control the lightshow of a concert is an abstraction over fumbling with the electricity cables and tieing them together to make light bulbs glow in a certain order. Now think about doing the light show only by messing with the wires. This is dangerous and way harder (nearly impossible) than using the console. And so it is with programming, too.<br>
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org22c2451">
<h4 id="org22c2451">Is it a wordy or concise Language?</h4>
<div id="text-org22c2451">
<p>
Do you have to write a lot of boilerplate or repeat yourself? In most cases you want an expressive high-level language; not overly verbose but also not too concise, so there’s just the right amount of redundancy left to keep it comprehensible.<br>
</p>

<p>

</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgd52f0e3">
<h3 id="orgd52f0e3">Usability and Programming Environment</h3>
<div id="text-orgd52f0e3">
<p>
Your language of choice ideally comes with tooling that’s easy to use. Tooling means things like editor support (syntax highlighting, “jump-to-definition”, looking up documentation), helpful (or at least comprehensible) error messages, and package management for libraries.<br>
</p>

<p>
Libraries are pieces of code written by other programmers that can be re-used, so a developer has less work and doesn’t need to code everything from scratch. A good selection of libraries determines what you can do with a language. Having many libraries is desirable for industrial use, but it doesn’t matter so much in the beginning. Many languages can also use libraries from other programming languages/ecosystems.<br>
</p>

<p>
Consider to pick a language that comes with a <i>REPL</i>, sometimes called <i>console</i> or <i>toplevel</i>. That’s basically like the command line running in a terminal emulator, but instead of shell commands you can run single pieces of your code. Well, nowadays many languages come with a REPL. But some go even further than that and enable true <i>interactive development</i>.<br>
</p>

<p>
Can you get started without huge ceremonies and fumbling for days?<br>
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org998904b">
<h3 id="org998904b">Popularity and Commmunity</h3>
<div id="text-org998904b">
<blockquote cite="http://www.paulgraham.com/iflisp.html">
<p>
“Popularity is always self-perpetuating, but it’s especially so in programming languages. More libraries get written for popular languages, which makes them still more popular. Programs often have to work with existing programs, and this is easier if they’re written in the same language, so languages spread from program to program like a virus. And managers prefer popular languages, because they give them more leverage over developers, who can more easily be replaced.” <cite>—<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/iflisp.html">Paul Graham</a></cite><br>

Popular means just that: popular. It does not imply technically “superior”. Popular languages have some …</p></div></div></div></div>

    <div>
      
<p>The decision by a half dozen of the largest social media companies in the United States to ban President Trump and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/11/technology/twitter-removes-70000-qanon-accounts.html">thousands</a> of his supporters after their posts instigated the violent invasion of the Capitol building on January 6 raised all kinds of difficult questions about the meaning of freedom of speech in the United States. Was the deplatforming a condemnable act of censorship or a necessary means of preventing future attacks? In what circumstances could incendiary and duplicitous speakers like President Trump justifiably be excluded from the platforms? And who should be responsible for determining the speech rules that govern the social media public sphere? These questions pervaded public debate about what some began to call the <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/story/2021-01/jonathan-zittrain-great-deplatforming">Great Deplatforming</a> and they generated a wide range of answers.</p>



<p>Despite the vigorous debate about freedom of speech raised by the deplatforming, there was wide agreement—at least among lawyers—that the First Amendment provided no help in answering them. Almost all litigators and law professors who weighed in the Great Deplatforming agreed that, while it raised difficult policy questions, it raised no serious First Amendment questions because the social media companies were private actors to whom the First Amendment did not apply. Jameel Jaffer, the Executive Director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, eloquently expressed this view when he <a href="https://twitter.com/JameelJaffer/status/1347970483879292928">tweeted</a> that “The First Amendment question is easy. All the other questions are hard.”</p>



<p>The idea that the First Amendment was irrelevant here shocked many outside the law world. Republican politicians in particular <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/01/first-amendment-regulation/617827/">continued to insist</a> that the social media companies had violated the First Amendment when they banned the President because of his speech.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>The Great Deplatforming may have illuminated many other things, but one thing it clearly spotlighted is how poorly equipped contemporary First Amendment doctrine is for conceptualizing, let alone doing anything about, the threats to freedom of speech that result from private control of the mass public sphere.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>The First Amendment’s irrelevance flows almost ineluctably, however, from the rigid framework that the contemporary cases apply to determine its scope. Under existing rules, the Constitution limits only state actors. Private persons confront the Speech Clause in very few circumstances: mostly when they exercise a function that has traditionally been the exclusive prerogative of the government, or when their conduct is coerced or very strongly encouraged by government actors.</p>



<p>Doctrinally, then, the conclusion that the social media companies were private rather than state actors was easy to reach.&nbsp; Running a social media platform is not a public function that has traditionally been performed by the government. Nor did government actors dictate the companies’ deplatforming decisions or even strongly encourage it. Twitter and Facebook came to those decisions on their own.</p>



<p>Most scholars and litigators who assessed the merits of the Great Deplatforming also endorsed the view that the social media companies ideally should not be subject to the Speech Clause, given the significant constraints that it would impose on their ability to regulate user speech that flowed through their platforms. Under existing interpretations, the First Amendment prohibits state actors from almost ever discriminating against speech because of its viewpoint or message. If they were subject to that rule, social media platforms would find it extremely difficult to exclude lies or misinformation, to ban encouragement of violence that did not amount to explicit incitement, or to prohibit the repetition of odious racist stereotypes. Were courts to analogize the platforms to “<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/88-2031.ZD.html">quintessential public forums</a>” like public streets, parks, and sidewalks, they would impose even greater constraints on the companies’ ability to regulate. Because the government is generally prohibited from discriminating against speech because of its content when it regulates the traditional public sphere, the extension of these duties to the social media companies would prevent them from being able to engage in the content-based acts of filtering, recommending, and ranking speech that play such an important role at present in organizing the digital public sphere.</p>



<p>It is not difficult, therefore, to understand why even enthusiastic advocates of free speech were unwilling to argue that the social media companies should be subjected to those rules. Doing so appeared very likely to make the platforms, as Jack Balkin <a href="https://columbialawreview.org/content/free-speech-is-a-triangle/">put it</a>, “far less valuable to end users, if not wholly ungovernable,” and no one wanted that.</p>



<p>The result was nevertheless to lead most scholars and litigators to agree that the most important legal guarantee of freedom of speech in the United States provided no protection whatsoever against what the ACLU rightly <a href="https://twitter.com/KimZetter/status/1347734205430591490">described</a> as the “unchecked power” of the social media companies “to remove people from platforms that have become indispensable to the speech of billions.” And not only that.</p>



<p>In recent years, the Court has interpreted the First Amendment not only to not prohibit private acts of speech discrimination but also to actively protect the right of private actors to discriminate free from <em>legislative</em> control. So in concluding that the social media companies were private actors, those who weighed in on the Great Deplatforming at least implicitly endorsed a view of the First Amendment that could be used to render those companies immune not only from judicial checks on their decisionmaking, but from legislative checks as well. The ACLU’s public statement certainly appeared to recognize as much. After warning darkly of the great power that the social media companies possessed, the statement identified voluntary transparency as the only mechanism for checking that power—the ACLU said it could only “hope that these companies will apply their rules transparently to everyone.”</p>



<p>We think it is an impoverished view of freedom of speech that leaves such weak means for protecting the expressive and democratic freedom of so many people. The Great Deplatforming may have illuminated many other things, but one thing it clearly spotlighted is how poorly equipped contemporary First Amendment doctrine is for conceptualizing, let alone doing anything about, the threats to freedom of speech that result from private control of the mass public sphere. Because virtually every forum of mass communication in the United States is privately owned and controlled, the First Amendment today sharply limits the ability of the democratic government to oversee the operation of its most important forums.</p>



<p>We do not want to have to choose between John Roberts and Mark Zuckerberg as the guardians of democracy, though that is what current doctrine seems to require. Luckily, the contemporary framework is not the only one available to us.</p>



<h2>A Spectrum of Public Duties</h2>



<p>If we look to an earlier epoch of First Amendment jurisprudence—the era of the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s—what we find is a far less formalistic approach to the delimitation of the First Amendment’s boundaries, one that is much more attentive to the problem of private power than the current framework tends to be, and far less antagonistic to the possibility of democratic supervision of the mass public sphere. This is a model that would better equip courts, lawyers and legislatures to think through the difficult free speech questions raised by events like the Great Deplatforming.</p>



<p>To get a sense of how this earlier approach operated, one need only look at one of the most famous but also perhaps most misunderstood cases in the First Amendment canon—the 1946 <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/326/501">decision</a> in <em>Marsh v. Alabama</em>. <em>Marsh</em> is almost always misremembered today as a decision that held that private corporations can be considered state actors when they perform a traditional government function, like running a town. But that is not what <em>Marsh </em>held. Neither the majority nor the dissent ever suggested the possibility that the corporation involved in the case—the Gulf Shipbuilding Corporation—was a state actor. (Gulf wasn’t in fact a party to the case.) All nine members of the Court instead agreed that the relevant state actors were the three Alabama state courts that either convicted or affirmed the trespass conviction of a Jehovah’s Witness who Gulf tried to kick out of the town it owned because it disliked her religious proselytizing but who refused to leave. The <em>Marsh </em>majority reversed the trespass conviction because it concluded that otherwise the corporation could use state property law to dictate what views could be expressed in the town’s public spaces, thus denying the town’s residents of a full opportunity to exercise their First Amendment rights.</p>



<p>The <em>Marsh </em>Court concluded, in other words, that a private corporation—a private actor!—had a duty to respect the free speech interests of other private persons because of the role it played in the regulation of the public sphere. More specifically, the Court held that the Gulf Shipbuilding Corporation had a duty to make sure the channels of communication in its town remained open because it had voluntarily, and for its own profit, turned its property into a part of the public realm. This was because, the Court noted, “[w]hether a corporation or a municipality owns or possesses the town, the public . . . &nbsp;has an identical interest in the functioning of the community in such manner that the channels of communication remain free.” It followed from this that “the managers appointed by the corporation [could not] curtail the liberty of press and religion of these people” any more than the government could.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>Private actors who open up their property more, and thereby acquire more of the attributes of government control, have a concomitantly greater responsibility to honor the statutory and constitutional interests of the public who use …</p></blockquote></figure></div></article></div>

<p>Myrtle called it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120111035254/http://myrtlehocklemeier.blogspot.com/2008/07/article-that-launched-thousand-posts.html">The article that launched a thousand posts…</a>, and counting comments on <a href="http://letsplaymath.net/2008/07/01/if-it-aint-repeated-addition/">this</a> <a href="http://rationalmathed.blogspot.com/2008/07/devlin-on-multiplication-or-what-is.html">and</a> <a href="http://www.textsavvyblog.net/2008/07/devlins-right-angle-finale.html">several</a> <a href="http://vlorbik.wordpress.com/2008/07/24/be-fruitful/">other</a> <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2008/07/teaching_multiplication_is_it.php">blogs</a>, that may not be too much of an exaggeration. Yet the discussion feels incomplete — I have not been able to put into words all that I want to say. Thus, at the risk of once again revealing my <a href="http://letsplaymath.net/2007/01/31/confession-i-am-not-good-at-math/">mathematical ignorance</a>, I am going to try another response to Keith Devlin’s <a href="http://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/devlin_06_08.html">multiplication</a> <a href="http://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/devlin_0708_08.html">articles</a>.</p>
<p>Let me state up front that I speak as a teacher, not as a mathematician. I am not qualified, nor do I intend, to argue about the implications of <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PeanosAxioms.html">Peano’s Axioms</a>. My experience lies primarily in teaching K-10, from elementary arithmetic through basic algebra and geometry. I remember only snippets of my college math classes, back in the days when we worried more about nuclear winter than global warming.</p>
<p>I will start with a few things we can all agree on…</p>

<h2>We All Agree on Some Things</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Elementary students will use addition</strong> to solve beginning multiplication problems. What else could they do? They have not yet learned multiplication.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>The multiplication table is initially built by repeated addition</strong>, as our students add up (or count by) the numbers in each row and column. Even adults, when they get stumped by a math fact they’ve forgotten, will use repeated addition to figure out the answer.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Repeated addition does give the correct answer</strong> for any multiplication of whole numbers. Sometimes it is more trouble than it is worth — who wants to add up 957×842? But by using the Distributive Property, any multiplication of whole numbers can be reduced to a repeated addition calculation:<br>
4 ×&nbsp;3 = (1 + 1 + 1 + 1) ×&nbsp;3 = 3 + 3 + 3 + 3</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rational number multiplications can be calculated as addition of parts.</strong> This is how the Egyptian scribes handled multiplication of fractions. But be careful! To calculate the parts, one needs multiplication — or rather, its inverse, division. So to use this as a definition, one must resort to circular reasoning.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Finally, I think we can all agree that repeated addition is an important problem-solving tool.</strong> Repeated addition can help students think their way through simple multiplication word problems. It doesn’t always work, but sometimes it is the quickest way to understand a situation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>So What’s the Problem?</h2>
<p>So what is wrong with the definition, “Multiplication is repeated addition”? Perhaps <em>wrong</em> is too strong a word — perhaps in some deep, theoretical sense, the statement is true, at least for the whole numbers — I’ll leave that argument to the mathematicians. (See, for instance, <a href="http://devlinsangle.blogspot.com/2011/11/how-multiplication-is-really-defined-in.html" title="How multiplication is really defined in Peano arithmetic">How multiplication is really defined in Peano arithmetic</a>.) But speaking as a teacher, the phrase can definitely be misleading.</p>
<blockquote><p>To define multiplication as repeated addition is to make multiplication a sub-species of addition.</p></blockquote>
<p>It is as if there were two types of addition: regular, random, “wild” addition and the specially-bred variety of addition to which we give the name <em>multiplication</em>. Is that really how we want our students to think? Multiplication is not a mere sub-species of addition. Multiplication is its own animal, an independent operation.</p>
<ul>
<li>The operation of addition has its <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/identity-element">identity element</a>. </li>
<li>The operation of multiplication has its <a href="http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/56032.html">identity element</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>And they are not the same. </p>
<ul>
<li>Every number has its own <a href="http://www.mathwords.com/a/additive_inverse_number.htm">additive inverse</a>. </li>
<li>Each number has a <a href="http://www.mathwords.com/m/multiplicative_inverse_of_a_number.htm">multiplicative inverse</a>, too.</li>
</ul>
<p>And they are not the same. </p>
<ul>
<li>Addition has its inverse operation, <a href="http://www.aaastudy.com/pro34bx2.htm">subtraction</a>.</li>
<li>Multiplication has its inverse operation, <a href="http://www.aaastudy.com/pro34cx2.htm">division</a>. </li>
</ul>
<p>And they are not the same, because the operations are not the same.</p>
<p>[Sidetrack: Oops! I forgot that zero does not have a multiplicative inverse. <a href="http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=7002833&amp;tstart=0">Jonathan</a> pointed out my mistake.]</p>
<p>[Another side note: I find it interesting that repeated subtraction can be a useful tool in solving some division problems, just as repeated addition can be a useful tool in understanding multiplication. Subtraction plays an important role in the <a href="https://denisegaskins.com/2010/04/12/the-cookie-factory-guide-to-long-division/">algorithm for long division</a>. I suppose someone will argue that this is evidence multiplication is repeated addition after all.]</p>
<h2>Dimensional Reasoning</h2>
<p><a href="http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/Dimensional+analysis">Dimensional analysis</a> means looking at the dimensions (units of measurement) of a quantity to help you solve a science or engineering problem.</p>
<p><strong>Addition requires identical units.</strong> The sum must always have the same units as the addends:</p>
<p>2 apples + 3 apples = 5 apples</p>
<p>2 apples + 3 oranges = ?? </p>
<p>What does that second equation give you? Fruit salad? In order to add quantities with unlike units, we need to find a <a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/common+denominator">common denominator</a>. Apples and oranges are both pieces of fruit, so…</p>
<p>2 apples + 3 oranges =</p>
<p>2 pieces of fruit + 3 pieces of fruit = 5 pieces of fruit </p>
<p><strong>Multiplication requires different units.</strong> The product does not have the same units as either the multiplier or the multiplicand.</p>
<p>2 baskets ×&nbsp;3 apples per basket  = 6 apples </p>
<p>How can we make multiplication come out the same as repeated addition? The only way to do it is to change the units.</p>
<p>3 cm + 3 cm = 6 cm </p>
<p>But…</p>
<p>2 cm ×&nbsp;3 cm = 6 cm<sup>2</sup> </p>
<p>We need…</p>
<p>2 lengths ×&nbsp;3 cm per length = 6 cm</p>
<p>We do not normally think about dimensional analysis when we work with plain numbers in math class. But the fact remains that <em>multiplication changes things in a way that addition does not</em>. </p>
<blockquote><p>Addition is one-dimensional, but multiplication is multi-dimensional.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is why the rules for fraction addition and fraction multiplication are so different. When you add positive rational numbers, you always get a sum that is bigger than either addend. But when you multiply rational numbers, all bets are off — the product may be bigger, smaller, or somewhere in between the numbers.</p>
<h2>Language Does Matter</h2>
<p><strong>Addition:</strong> addend + addend = sum. The addends are interchangeable. This is represented by the fact that they have the same name.</p>
<p><strong>Multiplication:</strong> multiplier ×&nbsp;multiplicand = product. The multiplier and multiplicand have different names, even though many of us have trouble remembering which is which. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>multiplier</strong> = “how many or how much”</li>
<li><strong>multiplicand</strong> = the size of the “unit” or “group”</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Different names indicate a difference in function.</em> The multiplier and the multiplicand are not conceptually interchangeable. It is true that multiplication is <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Commutative.html">commutative</a>, but (2&nbsp;rows ×&nbsp;3&nbsp;chairs/row) is not the same as (3&nbsp;rows ×&nbsp;2&nbsp;chairs/row), even though both sets contain 6&nbsp;chairs.</p>
<h2>A New Type of Number</h2>
<p>In multiplication, we introduce a totally new type of number: the <em>multiplicand.</em> A strange, new concept sits at the heart of multiplication, something students have never seen before.</p>
<p>The multiplicand is a this-per-that ratio.</p>
<p>A ratio is a not a counting number, but something new, much more abstract than anything the students have seen up to this point. </p>
<p>A ratio is a relationship number.</p>
<p>In addition and subtraction, numbers count how much stuff you have. If you get more stuff, the numbers get bigger. If you lose some of the stuff, the numbers get smaller. Numbers measure the amount of cookies, horses, dollars, gasoline, or whatever.</p>
<p>The multiplicand doesn’t count the number of dollars or measure the volume of gasoline. It tells the relationship between them, the dollars per gallon, which <em>stays the same whether you buy a lot or a little.</em> </p>
<blockquote><p>By telling our students that “multiplication is repeated addition,” we dismiss the importance of the multiplicand. But until our students wrestle with and come to understand the concept of ratio, they can never fully understand multiplication.</p></blockquote>
<h2>How Then Shall We Teach?</h2>
<p>If we accept this argument, if we agree to no longer define basic multiplication as repeated addition, then what? How does that affect the way we teach?</p>
<p>Mainly, we need to change our focus from <strong>how</strong> to <strong>why</strong>.</p>
<p>We can teach multiplication in much the same way that we do now, using manipulatives arranged in groups or rows, pictures of multiplication situations, and rectangular arrays of dots or blocks. But instead of drawing our student’s attention to the <em>process</em> of adding up the answer, we want to focus on the fact that the items are arranged in <em>equal sized groups</em>. </p>
<p>In other words, we teach our students to recognize the multiplicand: </p>
<ul>
<li>Teach children the useful word “per” and how to recognize a “this per that” unit. </li>
<li>Have them label the quantities in their workbook: 3 cookies per student, 5 flowers per vase, 1 eye per alien, or whatever.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we need a simple, elementary-level catchphrase to replace “multiplication is repeated addition,” how about this? </p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Multiplication is counting by this-per-that groups.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>As with any such phrase, this statement fails to capture all that multiplication entails. The definition will have to be expanded as students learn about rational numbers. “Oh, look! We can count just part of a group, and we can measure with a unit that is not a whole number.” Our students will someday have to learn about real numbers, complex numbers, and matrix multiplication. Even so, the phrase captures an important aspect of many multiplication situations our students will meet in K-12: that there is a multiplicand, some “this per that” quantity.</p>
<p>This approach should be especially helpful to those frustrating students — you know, the ones with the blank stare — who read a word problem and then ask, “Do I add or multiply?”</p>
<h2>A Useful Tool</h2>
<p>Completing the circle, I come back to the point of <a href="http://letsplaymath.net/2008/07/01/if-it-aint-repeated-addition/">my first “repeated addition” post</a>. I would like you to consider the teaching power of bar model diagrams to represent arithmetic operations. These diagrams are used in the <a href="http://www.singaporemath.com/Primary_Mathematics_US_Ed_s/39.htm">Singapore Primary Math</a> books, and according to <a href="http://letsplaymath.net/2007/09/02/pre-algebra-problem-solving-2nd-grade/#comment-12305">one commenter</a> they are popular in Russia and Australia. They are even beginning to show up in newer American textbooks, where they are sometimes called “tape diagrams.” </p>
<p>Here are some advantages of the bar diagram model:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bar diagrams chunkify the number line and make number relationships less abstract. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>They provide elementary students with a pictorial algebra that can help them think through complicated word problems. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It is easy for students to see the inverse relationship between addition and subtraction, or between multiplication and division. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Because …</li></ul></div></div>

March 3, 2021 | https://sammorrowdrums.com/going-ad-free-with-micropayments | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://sammorrowdrums.com/going-ad-free-with-micropayments">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Having recently decided that I was fed up with seeing ads and paywalls on countless websites every time I open links (on news sites in particular), while still wanting content producers to get payed, I felt I needed to look into options for micropayments and see if they are any good. I simply won't subscribe to sites for which I am only a casual reader, so I needed another option.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/dMP9PflY.png" alt="Scroll payment breakdown"></p>

<p>There are actually now several micropayment providers, and Mozilla seem to be very motivated to help push the field forwards<a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2020/03/web-monetization-coil-and-firefox-reality/" rel="nofollow">1</a>, <a href="https://firstlook.firefox.com/betterweb/" rel="nofollow">2</a>. Interestingly JavaScript pioneer and Mozilla co-founder <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich" rel="nofollow">Brendan Eich</a>, is also one of the pioneers of micropayment systems with <a href="https://brave.com/" rel="nofollow">Brave web browser</a> and their <a href="https://brave.com/brave-rewards/" rel="nofollow">Basic Attention Token</a> system. Unfortunately, I ruled out Brave early on because:</p>
<ul><li>There are numerous accusations of dubious activity such as:
<ul><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/8/21283769/brave-browser-affiliate-links-crypto-privacy-ceo-apology" rel="nofollow">Inserting affiliate links</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/04/brave-software-publishers-respond/" rel="nofollow">They tried blocking ads, but then injecting their own</a>
<ul><li><strong>UPDATE</strong> Apparently this is a widely held misconception, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18744481" rel="nofollow">here</a> is some more conversation around it.</li></ul></li>
<li><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18734999" rel="nofollow">Taking tips for people without consent</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/brave-browser-leak-exposed-user-domain-info-months" rel="nofollow">Including Tor, but Leaking DNS</a>, which is now fixed but a false sense of security is a dangerous thing</li></ul></li>
<li>I'm not convinced by Basic Attention Token and tips implementation, nor chances of mass adoption of Brave for their system to get enough market share to succeed.</li>
<li>I want to choose what browser I use – and still be able to read monetized content without ads.</li></ul>

<p>So that left me mostly with the two services Mozilla is working with, <a href="https://coil.com/" rel="nofollow">Coil</a> and <a href="https://scroll.com/" rel="nofollow">Scroll</a>. Here is a basic breakdown:</p>
<ul><li>Coil
<ul><li>$5/month</li>
<li>Works with browser plugins</li>
<li>Pays out continuously based on time spent on site / watching content</li>
<li>On mobile requires <a href="https://www.pumabrowser.com/" rel="nofollow">Puma browser</a> (due to lack of plugin integration in mobile browsers), which is basically Firefox Mobile + Coil support</li>
<li>Uses open <a href="https://interledger.org/" rel="nofollow">interledger</a> protocol:
<ul><li>To monetize your own content, just add an HTML tag (or if doing conditional ads, you can do a small bit of JS to check).</li>
<li>Paying out goes to any wallet provider that supports the protocol, I use <a href="https://uphold.com/" rel="nofollow">Uphold</a> for my blog, which can pay out in Fiat currency</li>
<li>Other providers than coil can emerge and use the same protocol</li></ul></li>
<li>Enables various other kinds of Monetization, so can be used with Twitch, Imgur, Newgrounds and all kinds of other services.</li>
<li>Coil doesn't have to pre-approve monetized content providers</li></ul></li>
<li>Scroll
<ul><li>$5/month</li>
<li>Works with browser cookie as far as I can tell</li>
<li>Pays out to its partners as a split share of your subscription fee</li>
<li>Works on basically all browsers (but you might not notice if you get signed out at first, from clearing cache for example)</li>
<li>Does deals with specific content providers, such as The Atlantic and Bloomberg.</li>
<li>Centralised payment system, officially only available in USA currently
</li></ul></li></ul>

<h2 id="using-coil">Using Coil</h2>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/HBt9YM2z.png" alt="Coil Homepage"></p>

<p>Coil was very easy to set up. Just sign-up,  grab the browser extensions and go. Then you can see a little green dollar sign when you visit pages that take payments. Unfortunately we don't have the ability (yet) to add the extension to mobile browsers, so in order to benefit from Coil on mobile I needed to install Puma Browser (effectively Firefox Mobile). Which, after a while of delaying I eventually decided to do. My one gripe was that neither LastPass nor 1Password currently recognize it as a browser, so it couldn't fully replace my mobile browser (yet), as they would offer to add passwords for the entire app rather than just the page you were on  – I did flag this with 1Password.</p>

<p>I am very happy with the service Coil provides (including their <a href="https://coil.com/explore" rel="nofollow">curated list</a> of monetized sites). I find that the broad range of independent publishers it supports makes it an incredibly viable option. The open protocol in particular should enable future iterations, competitors and support from more financial institutions over time, and it seems like its biggest perk is it is decentralized, and so I was able to experiment with the other side of the coin with ease.</p>

<p>With my blogging provider <a href="https://write.as/" rel="nofollow">Write.As</a>, I was able to instantly try out monetizing my own content. I just needed to add my “interledger payment pointer”, which I obtained via <a href="https://uphold.com/" rel="nofollow">Uphold</a> to automatically pay out in Euros.</p>

<p>Now, before getting excited, my low volume blog does not make any real money. Here's how it's gone so far:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/GsnyTHdQ.png" alt="My uphold wallet balance"></p>

<p>But, I am hopeful should I write anything of consequence and should more people start using Coil, I would end up getting payed a much greater amount. I'd be interested to see how the more commercial partners are doing.</p>



<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/eSKZyL15.png" alt="Scroll Homepage"></p>

<p>So after my positive experience with Coil, I decided to give Scroll a go. It is interesting, because while it doesn't have the open tech appeal of Coil, it does remove ads and has some serious premium content providers signed up to it, although sadly some of them still have article limits before you would still have to subscribe.</p>

<p>Coil uses magic SSO links via their interface and to your email, so it is really simple to get going. Click on the links in your browsers of choice, and you are already set up. They also show a breakdown of which partners are getting a cut of your subscription (and how much of it they get).</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/dMP9PflY.png" alt="Scroll payment breakdown"></p>

<p>You can tell that it is working on participating sites because you get a small S symbol on-screen, which you can open to the Scroll toolbar, which enables you to do things such as share ad free links, and also it gives visual confirmation that you are indeed signed in.</p>

<p>My only problem (other than questions about the centralized model), is that Scroll gets logged out when you clear your browser cache etc. and I don't know what their plan is (and if it will continue to work the same way once browsers crack down further on cookies). So I have found myself logged out a few times, and then need to input my email and get a link to back log in again. It's only a mild annoyance, but it is true that it has been more awkward to use in the long run compared to Coil (which was more a set up once, work forever kind of thing).</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I think the world of micropayment funded content is finally beginning to mature, and “experiments” in the field are getting more and more thought out, and I expect to see these services continue to expand significantly  over the next few years. I cannot predict if the day of micropayments is here, and I know that globally $5/month to two main providers is cheap in some places, and unimaginable in others, but the nice part with Coil, is that people in places that are less wealthy can easily get set up to monetize content, and hopefully that will democratize media a little bit more – while also providing alternatives to established ad-based media.</p>

<p>There are also further questions to be asked, like the implications of society being desensitized to automatically paying out small sums of money all the time, and potential for accidentally paying money to people you wouldn't want to (even if there were ads doing it before anyway). It is also interesting what impact this has on privacy / tracking – and micropayment providers knowing what content you are looking at. I certainly hope that none of these businesses evolve to monetize your user data, as that is exactly the opposite of what I'm paying them to do. I also wonder about children and people unable to pay, and if we are just locking them out of ad-free experiences – which I would consider to be a dark outcome. Will it also make ad-funded stuff less viable – as more places stop relying on ads and use this instead? I certainly hope so.</p>

<p>I am very happy with my micropayment experience so far, and I intend to continue to use both Scroll and Coil for at least the next year, and I definitely feel a bit better not seeing ads this way, rather than simply applying an ad-blocker with no alternative funding for content producers. If you are willing to, I'd recommend giving it a try for yourself and experiencing the warm feeling of giving something back when reading something you have enjoyed, without the cursed tracking cookies and ads slowing loading and interrupting your experience.</p>

<p>
This article helps to understand and implement BRDFs commonly used in game engines, for use in both rasterization and 
emerging realtime raytracing. I hope it will help to overcome the steep learning curve of this complex topic, and to 
understand how to render different materials. Various optimizations and approximations are discussed, and code is 
shown for all relevant parts. Accompanying source code is a single file which can be compiled for both C++ and HLSL, 
and can be easily integrated into rendering applications.

  <div>
    
    
            <div><p><strong>In the education sector, personal and other privacy-sensitive data are digitally stored and exchanged at an increasing rate. It is important this is done in a safe and responsible manner. An investigation commissioned by the University of Groningen (RUG) and the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences (HvA) has shown there are privacy risks associated with the use of Google’s G Suite*.</strong></p>
<p>These risks are associated with the so-called metadata Google collects. SURF and SIVON have supported this investigation into privacy risks and are currently, on behalf of the education sector, in negotiations with Google to ensure these privacy risks are eliminated.</p>
</div>
      
  </div>
  </div><div>
          
            <div><p>The privacy risks were revealed by a so-called Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) on Google’s G Suite. A DPIA provides insights into the way data is collected, what is done with it, and what risks are associated with collection. The Dutch Ministry of Justice and Security had the DPIA carried out for the G Suite Enterprise version, the RUG and HvA had an investigation carried out on G Suite Education.</p>
<h2>Metadata</h2>
<p>Google collects metadata, for example, about the use of Google G Suite. With this data, Google can see what users click on most often, how long they are logged in for, what internet pages are used most, and what search queries are carried out most. This is, therefore, not a case of individual learning results or user’s address data.</p>
<h2>Risks</h2>
<p>Google regards itself a data controller rather than a processor. This means Google considers itself entitled to determine the purpose of the collection of metadata and the manner in which this is done. Moreover, Google states in their privacy agreements that they may unilaterally change the conditions surrounding the collection of metadata, without asking for [users’] permission.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For applications in educational institutions, we find it undesirable that the ownership and responsibility for this data lies with Google. As a result, educational institutions using Google G Suite have little to no control over what happens with their data, creating a potential risk for the future. For example, if this metadata is being used to place personalised advertising.</p>
<h2>Follow-up steps</h2>
<p>Currently, there is no agreement with Google in place surrounding the practices on collecting metadata and we are still discussing the indicated improvement points with them. We will also be submitting a request for advice about these privacy risks to the Dutch Data Protection Authority. We assume Google will make changes so the identified risks will be removed and education institutions can continue to use G Suite for Education safely.</p>
<p><em>* G Suite for Education was recently renamed Google Workspace for Education. Google Workspace for Education includes Classroom, Meet, Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides and more.</em></p>
</div>
      
      </div><div>
      <p><span>What products does Google G Suite for Education contain and what is Google Workspace for Education?</span></p><div>
            <div><p>Google G Suite for Education includes: Classroom, Meet, Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides, and more. Google G Suite for Education has &nbsp;recently been renamed Google Workspace for Education.</p>
<p>The complete list of applications: Google Classroom, Chat, Meet, Hangouts, Contacts, Tasks, Keep, Drive, Calendar, Jamboard, Sites, Forms, Sheets, Docs, Slides, Assignments, Cloud search and retrieval across services, Vault, Gmail, Cloud identity management</p>
</div>
      </div>
  </div><div>
      <p><span>What is a DPIA?</span></p><div>
            <p>A DPIA (Data Protection Impact Assessment) provides insights into the way data is collected, what is done with it, and what risks are associated with collection. When a DPIA is completed, measures can be put in place to reduce the risks.</p>
      </div>
  </div><div>
      <p><span>Why has a DPIA of Google G Suite been done?</span></p><div>
            <p>The DPIA was carried out in order to identify potential privacy risks of Google G Suite for Education when used by educational institutions. With the outcomes of the DPIA, we were able determine what measures need to be taken to limit those risks.</p>
      </div>
  </div><div>
      <p><span>What are the outcomes of the DPIA?</span></p><div>
            <p>The outcome of the DPIAs has shown there are privacy risks associated with the use of Google G Suite (Enterprise) for Education. Google has therefore amended their privacy conditions on a number of points. However, risks still remain in place. The DPIA also has shown that so-called ‘metadata’ is collected. Metadata remotely measures whether and how users use applications. This data is sent to the supplier of the software and for example, concerns the moment of login by users, what internet pages are visited, how long a document is being worked on, or how many words are being typed. Google still regards itself a controller of some of the data collected, rather than a processor. This means Google considers itself entitled to determine the purpose of the collection of metadata, as well as the manner in which this is done. Moreover, Google is not transparent about their data collection and processing practices. As a result, educational institutions using Google G Suite have little to no control over what happens with their data.</p>
      </div>
  </div><div>
      <p><span>What happens next?</span></p><div>
            <p>On behalf of the education sector, SURF and SIVON are in discussion with Google to resolve the privacy risks identified regarding the use of metadata. At the moment, Google has not yet implemented all changes the education sector requires. SURF and SIVON will submit a request for advice to the Dutch Data Protection Authority (AP). The AP is expected to deliver an assessment of the privacy risks identified.</p>
      </div>
  </div><div>
      <p><span>What happens if Google does not  resolve the privacy risks?</span></p><div>
            <p>We assume Google will make changes so the identified risks will be resolved.</p>
      </div>
  </div><div>
      <p><span>Should educational institutions stop using Google immediately? </span></p><div>
            <div><p>No, we believe there is a problem that needs to and can be solved. We assume Google will make the necessary adjustments. The current situation does not mean that schools and educational institutions should stop using Google G Suite at once, especially if they depend on it for the continuity of their education. The discussions with Google regarding changes to their policy are ongoing and the Dutch Data Protection Authority has also been asked to issue an advice.</p>
<p>We advise institutions that are currently considering implementing the use Google, to temporarily halt these plans until further notice.</p>
</div>
      </div>
  </div><div>
      <p><span>What changes has Google made as a result of the DPIA?</span></p><div>
            <p>It has been agreed with Google that they will communicate more clearly about the use of user data, including about the processing of metadata they collect. When using G Suite for Education, Google will put in place measures for logging in with a private account in the institutional environment, so personal information and institutional information are not mixed. Users will also be able to block access to "additional services", such as YouTube, for their institutional account.</p>
      </div>
  </div><div>
      <p><span>How do I know whether my institution has purchased the Google G Suite for education service via SURF?</span></p><div>
            <p>SURF has not had an agreement with Google for years. Only since very recently, there is the possibility to purchase G Suite via OCRE. Institutions have not yet made use of this option.</p>
      </div>
  </div><div>
      <p><span>If my institution still has a direct contract with Google for this service, can SURF take over this contract and ensure  the DPIA requirements are met?</span></p><div>
            <p>That depends on your institution's current agreements with Google. We are not in a position to make general assumptions about individual situations. Please contact your SURF relationship manager if you have any questions.</p>
      </div>
  </div><div>
      <p><span>What is the impact of the DPIA on other Google services currently on offer through OCRE?</span></p><div>
            <p>The DPIA that is completed, was specifically aimed at G Suite. Other Google solutions have not been tested at this point. As such, we cannot (yet) state with certainty whether these solutions comply or not. It is up to the institution to weigh up the pros and cons of their use and, above all, to consult their Data Protection Officer (FG). We do advise to proceed with caution when entering into new contracts.</p>
      </div>
  </div><div>
      <p><span>Within my institution we cannot simply switch to another service; what does SURF advise for these  situations?</span></p><div>
            <p>Currently, there is a problem that needs to be solved, and we assume Google will make the necessary adjustments to resolved these problems. The current situation does not mean the education sector should stop using Google G Suite immediately or all together, especially if they depend on it for the continuity of their education. The Dutch Data Protection Authority (Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens) has been asked to provide advice on this, and talks with Google about their policy are ongoing. We advise institutions considering using Google to take the results of this DPIA into account when making decisions.</p>
      </div>
  </div><div>
      <p><span>Do these privacy risks also apply to Microsoft/O365?</span></p><div>
            <p>Similar DPIAs have been&nbsp; carried out for Microsoft products and services two years ago. As a result, at the time, additional arrangements have been made with Microsoft. The final conclusion of these DPIAs was that the use of Microsoft products does not involve high risks, provided that the customer takes a number of measures.</p>
      </div>
  </div><div>
      <p><span>I have a question or comment I do not wish to discuss publicly. Who should I contact?</span></p><div>
            <p>If your question is not answered on this page, please contact your SURF relationship manager.</p>
      </div>
  </div><div>
      <p><span>SURF does not offer a contract with Google. Why is SURF involved in this?</span></p><div>
            <p>At the request of the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences (HvA) and the University of Groningen (RUG), SURF has been involved in this process since May 2020. SURF has been involved as this matter is of …</p></div></div></div>

<h2>A Kilo Byte-Sized LISP System</h2>

<p><a href="http://t3x.org/klisp/klisp.tgz">klisp.tgz</a> (35KB, KL21) &nbsp;|&nbsp;
<a href="http://t3x.org/klisp/klisp.txt.html">klisp.txt</a> &nbsp;|&nbsp;
<a href="http://t3x.org/klisp/kl.exe">kl.exe</a> (DOS, 14KB) &nbsp;|&nbsp;
<a href="http://t3x.org/klisp/kl.com">kl.com</a> (DOS, 13KB) &nbsp;|&nbsp;
<a href="http://t3x.org/klisp/22/index.html">KLISP&nbsp;22</a>
</p>

<p>Kilo&nbsp;LISP is a small interpreter for purely
symbolic LISP. Its source consists of 25K bytes of comprehensible
code (20KB C, 5KB LISP) and it runs in 64K bytes
of memory. There is also a
<a href="http://t3x.org/cpnc/index.html#klisp">version for CP/M</a>
that is written in
T3X and runs in 48K bytes of memory. Then there is a slightly
larger and <a href="http://t3x.org/klisp/22/index.html">more Common LISP-compatible
version</a> that needs 80K bytes of RAM. Despite its small size Kilo
LISP offers:
</p>

<ul>
 <li>lexical scoping
 </li><li>tail call elimination
 </li><li>macros
 </li><li>quasiquotation
 </li><li>variable-argument functions
 </li><li>constant-space garbage collection
 </li><li>image files
 </li><li>keyboard interrupt handling
</li></ul>

<p>The code should compile with any C89 (K&amp;R2/ANSI/ISO) C compiler.
It even compiles with Turbo C 2.0 or <a href="http://t3x.org/subc/">SubC</a>
and with K&amp;R (pre-ANSI) C when using
<a href="http://t3x.org/index.html#unproto">unproto</a>. The CP/M version requires
<a href="http://t3x.org/t3x/index.html#Z">T3X/Z</a> version 13 or later. The interpreter
does not use any stdio functions and compiles to a static executable of
</p>

<ul>
 <li>29K&nbsp;bytes using SubC on FreeBSD x86-64
 </li><li>31K&nbsp;bytes using T3X/Z on CP/M (Z80)
 </li><li>13K&nbsp;bytes using Turbo C on DOS (8086)
 </li><li>11K&nbsp;bytes using Mark Williams C on Coherent (80286)
 </li><li>512K&nbsp;bytes using GCC on FreeBSD x86-64 (LOL)
</li></ul>

<p>Language-wise, Kilo&nbsp;LISP is a LISP-1 using tail recursion to
implement iteration. It is a bit like Scheme, but using more
LISPy syntax and function names. See the <a href="http://t3x.org/klisp/klisp.txt.html">manual</a>
for details.</p>

<p>Since some of you have discovered
<a href="https://www.lulu.com/en/us/shop/nils-m-holm/the-kilo-lisp-system/hardcover/product-1wk5vvw6.html">the book</a>: it is a retro-style, overpriced hardcover
edition for my own personal amusement only and contains nothing that cannot be
found on this page!

<p><em>Guest post originally published on <a href="https://elastisys.com/what-was-observability-again/">Elastisys’s blog</a> by Cristian Klein, Sr Cloud Architect at </em>Elastisys</p>



<p><strong>Imagine running a business without financial projections or even knowing how much money is left in the bank. How would you know if you are swimming in a huge cash buffer or if you need to skip a customer lunch due to insufficient funds? Without observing your financials it is simply impossible to run a healthy business. Similarly, without observing your computing infrastructure, it is impossible to keep an application running healthy.</strong></p>



<p>In fact, observability is so critical that as of February 2021, the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) lists&nbsp;<a href="https://landscape.cncf.io/card-mode?category=observability-and-analysis&amp;grouping=category">102 projects in that category</a>. Observability is not only important, it is also expensive. Netflix is jokingly referred to as “a platform that produces massive amounts of logs, that happens to also stream videos”. Observability is expensive for two reasons:</p>



<ol><li>Observability needs to be&nbsp;<strong>at least one order of magnitude more reliable</strong>&nbsp;than the observed system. Otherwise, you will keep debugging your observability stack, instead of using it to keep your application running.<br></li><li>Since you never really know what to observe, until after an incident, it is common to&nbsp;<strong>observe more than you need</strong>. A good car driver not only looks ahead, but keeps scanning the surroundings to avoid an accident.</li></ol>



<p>In this post, let us dive deeper into observability: What it is, different types of observability and what it technically means to implement observability. At the end of this post, you will understand why you should resist the temptation to save a few bucks on observability.</p>



<h2>What is observability?</h2>



<p>Observability comes under many names, such as monitoring, auditing, telemetry, instrumenting. Ignoring the nuances, all these words essentially mean the same: Taking measurements of your infrastructure, platform and application to understand how it’s doing. As Peter Drucker used to say:&nbsp;“If you can’t measure it, you can’t manage it.”</p>



<p>If you are familiar with Lean Thinking — i.e., Build-Measure-Learn — then observability should come naturally to you. Observability closes the feedback loop via the “measure” phase. It allows your team to make rapid changes to an application, quickly adapt to its user base and environment, without unnecessary surprises. Good observability can convert “being woken up at 2am” into a mundane daily check.</p>



<h2>But what is observability, really?</h2>



<p>When talking about observability, we generally try to answer three questions:</p>



<ol><li>Are my users happy?</li><li>Are my applications happy?</li><li>Are my servers happy?</li></ol>



<p>We do this via three means: traces, logs and metrics. The former produce more data, but not necessarily more insight.&nbsp; Nowadays, each of these is expected to be near-real-time. (Would you be okay with a heart rate monitor that tells you yesterday’s heart rate?)</p>



<p>Let us go through logging and metrics, the two you should definitely have.</p>



<h2>Logging</h2>



<figure><img src="https://elastisys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/logging-1024x576.png?x26421" alt=""><figcaption>Screenshot of Kibana, which, together with Elasticsearch, is a leading logging solution.</figcaption></figure>



<p>While writing an application, your team will often add code for “logging”. These are explicit instructions to produce a log line, i.e., a bunch of meaningful text, when code execution passes through a major event. For example, “user X logged in” or “user Y authentication failure”, etc. These lines are what makes the difference between asking your customers “if they tried clearing their browser cache and reload” or actually investigating their complaint.</p>



<p>Logging is rather&nbsp;<strong>explicit</strong>: Your team needs to add logging code and needs to foresee what to log. The rule of thumb is that all major boundary events need to be logged. Some application bugs only manifest in production, so you should rather “over-log” than “under-log”. Otherwise, a lot of time is wasted hunting so-called&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisenbug">Heisenbugs</a>: bugs that are extremely difficult to reproduce, but nevertheless cause customer annoyance.</p>



<p>Logging produces&nbsp;<strong>massive amounts of data</strong>. To save costs, it’s best to think in terms of short-term and long-term logs. Short-term logs — e.g., the last 7 days — should be “googleable”, i.e., you should be able to perform a full-text search within seconds. Projects like&nbsp;<a href="https://opendistro.github.io/for-elasticsearch/">Elasticsearch/Kibana</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://grafana.com/oss/loki/">Loki</a>&nbsp;are most suitable for this purpose.</p>



<p>Long-term logs are stored in whatever form is cheapest, usually object storage. They are not immediately “googleable”, then again, the likelihood of needing to search through them is small. In fact, if you want to err on the side of privacy, it might be good to avoid long-term logs.</p>



<p>Sometimes, you do not care about the exact log line, rather about the number of times a specific event occurred. This information could be extracted from logs, but there is a more efficient way: metrics.</p>



<h2>Metrics</h2>



<figure><img src="https://elastisys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/metrics-1024x576.png?x26421" alt=""><figcaption>Screenshot of Grafana, a leading project for visualizing metrics.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Metrics — also called Service Level Indicators (SLI) or Key Performance Indicators (KPI) — are time series of numeric values. Think of it like recording outside temperature in all major cities on an hourly basis. Metrics use the<strong>&nbsp;least amount of space</strong>&nbsp;and provide (for the space they use) the&nbsp;<strong>maximum amount of insight</strong>. They can record the number of hourly active users, the number of requests hitting your application, the amount of free disk space, etc. Keeping an eye on metrics ensures that your users get a great experience with your application, while also keeping infrastructure costs down.</p>



<p>Metrics are rather&nbsp;<strong>explicit</strong>. Your team needs to add code for collecting and also exposing a given metric. However, most commonly used tools out there, such as Nginx, Kubernetes or MySQL, already export a plethora of metrics, which should provide you with a good situational awareness.</p>



<p>Projects like&nbsp;<a href="https://prometheus.io/">Prometheus</a>&nbsp;can help you collect metrics with minimal support required from the application, while&nbsp;<a href="https://grafana.com/">Grafana</a>&nbsp;can help visualize them. In fact, I would argue that screens filled with Grafana dashboards make a nice decoration for office walls. You know, when going to the office for work becomes a thing again.</p>



<p>So far we talked about visualization, i.e., a more intentional form of observability. But what if the system needs attention here and now?</p>



<h2>Alerts</h2>



<p>Alerts are like the system “crying for help” requesting the attention of a human. Usually, if a given metric exceeds a threshold, the on-call person receives an email, an SMS, or a message on Slack or Microsoft Teams. An automatic escalation may be implemented, e.g., if the first on-call person does not respond to the alert within 30 minutes, the second on-call person is alerted.</p>



<p>Alerts are tricky. Too much alerting and the system is “crying wolf”. Your team will end up with “alert fatigue” and start ignoring even the important ones. Too little alerting and your customers will “do alerting” for you … this is usually not the preferred alerting channel, least your accountant complains about having to cash in too many invoices.</p>



<p>Therefore, the bar for “when to alert” should be high. Is this a “2am” or “mayday” event, i.e., should someone be woken up at night if this happens? Or is this a “pan-pan” event and can be dealt with during daytime?</p>



<p>Fortunately, projects like Prometheus, not only enable alerting, they can also perform predictions. Knowing that a disk will get full in 72 hours, can prevent both disappointing customers with a downtime and ruining a team member’s good night sleep.</p>



<h2>Summary</h2>



<p>Lack of observability is like driving with closed eyes: You can’t tell how close you are to a disaster. The faster you are driving and the busier the road, the more you should watch out.</p>



<p>Observability is the same: The faster you want your team to add features, the more you should invest in observability. And, while it may be tempting to save a few bucks on observability, those savings will quickly erode during the next slow-to-fix incident.</p>

<p>What you see above is a tool to reorder the pages of a PDF file, into the order as described by Brent Yorgey <a href="https://mathlesstraveled.com/2016/01/08/a-new-way-to-read-and-print-double-sided-paper/">here</a> (called “Möbius double-sided printing” <a href="https://byorgey.wordpress.com/how-to-print-things/#m%C3%B6bius-double-sided">here</a>). Basically, it reorders the <i>n</i> pages [1, 2, …, <i>n</i>] of a PDF file into the order [1, <i>m</i>+1, 2, <i>m</i>+2, 3, <i>m</i>+3, … <i>m</i>, 2<i>m</i>], where <i>m</i> = ⌈<i>n</i>/2⌉, and the final page 2<i>m</i> is omitted if it doesn't exist (i.e., if <i>n</i> is odd).</p>

<p>To use this tool, just upload a PDF file above, then click on the link to download a new PDF file with reordered pages.</p>


<p><i>(In short, so that it requires less mental effort to turn pages, and so that it's easier to look at the next/previous page(s) simultaneously. It's explained by Brent Yorgey on the two pages mentioned above; reproducing part of the explanation here along with his illustrations.)</i></p>

<p>Consider the standard/default method of two-sided printing: for a document with 8 pages, the result looks like:</p>

<p>When printed out as a bunch of loose sheets, this order has two (very minor) advantages over the standard order:
  </p><ol>
    <li><p>When you're done reading a certain page, the way to proceed to the next page is the same regardless of whether you're on an odd-numbered page or an even-numbered page: you don't have to remember, and so at page boundaries you don't have to shift your attention from the contents of what you're reading to figuring out page mechanics. What you do is always the same, namely flip the current sheet of paper and move it to the bottom of the stack:</p>

    <li>When the text refers to the previous or the next page, you can always very easily look at that page or put it adjacent to the current one (so you can see both at once), which with the standard method is impossible when an odd-numbered page refers to its next page or an even-numbered page refers to its previous one. Also, if you just want to glance at the previous page, there is never any page flipping required: just twist your wrist and look at the bottom of the stack. (This is my main reason for preferring this method over the minor variant he calls “Two-way double-sided”.)</li>
  </ol>



<p>The code rearranges pages using <a href="https://pdf-lib.js.org/">pdf-lib</a> (<a href="https://github.com/Hopding/pdf-lib">GitHub</a>) (v1.3.0) by Andrew Dillon. I tried to use Mozilla's PDF.js, but its documentation on these “core” matters (as opposed to just rendering a PDF in a canvas or whatever) seems poor/nonexistent compared to pdf-lib, which is excellent.</p>

<p>The idea of printing documents in this way, and the analysis and pictures above, are due to Brent Yorgey (<a href="https://mathlesstraveled.com/2016/01/08/a-new-way-to-read-and-print-double-sided-paper/">here</a> and <a href="https://byorgey.wordpress.com/how-to-print-things/#m%C3%B6bius-double-sided">here</a>, as mentioned).</p>

The kids, their requirements and then planning their workday around that.</p><p>But in the case of Brett, he's not just a father of 3 but the CEO of ~15 person marketing company AND launching another startup. So besides running a family, he's also responsible for running and growing a business and starting a new one too.</p><div><p>If you're thinking Brett would be struggling to manage all of those things? </p><p>I’m afraid, you're wrong.</p></div><p>That's what blew me away! Frankly, at the end of my conversation with him I felt it would actually be easy for him to manage all those things with the several concepts, principles and tools that he uses to guard and make the most of his time.</p><p>One key learning that I took away from him is how he reflects back on the tasks that he didn't accomplish by the assigned deadline. He re-analyzes if those tasks were really important enough or could they just be delegated or completely ignored. Instead of, you know, feeling guilty and crying wet tears over them. I mean that’s what I do at least. Unlike Brett, who does this whole re-analysis to help him make better time allocation decisions in future.</p><p>That's just one of the many useful techniques, concepts, tools he shared in our entire conversation. It's almost like a mini-productivity course if you read it through.</p><p>Let's dive straight in!</p><blockquote>If you like this blog post, please take a minute to share it around. <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.mailmanhq.com%2Fbrett-farmiloe-markitors%2F&amp;via=Mailman_HQ%20%40mohitmamoria&amp;text=Brett%20Farmiloe%20-%20CEO%20with%203%20kids%20and%202%20businesses%20to%20run%21">Click here to get an auto-populated tweet</a>.</blockquote><h3 id="brett-introduces-himself">Brett introduces himself</h3><p>Hi I’m Brett Farmiloe. Father of 3, CEO of <a href="https://markitors.com/">Markitors</a>, an SEO company for small businesses and I’m also launching a startup that’s considered a knowledge network (terkel.io). Balancing all of those things is basically what I try to do everyday.</p><h3 id="what-is-a-knowledge-network">What is a knowledge network?</h3><div><p>The knowledge network I’m building is called <a href="https://terkel.io/">Terkel</a>. Panelists can go in, answer questions from their area of expertise and get published. Sharing your knowledge is the best way to promote your small business.</p><p>It was born out of the fact that our SEO company was turning away 9 out of 10 leads as they didn’t meet certain criteria for us to develop a positive ROI for them. So we created this knowledge network where these small businesses could still participate, get value and build some brand authority for their website, so that eventually they can be a good client for us.</p></div><h3 id="how-brett-started-his-business">How Brett started his business?</h3><div><p>I started Markitors as a freelancer, had a bunch of clients. I was having a really good time, I was &nbsp;traveling around the world doing marketing and it was great. Then I got my website to rank at #1 in google search results. If you google the term “Digital marketing company” anywhere in the United States, you would find markitors.com on top, and then when you call the phone it’d just be me hangin’ out in my daughter’s bedroom. People would say, ”hey tell me about your company” and I’d go,” well it’s just me”. That inspired to actually go ahead and start a company and now we’ve got around 15 employees.</p><p>The thing that has recurred time and time again for the past decade or so is this notion that help is very hard to find in digital marketing. Small business owners have this aspiration or dream for their business and it’s very hard for entrepreneurs to realize that dream without proper help. Small business owners keep coming at me with a sense of distrust, which is valid as they might have burnt before or they’re hearing conflicting things from multiple people. They’re in a confused state, I know I need it but I have no idea what to do.</p><p>The thing that propels and motivates me with Markitors is to help small businesses make a big impact. With Markitors the goal is to create something larger than what a freelancer can and make a difference in many people’s lives. I believe small businesses are the backbone of the American economy and worldwide economy. If we can help that space by giving small businesses more clarity on how they could realize their dreams then I don’t think there can be anything better than that.</p></div><h3 id="why-his-company-is-called-markitors-">Why his company is called “Markitors”?</h3><div><p>When I graduating from college, I majored in accounting. My first job out of school was of a “Financial Auditors”, so I was auditing balance sheets and financial statements. I then transitioned over to marketing and said let’s combine marketing and auditors in one company name and hence, “Markitors”.</p><p>It was a good representation of the differentiation I was bringing to the market and on top of that, the domain was available so I just went with it.</p><p>Another thing I like about the name “Markitors”, is that the misspellings are io which is short for input-output. Since SEO is increasingly technology and data-driven, so that input-output (io) really helps position the differentiation we’re seeking.</p></div><h3 id="what-the-pandemic-has-taught-about-time-management">What the pandemic has taught about time management?</h3><div><p>For me, it’s essentially that it’s impossible to work in the mornings with kids at home until they’re off to school. Else, it’s just calling for frustration throughout the day. The first part of my day, say 6 AM to 8 AM is focused on getting the kids out of the doors so that I can focus on work.</p><p>Instead of having this balance, I prefer giving full attention and focus on 1 thing. That’s lesson number 1 for me. In the mornings it’s my kids, and then my work.</p></div><h3 id="productivity-tools-he-uses">Productivity tools he uses</h3><div><p>I use a project management tool to organize everything, for me that’s <strong>Asana</strong>.</p><p>Asana helps me plan-out and prioritize different tasks based on today feature, upcoming feature and the stuff that’s later. That helps me organize my activities based on when they need to get done.</p><p>Then I use <strong>Google Calendar</strong> for scheduling and blocking time for activities. I have mainly 2-hour blocks to get stuff done. Time-blocking on my calendar helps limit distractions and really get things done that need to be done.</p><p>I’ll also give a shoutout to <strong><a href="https://www.mailmanhq.com/">Mailman</a></strong>, it has been awesome from a limiting-distractions point of view. The way that I structure and use Mailman is I have 3 email deliveries throughout the day, morning delivery at 7 AM, the afternoon delivery at 12:30 so that I can have lunch and when I come back there are some messages to address and then I have the end of day delivery at around 4:30 PM to quickly address the things that I need to before I log off for the day.</p><p>I don’t if you’ve watched the documentary Social Dilemma. It basically talks about how people are addicted to certain technologies and I find it funny that one of my friends who I went to high school with, wasn’t addicted to social stuff but he was addicted to email. Honestly, I could sympathize with that, as I’m not very active on social but digital addiction can very well be email. Mailman has really helped me limit those distractions and stay productive.</p><p>Talking about productivity tools, another good one I use is <strong>Calendly</strong>. It has been really helpful in self-scheduling meetings and client calls, availing the continuous back and forth for finalizing a time that works for both parties.</p></div><h3 id="on-managing-a-team">On managing a team</h3><div><p>Recently, we made a key hire at Markitors, “VP of Operations “ to take care of the day to day things that keep coming up. When you’re running a marketing agency, small fires keep popping, and those need to be addressed, so having someone responsible to take care of all of that really helps the founder or CEO focus on the more important things like growing the business.</p><p>This is also a good thing for the team, as I think of myself as more like a disruptor, I like to experiment, challenge, and change things. That chaotic nature is not good for employees, who’d like to have some stability. Bringing in someone to take care of operations has ensured that, while I get to dabble more in creative work, taking the business forward and in the direction we want to go in.</p></div><blockquote>If you like this blog post, please take a minute to share it around. <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.mailmanhq.com%2Fbrett-farmiloe-markitors%2F&amp;via=Mailman_HQ%20%40mohitmamoria&amp;text=Brett%20Farmiloe%20-%20CEO%20with%203%20kids%20and%202%20businesses%20to%20run%21">Click here to get an auto-populated tweet</a>.</blockquote><h3 id="team-productivity-by-wins-">Team productivity by “wins”</h3><p>Every morning at 8:30 we have a team meeting where we all discuss our “wins” from the previous day and 1 priority for the day, then everyone goes their own ways and we hold each other accountable to accomplish that 1 thing.</p><h3 id="on-burnout">On burnout</h3><div><p>I think if any entrepreneur would be lying if they say they’ve never been burnt out or close to burnout.

<p>Fasting is the process by which someone holds off eating for a certain amount of time. Based on <a href="https://healthblog.uofmhealth.org/wellness-prevention/intermittent-fasting-it-right-for-you">University of Michigan Health Lab</a>, intermittent fasting is beneficial for weight loss and may help improve blood pressure, reduce liver fat, and lower cholesterol[1].</p>



<p>If you’re considering intermittent fasting, you must be quite confident to resist your craving for food in the morning, at noon, or even in the evening.</p>



<p>What about your craving for coffee?</p>



<p>This article tells you everything you need to know about coffee and intermittent fasting.</p>



<h3>Can I Drink Coffee While Intermittent Fasting?</h3>



<p>The short answer is YES.</p>



<p>The long answer is you can drink coffee during intermittent fasting because it may bolster the benefits of fasting.</p>



<h4><strong>Inflammation Reduction</strong></h4>



<p>Chronic inflammation is the cause root of many diseases. Based on the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28967799/">research published by PubMed</a>[2], intermittent fasting and coffee intake are beneficial to reduce inflammation.</p>



<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27842207/">Some research</a>[3] indicates higher coffee intake may help reducing the risk of metabolic syndrome that is a type of inflammation featuring high blood pressure, fat excess, high cholesterol and high blood sugar.</p>



<p>There’s also <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29590460/">research</a>[4] indicating that coffee intake may decrease the risk of Type 2 Diabetes. In addition, daily up to 3 cups (710 ml) of coffee may lead to a 19% reduced risk of death from heart disease.</p>



<h4><strong>Good for Your Brain Health</strong></h4>



<p>One of the reasons why intermittent fasting becomes increasingly popular is that intermittent fasting may promote brain health and protect against nervous system disease related with age.</p>



<p>Fortunately, coffee features such advantages as well.</p>



<p>Similar with intermittent fasting, regular coffee intake may reduce the risk of mental decline, Alzheimer disease and Parkinson.</p>



<p>Under the condition of intermittent fasting, your body will generate energy from ketone fat, which is related with brain health improvement. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28177691/">The earlier research</a>[5] indicated that the caffeine in the coffee equivalently promotes the generation of ketone.</p>



<p>Moreover, intermittent fasting may improve brain health by increasing autophagy that is the process of getting rid of cells that are damaged or dysfunctional. Autophagy may protect against mental decline correlated with age.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24769862/">a research in mice</a>[6] indicates that coffee intake can promote the generation of autophagy.</p>



<p>Therefore, coffee intake during intermittent fasting may be quite beneficial to your health and coffee can’t break your fasting.</p>



<figure><amp-img width="1200" height="628" src="https://www.fastyle.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/coffee-fasting.png" alt="coffee fasting" layout="intrinsic" i-amphtml-layout="intrinsic"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="628" src="https://www.fastyle.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/coffee-fasting.png" alt="coffee fasting" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyBoZWlnaHQ9JzYyOCcgd2lkdGg9JzEyMDAnIHhtbG5zPSdodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZycgdmVyc2lvbj0nMS4xJy8+"></amp-img></figure>



<h3>Are All Types of Coffee Fit for Intermittent Fasting?</h3>



<p>Definitely NO.</p>



<p>You can drink coffee while fasting. However, maybe not the coffee you are used to. Not want to break your fasting, black coffee is recommended.</p>



<p>Coffee nowadays has changed to more of a dessert beverage that is packed with calories. As one of the main benefits of intermittent fasting is weight loss, the coffee containing cream, sugar, or any type of sweetener should be avoided. Sugar is a monster that will quickly increase your blood sugar level. Therefore, sugar should be avoided being added to your coffee if you are fasting to lose weight.</p>



<p>In addition, coffee is beneficial during fasting as it provides caffeine and will have you up and moving with energy even when you are feeling sluggish because of the lack of food. Caffeine is also the world’s most widely used nootropic (smart drug). So, drinking coffee during fasting will ensure that your mind is still working properly as well.</p>



<h3>Does Coffee Stop Autophagy?</h3>



<p>Partially yes.</p>



<p>If too much coffee is drunk, insulin signal and mTOR will be stimulate that will stop autophagy. Nevertheless, the polyphenols or plant compounds in coffee can stimulate AMPK, so coffee tends to start autophagy in general.</p>



<h3>How Much Coffee Can I Drink Every Day if My Fasting isn’t Broken?</h3>



<p>Generally speaking, 5 teacups of coffee can be drunk during 24 hours, which won’t have obvious effect on your blood sugar on an empty stomach. 1 to 2 teacups of coffee don’t stimulate mTOR or reduce ketone as long as you don’t suffer from diabetes or slow down coffee metabolism genetically.</p>



<h3>What Can I Add to My Coffee that Won’t Break My Fasting?</h3>



<p>If you like flavored coffee, that’s also OK.</p>



<p>What can be added to your coffee for fasting, the key is to watch the <strong>calorie count</strong> and <strong>avoid sugars</strong>. One cup of just plain black coffee is only about three calories. This is why during fasting, having a couple cups of coffee will not take away the health benefits by affecting your metabolic change in a negative way. If you need to add something to the coffee to make it more suitable for your taste, a little bit of artificial sweetener probably won’t hurt you. Still, don’t go overboard with it. In fact, you would be better off trying a few sprinkles of cinnamon instead. Cinnamon is loaded with antioxidants and has anti-inflammatory properties.</p>



<p>Other things that can be added to your coffee that won’t break your fasting include:</p>



<ul><li>A sprinkle of cinnamon</li><li>A little nutmeg</li><li>A little cocoa</li><li>Some sweet flavor without fat like stevia</li><li>Some sugar-free almond milk</li></ul>



<h3>What to Avoid Adding to Coffee for Fasting?</h3>



<p>As stated above, the elaborate coffee available nowadays at the stylish shops and cafes are not only pricey, but they can be as high in calories as a milkshake. Milkshakes won’t help you lose weight.</p>



<p>Anything that adds calories to your coffee needs to be looked at closely. If the coffee is getting close to 50 calories or above, it can knock you out of fasting. Adding milk and sugar can easily make that cup of coffee a couple hundred calories. It is best to avoid the heavy creamers, the fancy flavoring, and anything else that will have your calorie count climbing.</p>



<h3>Play It Smart: Use Coffee to Strengthen Your Fasting</h3>



<p>Drinking coffee while fasting for eight to twelve hours is fine as long as you don’t overdo it. Try to limit yourself to two cups and keep them low calorie and you can still have all the health benefits. However, don’t feel like you have to drink coffee while fasting if you are not a fan of the beverage. Water and certain teas are perfectly fine as well!</p>



<h3>Besides Coffee, What Else Can I Drink During Intermittent Fasting?</h3>



<p>One rule, any drink is OK with intermittent fasting as long as no sugar is included. Of course, alcoholic drinks aren’t suggested for the sake of your health.</p>



<h4><strong>The Best Drink: Water</strong></h4>



<p>Water is naturally free of calories and a must-have necessity to your body.</p>



<p>Do you know sometimes emotional hunger is aroused because you’re thirsty? Drinking water is beneficial for you to avoid the risk of the following diseases:</p>



<ul><li>Heart diseases</li><li>High blood pressure</li><li>High cholesterol</li><li>Diabetes</li><li>Overweight</li></ul>



<p>If you’d like flavored water, you can try adding some lemonade to it. As a natural flavor, lemonade contains zero calory.</p>



<h4><strong>Tea</strong></h4>



<p>Similar to black coffee, tea contains zero calories. Any type of brewed tea is friendly with intermittent fasting no matter it comes from tea bags, leaves, or flakes. High-calorie food should be avoided being added water for fasting such as honey, milk, or heavy cream, which is the same as coffee intake.</p>

This agreement is entered into freely by both parties set forth in the signature block below (“Buyer” and “Seller”) and both parties agree to honor and be bound by the terms of this agreement in any court, real, imagined, or otherwise, or as set before any judge or any being serving in a similarly recognizable capacity making judgment as to the validity of this contract, in any state of reality or nonreality, physical or metaphysical, for all eternity (past, present, and future) and also any states of being or nonbeing outside of our human conception of time.</p><p><strong>BUYER AND SELLER AGREE AS FOLLOWS:</strong></p><p><strong>SECTION I. DEFINITION OF “SOUL”</strong></p><p>A. &nbsp; &nbsp;The “Soul” of the Seller for the purposes of this contract is understood to mean the spiritual, immortal, and immaterial essence of their self which exists independently and distinctly from their material being.</p><p>B. &nbsp; &nbsp; While both the Buyer and the Seller acknowledge that the true nature, scope, and existence of any Such soul, whether or not it exists, is unknown and unknowable to either of them, the ambiguity involved in no way limits or renders any portion of this agreement invalid and the total scope of the Soul shall be considered as subject to the agreement.</p><p>C. &nbsp; &nbsp;The Seller’s religion or belief system lacking a concept of a “Soul” or metaphysical reality lacking the concept of a “Soul” as given shall not alter the stated intent of this contract, and the essence being transferred to the Buyer shall constitute whatever immaterial equivalent, if any, exists that is closest in nature to the given definition of the Seller’s spiritual, immortal, and immaterial essence.</p><p>D. &nbsp; &nbsp;In the event that a “Soul” is not actually immortal, this contract shall remain in effect through whatever duration of time or non-time that the soul exists in any manner, state, or way of being.</p><p>E. &nbsp; &nbsp; In the event that the Seller’s “Soul” does not exist as an independent entity outside of the whole “one-ness” of reality as commonly described in some belief systems, and in the event that this belief about the nature of reality reflects actual reality, this contract will remain in effect for whatever period of time or non-time and to whatever degree that the Seller’s immaterial essence is distinguishable in any form, manner, or state of being from the sum whole of immaterial or material existence.</p><p>F. &nbsp; &nbsp; The Buyer acknowledges and fully understands that the Seller may deny the existence of any such Soul as defined here in Section I or deny the possibility of transferring ownership of said Soul to another party according to their personal belief system. Buyer agrees to accept the risk of being unable to actually take possession of said Soul from the selling party due to either its nonexistence or non-transferability on the part of the Soul’s owner.</p><p><strong>SECTION II. SALE AND TRANSFER OF SOUL</strong></p><p>A. &nbsp; &nbsp;Buyer and Seller intend this Agreement to be a contract of sale for the Seller’s Soul, as defined in Section I, wherein the Buyer shall provide the compensation outlined in Section III in exchange for ownership and use of the Seller’s Soul as described in Sections I and IV.</p><p>B. &nbsp; &nbsp; The transfer of ownership of this Soul shall occur at the moment this document is signed and returned to the Buyer by the Seller in any format, electronic or physical.</p><p>C. &nbsp; &nbsp;If for any reason this Soul or a portion of this Soul shall be found to be non-transferable from Seller to Buyer, this shall in no way limit the other provisions of this agreement or the Buyer’s rights with respect to use and possession of the Soul. Seller agrees to transfer ownership of Soul to Buyer to whatever degree is possible, in part or in whole, and commits to the terms of usage, transfer, or possession of Soul as described in Section IV to whatever degree may be possible.</p><p>D. &nbsp; &nbsp;As compensation for this transfer of ownership of the Soul, Buyer agrees to compensate Seller an amount of no less than ten (10) United States Dollars, to be transferred according to the terms given in Section III, within 48 commonly recognized Earth-hours of the receipt of the signed agreement via any medium, physical or electronic.</p><p>E. &nbsp; &nbsp; This transfer of ownership of the Soul from Seller to Buyer provides the Buyer with full usage rights and ownership of the soul to do with as they see fit, including but not limited to the provisions given in Section IV of this document.</p><p>F. &nbsp; &nbsp; This transfer of ownership of the Soul from Seller to Buyer prevents the Seller from any personal or public use of or claim of ownership to the transferred Soul without the express permission, in writing, of the Buyer. Other than limiting their making claims of ownership to the Soul, this clause shall in no way limit the material actions of the Seller.</p><p>G. &nbsp; &nbsp;This transfer is permanent and irrevocable except as given in the terms of this contract. Buyer shall be the new owner of Seller’s Soul for all time and non-time and states of being, with all according rights and privileges of use as given in Section IV.</p><p>H. &nbsp; &nbsp;Buyer and Seller agree that actual possession, use, or storage of the Soul by the Buyer is not required for Buyer’s ownership, transfer, or future use of the Soul to be enforceable under these terms. Buyer may, at their discretion, leave the Soul in the location it currently exists or move it from its current location at any time and at their own discretion. Buyer may use or not use the soul as Buyer sees fit. Failure to take possession of or to use the Soul shall in no way invalidate the ownership, usage rights, subsequent transfer, or any other term of this contract with respect to the transferred Soul.</p><p><strong>SECTION III. COMPENSATION FOR TRANSFER</strong></p><p>A. &nbsp; &nbsp;Buyer agrees to compensate Seller with an amount of no less than ten (10) United States Dollars for the transfer of the Soul within 48 commonly recognized Earth-hours of the receipt of the signed agreement via any medium, physical or electronic, as described in Section II-C, according to the conditions outlined in this Section (III).</p><p>B. &nbsp; &nbsp; The sending of these funds (hereafter “the payment”) shall occur via PayPal.com and shall be sent to an electronic mail address provided by the Seller.</p><p>C. &nbsp; &nbsp;In the event that no address is provided by the Seller to render the payment, Buyer will send payment to the address used to transfer electronically signed contract documents or make a reasonable attempt to acquire such an address from the Seller via the same communication medium over which the signed documents are transferred. Failure to acquire a valid payment address from Seller within the 48-hour period shall not invalidate the contract or the Buyer’s ownership and usage of transferred Soul provided this is the primary reason for the Buyer’s inability to render compensation.</p><p>D. &nbsp; &nbsp;Seller acknowledges that small variations in actual value of currency may occur from moment to moment and that in sending a nominal amount of $10 USD via the PayPal payments system within 48 hours of receipt of the contract as described in Section III-A, they have satisfied their obligation to compensate the Seller under the terms of this agreement.</p><p>E. &nbsp; &nbsp; Seller agrees to pay any and all standard PayPal fee percentages that may arise in the course of transferring sent funds to their personal accounts.</p><p>F. &nbsp; &nbsp; Seller agrees that their failure to accept the funds shall in no way invalidate the agreement and that the contract will remain completely whole and enforceable regardless of their acceptance or non-acceptance of the payment.</p><p>G. &nbsp; &nbsp;In the event that the Buyer fails to send the compensation as described in this Section (III) within 48 hours of receipt of the contract signed by the Seller, the contract will be considered null and void and the ownership of the Soul shall revert to the Seller.</p><p>H. &nbsp; &nbsp;No action or use of the Soul may be undertaken by the Buyer within the 48-hour period beginning with the receipt of the contract signed by the Seller until and unless the Buyer has adequately rendered payment to Seller as described in this Section (III).</p><p><strong>SECTION IV. OWNERSHIP AND USE OF SOUL</strong></p><p>A. &nbsp; &nbsp;Buyer and Seller agree that the owner of the Soul may possess, claim, keep, store, offer, transfer, or make use of it in whole or in part in any manner that they see fit to do so, conventional or otherwise, including (but not limited to) the purposes described in this Section (IV). Example uses of the Soul which would be permitted under these terms include (but are not limited to):</p><ul><li>Publicly claiming to be the owner of the Soul in question.</li><li>Transferring of said Soul, in whole or part, to any person or entity, for any reason.</li><li>Sacrificing or offering said Soul, in whole or in part, to any deity or spiritual entity.</li><li>Spending or using the soul, in whole or in part, for some purpose which causes it to diminish in value, quantity, or substance or be subsumed into a larger whole.</li><li>Transferring the burden, credit, or responsibility of any actions reflected in the State of a Soul from another Soul to this Soul or from this Soul to another Soul.</li><li>Long term storage, usage, or preservation of the Soul in a state which would prevent it from taking the course of development, evolution, or relocation it may otherwise take naturally or due to the actions or material status of the Seller.</li></ul><p>B. &nbsp; &nbsp; Seller agrees to fully relinquish any right of ownership or usage they have in the Soul and agrees that they will not attempt to use, keep, transfer, or sell the same Soul again even if it remains in their possession or immediate vicinity.</p><p>C. &nbsp; &nbsp;Seller agrees not to interfere or attempt to interfere via metaphysical, magickal, or spiritual means with Buyer’s attempt to claim, transfer, or …</p></div></section></article></div></main></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="section-5-61"><div><div id="new_columns-6-61"><div id="div_block-7-61"><p><span id="span-26-61">
<p>You might think the US would be world champion of household debt, yet the highest private indebtment has always been in the Nordic countries. Debt, however, takes different forms, writes <strong>Martino Comelli</strong>. In Scandinavia, inclusive welfare systems make debt into an investment. Elsewhere, gerontocratic welfare and consumer credit can become a burden</p>
<h2>Debt and welfare: a trade-off?</h2>
<p>The economic crisis of 2007–2008 put household debt in the spotlight. <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008">A common narrative</a></strong> was that cheap credit fuelled a house price bubble in the US. The financial industry sold derivatives based on those debts and many European banks who bought those products went belly up, allowing the crisis to spread across the Atlantic.</p>
<p>Debt, and in particular, household debt, has been regarded with suspicion ever since. Many scholars argue that the rise of household debt was caused by welfare retrenchment, suggesting a trade-off between welfare and debt. A lack of welfare was compensated by private leveraging. Other scholars pointed out that many governments were pushing for asset-based welfare – like buying housing as a form of private welfare – encouraged by steadily rising house prices in the years preceding the crash.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="683" height="776" src="https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure1.png" alt="" srcset="https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure1.png 683w, https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure1-264x300.png 264w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px"><figcaption>Figure 1: Quantity of household debt in OECD countries</figcaption></figure>
<p>Yet empirical data suggests that the welfare-debt trade-off may be mistaken. Curiously, the highest indebtment ratio in the OECD was, and is, in northern European countries such as Denmark, Norway, Sweden and the Netherlands. These are the countries with the most far-reaching welfare programmes, and known to be fiscally responsible. Clearly, the welfare-debt trade-off theory needs a rethink.</p>
<h2>Private debt, public virtues: on the age-orientation of welfare</h2>
<p>Is it, then, a complementary relationship? Generous welfare provides security, encouraging people to borrow more. But this interpretation does not fly either. Many European countries have generous welfare – France for example, has higher social spending than Denmark – but nowhere near the level of household debt of the Nordic countries.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/02732173.2021.1875088">My research on the relations between welfare and household debt</a> </strong>offers a novel explanation of the welfare-debt conundrum. There is no trade-off between private debt and welfare, nor is there a complementary relation. What matters is where the welfare money is spent and how. It isn’t necessarily about the quantity of spending, but about its direction.</p>
<blockquote><p>While mortgages are a marker of privilege, another common type of debt, consumer credit, is often a marker of need</p></blockquote>
<p>Most welfare spending is concentrated on older generations, particularly retired people. According to <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-cycle_hypothesis">Franco Modigliani</a>'s life-cycle <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-cycle_hypothesis">hypothesis</a></strong>, debt is linked to one's stage in life. People take on debt when young because their income is low but their expenses (housing, children, leisure) high – and they pay this debt off as they age.</p>
<p>Countries that not only provide social help for the elderly, but counterbalance that with spending and services for the young and economically active, tend to have higher private debt (see Figure 2). In particular, countries that spend on education and active labour market policies, and those which offer better protection for people in precarious jobs, have the highest levels of private debt.</p>
<p>Household debt is an unintended consequence of assuring a smoother transition to adulthood. In conservative continental European countries, however, despite high welfare spending, welfare is concentrated mostly on the elderly and on people with stable jobs. This discourages younger generations from taking risks, including mortgage debt.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="980" height="714" src="https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure2.png" alt="Figure 2. Quantity of household debt by the age orientation of welfare spending in OECD countries" srcset="https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure2.png 980w, https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure2-300x219.png 300w, https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure2-768x560.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px"><figcaption>Figure 2. Quantity of household debt by the age orientation of welfare spending in OECD countries.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Note: Figure 2 illustrates an inverse relationship between the elderly orientation of social spending (EBiSS, on the x axis), and the quantity of household debt as % of net disposable income (on the y axis). The EBiSS is a rate between social spending for the economically active (at the numerator) versus spending oriented toward the elderly (at the denominator). A higher value on the EBiSS index means that a greater share of social spending is going to the elderly.</p>
<h2>Consumer credit? The three worlds of debtfare capitalism</h2>
<p>Most of the debt in OECD countries is mortgage debt. While mortgages are a marker of privilege, another common type of debt, consumer credit, is often a marker of need.</p>
<p>If we consider consumer credit, the welfare-debt theory makes sense again. While consumer credit is more the exception than the norm in Europe, and almost absent in the Nordic countries, it is common in Anglo-liberal countries (UK, US and Canada) where it is used by families as a substitute for poor welfare provision.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="895" height="531" src="https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure3.png" alt="Figure 3. Clusters measures" srcset="https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure3.png 895w, https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure3-300x178.png 300w, https://theloop.ecpr.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/figure3-768x456.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 895px) 100vw, 895px"><figcaption>Figure 3. Clusters measures</figcaption></figure>
<p>Figure 3 shows three main patterns of private debt/welfare configurations; what we call debtfare:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the Nordic / youth-oriented model, household debt is high, consumer credit is low, and the rate of young people Not in Education, Employment, or Training (NEET) is very low.</li>
<li>
<p>In conservative European countries such as Germany and Italy, there are a lot of NEETs, welfare is orientated toward the elderly, and there is little household debt or consumer credit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Anglo-liberal countries such as the UK, US and Canada, consumer credit is high, and so is overall debt (though not as high as in the Nordic countries). The share of NEETs is remarkably high, and most welfare is oriented toward the elderly.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Household financialisation, then, follows different paths and patterns. Both liberal and conservative welfare is gerontocratic, and they have a high level of NEETs, but while the former is oriented toward a market solution to inequality (more debt), the latter discourages any form of risk taking.</p>
<p>So, while paying attention to debt is important, it shouldn’t be the only lesson of the 2008 crisis. Further attention should be paid to the macro-sociological conditions that give debt different meanings: inclusive welfare can make debt into an investment, but gerontocratic welfare can make debt a burden.</p>

        <p>As your scientific career advances, you will have to supply publication
lists, sometimes also known as ‘research output lists’ or some such
nonsense,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> for all kinds of purposes. I used to do this manually,
but with an increasing number of publications and requirements for the
publication lists, I started to lose track.</p>
<p>Following my maxim of ‘automate the boring stuff if you need it
repeatedly’, I developed a solution based on BibLaTeX to typeset my
publication list for me. The best thing: it can be easily adjusted to
fit different occasions, as we will see!</p>

<p>To get started, you will first need to store your publications in
a bibliography file. See <a href="http://bastian.rieck.me/blog/posts/2020/bibliography/">my previous post on how to keep a bibliography</a>
for details on how to accomplish this. I will use a simple entry of an
<a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/moor20a.html">actual publication of mine</a> as an example:</p>

</code></pre></div><p>This entry is nothing out of the ordinary—except for the <code>author+an</code>
field, whose purpose will become clear later on. Putting this in a file
<code>Publications.bib</code>, we may now start a new LaTeX document called
<code>Publications.tex</code>. The file can use <em>any</em> document class of your
choice, but the important parts are how we load the <code>biblatex</code> package:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="latex"><span>\usepackage</span>[
  backend      = biber,
  doi          = false,
  giveninits   = false,
  maxcitenames = 99,
  isbn         = false,
  url          = false,
]<span>{</span>biblatex<span>}</span>

<span>\addbibresource</span><span>{</span>Publications.bib<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Notice that <code>biblatex</code> already provides some global options for
including/excluding some fields. For example, if I need a publication
list with additional details about where to find the publication,
I could set <code>doi = true</code> to include DOIs whenever available. Likewise,
if I want to save some space, I could set <code>giveninits = true</code> to ensure
that only the initials of first names are used, leading to ‘B. Rieck’ as
opposed to ‘Bastian Rieck’.</p>

<p>If I need more control and want to remove specific fields, I can use use
<code>\AtEveryCitekey</code> and <code>\AtEveryBibitem</code>.  For example, to remove the
month, the editor, and the location of every entry, we could use the
following construction:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bibtex"><span>\AtEveryBibitem{\clearfield{month}}</span>
<span>\AtEveryCitekey{\clearfield{month}}</span>
<span>\AtEveryBibitem{\clearname{editor}}</span>
<span>\AtEveryCitekey{\clearname{editor}}</span>
<span>\AtEveryBibitem{\clearlist{location}}</span>
<span>\AtEveryCitekey{\clearlist{location}}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The apparent duplication of commands is only required if we want to use
<code>\printbibliography</code> <em>and</em> <code>\fullcite</code>&nbsp;(see below for more details
on this). If you are content with only using <code>\fullcite</code>, it is
sufficient to use <code>\AtEveryCitekey</code>.</p>
<p>The neat thing is that this all works <em>without</em> changing your original
<code>Publications.bib</code> file, making it very easy to print a condensed
variant or an extended variant of your bibliography as the occasion
requires. The example also demonstrates that different
fields require different commands; see <a href="http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/biblatex/doc/biblatex.pdf">the BibLaTeX
documentation</a>
for more details.</p>

<p>As a personal preference, I like to change the way certain elements are
typeset. For example, I tend to prefer titles being typeset in
<em>italics</em>, whereas the journal name itself should just be typeset in an
upright font—briefly put, I want my publication list to follow the
manually-curated entries on my <a href="http://bastian.rieck.me/research/">research page</a>.
If your preference is different, feel free to adjust this to your
heart’s desire!</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bibtex"><span>\DeclareFieldFormat[article, incollection, inproceedings, misc, unpublished]{title}{\textit{#1}}</span>
<span>\DeclareFieldFormat[article]{journaltitle}{\upshape{#1}}</span>
<span>\DeclareFieldFormat[incollection, inproceedings]{booktitle}{\upshape{#1}}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>For even more control over how certain entries are printed, you can
update internal macros. To remove the date from an issue of a journal
article, you can update the <code>issue+date</code> macro, for instance:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bibtex"><span>\renewbibmacro*{issue+date}{%</span>
  <span>\setunit{\addcomma\space}</span>
    <span>\iffieldundef{issue}</span>
      <span>{\usebibmacro{date}}</span>
      <span>{\printfield{issue}%</span>
       <span>\setunit*{\addspace}%</span>
       <span>\usebibmacro{date}%</span>
      <span>}%</span>
  <span>\newunit%</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>See the file <code>standard.bbx</code> of your local BibLaTeX installation for an
overview of all the macros. Their number is legion—and I have to admit
that I am now quite content with their default settings in most cases, except
for the way the publisher and location are being printed. In lieu of the
default macro, which employs a colon for separating the publisher and
the location, I prefer commas, so I use the following construction:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bibtex"><span>\renewbibmacro*{publisher+location+date}{%</span>
  <span>\printlist{publisher}%</span>
  <span>\setunit*{\addcomma\space}%</span>
  <span>\printlist{location}%</span>
  <span>\setunit*{\addcomma\space}%</span>
  <span>\usebibmacro{date}%</span>
  <span>\newunit%</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This is probably less important to you if you do not use the <code>location</code>
field; and a quick check of my own bibliography shows that I mostly
dropped the field altogether because it does not provide any added value
for me.</p>

<p>To actually print out the entries in your document, you have multiple
options. The first option entails making use of <code>\printbibliography</code>,
thus losing out on <em>some</em> customisation options, whereas the second
option involves using <code>\fullcite</code>, which requires some manual
interventions but is overall more flexible.</p>
<h2 id="option-i-printbibliography">Option I: <code>\printbibliography</code></h2>
<p>Your main document is very simple in this case:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="latex"><span>\begin</span><span>{</span>document<span>}</span>
  <span>\nocite</span><span>{</span>*<span>}</span>
  <span>\printbibliography</span><span>[title=Peer-reviewed Articles]</span>
<span>\end</span><span>{</span>document<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Short, sweet, and still somewhat customisable! For example, if you
want to print out only articles of a certain type, you could add
a <code>keywords</code> entry to your bibliography, and use the following
construction:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="latex">  <span>\printbibliography</span><span>[title=Posters, keyword=poster]</span>
</code></pre></div><p>What I dislike about this solution is that I often have to pick the
articles I want to print quite carefully; many of them require
additional annotations. Moreover, I prefer to have a running number of
my publications in a publication list. For this reason, I prefer to use
<code>\fullcite</code>.</p>
<h2 id="option-ii-fullcite">Option II: <code>\fullcite</code></h2>
<p>Here, your document structure becomes a little bit more convoluted, but
you also gain additional control over how entries are formatted. The
primary advantages of this approach are that you can drop publications
easily&nbsp;(in case you are restricted to publications of a certain
area), you can change the ordering, and you can use <em>one</em> running
counter of publications, which some funding agencies like to see because
it more publications means more science means more relevance, or
something like that. Here’s how you accomplish such a list:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="latex"><span>\usepackage</span><span>{</span>enumitem<span>}</span>

<span>\begin</span><span>{</span>document<span>}</span>
  <span>\section*</span><span>{</span>Conference publications<span>}</span>

  <span>\begin</span><span>{</span>enumerate<span>}</span>
    <span>\item\fullcite</span><span>{</span>Moor20a<span>}</span>
  <span>\end</span><span>{</span>enumerate<span>}</span>

  <span>\section*</span><span>{</span>Journal publications<span>}</span>

  <span>\begin</span><span>{</span>enumerate<span>}</span>[resume]
    <span>\item\fullcite</span><span>{</span>Bock18<span>}</span>
  <span>\end</span><span>{</span>enumerate<span>}</span>
<span>\end</span><span>{</span>document<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The neat thing about this list is that you can use the margin of the
page to add additional annotations. For example, to highlight your
favourite publications<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, you can use the following construction:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="latex"><span>\usepackage</span><span>{</span>fontawesome<span>}</span>
<span>\usepackage</span><span>{</span>marginnote<span>}</span>

<span>% Controls the way these notes are being typeset with respect to the
</span><span>% margin of the page. Update this as necessary!
</span><span></span><span>\setlength</span><span>{</span><span>\marginparsep</span><span>}{</span>0.5cm<span>}</span>

<span>\newcommand</span><span>{</span><span>\favourite</span><span>}{</span><span>%
</span><span></span>  <span>\strut\marginnote</span><span>{</span><span>\faStar</span><span>}</span><span>%
</span><span></span><span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This gives you the opportunity to highlight a publication as follows:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="latex"><span>\begin</span><span>{</span>enumerate<span>}</span>
  <span>\item\favourite\fullcite</span><span>{</span>Moor20a<span>}</span>
<span>\end</span><span>{</span>enumerate<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The price that you pay for this flexibility is that you have to list
your publications manually, but at least you control their ordering and
only have to adjust all their details in one single file; you can use
the <em>same</em> list of publications with a different preamble to easily
change the way things are being depicted. I like to keep a ‘condensed’
version of the publication list handy for grants, while my CV contains
everything.</p>
<p><strong>Caveat lector</strong>: There might be some minor differences in how
<code>\fullcite</code> prints an entry as compared to <code>\printbibliography</code>. If you
want to add a period after each list entry, you need to change how
<code>\fullcite</code> works under the hood. For example, you could redefine
<code>\fullcite</code> as follows:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="latex"><span>\DeclareCiteCommand</span><span>{</span><span>\fullcite</span><span>}</span>
  <span>{</span><span>\usebibmacro</span><span>{</span>prenote<span>}}</span>
  <span>{</span><span>\usedriver</span><span>{}{</span><span>\thefield</span><span>{</span>entrytype<span>}}</span>.<span>}</span>
  <span>{</span><span>\multicitedelim</span><span>}</span>
  <span>{</span><span>\usebibmacro</span><span>{</span>postnote<span>}}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Alternatively, if it is important to you, you can also add the periods
manually.</p>

<p>As a finishing touch, I always aim to highlight equal contributions,
equal supervision, and myself in the publication list. The first two
things are primary done out of fairness—if a publication has multiple
authors who contributed to it, <em>any</em> publication list should reflect
this—while the last thing is done out of an instinct for
self-preservation: since the publication list is supposed to show my own
contributions to science, I figured it made sense to highlight my
own name. To accomplish this, I used the <code>+an</code> mechanism that permits us
to include annotations for BibLaTeX to use later on when typesetting
a citation.</p>
<p>This can be accomplished by updating the way author names are being
printed:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="latex"><span>\renewcommand*</span><span>{</span><span>\mkbibcompletename</span><span>}</span>[1]<span>{</span><span>%
</span><span></span>  <span>\ifitemannotation</span><span>{</span>highlight<span>}</span>
    <span>{</span><span>\textbf</span><span>{</span>#1<span>}}</span>
    <span>{</span>#1<span>}</span><span>%
</span><span></span>  <span>\ifitemannotation</span><span>{</span>first<span>}</span>
    <span>{</span><span>\kern</span>-0.05em<span>\textsuperscript</span><span>{</span><span>$</span><span>\dagger</span><span>$</span><span>}}</span>
    <span>{}</span><span>%
</span><span></span>  <span>\ifitemannotation</span><span>{</span>last<span>}</span>
    <span>{</span><span>\textsuperscript</span><span>{</span><span>$</span><span>\ddagger</span><span>$</span><span>}}</span>
    <span>{}</span><span>%
</span><span></span><span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>You can see that is use a <strong>bold</strong> font to print all names that contain
the <code>highlight</code> annotation. For the equal contributions, I use <code>first</code>
and <code>last</code> to indicate joint first authorship and joint supervision,
respectively. Feel free to change the symbols here—I like the
dagger<sup>†</sup> to indicate joint first authors<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, and the
diesis or double dagger<sup>‡</sup> to indicate …</p></div></div>

<p>Why simple rules of thumb often outperform complex models</p>

</div><div>
 
<div>
<p><small>[Photograph by Literary and Media Committe, TAPMI]</small></p>

<p>This is the age of big data. We are constantly in quest of more numbers and more complex algorithms to crunch them. We seem to believe that this will solve most of the world’s problems - in economy, society and even our personal lives. As a corollary, rules of thumb and gut instincts are getting a short shrift. We think they often violate the principles of logic and lead us into making bad decisions. We might have had to depend on heuristics and our gut feelings in agricultural and manufacturing era. But this is digital age. We can optimise everything.</p>

<p>Can we?</p>

<p>Gerd Gigerenzer, a sixty nine year German psychologist who has been studying how humans make decisions for most of his career, doesn't think so. In the real world, rules of thumb not only work well, they also perform better than complex models, he says. We shouldn’t turn our noses up on heuristics, we should embrace them.</p>

<p>That view is increasingly gaining global attention. Partly because of the failure of complex models in predicting major events, such as the financial crisis in 2008, and the election of Donald Trump last year. Partly because Gigerenzer is backing what he says with some cutting edge research. His team at The Center for Adaptive Behavior and Cognition (ABC) at Max Planck Institute for Human Development, Berlin studies the role of heuristics in decision making, in a way that can be coded into a computer programme, tested, and used in the real world. In finance, Bank of England is using their insights to design simpler rules to avert banking crisis. In healthcare, medical organisations are working with them to teach risk literacy to doctors and patients so they can evaluate evidence better. Artificial intelligence developers are looking up at their work to see if they can make machines think better.</p>

<h3>An adaptive toolbox&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Gigerenzer was in India recently to conduct a seminar, called the Winter School on Bounded Rationality at TA Pai Management Institute, Manipal, where his audience were a skeptical bunch of research scholars from some of the top institutions in India and abroad.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gigerenzer, a tall man sporting a white mustache and possessing the gait of a country gentleman, was in full flow - explaining, clarifying, defending his worldview using a mix of evidence from research, personal anecdotes and a deadpan display of academic confidence. When a finance professor with an obvious love for mathematical analysis said he didn’t agree with Gigerenzer’s views, he replied, “Well, I have three days to convince you”.</p>

<p>In short, Gigerenzer's arguments go like this. There is a big difference between risk and uncertainty. You are dealing with <em>risk</em> when you know all the alternatives, outcomes and their probabilities. You are dealing with <em>uncertainty</em> when you don’t know all the alternatives, outcomes or their probabilities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When you are dealing with risk, complex mathematical models and fine tuning them for optimisation work. However, when you are dealing with uncertainty, they don’t work well, because the world is dynamic.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What you then need is a set of simple rules of thumb that are robust and gut instincts sharpened by years of experience. You need <em>an adaptive toolbox</em>. To use the toolbox well, logical rationality - knowing rules such as transitivity and set theorem - won’t suffice. What’s needed is <em>ecological rationality</em>, that is knowing which heuristic works in which environment.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Innovating over a cup of coffee</h3>

<p>To study all of these, Gigerenzer has assembled a team of international and interdisciplinary team in ABC at&nbsp;Max Planck Institute. “I don’t believe in the borders of the regular disciplines”, Gigerenzer said. “They may be good for teaching but certainly not for innovation. My group has about 35 researchers and half of them, at any point, are from ten different disciplines - psychology, machine learning, computers, economics, engineering, philosophy, biology and so on. The point is to get all these minds together to solve one problem.”</p>

<p>That problem is: <em>How do humans and other animals make decisions under uncertainty, that is, when time and information are limited and the future is unknown? &nbsp;</em>They try to solve this problem by designing models of how people make decisions, and by&nbsp;conducting experiments, testing one model against another to see where rules of thumb (heuristics)&nbsp;perform better than others. &nbsp;</p>

<p>“Another important thing,” he continued, “is to make them feel like a family, because people from different disciplines typically avoid talking to one another. They claim no one would understand their language. At Max Planck I have put them all on one floor. We have tea and coffee everyday at 4 PM. No one is obligated to come, so they come. And they talk, they ask questions: “What does this concept mean?,” “Why don’t you do that instead of this”. And, so we make progress.”</p>

<p>“It is one of the most intellectually stimulating environments for research,” Özgür Simsek, a researcher in Gigerenzer’s team said. Simsek studied industrial engineering in Turkey, before moving to University of Massachusetts, Amherst to get a masters in operations research and a PhD in artificial intelligence and machine learning. After her doctorate, she was looking for something novel to work on, and found the research on bounded rationality at Max Planck to be interesting. “I thought the research on bounded rationality had perhaps something new to say about AI and machine learning, and perhaps we could bring some of these ideas into AI. At the same time, I thought my computational background, working in algorithms, analyzing algorithms, developing algorithms could be useful in understanding heuristics better,” Simsek said. It is eight years since she joined.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The path that Konstantinos Katsikopoulos took to land in Max Planck Institute was not too different. He studied in Athens, and then went on to get his PhD in operations research from MIT. He came to know about Gigerenzer’s work when he stumbled on a book title “Simple Heuristics that Make Us Smart.” The was intrigued by the words simple and smart.&nbsp;He already knew the limitations of complex optimising models. “When I studied mathematics, the most basic thing I learned is that any claims about optimality or optimising are conditional on the model. Your results are always the best according to a model of the world. And a model of the world is not reality. You can’t take the model per se as a benchmark of success in the world.” The idea of comparing complex optimisation models against simple heuristics appealed to him. He joined Max Planck as a postdoc fifteen years ago. Katsikopoulos recently shifted to the Business School of the University of Southampton, UK, and continues to be associated with Max Planck through Harding Center for Risk Literacy as an adjunct scientist. (Harding Center, a part of Max Planck&nbsp;trains physicians and patients to better understand medical evidence, and promotes risk literacy among school children. Gigerenzer is not a fan of the Nudge (using insights behavioural economics and psychology to change behaviour of people by subtle cues and changes in a setting). He believes teaching people how to assess risks is a more straightforward and effective way to get positive results).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another researcher, Shenghua Luan, was doing his PhD in psychology at University of Florida, after graduating from Peking University in China. At Florida, he attended a seminar in which Gigerenzer’s work was discussed. He started studying his papers and got hooked. After PhD, he spent some time at Max Planck as a postdoc, before moving to Singapore to teach at Singapore Management University. Soon, he was missing the exciting research at Max Planck so much, that he decided to go back. When he speaks about his work, his enthusiasm can spill over. “This is not some abstract stuff. This is what people do in real life,” he said.</p>

<h3>The skeptical statistician</h3>

<p>Gigerenzer’s own intellectual journey started when was wondering why he chose a career in academics over entertainment music years ago. &nbsp;“As a musician at that time, I was earning, may be, five or ten times more than what an assistant professor would earn. Now, I did not sit down and list all possible consequences of staying in music, all possible consequences of going to academia, weigh them and add them up, because that made no sense. I wouldn’t have been able to estimate all of them. I just took the decision. It was a qualitative decision. Thinking about it, got me interested in how people make decisions.”</p>

<p>Gigerenzer was contrasting his decision making process to a method that has been long popular among intellectuals of scientific temper. They believed one can arrive at an optimal decision by listing down all the likely advantages and disadvantages of various options. Charles Darwin tried that technique to decide on whether to marry or not. Benjamin Franklin strongly recommended this method - he called it Moral Algebra - to his nephew who was looking for his wife. “if you do not learn it, I apprehend you will never be married,” Franklin wrote to him. It has not vanished. We will find some version of this method being practiced by the bureaucracy in government and business even today. Gigerenzer saw that he didn’t use this method to make one of the most important decisions of his life. In fact, most of us don’t. Our decisions are mostly qualitative, not quantitative. &nbsp;</p>

<p>“When I started as a student i didn’t know very much about psychology,” Gigerenzer said. “Basically, I knew about Freud and a few other psychoanalysts. I quickly realised that I can explain almost everything with these concepts. I got disinterested. I didn’t want a theory that explains everything. Then I got interested in personality psychology. I remember there was a big book, 400-500 pages, on the subject and I knew it almost by heart. Some friends …</p></div></div></div>

<p>It used to be that when you dragged an item off the Dock and dropped it, the icon would disappear in a puff of smoke and make a satisfying noise. The animation was strangely primitive against the backdrop of the slick user interface of what used to called Mac OS X.</p>



<p>The animation first appeared in Developer Preview 4 and many thought it was a placeholder for something more polished. However, after awhile, many people seem to take a liking to it. Here’s a series of frames that shows it if you’re not familiar.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="128" height="640" src="https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/poof.png" alt="" srcset="https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/poof.png 128w, https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/poof-60x300.png 60w, https://techreflect.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/poof-54x270.png 54w" sizes="(max-width: 128px) 100vw, 128px"><figcaption>POOF!</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The legendary poof animation came out of a discussion of the Human Interface team that wanted this action to have an animation to go with the very liquid Aqua interface.</p>



<p>One of the most talented engineers on the team took out a piece of paper. I wish I could say it was a napkin to make the story better.</p>



<p>On the piece of paper, he drew a series of frames similar to what is pictured above. A quick, five frame animation. The intention of the designer was that these drawings would stoke further discussion. That it would get cleaned up and refined later.</p>



<p>But that never happened. It shipped as is. And the rest is history.</p>

<p>It’s interesting how learning is sometimes like travel. At the end of the journey, you end up back where you started, only with a broadened perspective.</p>
<p>Trivial example: code comments. When I was new to programming I commented my code extensively. If I’m honest, it was to compensate for my difficulties in reading code. A consequence of this is it allowed me to be lazy in the code I wrote. I wouldn’t need to put much effort into making it clear and readable because there were always plain English comments to fall back on.</p>
<p>Then I joined a team that was militantly against comments, where every comment was an admission of failure to write readable code. I took this on-board and disciplined myself not to rely on comments. This forced me to spend more time on refactoring my code to make it as readable and “self-documenting” as possible. I still wouldn’t say I’m there yet, but I’m confident that my code is much more readable now than it was then.</p>
<p>However, in the last year or so, I’ve started adding comments again. Not too many, but here and there to add more context. It felt like blasphemy at first. Some of my comments are even somewhat redundant, but I’ve since learned that <a href="https://www.cnothelfer.com/redundant-encoding">encoding the same information in redundant ways</a> is an important principle for aiding our comprehension. For example, traffic lights use both colour and position to encode the same information.</p>
<p>Superficially it seems as though I’ve returned to where I started: I’m commenting code again. However, if I hadn’t disciplined myself to do without comments entirely for a while, I wouldn’t have been forced to learn how to write more readable code. Abstaining from code comments is a <a href="https://coderefinery.nz/2020/10/21/forcing-functions-in-software-development/">forcing function</a> for learning to write more readable code. At some point, you can re-integrate commenting as a useful tool rather than a crutch.</p>
<p>Interestingly, I’m confident that if I could travel back in time and tell past-me or any of my old teammates that, actually, comments can be a valuable tool to aid comprehension, I’m positive I would encounter strong resistance. This is just as it should be; I don’t think it can be any different. When you’re learning a new skill, it’s necessary to become somewhat closed off and follow a direction single-mindedly for a while, it’s part of the learning process. If you were too suggestible and deviated too easily, you would go around in small circles and never get anywhere.</p>
<p>You see the same pattern across the development community when a new technology or framework is introduced (I won’t name names. I’m sure you can think of some examples). In the early days, there is hype and zealotry. Then over time as more developers adopt the tech into production and real issues with it emerge, there is disillusionment and abandonment. Finally a more realistic, calibrated picture of the trade-offs of the technology emerge.</p>

<p>A stunning admission by the US government that it possesses UFO debris was recently made in response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request filed over three years ago by this author. In a reply letter, the US Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) has ended decades of speculation by verifying that UFO material has indeed been recovered. Now officially referred to as UAP (Unidentified Aerial Phenomena) rather than UFOs, some of this material was placed with a defense contractor for analysis and storage in "specialized facilities." Incredibly, part of the information released discusses material with shape recovery properties, much like the "memory metal" debris found fallen at the Roswell UFO crash in 1947.</p>



<p>And based on the documentation received, it appears that the retrieved debris exhibits other extraordinary capabilities. In addition to "remembering" their original form when bent or crushed, some of these futuristic materials have the potential to make things invisible, "compress" electromagnetic energy, and even slow down the speed of light. Although much of the reports' details are redacted, what can be gleaned is that these technologies represent a literal quantum leap beyond the properties of all existing material known to man.</p>



<p>Finally, the whereabouts of the UFO debris held by the contractor is unknown. Some months ago they laid off their employees and ceased operations. Former company officials, when reached, refuse comment.</p>



<h6>THE FOIA REQUEST</h6>



<p>The original 2017 FOIA request made to the DIA asks for the physical descriptions, properties and composition of UFO/UAP material held by the government and its contractor. The request is unambiguous in its meaning. It refers to UFO/UAP material and "physical debris recovered by personnel of the Department of Defense as residue, flotsam, shot-off material or crashed UAPs or unidentified flying objects." The FOIA request can be seen in full <a href="https://7f215854-ce29-4a12-9bb0-f4e7eb88d38a.filesusr.com/ugd/aa4aac_c53f66ccc2f745908c6b639c1042977e.pdf" target="_blank"><span><span><span>here:</span></span></span></a></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>​</span></span></span></span></p></div><div id="comp-kkurd3px" data-testid="richTextElement"><p>In their reply, the DIA amazingly agrees that it has documents responsive to my request on recovered UFO debris and its analysis, the program under which it was administered, AATIP (the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program), and that their defense contractor (Bigelow Aerospace in Las Vegas, Nevada) has stored the material. They also provide some reports related to the possible applications of the studied material.</p>



<p>The delays and excuses offered up during the years awaiting the FOIA response were many. They include that the records search involved another agency that needed to be consulted; that I had been emailing my former FOIA Officer though she'd left months ago and never received my follow-up communication; to a re-assignment of my case to the DIA's FOIA Chief, Steve Tumiski. After a lawsuit was threatened with the retention of counsel, the DIA somehow, after so very long, acted to respond.</p>



<h6>THE RELATION TO ROSWELL</h6>

</div><p>The information received includes several pages of what are called "advanced technology reports" on Nitinol - a shape recovery alloy. Nitinol has similar properties to the "memory metal" found fallen as debris at the Roswell, New Mexico UFO crash of 1947. The pages found within the FOIA reply on Nitinol explore its potential for integrating it into the human body for the improvement of health. Well over 40 witnesses to Roswell have mentioned a metal-like material that could "remember itself" when deformed or folded, returning to its original state seamlessly and instantly. In a series of investigative articles appearing in the UFO Explorations website article archive section, the case is credibly made that Nitinol represents our first</p><div id="comp-kkuwalzl" title=""><div data-testid="linkElement"><wix-image id="img_comp-kkuwalzl" data-image-info="{&quot;containerId&quot;:&quot;comp-kkuwalzl&quot;,&quot;displayMode&quot;:&quot;fill&quot;,&quot;imageData&quot;:{&quot;width&quot;:719,&quot;height&quot;:406,&quot;uri&quot;:&quot;aa4aac_4110780180b542edadc482e561165b0f~mv2.png&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Roswell Disc, 719x406, enhanced with Pho&quot;,&quot;displayMode&quot;:&quot;fill&quot;}}" data-bg-effect-name="" data-is-svg="false" data-is-svg-mask="false" data-image-zoomed="" data-has-ssr-src="true"><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/aa4aac_4110780180b542edadc482e561165b0f~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_169,h_96,al_c,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2/Roswell%20Disc%2C%20719x406%2C%20enhanced%20with%20Pho.png" alt="Roswell Disc, 719x406, enhanced with Pho"></wix-image></div></div><div id="comp-kkuwz42y" data-testid="richTextElement"><p>attempts to replicate a material of the craft's construction. The Roswell debris was flown to Wright Field in Ohio after the crash. Some months later, Wright granted a contract to Battelle Memorial Institute to begin phase diagrams (recipes) for mixing Nickel and ultra-high-purity Titanium, required to make memory metal. General Arthur Exon, Base Commander at Wright Patterson in the 1960s, who flew over the crash site in 1947, spoke to researcher Kevin Randle on tape. He stated that it was his understanding that some of the wreckage being tested was comprised in part of "specially processed" Titanium.</p>



<p>And in September of 1947, two months after the Roswell crash, General George Shulgen of Air Intelligence described "the materials of construction" of the flying saucers as potentially being made of <span>"composite or sandwich construction utilizing various combinations of metal and plastics."&nbsp;</span> Some of the Roswell crash debris was said to display metal-plastic like appearance and characteristics. The DIA-sponsored reports I received mention a highly-engineered material called "metamaterial" (see below) as comprised of <span>"composite media."</span> Metamaterial can be <span>layered with metal and plastics.</span></p>



<p>Throughout the received FOIA documents, mention is made of potential use of some of the materials in "advanced aerospace platforms." Reference is made to desired material characteristics such as being extremely lightweight and tough, like the characteristics of the debris found at the Roswell crash.</p>



<h6>OTHER MATERIAL</h6>



<p>Extensive reference is also made to the study and application of what the tests called <span>metamaterial</span>*, including that some of this material:</p>



<ul>
	<li>
	<p><span>Can be used to "slow down light" and even "bring light to a complete standstill"</span></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>(Implying the ability to manipulate the speed of light (electromagnetic energy traveling at 186,000 miles per second)</p>



<ul>
	<li>
	<p><span>May induce invisibility by manipulating refraction, reflectivity and increasing light absorption. The reports use terms like "optical isolation" and "transparency" and make reference to a "MetaMirror" technology</span></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>(Implying the ability to make something unable to be seen, and/or picked up by radar, scanning or imaging)</p>



<ul>
	<li>
	<p><span>Has the interesting ability to "compress electromagnetic energy"</span></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>(Such condensing can make information and energy storage smaller and their transfer faster by reducing volume)</p>



<ul>
	<li>
	<p><span>Exhibits a particular "tunable resonance" which was likely "determined during fabrication."</span></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>(The phrase "tunable resonance" refers to a vibration of large amplitude from a small stimulus. Very recent research shows potential in the field of "energy harvesting" technologies, or pulling energy from the environment for low-power electronic devices)</p>

<p><span>​</span></p>

<p>There seem to be many exciting, but far in the future, technical applications to these materials that will change the way our lives are lived.</p>



<p><span>*Metamaterial</span>, a coined and relatively recent word, is believed to be any material engineered to have a property that is not found in naturally occurring materials. Some of these materials appear to be made from assemblies of multiple elements fashioned from composite materials such as metals and plastics. These composite media can be engineered to exhibit unique electromagnetic properties. Made up from subwavelength building blocks (most often based on metals), these metamaterials allow for extreme control over light energy and optical fields, enabling such effects such as negative refraction to be realized.</p>

<p><span>​</span></p>

<p>Portions of the reports center on next-generation <span>Amorphous Metals</span> (also called "liquid metal" or "metallic glass") which are novel engineering alloys with disordered atomic-scale structure. Metal is crystalline in its solid state, which means it has a highly ordered arrangement of atoms. Amorphous metals though are crazily disordered - a metal-like material so unique that it is believed it may one day replace plastic and metal in many applications. The material is stronger and lighter than any existing metal, can be injection molded like plastic (no rivets, seams or joining, smooth like many reported UFOs) and will never corrode or rust. Imagine using a single razor blade for the rest of your life because it stays super sharp forever. A golf club so springy it can drive a ball farther than any pro ever has. An artificial hip implant that performs better than a real hip. A cell phone case that is completely indestructible.</p>



<p>The contract that Bigelow was granted was under the auspices of an official government UFO study (whose existence was revealed by <span>The New York Times</span> in 2017). The contract was for Bigelow to construct "specialized modified facilities" to hold the material for testing. The DoD/Pentagon UFO study effort was called the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP). It ran for some years (and under more than one name), and according to informed sources, remains in operation to this day. What is inside these "specially modified facilities" that requires such contracted technical services? What is the nature of this anomalous debris and what are its properties that it requires shielding?</p>

Suddenly, from a corner of your consciousness, a voice speaks, "Oi dummy! Test the performance! What if this makes the app slower?!"</p><p>You frown. You squint at the screen thinking of what to do. Then you shrug saying, "Ah well! I'll do it at the end," and type away adding feature after feature without a worry. <strong>No! Stop!</strong></p><p>Performance matters. Speed matters. <strong><em>Do it now!</em></strong> Do you really want to use an app that lags and stutters every time you click a button. EVEN IF it has a thousand features? Remember how you'd get frustrated each time Microsoft Office took 10 seconds to load? What about Adobe Photoshop? Firefox?&nbsp;</p><p>And oh how you'd jump in excitement every time an app on your super epic computer just&nbsp;<strong><em>snapped open</em></strong> in a blink. Oh I see you shaking your head saying, "But...but...that feature!"</p><p>Let's try something. Open your terminal/console and copy a file from your home/user directory to a folder inside a folder in your Documents.</p><p>Now do the same from your File Manager.</p><p>See the difference? How much faster it is from a terminal. Just one command and viola!</p><p>"But...but...but that's different!" I hear you say.</p><blockquote><p>Performance is fundamentally about how long it takes you to perform an action, <em><strong>any</strong></em> action.</p></blockquote><p>Oh but it isn't! Performance isn't only about loading speed. It's not only about rendering and latency and all that stuff. No. Performance is fundamentally about how long it takes you to perform an action, <em><strong>any</strong></em> action. An app could be super snappy but still take 5 seconds to perform an action from thought to result.</p><p>You see that is how performance is defined.&nbsp;How long will it take a user to go from <em>thinking of doing an action</em> to <em>actually seeing the result</em>? What if that logout button was buried ten layers deep? How about if copying a file required you to open 3 sub-menus? Do you think that's performant?</p><p>Now before you go and benchmark each and every line of your code, listen.&nbsp;<strong>Listen!</strong> Breathe. Yes, speed matters but if you miss your deadline it is&nbsp;<strong><em>your</em></strong> performance that needs to be improved. So be clever.</p><blockquote><p>Because sometimes...<em>less is more.</em></p></blockquote><p>Ship <em>fewer</em> features. Write <em>less</em> code. Make <em>less</em> views. Do <em>less</em> navigation. Add <em>less</em> animations. Interrupt the user <em>less</em>. All those will improve both&nbsp;<strong><em>your</em></strong> and&nbsp;<em><strong>your product's</strong></em> performance. Ship&nbsp;<em>faster. </em>Build <em>faster.</em> That's what matters because sometimes...<em>less is more.</em></p><h2>It's Not Only About Code</h2><p>See that person on his phone scrolling through this blog post thinking how he'll make the fastest X? How long do you imagine it'll take him to build such a thing? A couple of hours? Months? Days? Years? Weeks? Do you think&nbsp;<em>he&nbsp;</em>is&nbsp;<em>performant?</em></p><p>You raise your hands in the air frustrated. "WHAT! This guy has gone crazy! Why does it matter how long it takes to build something <em>fast</em>?"</p><p>&nbsp;Let me tell you something. If it takes you a month to get that line of code to execute in under a micro-second; you lost millions of microseconds. Time is the currency in this world. If something is slow <em>don't ship it</em> instead of spending a month trying to make it faster because you are trading <em>your </em>performance for <em>your product's.&nbsp;</em>If you ship late you have&nbsp;<em>less&nbsp;</em>time to do&nbsp;<em>more.</em></p><blockquote><p>Don't ship slow features fast nor fast features slow.</p></blockquote><p>What if you shipped that fast code in time? What if you didn't spend a month making it fast? What if&nbsp;<em>you&nbsp;</em>did it&nbsp;<em>faster?</em>&nbsp; Then it was worth it. You did it.</p><h2>What About That Cool Feature?</h2><p>So you skipped a feature because it was too slow what do you do now? It is an absolutely fantastic feature, something so fancy that it will blow your users' mind. I say, "Can you make it fast without hampering the release line?" No? Roll it over to the next release. No line of code is more important than <em>your&nbsp;</em>and <em>your product's&nbsp;</em>performance.</p><h2>Closing Thoughts</h2><p><em>Every millisecond matters...but not more than that deadline.</em></p></div></article></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
<p>Recently, the Raspberry Pi Foundation launched their new <a href="https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/rp2040/rp2040-datasheet.pdf">RP2040 SoC</a> on a $4 development board called <a href="https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/pico/pico-datasheet.pdf">Pico</a>. As the foundation’s goal is primarily education, they’ve provided lots of high quality documentation, libraries, and examples for the new chip. Naturally, I’m going to ignore most of that and roll my own. Why? Because this is my idea of fun and I’m trapped inside during a pandemic.</p>
<p>If you’d like to build the examples and follow along, you’ll need <a href="https://www.adacore.com/download">GNAT Community 2020 ARM ELF</a> installed in your PATH. I’ve only tested this on x86_64 Debian, if you’re on another platform I can’t help you. You’ll also want an SWD debugger that works with the RP2040. I use openocd on a Raspberry Pi, I hear Segger J-Link support is coming soon. Technically you could use elf2uf2 and load binaries over USB, but that’s gonna get tedious for any nontrivial debugging.</p>
<p>The RP2040 has no internal flash. The boot ROM loads 256 bytes of code from an external SPI flash and executes it. This “second stage bootloader” is expected to configure the XIP (eXecute In Place) peripheral with clock and timing details specific to the flash chip in use, then jump to the start of the user code in the memory mapped to the flash.</p>
<p>I tried to rewrite the <code>boot2.S</code> bootloader from pico-sdk in Ada, but I couldn’t get it to fit inside 256 bytes. It might be possible, but not today. I ran gcc’s preprocessor on <code>boot2.S</code> to generate a single assembly file I could link. I copied the linker script and <code>crt0.S</code> from pico-sdk too.</p>
<p>The <code>zfp-cortex-m0p</code> Ada runtime does most of the boilerplate Cortex-M0+ setup and implements <code>Ada.Text_IO</code> with semihosting over the debug interface, so I wrote a hello world and copypasta’d a GPR project file to build it.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>with</span> <span>Ada</span><span>.</span><span>Text_IO</span><span>;</span> <span>use</span> <span>Ada</span><span>.</span><span>Text_IO</span><span>;</span>

<span>procedure</span> <span>Main</span> <span>is</span>
<span>begin</span>
   <span>Put_Line</span> <span>(</span><span>"Hello, RP2040!"</span><span>);</span>
<span>end</span> <span>Main</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>It took me a few hours to figure out the right incantation to get the linker to put the .boot2 section at the start of the flash chip along with crt0.S and the Ada runtime’s init code. The result is an ugly mess, which is why I’m omitting it here. If you want to see how to do things the quick and dirty way, <a href="https://github.com/JeremyGrosser/rp/tree/744e546999aba596701dcf89d4f5e39f056932e0">my initial attempt is on github</a>.</p>
<p>I soldered some headers for the Pico’s SWD port, wired it to a Raspberry Pi 4, and compiled the <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/openocd/tree/rp2040">raspberrypi branch of openocd</a>. As far as I can tell, nobody distributes a toolchain that can cross-compile Ada arm-eabi binaries on aarch64 and I don’t want to spend my time building binutils and gcc right now, so I setup an ssh tunnel from my x86_64 workstation to the Pi. I run arm-eabi-gdb locally and connect to openocd over the tunnel. Most of this will go in a .gdbinit script later.</p>
<p><img src="https://synack.me/img/raspberrypi-swd.png" alt="Raspberry Pi SWD wiring"></p>
<div><div><pre><code>ssh pi@192.168.1.202 -L3333:localhost:3333
openocd -f interface/raspberrypi-swd.cfg -f target/rp2040.cfg

arm-eabi-gdb obj/main
target extended-remote localhost:3333
monitor arm semihosting enable
load
run
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Let’s write some code! For this example, I’m not going to do anything particularly complicated or idiomatic to Ada in order to keep things as simple as possible. This is going to be a very imperative program assigning values to registers and not much more.</p>
<p>ARM’s tooling for silicon vendors generates an SVD file, which is a pile of XML that lists all of the peripheral addresses and register offsets with vaguely human readable names. The svd2ada program translates this into Ada spec files with record types and representation clauses. Unfortunately, it crashed with the RP2040 SVD file. svd2ada expects a <code>&lt;size&gt;</code> to be specified on every register but the RP2040 SVD defines <code>&lt;size&gt;</code> at the peripheral level. The SVD format says this should then be inherited by the registers in the peripheral, but svd2ada doesn’t do that. I couldn’t figure out how to fix svd2ada so I wrote a quick Python script to modify the SVD file by copying the <code>&lt;size&gt;</code> field to every register within a peripheral. Now svd2ada works and generates a <code>.ads</code> file for each peripheral on the RP2040.</p>
<p>Normally the next step in bringing up a new chip would be to get all of the clocks configured, which is usually pretty boring code to write. At startup, the RP2040’s system clock runs from an internal ring oscillator with a not at all predictable or stable frequency between 1.8 and 12 MHz, which is good enough for some blinking. I skipped clock configuration and went straight for the GPIO.</p>
<p>There are four peripherals that need to be configured to toggle a pin: RESETS, PADS_BANK, IO_BANK, and SIO. RESETS, as you might expect, controls the reset state of the other peripherals. I pull the IO_BANK and PADS_BANK out of reset and wait for any initialization these peripherals might need to do in a busy loop.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>RESETS_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>RESET</span><span>.</span><span>io_bank0</span> <span>:=</span> <span>False</span><span>;</span>
<span>RESETS_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>RESET</span><span>.</span><span>pads_bank0</span> <span>:=</span> <span>False</span><span>;</span>
<span>while</span> <span>not</span> <span>RESETS_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>RESET_DONE</span><span>.</span><span>io_bank0</span> <span>or</span> <span>else</span> <span>not</span> <span>RESETS_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>RESET_DONE</span><span>.</span><span>pads_bank0</span> <span>loop</span>
  <span>null</span><span>;</span>
<span>end</span> <span>loop</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>Next, PADS_BANK enables the output driver on GPIO25, which is connected to the LED on the Pico board.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>--  output disable off</span>
<span>PADS_BANK0_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO25</span><span>.</span><span>OD</span> <span>:=</span> <span>False</span><span>;</span>
<span>--  input enable off</span>
<span>PADS_BANK0_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO25</span><span>.</span><span>IE</span> <span>:=</span> <span>False</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>IO_BANK selects a peripheral to connect the pad to.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>--  function select</span>
<span>IO_BANK0_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO25_CTRL</span><span>.</span><span>FUNCSEL</span> <span>:=</span> <span>sio_25</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>The SIO (single-cycle IO) peripheral can toggle pins. I added a Pin_Mask constant in the declare block with bit 25 set. svd2ada generates nice subtype definitions for each register field so that I don’t need to know that GPIO_OUT is 30 bits wide. The immediate value here is just <code>Shift_Left (1, 25)</code>, but using Shift_Left here would require some type conversion that I want to avoid in this example.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>Pin_Mask</span> <span>:</span> <span>constant</span> <span>GPIO_OUT_GPIO_OUT_Field</span> <span>:=</span> <span>16#0200_0000#</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>Enable the output in the SIO peripheral</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>-- output enable</span>
<span>SIO_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO_OE_SET</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO_OE_SET</span> <span>:=</span> <span>Pin_Mask</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>Now we blink!</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>loop</span>
   <span>SIO_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO_OUT_SET</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO_OUT_SET</span> <span>:=</span> <span>Pin_Mask</span><span>;</span>
   <span>SIO_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO_OUT_CLR</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO_OUT_CLR</span> <span>:=</span> <span>Pin_Mask</span><span>;</span>
<span>end</span> <span>loop</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>Assuming those calls actually get compiled into single cycle writes, that’s gonna be blinking at half the system clock frequency, far faster than the human eye can see, but good enough for an oscilloscope. The SIO peripheral has an XOR register that allows us to make this code even shorter.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>loop</span>
   <span>SIO_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO_OUT_XOR</span><span>.</span><span>GPIO_OUT_XOR</span> <span>:=</span> <span>Pin_Mask</span><span>;</span>
<span>end</span> <span>loop</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>This is where the narrative diverges from reality. After I got to this point, I spent a few days refactoring the code into a package with well defined types and interfaces that conform to the Ada HAL package. For the sake of this example, I’m going to gloss over some of those organizational details and pretend things are still mostly happening in a single Main procedure.</p>
<p>Next I need a delay in that loop to blink at a rate that’s perceptible to humans. I could call a bunch of <code>nop</code> instructions and waste cycles, but that’s just silly. The RP2040 has a very nice 64-bit timer peripheral that I completely ignored because the chip also has the standard ARM SysTick peripheral that I’m already familiar with. Exported symbols need to be defined at the package level, so I’ve put this code into a SysTick package. I’ve only reproduced the implementation bits here, just know that this is happening in a new file.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="ada"><span>--  Reload every 1ms</span>
<span>PPB_Periph</span><span>.</span><span>SYST_RVR</span><span>.</span><span>RELOAD</span> <span>:=</span> <span>SYST_RVR_RELOAD_Field</span> <span>(</span><span>12_000_000</span> <span>/</span> <span>1_000</span><span>);</span>

<p>I need an interrupt handler to increment a counter for every tick. crt0.S exports a weak <code>isr_systick</code> symbol that I can implement.</p>

<p>I’ll also add a wrapper around the <code>wfi</code> (wait for interrupt) assembly instruction in the same package</p>

<p>Back in the blink loop, I call the wait for interrupt instruction and check the value of Ticks.</p>

<h2 id="intro"><strong>Intro</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Hello, and welcome to CoRecursive. I’m Adam Gordon Bell. I’m trying to find and share the personal experiences of building software. I’m not really a big gamer, but lately I fell down this rabbit hole into the world of Casey Muratori, and this project that he started on Twitch in 2014.</p>
<p><strong>Casey:</strong>
The videos are me just programming. They’re not even good. I mean, I’ll be honest. I’d love to say that they’re amazing, and that I’m really great. But they’re not. They’re not. All they are is a regular programmer who does actual real programming work. Right? It just ended up taking on a life of its own.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Casey’s game programming videos, they started a movement. It’s a movement that in some ways feels like software development from the ’70s. But in other ways, it’s totally modern and maybe points towards the future of learning or entertainment. I’m not sure where to start with Casey’s story, but the basics of his approach, they date to this job he had in the late ’90s.</p>
<p><strong>Casey:</strong>
In 1999, I took a job at RAD Game Tools. I was still a C++ programmer at the time, meaning I was still … If I was going to write a matrix multiplication, it would be like templatized on the size of the matrix. Right? Traditional C++ class hierarchy with inheritance kind of programming. Smart pointers, for example. One of the things that was cool about RAD Game Tools is it was me and there were two other programmers there. RAD Game Tools is legendary in that the amount of money they make per programmer is staggering.</p>

<p>They were making millions of dollars a year and they had three programmers or something, and not on weird web laundering of money where you basically you’re selling ads to be like … Literally selling software. This is libraries they’re selling. Right? The two programmers there at the time, beside me, when I joined Jeff Roberts, who has literally written the video codec for every game basically in existence almost in history. Every game. Name a game, the videos play back through something Jeff wrote, right? From basically the year ‘94 to today.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Wow.</p>
<p><strong>Casey:</strong>
Whatever the latest game is you pick up, it’s videos are playing back through something Jeff wrote. The other programmer was John Miles, who’s the guy who wrote the engine for Ultimate 5 way back in the day. He wrote the Miles Sound System which was the sound system used in most dos games. It was extremely popular, still exist to this day, in fact, and it’s used by people for sound. I want to say he also wrote the render on Wing Commander III. Anyway, those two programmers who were there and they are old school C programmers.</p>

<p>Here I am looking at this and I’m like, “Well, these are way better programmers than me, and they don’t use any of this stuff, and I wonder why.” Right? Why is it that you get some programmers who are literally some of the best programmers I’ve ever seen and they don’t use any of this stuff? Why is that? Right? Not only that, but if you take Jeff, for example, it might be argued he’s a programmer who as far as the video game world is concerned. I mean, it’s staggering to think of how many games have his code in it. Right?</p>

<p>Because they all [inaudible 00:03:32] It’s just like looking at how impactful they are and what amazing stuff they were able to do, and it’s like why am I using all this stuff? Do I know something they don’t? Because that seems unlikely. Right? There’s a little bit of programmery I always know what I’m doing nonsense, and it’s like do you? I mean, why are these other people who are so good not need that thing? Right. Being honest with you, you have to be a little bit introspective and go, “What’s going on here?”</p>
<h2 id="being-critical-of-your-own-skills"><strong>Being Critical Of Your Own Skills</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Did these guys talk to you and say why are you using templates or-</p>
<p><strong>Casey:</strong>
No. It was just … I mean, I am always as critical of my own habits as I am of anybody else’s, right? If I am aggravated with some piece of software that someone else’s … I’ve had some famous rants about Visual Studio, for example, and how bad it’s gotten. That dialogue, I mean, you might be tempted to think that that is just me complaining about someone else [inaudible 00:04:36] software. No. That dialogue is happening in my head about my programs all the time. I always think they’re terrible, right?</p>

<p>I’m always going what could I have done to make this less terrible? It only comes out of that. It was me just looking and going like, “There’s probably something to learn here.” Incontrovertible, these guys are better programmers than I am. That’s true. One reason for that could be that I just suck and I’m never going to get any better, so it doesn’t matter. So just keep using C++ and whatever. Right? Another possibility is that I could learn to be as good as they are, and I’m just not taking it seriously enough. I’m not trying. Right?</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Casey:</strong>
Yes I’m trying to program, but I’m not trying to get better. Right? What are things I can use to get better? Well, I can look at what they are doing and go, “What about what I am doing is different, and can I assess if any of those are the answer?” Because they might not be. It might be that they just happened to program in C and I happened to program at C++, and they happened to be good and I happen to suck. That’s a totally possible thing that could have happened there. But another thing could be that actually I could be good, I could be writing code as good as they are, but I need to learn what are the things that they know that I don’t?</p>

<p>What are the practices they have that I don’t have? Right? I always try to do that as much as I can. If I see something that looks like it’s working well, or that they’re getting something done well, I try to go, “How can I reassess what I’m doing to see whether there’s something of that that would make a difference for me?” Because I want to be better, I don’t want to be writing bad code. But it’s not always obvious how to improve.</p>
<h2 id="trying-just-plain-c-programming"><strong>Trying Just Plain C Programming</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Did you spend time watching them code?</p>
<p><strong>Casey:</strong>
Not in so many words. I never walked into someone’s office and was like, “Teach me how to program.” But I tried to say what are the things I could do that would assess my own practices in light of the fact that I have some good examples just sitting here? Because typically watching a programmer program at that time would have been creepy. I’d be sitting and we’d be like, “Kilroy was here.” I’m peeking up over the chair. A little Casey head pops up. What I did was I was in charge of the character animation system, and I wrote the first version, it sucked. I was going to write the second version as, let me try. Because I started programming C, not C++, and I had become a C++ programmer.</p>

<p>I was like, “Let me try just going back to see,” because honestly I know how to do it because I used to program [inaudible 00:07:22]. Let me try going back to C and what I’m going to do is I’m only ever going to use one of these features in C++ if I actually can demonstrate to myself that it would create a benefit here. What I found was that literally the only two things that were at all useful were operator overloading and function overloading. Those are the only two. Everything else, I was like, “Yep. The code was better without it.” Unlike most programmers, I actually had the experience of literally taking the time to see, do these features actually improve the code or don’t they?</p>

<p>I could actually test it because I was fortunate to have the time and control over a project to actually see what happened. From there, I was just like, “You know what? I need to do that for everything. I need to actually start taking this seriously and stop just assuming that because someone else puts something in a language that it must be good.” When you change your thinking to I’m going to evaluate rather than I’m going to trust, what you start finding is that most things most people say are mostly wrong, and the reason for that is they have to be because a lot of them are overlapping.</p>

<p>Most of the time you see two different people suggesting two different ways to do something, obviously someone’s wrong or there isn’t a better way to do it, meaning it doesn’t matter which one you pick. Either somebody was wrong and one of them was the correct way, in which case there was one that you should have rejected, or it doesn’t matter which way you do this, in which case they were all wrong for suggesting that you needed to do it this way. I think ever since that point in my career, it’s been about 20 years since then, I’ve just always evaluated things as carefully as I could.</p>

<p>When I see a new thing suggested, I go, “What does this actually yield?” If I look at the difference between doing it this way and doing it in whatever way I would have done it before, and I go, “Does that result in less lines of code, less bugs, less time?” Blah, blah, blah. I go, “Can I make an argument along any of these lines?” What you’ll find out if you do this, honestly, is a lot of the stuff is just a waste of your time.</p>
<h2 id="the-do-it-yourself-development-aesthetic"><strong>The Do It Yourself Development Aesthetic</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Casey, didn’t just leave C++ behind, he also nurtured this sort of obscenely DIY development aesthetic that’s pretty uniquely his. He doesn’t use an IDE. Just Emacs <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. He doesn’t use make or a build script. He doesn’t use any libraries. He thinks other people should try this approach.</p>
<p><strong>Casey:</strong>
I think everyone should have the experience of building something from the ground up. Most programmers, no matter what they work on, would benefit greatly from having written one thing from scratch, meaning start in a fairly bare language, such as C, don’t use the libraries, just write everything yourself from just basic things. Even better if you want to try assembly language, but assembly language has a bunch of things that you have to do, like register …</p></div></div>

            <p> This screener assesses stocks by the following two factors:
                </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Highest short interest</li>
            <li>Mentions on Reddit</li>
        </ul><p>
        An indicator of whether they may be the next "meme stock". Short interest represents the total number of shorted shares divided by the number of shares outstanding. It is a helpful indicator that gives people an idea of what the overall market feels about a particular stock by showing what short-sellers are doing.
Historically, hedge funds would often announce their short position on a stock.
Investors can take advantage of understanding short interest by being able to predict the next “short squeeze”; in other words, a situation in which the stock jumps sharply higher, forcing short sellers who had bet that its price would fall, to buy it in order to prevent even bigger losses.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Members of Congress said troops at the Capitol have been hospitalized, because their food is below substandard quality.</p><div>
                            <p>WASHINGTON — In their final days protecting the U.S. Capitol from a potential reprise of domestic terrorism, members of the Michigan National Guard reported metal shavings, feathers, and undercooked meat found in substandard meals, a potential readiness risk that has hospitalized troops.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Michigan members of the House of Representatives wrote a letter Tuesday to Gen. Daniel Hokanson, chief of the National Guard, expressing their displeasure with the findings.&nbsp;</p>
                        
                    <p>"It is completely unacceptable that our men and women serving in Washington D.C are being hospitalized due to the food they are being provided," the letter said. "We request that either the current contract be voided and a new food provider be brought in or that the service members be provided with a per diem throughout their remaining time in Washington, D.C.”</p>
                    <p>According to a closed-door National Guard update given to members of Congress, 59 people had wide-ranging gastrointestinal issues because of food consumed at the Capitol. Some of the troops managed their conditions in their quarters, others required a hospital diagnosis.</p>
                    
                                <div>

                                </div>
                    <p>As reports of undercooked and underprepared food increased Monday, Sen. Gary Peters and Rep. Daniel Kildee, Democrats of Michigan, called for the firing and replacement of the meal contractor, sending appeals directly to the National Guard Bureau at the Pentagon.</p>
                    <p>“It is simply unacceptable that these men and women are being fed chicken with the feathers still attached, and raw ground beef,” Peters wrote to Hokanson. “After several attempts to rectify the situation and little progress, I believe that the only appropriate course of action is for the immediate cancellation of the existing food contract, the disbursement of per diem for the remaining duration of the mission and to provide retroactive per diem.”</p>
                    <p>Roughly 1 in 5 of the National Guard troops within the Capitol perimeter are from Michigan. Their mandate expires March 12, when Defense Sec. Lloyd J. Austin III said all troops are expected to leave the Capitol grounds.</p>

<p><span>When discussing symmetric encryption algorithms - like the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) - you may have been considering using AES-128 or AES-256. The last three digits represent the length of the secret key – think of it like the number of teeth in a physical key. From a security perspective, a 256-bit secret key is obviously better, but does it really matter which of the two options you choose? This article walks through some of the main security considerations for AES-128 and AES-256.</span></p>
<h2><span>Brute Force Attack Protection</span></h2>
<p><span>A brute force key guessing attack is where an attacker tries each potential secret key until the right one is found. This attack is guaranteed to succeed (eventually) and (ideally) should be the fastest way to break an encryption algorithm.</span></p>
<p><span>When discussing brute force attack protection, understanding just what different key lengths mean is essential. With the impending arrival of quantum computing, it is also good to know how they will impact cryptographic security. Are the current forms of AES strong enough?</span></p>
<h2><span>The Difference in Key Length</span></h2>
<p><span>The main difference between 128 and 256-bit encryption algorithms is the length of the secret key that they use. The 128 and 256 in AES-128 and AES-256 means that the two algorithms use 128-bit and 256-bit keys respectively.</span></p>
<p><span>The longer the secret key, the harder it is for an attacker to guess via brute force attack. However, AES-256 is not just twice as strong as AES-128.</span></p>
<p><span>With 128 and 256-bit secret keys, AES-128 and AES-256 have 2<sup>128</sup> and 2<sup>256</sup> potential secret keys respectively. With binary keys, each bit added to the key length doubles the key space. This means that AES-256 has 2^128 or 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 times as many keys as AES-128.</span></p>
<p><span>As a result, a brute force attack against an AES-256 key is much harder than against an AES-128 key. However, even a 128-bit key is secure against attack by modern technology. At its peak, the Bitcoin network - arguably the largest modern use of computational power for cryptography - <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/en/charts/hash-rate?scale=1&amp;timespan=all">performed approximately</a></span> 150*10^18≈2^67 operations per second. Assuming that these operations are of equal difficulty to a brute force attack, it would take the Bitcoin network over 70,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 years to crack a single AES-128 key.</p>
<h2><span>Resistance to Quantum Computing</span></h2>
<p><span>The threat of quantum computing to cryptography has been well-publicized. Quantum computers work very differently than classical ones, and quantum algorithms can make attacks against cryptography much more efficient.</span></p>
<p><span>In the case of asymmetric encryption algorithms (like RSA), quantum computing completely breaks them. However, for symmetric algorithms like AES, Grover’s algorithm - the best known algorithm for attacking these encryption algorithms - only weakens them. Grover’s algorithm decreases the effective key length of a symmetric encryption algorithm by half, so AES-128 has an effective key space of 2^64 and AES-256 has an effective key space of 2^128.</span></p>
<p><span>However, while this seems significant, it doesn’t break either algorithm. With the right quantum computer, <a href="https://www.nap.edu/read/25196/chapter/6#98"><span>AES-128 would take about 2.61*10^12 years to crack</span></a>, while AES-256 would take 2.29*10^32 years. For reference, the universe is currently <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/07/15/age-universe-13-8-billion-years-scientists-confirm/3287409001/"><span>about 1.38x10^10 years old</span></a>, so cracking AES-128 with a quantum computer would take about 200 times longer than the universe has existed.</span></p>
<p><span>This also makes the assumption that an attacker has the “right” quantum computer. Cracking AES-128 would take an estimated 2,953 logical qubits and AES-256 would require 6,681. In 2020, the <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/09/ibm-promises-1000-qubit-quantum-computer-milestone-2023"><span>largest quantum computer had 65 qubits</span></a> with a goal of hitting 1,000 by 2023.</span></p>
<h2><span>128 and 256-Bit Algorithms Under the Hood</span></h2>
<p><span>Brute force attacks against a secret key are the best potential attack against a secure algorithm but what if the algorithm is has a vulnerability?</span></p>
<p><span>AES is broken up into two distinct algorithms: the encryption algorithm (which does the actual encryption) and the key schedule (which converts the secret key into round keys). The security of each of these matters to the security of AES.</span></p>
<h2><span>The Encryption Algorithm</span></h2>
<p><span>AES-128 and AES-256 use an almost identical encryption algorithm. Each encryption algorithm takes a set of operations and applies them a certain number of times or “rounds”. The only difference between AES encryption algorithms is the number of rounds: AES-128 uses 10 and AES-256 uses 14.</span></p>
<p><span>This means that, if an attack against the AES algorithm was discovered, it would likely affect both AES-128 and AES-256. The only difference is if the attack only worked up to a certain number of rounds of AES (which some AES attacks do). If an attack worked for at least ten rounds but less than fourteen, then a clear winner exists between AES-128 and AES-256. However, no such attack is currently known for AES.</span></p>
<h2><span>The Key Schedule</span></h2>
<p><span>The key schedule is where AES-128 and AES-256 become very different. The AES-128 key schedule is designed to turn a 128-bit secret key into ten 128-bit round keys. The AES-256 key schedule transforms a 256-bit secret key into fourteen 128-bit rounds keys.</span></p>
<p><span>Of the two, the AES-128 key schedule is actually more secure. The AES-256 key schedule has known weaknesses that might make it possible to perform related key attacks against the algorithm.</span></p>
<p><span>A related key attack should never happen in real life. For it to occur, an attacker needs to: </span></p>
<ol>
<li><span> </span><span>Convince the key owner to take their existing encryption key</span></li>
<li><span> Create three other keys based on this key using relationships known to the attacker</span></li>
<li><span> Encrypt <span>2<sup>99.5</sup> </span>&nbsp;(that’s eight followed by 29 zeros) blocks of data with these keys</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>Even if this attack were feasible, it can be avoided simply by using good key generation practices. A truly random key should never be vulnerable to a related key attack because it has no related keys.</span></p>
<p><span>Despite the fact that this attack is infeasible to perform, <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2009/07/another_new_aes.html">some cryptographers advise</a> – when given a choice between AES-128 and AES-256 with no constraints – using AES-128 over AES-256. If you have a simpler algorithm with a stronger key schedule, why use the more complex one?</span></p>
<h2><span>Picking Between AES-128 and AES-256</span></h2>
<p><span>128-bit and 256-bit AES both have their pros and cons. AES-128 is faster and more efficient and less likely to have a full attack developed against it (due to a stronger key schedule). AES-256 is more resistant to brute force attacks and is only weak against related key attacks (which should never happen anyway).</span></p>
<p><span>Since both algorithms are secure against modern and anticipated future threats, the choice between them doesn’t really matter from a security perspective. Our best guidance is that </span>AES-128 provides more than adequate security while being faster and more resource-efficient but readers who want that extra security provided by greater key sizes and more rounds in the algorithm should choose AES-256.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

<p>Schnorr just released a new paper <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/232">Fast Factoring Integers by SVP Algorithms</a> with the words "This destroyes the RSA cryptosystem." (spelling included) in the abstract.</p>
<p><img alt="schnorr destroys RSA" src="https://www.cryptologie.net/upload/schnorr.jpg"></p>
<p>What does this really mean? The paper is honestly quite dense to read and there's no conclusion in there.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Several people have pointed out that the "This destroyes the RSA cryptosystem" is not present in the paper itself, that is until the paper was updated to include the sentence without the typo.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: There was some discussion about a potential fake, but several people in the industry are confirming that this is from Schnorr himself:</p>
<p><img alt="schnorr destroyes RSA" src="https://www.cryptologie.net/upload/Screen_Shot_2021-03-03_at_3.07_.21_PM_.png"></p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Sweis is <a href="https://sweis.medium.com/did-schnorr-destroy-rsa-show-me-the-factors-dcb1bb980ab0">calling for a proof of concept</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to the claims in Schnorr’s paper, it should be practical to set significant new factoring records. There is a convenient 862-bit RSA challenge that has not been factored yet. Posting its factors, as done for the CADO-NFS team’s records, would lend credence to Schnorr’s paper and encourage more review of the methodology.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: <a href="https://twitter.com/ducasleo/status/1367367057055109125?s=11">Léo Ducas</a> has been trying to implement the claim, <a href="https://github.com/lducas/SchnorrGate">without success</a>.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Geoffroy Couteau thinks the claim is wrong:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>several top experts on SVP and CVP algorithms have looked at the paper and concluded that it is incorrect (I cannot provide names, since it was in the context of anonymous reviews).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Daniel Shiu <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/88582/does-schnorrs-2021-factoring-method-show-that-the-rsa-cryptosystem-is-not-secur/88601#88601">pointed out an error in the paper</a></p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Pedro Fortuny Ayuso is <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26332034">very skeptical of the claim</a>. Will he end up eating his shirt?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Schnorr is 78 years old. I am not gerontophobic (being 50 I am approaching that age) but: Atiyah claimed the Riemann Hypothesis, Hironaka has claimed full resolution of singularities in any characteristic... And I am speaking of Fields medalists.
So: you do really need peer-review for strong arguments.</p>

Its usage is split into two roles: one system is set up as the <strong>master</strong> and is responsible for controlling those systems that connect to it. One or more systems are then set up as <strong>minions</strong> that connect to the master and respond to any commands it issues.</p><p>Both master and minions are typically run as root on the systems they are installed on.</p><h2 id="discovery">Discovery</h2><p>Whilst looking at the source code for SaltStack for one of the previously disclosed vulnerabilities at <a href="https://www.immersivelabs.com/">work</a>, I decided to run the source code through <a href="https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit">Bandit</a>, a security scanner for Python applications to see how many issues it would find.</p><p>I was expecting to see quite a few results, as it has a relatively large codebase and has existed for several years. However, as can be seen in the screenshot below Bandit showed even more issues than I was expecting including 117 high severity issues.</p><figure><img src="https://sec.stealthcopter.com/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot_20201226_214009.png" alt=""><figcaption>Bandit's report for SaltStack Salt</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, many of these issues are false positives or of little importance to us, and it can take significant time to parse through all the data. For a quick win, I decided to focus my time researching some potential command injections due to several instances of <code>subprocess.Popen</code> used in conjunction with <code>shell=True</code> in the codebase.</p><p>After looking at a few of these that turned out not to be in any way controllable I found one that could be controlled via some clever trickery using process names.</p><figure><img src="https://sec.stealthcopter.com/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot_20201226_213907.png" alt="" srcset="https://sec.stealthcopter.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Screenshot_20201226_213907.png 600w, https://sec.stealthcopter.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Screenshot_20201226_213907.png 1000w, https://sec.stealthcopter.com/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot_20201226_213907.png 1089w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>This is the vulnerability we're looking for</figcaption></figure><h2 id="vulnerability">Vulnerability</h2><p>The minion's <code>restartcheck</code> is vulnerable to command injection via a crafted process name when this process has open file descriptors associated with <code> (deleted)</code> at the end of a filename (note the leading space is required). This allows for a local privilege escalation to root from any user able to create files on the minion in a directory that is not explicitly forbidden.</p><h3 id="vulnerable-code">Vulnerable Code</h3><p>The vulnerable code is at <a href="https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/6211b30a2d93366dcaaa4d66fdf2479eae1524bd/salt/modules/restartcheck.py#L615">line 615 in restartcheck.py</a> where <code>subprocess.Popen</code> is called with <code>shell=True</code> and a command that can be maniplulated by an attacker:</p><pre><code>cmd = cmd_pkg_query + package
paths = subprocess.Popen(cmd, shell=True, stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
</code></pre><p>Where <code>package</code> is formed from the process name and <code>cmd_pkg_query</code> is one of the following depending on the OS:</p><ul><li>Debian: <code>dpkg-query --listfiles</code></li><li>RedHat: <code>repoquery -l</code></li><li>NILinuxRT: <code>opkg files</code></li></ul><p>If we can insert a bash control character such as <code>;</code> <code>|</code> <code>&amp;&amp;</code> etc into the process name we can trigger the injection when this code is reached.</p><p>However, to reach this code, a process first needs to have a filehandler open to a file with a filename that ends in <code> (deleted)</code>, and this file needs to reside in a directory that is not explicitly forbidden.</p><p>The list of forbidden directories can be seen <a href="https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/6211b30a2d93366dcaaa4d66fdf2479eae1524bd/salt/modules/restartcheck.py#L33">here</a>. This deny list immediately rules out some of the more obvious places we might try to use such as <code>/tmp</code> or <code>/dev/shm</code>, however, there are a few common ones that a low privileged user may have access to such as:</p><ul><li><code>/var/crash</code></li><li><code>/var/spool/samba</code></li><li><code>/var/www</code></li></ul><h3 id="process-names">Process names</h3><p>During this research, it turned out that process names can be a surprisingly tricky thing to modify reliably, and a process name listed by <code>ps</code> may not be the same returned by the Python psutil library.</p><p>In Linux, process names can contain any characters (apart from null). Any user can start processes on a system and the process itself can set the process name. They are a good target for command injection vulnerabilities as developers are unlikely to expect process names to contain special characters or injections.</p><p>It is possible to use <code>exec -a </code> to directly set a process name; however, this doesn't work in <code>busybox</code> or <code>sh</code> shells and doesn't appear to show the same name when using <code>psutil</code>. It's also possible to modify the process name by directly manipulating procfs however this also leads to inconsistent results.</p><p>So in the end, the simplest and most consistent way to set a process name is to rename the binary or script being run. As filenames in Linux cannot contain <code>/</code> this restricts the commands we can inject, however using base64 encoding it is trivial to bypass this restriction as shown below:</p><pre><code># If we wanted to copy the shadow file to /tmp we could run this 
cp /etc/shadow /tmp/shadow

# Convert it to a base64 string
echo cp /etc/shadow /tmp/shadow | base64 -w0

# The result of the conversion
Y3AgL2V0Yy9zaGFkb3cgL3RtcC9zaGFkb3cK

# The new command we need to run
echo Y3AgL2V0Yy9zaGFkb3cgL3RtcC9zaGFkb3cK|base64 -d|sh -i

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
                    
<p><em>Editor’s Note: In December 2016, then-President Barack Obama signed an executive order that announced sanctions on Russian individuals and organizations in response to election interference efforts.</em></p>



<p><em>The list included several notorious hackers, as well as Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) and Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU). Also on the list was a lesser-known organization that left many puzzled: ZOR Security. The company was founded by Alisa Shevchenko, who worked as a virus analytics expert for Kaspersky Labs for several years and was passionate about building a co-working space for hackers and computer geeks. She had also been </em><a href="https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/advisories/ICSA-15-085-01A"><em>credited</em></a><em> by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security for assisting Schneider Electric in finding vulnerabilities in their software.</em></p>



<p><em>According to the announcement, Shevchenko’s company was a supplier to the GRU, the group said to be behind the hack on the Democratic National Committee and other political organizations. Shevchenko, who also goes by Alisa Esage, said U.S. authorities were mistaken, and that she had already closed her company. She currently works as an independent researcher, and is the founder of the </em><a href="https://zerodayengineering.com/"><em>Zero-Day Engineering project</em></a><em>, which shares technical knowledge and training on software vulnerability research.</em></p>



<p><em>Shevchenko talked to Recorded Future cyber threat intelligence expert Dmitry Smilyanets last week about her experience in 2016, her favorite vulnerabilities, and what it’s like to be a hacker in Russia. The conversation below, conducted in English, has been lightly edited for clarity:</em></p>



<p><strong>Dmitry Smilyanets: What was your reaction when you found out the U.S. government imposed sanctions on your company, ZOR Security?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Alisa Esage:</strong> I tried to keep calm and prevent the major press from portraying me as a kind of dangerous evil bitch that masterminded the hack of the century. Meanwhile, I kept working on my projects.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www-therecord.recfut.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/eage-1024x804.png" alt="Alysa Esage" width="451" height="353" srcset="https://therecord.media/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/eage-1024x804.png 1024w, https://therecord.media/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/eage-300x236.png 300w, https://therecord.media/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/eage-768x603.png 768w, https://therecord.media/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/eage-1536x1206.png 1536w, https://therecord.media/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/eage.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 451px) 100vw, 451px"><figcaption><em>Courtesy of Alisa Esage.</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p><strong>DS: How did it change your life?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AE:</strong> I guess it made me a specialist in thriving under U.S. sanctions.</p>



<p><strong>DS: You said authorities were mistaken—in what way?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AE:</strong> I don’t care about this anymore. People have the right to make mistakes. And the U.S. government likes to sanction everyone to assert power where they don’t have it, so let them.</p>



<p><strong>DS: Do you still feel the pressure of sanctions?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AE:</strong> I definitely feel that something is happening, but I wouldn’t call it pressure. If somebody can’t work with me or benefit from my products because they fear the U.S. government, it’s their own problem.</p>



<p><strong>DS: How did you get into cybersecurity and hacking?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AE:</strong> It all started with my father, Andrey. He was a talented electronics engineer, one of the first in Russia who started to assemble personal computers as a hobby when they were not generally available, based on spare parts and articles published in foreign technical magazines. He taught me to solder when I was 5 years old, I think. So I started reading books about computers and programming in early school and taught myself to code in C++ and x86 assembly language as soon as I got a PC at age 15. While still in school I learned reverse-engineering, solved ‘crackme’ challenges, hacked PC games and coded ‘keygens’ for fun, and participated in the Russian and international underground hacking scene, mostly on the side of low-level software cracking. That was the beginning of it.</p>



<p><strong>DS: Do you think it’s getting easier or more difficult for people to follow in your path?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AE:</strong> It’s a bit of both. When I was getting started, there was very little information available on computer security specifically. The internet was slow, and only a handful of publications might help you, aside from some generic books on computer programming. I recall there was a website named… something about ethical hacking, presumably ran by a woman; the articles published on it inspired me and helped me to get started. Nowadays it’s totally different. The information is abundant. There are thousands of public sources on all topics in computer security, from tutorials for beginners to professional deep technical trainings on advanced topics (like the ones that I teach, offered by my company Zero Day Engineering). This is the easy side.</p>



<p>On the other hand, computer technologies are getting more and more complex, technological developments are accelerating, learning curves are steeper and as a result, it’s getting harder to achieve high levels of expertise in this. It takes more time—years and decades. Remember the old assumption, “hacker equals teenager,” and that a hacking career ought to wrap up before one’s 30th birthday? So untrue today. The majority of the best hackers I know are well into their 30s, and they are just getting started. This is what it takes to gain true mastery in advanced hacking of modern computer systems: a lifetime dedication.</p>



<blockquote><p>For women [hackers] specifically: don’t listen to anyone, and keep doing what you love.”</p><cite>— Alisa Esage</cite></blockquote>



<p>Either way, I think that reaching truly advanced levels on this path is more of a destiny than a choice. It takes a very peculiar mindset that seems to be based on genetic data, among other factors, plus special circumstances in life to keep doing the impossible every day. There are plenty of easier ways to thrive and succeed in modern human society than pitching your brain against yet another hardened system. You know that you’re in it when you can’t live without it. And when it happens—congratulations, there is no turning back.</p>



<p><strong>DS: How would you advise other young women to get into a career like yours? What are the pros and cons of being a hacker?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AE:</strong> Find something that excites you, pick a specific task, and solve it until completion. Reflect and repeat. Solving technical tasks and completing them is essential to progress on this path, while passive consumption of information would mostly litter your brain and disrupt your technical creativity. Dedicate yourself to practice, read mostly primary sources (such as technical specifications, classical books, and high-quality blogs from researchers whose work you admire). It’s the same advice for both women and men.</p>



<p>For women specifically: don’t listen to anyone, and keep doing what you love. Especially if you already know that deep technical work is your passion, then don’t let anyone side-track you into management, lecturing, report-writing, marketing, or whatever else supportive roles in the cyber industry. Men and women definitely face different challenges in this career path, though it does get better over time (though a lot much slower and to a lesser extent than it’s commonly suggested).</p>



<p>Pros and cons? It’s risky and fun, obviously.</p>



<p><strong>DS: What do you like most about your line of work? What about your least favorite parts?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AE:</strong> I like the uncertainty, the adversarial environment, hunting for bug bounties, and solving hard challenges. I like that my work is valued extremely high, so that I can earn a high-end annual salary in three days with my brain alone, while sitting on the beach in pajamas. I dislike that I have to compete with many smart guys, who comprise a dominant majority in this space. Men and women were not made to compete with each other.</p>



<p><strong>DS: What is the coolest vulnerability you ever found?</strong></p>



<p><strong>AE:</strong> A DLL Hijacking remote code execution bug in Outlook Express in Windows XP. It was a long time ago when Windows XP was still in use on every personal computer, and not just on ATMs and POS terminals like nowadays. In my early career in vuln research, I developed a proprietary methodology to discover zero-day bugs of this class and found many issues including the one in OE. For many years after I found it, I used to check if it’s still unpatched and it was. Nowadays it’s probably a “forever-0day”, since XP is EoL. Long-lived and reliable exploits like that are always fascinating.</p>



<p>Nowadays DLL Hijacking issues (also known as Insecure Library Loading) are still very prominent. For instance, a bug of this type was recently patched in Zoom Client for Windows. It’s trivial to find and trivial to exploit. The fact that world-dominating software developers still allow such trivial programming mistakes indicates a severe lack of vulnerability awareness in the global software industry. It’s one of the reasons why my company is developing specialized vulnerability intelligence feeds that (aside from our trainings) should help to bridge this knowledge gap and make the Internet more secure for everyone.</p>



<p><strong>DS: In your opinion, what’s the easiest way to compromise an organization in 2021?</strong></p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www-therecord.recfut.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/YoK64_9z_400x400.jpg" alt="" width="364" height="364" srcset="https://therecord.media/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/YoK64_9z_400x400.jpg 400w, https://therecord.media/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/YoK64_9z_400x400-300x300.jpg 300w, https://therecord.media/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/YoK64_9z_400x400-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 364px) 100vw, 364px"><figcaption><em>Courtesy of Alisa Esage.</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<p><strong>AE:</strong> There is no such way, generally. Organizations are not uniform in their levels of security. What’s truly important to realize is that there exists a spectrum of offensive cyber technologies that may be leveraged to compromise an organization, from trivial to advanced. Attackers would typically go for the weakest link in the system, that can be broken with the easiest tech in the spectrum. As opposed to it, my professional choice is to specialize in the most advanced extreme of it—zero-day vulnerabilities and exploits, especially in hardened systems—because once you can solve a hard problem, everything else in the spectrum is a piece of cake. Also, because it’s kind of unstoppable. You can train your employees to avoid clicking on phishing that brings ransomware, you can establish a proper corporate policy to block insiders that deliver supply chain implants and leak your business secrets, but you can’t avoid technology altogether. And technological systems have bugs, that may be leveraged for arbitrary code execution. And game over.</p>



<blockquote><p>I like that my work is valued extremely high, so that I can earn a high-end annual salary in three days with my brain alone, while sitting on the beach in pajamas.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Another key point to realize is that, regardless of a security compromise scenario, the root cause of it is always a …</p></article></div>

<p>Have you heard of <strong>Shiny Object Syndrome</strong>?</p>



<p>It’s the condition of being distracted by “shiny” new things.</p>



<p>Fad diets, the latest gadgets, <a href="https://ozchen.medium.com/new-years-resolution-syndrome-db9f52e72a07" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">endless New Year’s resolutions</a> and yes…<strong>new stocks</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Shiny Stock Syndrome</strong> is the financial version of Shiny Object Syndrome.</p>



<p>If you’ve ever bought a new stock without doing research or feel like you’ve missed on out an investment…then you might have Shiny Stock Syndrome.</p>



<p><em>What if you miss out on the next Amazon, Netflix or Tesla? You don’t wanna be a dunce, do ya???</em></p>



<p>In other words, it’s financial FOMO. </p>



<p><strong>Hi, my name is Oz and I’m a cryptoholic… </strong></p>



<p>During the cryptomania of 2017, I bought several obscure cryptocurrencies thinking they’d simply go up. I did very little research on some of these cryptocurrencies. Some of these, like <a href="https://coin.market/crypto/linda-coin">LINDA coin</a>, are basically defunct. </p>



<p>I lost money. Luckily, I didn’t lose my shirt by holding <a href="https://ozchen.com/cryptocurrency-not-lottery-ticket/">more worthwhile crypto</a>. </p>



<p>That’s how I experienced Shiny Object Syndrome first hand.</p>



<p>Thankfully, there is a solution to this pernicious mental condition. </p>



<h2 id="h-is-this-better-than-what-i-already-own">“Is this better than what I already own?”</h2>



<p>Shiny Stock Syndrome is an expression of the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novelty_effect" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">novelty effect</a></strong>. This is the bias towards preferring something just because it’s perceived as new. </p>



<p>After all, we like to read “news” …and not “olds.” (Hey, I gotta drop at least 1 dad joke in here.)</p>



<p>To counter the novelty effect, we can take advantage of another bias: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endowment_effect">endowment effect</a>, which is the preference for something we already own. </p>



<p>Use the endowment effect to pay as much attention to stocks you already own, compared to hot new stocks. </p>



<p>This insight from a <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/01/06/5-questions-investors-should-ask-themselves-in-202/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Motley Fool podcast</a> really stuck with me:</p>



<blockquote><p>…for every new stock I add to my portfolio, I want to add to an existing business as well. If I truly don’t feel confident enough to add to any of my existing businesses in my portfolio, then maybe that says to me, “Hey, you should probably sell one of these businesses if you don’t really like it that much.”</p><cite>Emily Flippen, Motley Fool analyst</cite></blockquote>



<p>So I’m adding this to my list of heuristics for investing. </p>



<ul><li>If a new stock isn’t <em>more</em> compelling than current stocks, hold or buy more of what I already own</li><li>If my current stock becomes less compelling, then I should be willing to trade it for new stock</li></ul>



<p>Of course, you don’t have to sell a stock you already own. But this is a good thought exercise for <a href="https://ozchen.com/general-specific-framework/">practicing specificity</a>. That can look like…</p>



<ul><li>Listening to CEO interviews and following them on Twitter</li><li>Reading through a company’s financial statements </li><li>Subscribing to a company’s investor relations’ newsletter</li></ul>



<p id="h-stealing-toms-1-for-1-model">To leverage ownership bias for good, <strong>we should be as into our current investments as we are new ones.</strong></p>







<hr>



<p>TOMS Shoes pioneered the <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90344987/toms-made-buy-one-give-one-famous-now-its-updating-the-model">One for One model</a> of giving 1 product away for every purchased shoe. </p>



<p><a href="https://ozchen.com/retail-investors-vs-professional-investors/">Individual investors</a> like you and I can <s>borrow</s> steal the One for One model to build conviction in our investments:</p>



<blockquote><div><p>“Any time I want to buy a new stock, I have to buy a stock that I already own. </p><p>For every new stock I add to my portfolio, I want to add to an existing business as well.”</p></div><cite>Emily Flippen, Motley Fool analyst</cite></blockquote>



<p>Yes, this means counteracting Shiny Stock Syndrome with….Stock Hold Syndrome 🤣</p>

And I think it needs to be done as we expect clinical trials to be carried out," Nemer told CBC News Network's <em>Power &amp; Politics</em>&nbsp;today.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Nemer told host Vassy Kapelos that the data provided so far by&nbsp;Moderna and Pfizer on their&nbsp;vaccines were&nbsp;gathered when the first and second doses of the vaccines were being spaced three to four weeks apart, not three to four months apart.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"I think it's really important that we stick with the data and with the great science that give us these fantastic vaccines, and not tinker with it," she said.&nbsp;</p>  <p>If provinces want to find out if the interval between&nbsp;the first and second doses&nbsp;can be extended to 16 weeks, she said,&nbsp;those provinces should conduct proper clinical trials by registering participants and&nbsp;explaining to them the possible advantages and disadvantages of taking part.</p>    <p>She said that while such&nbsp;trials might show that it's&nbsp;safe to extend the interval to four months, Canada is not there yet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <p>"For now, we simply don't have enough data that tells&nbsp;us this is an effective strategy, particularly when we think that we have variants of the virus that are emerging that are not as well recognized by the vaccine," Nemer said.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"Partial immunity is something that people need to be very wary of. And it's probably best to just vaccinate as recommended and as studied for now."</p>  <p><em><strong>Watch:&nbsp;Mona Nemer:&nbsp;'partial immunity is something that people need to be very wary of.':</strong></em></p>  <p><span><span><div><div title="B.C. extends wait time between vaccines doses" role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div aria-labelledby="1867481667971-metadata-" title="B.C. extends wait time between vaccines doses"><div><p><img src="https://thumbnails.cbc.ca/maven_legacy/thumbnails/234/311/MONANEMER_400kbps_1280x720_1867496515944.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"></p></div></div></div></div></div><span>In response to B.C. extending the gap between first and second doses, Canada's Chief Science Advisor says "partial immunity is something that people need to be very wary of.

Centre for Disease Control,&nbsp;and countries around the world,&nbsp;shows&nbsp;"miraculous" protection of at least 90 per cent from the first dose of the&nbsp;Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.</p>  <h2>NACI guidance</h2>  <p>Henry said the B.C. CDC has been exchanging data with colleagues across the country and similar results are&nbsp;coming from&nbsp;Quebec, as well as from the U.K., Israel and other countries.</p>  <p>She also said&nbsp;the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) has been looking at the issue and will be issuing a statement on the matter in the near future.</p>  <p>As of March 1, however, the advice&nbsp;NACI is providing on its website says&nbsp;that the interval between the first and second shots of the Moderna vaccine should be four weeks, the interval for Pfizer should be three weeks and the interval for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine should be 12 weeks.&nbsp;</p>    <p>The head of Moderna's Canadian operations, Patricia Gauthier, told Kapelos Monday that the company's own trials, and the conditions under which the vaccine&nbsp;was approved by Health Canada, are tied to a four week interval.</p>  <p>"That being said, we're in times of pandemic and we can understand that there are difficult decisions to be made," Gauthier said. "This then becomes a government decision. We stand by the product monograph approved by Health Canada, but governments ... can make their own decisions."</p>  <p>Gauthier said she is not aware of any studies done or led by Moderna on what happens when the interval between the first and second doses is changed from four weeks to four months.</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

The January 6 insurrection was the culmination of months of online mis- and disinformation directed toward eroding American faith in the 2020 election.</p><p>US elections are decentralized: almost 10,000 state and local election offices are primarily responsible for the operation of elections. Dozens of federal agencies support this effort, including the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) within the Department of Homeland Security, the United States Election Assistance Commission (EAC), the FBI, the Department of Justice, and the Department of Defense. However, none of these federal agencies has a focus on, or authority regarding, election misinformation originating from domestic sources within the United States. This limited federal role reveals a critical gap for non-governmental entities to fill. Increasingly pervasive mis- and disinformation, both foreign and domestic, creates an urgent need for collaboration across government, civil society, media, and social media platforms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The Election Integrity Partnership, comprising organizations that specialize in understanding those information dynamics, aimed to create a model for whole-of-society collaboration and facilitate cooperation among partners dedicated to a free and fair election. With the narrow aim of defending the 2020 election against voting-related mis- and disinformation, it bridged the gap between government and civil society, helped to strengthen platform standards for combating election-related misinformation, and shared its findings with its stakeholders, media, and the American public. This report details our process and findings, and provides recommendations for future actions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Who We Are: EIP and Its Members</h2><p>The Election Integrity Partnership <a href="https://www.eipartnership.net/news/announcing-the-eip"><span>was formed to enable real-time information exchange</span></a> between election officials, government agencies, civil society organizations, social media platforms, the media, and the research community. It aimed to identify and analyze online mis- and disinformation, and to communicate important findings across stakeholders. It represented a novel collaboration between four of the nation’s leading institutions focused on researching mis- and disinformation in the social media landscape:&nbsp;</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>The Stanford Internet Observatory (SIO)&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>The University of Washington’s Center for an Informed Public (CIP)&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Graphika&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>The Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab (DFRLab)&nbsp;</p></li></ul><h2>What We Did</h2><p>The EIP’s primary goals were to: (1) identify mis- and disinformation before it went viral and during viral outbreaks, (2) share clear and accurate counter-messaging, and (3) document the specific misinformation actors, transmission pathways, narrative evolutions, and information infrastructures that enabled these narratives to propagate. To identify the scope of our work, we built a <a href="https://www.eipartnership.net/policy-analysis/platform-policies"><span>framework</span></a> to compare the policies of 15 social media platforms across four categories:&nbsp;</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><em>Procedural interference</em>: misinformation related to actual election procedures</p></li><li><p><em>Participation interference</em>: content that includes intimidation to personal safety or deterrence to participation in the election process</p></li><li><p><em>Fraud</em>: content that encourages people to misrepresent themselves to affect the electoral process or illegally cast or destroy ballots</p></li><li><p><em>Delegitimization of election results</em>: content aiming to delegitimize election results on the basis of false or misleading claims&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>The EIP used an innovative internal research structure that leveraged the capabilities of the partner organizations through a tiered analysis model based on “tickets” collected internally and from our external stakeholders. Of the tickets we processed, 72% were related to delegitimization of the election.&nbsp;</p><h2>Key Takeaways</h2><h4>Misleading and false claims and narratives coalesced into the metanarrative of a “stolen election,” which later propelled the January 6 insurrection.&nbsp;</h4><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Right-leaning “blue-check” influencers transformed one-off stories, sometimes based on honest voter concerns or genuine misunderstandings, into cohesive narratives of systemic election fraud.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Warped stories frequently centered on mail-in voting and accusations of found, discarded, or destroyed ballots, particularly in swing states. Misleading framing of real-world incidents often took the form of falsely assigning intent, exaggerating impact, falsely framing the date, or altering locale.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>The metanarrative of a “stolen election” coalesced into the #StopTheSteal movement, encompassing many of the previous narratives. The narrative appeared across platforms and quickly inspired online organizing and offline protests, leading ultimately to the January 6 rally at the White House and the insurrection at the Capitol.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Fact-checking of narratives had mixed results; non-falsifiable narratives presented a particular challenge. In some cases, social media platform fact-checks risked drawing further attention to the claims they sought to debunk.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><h4>The production and spread of misinformation was multidirectional and participatory.&nbsp;</h4><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Individuals participated in the creation and spread of narratives. Bottom-up false and misleading narratives started with individuals identifying real-world or one-off incidents and posting them to social media. Influencers and hyperpartisan media leveraged this grassroots content, assembling it into overarching narratives about fraud, and disseminating it across platforms to their large audiences. Mass media often picked up these stories after they had reached a critical mass of engagement.</p></li><li><p>Top-down mis- and disinformation moved in the opposite direction, with claims first made by prominent political operatives and influencers, often on mass media, which were then discussed and shared by people across social media properties.</p></li></ul><h4>Narrative spread was cross-platform: repeat spreaders leveraged the specific features of each platform for maximum amplification.&nbsp;</h4><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>The cross-platform nature of misinformation content and narrative spread limited the efficacy of any single platform’s response.</p></li><li><p>Smaller, niche, and hyperpartisan platforms, which were often less moderated or completely unmoderated, hosted and discussed content that had been moderated elsewhere. Parler in particular saw a remarkable increase in its active user base, as users rejected the “censorship” they perceived on other platforms.</p></li></ul><h4>The primary repeat spreaders of false and misleading narratives were verified, blue-check accounts belonging to partisan media outlets, social media influencers, and political figures, including President Trump and his family.</h4><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>These repeat spreaders amplified the majority of the investigated incidents aggressively across multiple platforms.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Repeat spreaders often promoted and spread each others’ content. Once content from misleading narratives entered this network, it spread quickly across the overlapping audiences.</p></li></ul><h4>Many platforms expanded their election-related policies during the 2020 election cycle. However, application of moderation policies was inconsistent or unclear.</h4><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Platforms took action against policy violations by suspending users or removing content, downranking or preventing content sharing, and applying informational labels. However, moderation efforts were applied inconsistently on and across platforms, and policy language and updates were often unclear.</p></li><li><p>Account suspensions and content removal or labeling sometimes contributed to conspiratorial narratives that platforms were “covering up the truth,” entangling platforms with the narratives they wished to eliminate.</p></li><li><p>Lack of transparency and access to platform APIs hindered external research into the effectiveness of platform policies and interventions.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><h2>Key Recommendations</h2><h3>Federal Government</h3><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Establish clear authorities and roles for identifying and countering election related mis- and disinformation. Build on the federal interagency movement toward recognizing elections as a national security priority and critical infrastructure.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Create clear standards for consistent disclosures of mis- and disinformation from foreign and domestic sources as a core function of facilitating free and fair elections, including via CISA’s Rumor Control and joint interagency statements.</p></li></ul><h3>Congress</h3><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Pass existing bipartisan proposals for increased appropriations marked for federal and state election security.</p></li><li><p>Codify the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence’s bipartisan recommendations related to the depoliticization of election security and the behavior of public officials and candidates for federal office noted in Volumes <a href="https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Report_Volume3.pdf"><span>3</span></a> and <a href="https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/report_volume5.pdf"><span>5</span></a> of the Committee’s report on foreign influence in 2016 elections.</p></li></ul><h3>State and Local Officials</h3><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Establish trusted channels of communication with voters.

For example, if researchers expect a narrative will emerge, platforms should explain that narrative’s history or provide fact-checks or context related to its prior iterations.</p></li><li><p>Invest in research into the efficacy of internal policy interventions (such as labeling) and share those results with external researchers, civil society, and the public.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Increase the amount and granularity of data regarding interventions, takedowns, and labeling to allow for independent analysis of the efficacy of these policies.</p></li><li><p>Impose clear consequences for accounts that repeatedly violate platform policies.
