<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>The first commercial version of <a href="https://curious-expedition.com/">Curious Expedition</a> was released at the end of 2014. In this blog post I will give you the complete overview of all the sales numbers of these first six years. How many units we sold, when we sold them, in which territories, on which platforms. I will also tell how it felt to tank with our game and how we were able to eventually turn it into a bigger success than we ever imagined.</p>
<p>In case you never heard about it: Curious Expedition is a roguelike expedition game in which you explore uncharted lands, fight dangerous beasts and encounter unknown tribes, all while trying to not go insane or getting forsaken by your own trek members. It is the first game by  <a href="http://maschinen-mensch.com/" target="_blank">Maschinen-Mensch</a>.</p>

<p>Over time, it was released on all major store fronts: Steam, GOG, HumbleStore and itch.io. We recently released console versions for Xbox, PS and Nintendo Switch, but that happened after the initial five years and will not be covered here.</p>

<h3 id="the-big-picture">The big picture</h3>
<p>I’ll give you the grand yearly numbers right away. For NDA reasons I can’t go into specific details about how much we sold on each distribution platform, but will instead lump all our digital sales together. All of this units are gross value, that means before tax, distribution rev share and charge backs (usually around 5-15%).</p>


<p>As you can see Curious Expedition had its <strong>most successful years two full years after releasing the first version</strong>. If you’re interested in how we managed to do that just keep reading the detailed history below:</p>
<h2 id="year-1-2014---alpha">Year 1 (2014) - Alpha</h2>
<h3 id="beginnings">Beginnings</h3>
<p>Johannes and I met at Berlin AAA developer <a href="https://www.yager.de/" target="_blank">Yager</a> where we both worked on the war/anti-war game Spec Ops: The Line. We decided to start working on a hobby project around 2012, with the grand dream of potentially going indie with it. Curious Expedition (or Terra Incognita as it was called back then) was the first game that we both agreed on. The idea came to me when I browsed a National Geographic magazine in the waiting room of my dentist.</p>
<p>During this hobbyist phase we struggled quite a bit with the game. Our interest in the premise never waned, but we went through dozens of game mechanics without really being able to nail down the core loop concept. During that time we met multiple times with the intention of quitting the game, only to give it two more months over and over again. We made a leap of faith when we decided to quit our AAA jobs in the beginning of 2014.</p>
<p>The birth of our company Maschinen-Mensch (at some point we had called ourselves Hic Sunt Leones) was eased by a <strong>€50,000 grant from <a href="https://www.medienboard.de/" target="_blank">Medienboard Berlin-Brandenburg</a></strong>. Thankfully we also had a bit of personal savings that helped us survive the initial months since the grant is only allowed to cover 50% of the project costs.</p>
<p>The first thing we did when finally started working full-time on the game, was completely ripping it apart and disabling all features until nothing but a simplistic movement prototype remained. From here we rebuilt all the aspects of the game. Our hope that we finally were onto something was kindled by the positive feedback from our small game designer meetup that we started around the same time.</p>
<p>At the end of 2014 we pushed ourselves to finally release the painfully barebone initial alpha of the game. Complete sections of the game were still missing: when you ran into combat a text message would tell you that we basically didn’t get to that part yet. But we had no choice: our money was running out at this point.</p>
<h3 id="alpha-editions">Alpha Editions</h3>
<p>We released the first buyable version of Curious Expedition on our own homepage where we sold it via the <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/developer/widget" target="_blank">Humble Widget</a>. We took some inspiration from all the new Kickstarter projects that were created in 2014 and showed that players appreciated different pricing and feature options for purchasing games.</p>
<p>Here’s an overview of all editions we started with:</p>

<h3 id="day-1-sales">Day 1 sales</h3>
<p>Our first release date was November 18th 2014 and we sold in total <em>drum rolls</em>.. <strong>61 copies for a total revenue of $1,203</strong>. Not exactly dream numbers when you just quit your high profile AAA job and spent all your savings on creating this indie game, which has to work out for you to be able to remain an indie game dev.</p>
<p>Here’s a break-down of the unit types sold on that first day:</p>
<div><h4>Launch Day (November 18th 2014)</h4></div>
<h3 id="back-to-work">Back to work</h3>
<p>After pushing the big frightening release button, I remember that we went to a coincidental drink out with some friends from the game dev scene. I still remember how they asked curiously how much we had already sold. I felt bad about telling them that this great indie game experiment we had launched had pretty much tanked at this point. But there was no point in giving up now, so on Monday we got back into the office (which was my living room) and just started working on our next big alpha update.</p>
<p>I turned my old iPad into a live sales metrics board showing the current sales in the style of an airport destinations board and we hooked up to a hefty cash register sound whenever somebody bought a copy of our game. I remember with joy the small moments of celebration when during work the sound would come up and how we high-fived. I also remember those stretches of hours when there was no single sound being played though and we were checking if our metrics were broken, before realizing once again that this was just the state of affairs.</p>
<p>In 2014 we sold in total <strong>793</strong> units for a revenue of <strong>$10,965</strong> with an average price point of <strong>$13.83</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="year-2-2015---early-access">Year 2 (2015) - Early Access</h2>
<p>In 2015 we pushed hard on extending Curious Expedition 1. Despite the slow start we were nowhere done and set our hopes into appearing in digital storefronts. So far we had tried to bring people to our small website, but since the players didn’t come to the game, it was time to bring the game to the players.</p>
<h3 id="alpha-videos">Alpha Videos</h3>
<p>Up to this point we had mostly relied on twitter to attract players to our homepage. Today we’re close to 6,000 followers on twitter, but back then we were struggling for a long time to even get to 500 followers.</p>
<p>To build up visibility and hopefully share our excitement about our game, we started recording videos for the numerous alpha updates that we did. Looking at them now, they are a crazy trip down the memory lane to our past selves. Here’s the one for Alpha 4, which is special since it is the alpha in which we added combat for the first time.</p>

          <p>
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m0KRUAeg79E" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
          </p>
          
<p>For each alpha update we announced the release day weeks in advance and approached it like a mini-release with marketing material and a strong theme for each of these updates. We made sure to have at least one highly visible “hero feature” per alpha release.</p>
<p>For this update our main focus were our dice challenges. We had been working on combat prototypes for over a year at this point, but as we added more and more combat features, we realized that it became a big centerpiece and we were over-scoping heavily, so we made the hard decision to completely remove combat and make a game that would work solely based on the merits of its unique travel gameplay first.</p>
<p>We did this even though we felt that we had stumbled into an interesting spin on combat: a 1-dimensional dungeon crawler, where instead of on a grid your character and the enemies would be laid out on a line.</p>
<h3 id="free-weekend">Free weekend!</h3>
<p>Before going to stores, we decided to try our luck on drawing more people to our website one last time and did a free weekend! Players could play the game right from their web browser without having to download anything. This was not only nice for lowering entry barriers but also made it very easy for us to revoke access to the game after the weekend was done.</p>
<p>We expected to have fewer sales during the free weekend with an uptick in sales afterwards from players who wanted to play more. To our surprise we had the highest sales during the time when the game was free. Afterwards the sales normalized pretty quickly again.</p>
<div><h4>Sales before and after the free weekend (Feb 2015)</h4></div>
<h3 id="storefront">Storefront!</h3>
<p>On May 19th we finally entered Early Access on Steam as our first store front and this is when Curious Expedition finally changed trajectory to become a success. We still sold the extra editions through our own homepage but the vast majority of sales now happened on the digital storefronts.</p>
<h3 id="pricing-strategy">Pricing Strategy</h3>
<p>We increased our price from <strong>$12</strong> to <strong>$15</strong> as we released the Early Access version. We felt it was fair enough since we had spent many months adding additional content to the game. The following chart shows the average price point per year.</p>
<div><h4>Average Price per Year (2015-2019)</h4></div>
<p>We also decided to be as timid as possible regarding sales. Until we reached the 1.0 phase we decided to not do any sales that went beyond 20%. You can see a timeline of our general sale price reductions here.</p>
<div><h4>On-Sale Reduction (2015-2019)</h4></div>
<p>In 2015 we sold in total <strong>21,266</strong> units for a revenue of <strong>$302,534</strong> with an average price point of <strong>$14.23</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="year-3-2016---gold-release">Year 3 (2016) - Gold Release</h2>
<h3 id="going-gold">Going Gold</h3>
<p>This is the year that we released the 1.0 version of Curious Expedition after over a year of Early Access. We also landed in more online stores: getting a presence in the HumbleStore and being lucky enough to be chosen by GOG as one of the very few games that they chose for their Games in Production program.</p>
<p>We read that you only get one big push in your game’s lifetime: either your Kickstarter campaign or your early access release or your full release. Luckily for us this turned out to not be the case. Not only did the game keep selling well in 2016, the release of the 1.0 version even surpassed our sales records until that point and pushed the game to sell more units than it had in 2015. After the gold release we started applying more sales and going beyond 20%. We were still extremely conservative for a game that had been released for two years now.</p>

<li><code>hostgssenc</code> - TCP/IP only GSSAPI</li>
<li><code>hostnogssenc</code> - TCP/IP only without GSSAPI</li>
</ul>
<p>With <code>DATABASE</code> we can specify database name or use special value <code>sameuser</code> if database name should be same as name of user that is connecting.</p>
<p>With <code>USER</code> we can specify user or role - role name should be preceded by <code>+</code> sign.</p>
<p><code>ADDRESS</code> field could be - hostname, IP range in CIDR format or special words:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>samehost</code> - which correspond to all IP adresses of database server</li>
<li><code>samenet</code> - which correspond to all IP in database server subnet</li>
</ul>
<p>With <code>METHOD</code> field we can set one of authentication methods - most important ones are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>trust</code> - allow connection without password - moslty set for local connections from database server itself</li>
<li><code>reject</code> - reject connections</li>
<li><code>md5</code> - allow connections after getting from user password - encrypted</li>
<li><code>password</code> - allow connection after getting plain password - DO NOT USE in untrusted networks - better -&gt; never use this option</li>
<li><code>ldap</code> - getting account authorization data from LDAP server</li>
</ul>
<p>In <code>DATABASE</code> and <code>USER</code> fields you can specify special word <code>all</code> if you don’t want to create any restrictions here.</p>
<p>There can be situation when we must use additional field named <code>auth-options</code> for specyfying details for example for <code>hostssl</code> connection type. This topic will be covered in another post.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Managers are responsible for partnering with reports to grow their career. This growth should be primarily facilitated by the work that is given to the report. This growth should not be primarily facilitated by “extracurriculars.” Let’s dive into some details.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of ways people can grow skill-sets: the work the business needs or extracurriculars. Extracurriculars are things that are not (or are not in service of accomplishing) a priority for the business. Extracurriculars commonly include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Reading a book</li>
  <li>Doing side projects</li>
  <li>Taking an online class</li>
  <li>Going to meetups</li>
  <li>Going to conferences</li>
</ul>

<p>Companies should to the best of their ability support people who want to do these things. However, it’s a common anti-pattern for managers (and reports, and companies) to treat these activities as primary drivers of growth. There’s a couple main reasons why people intuitively lean on extracurriculars when trying to drive growth:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The alternative to extracurriculars is having people take on work that stretches their ability/skill set, which is less efficient for the business. Stated otherwise: extracurriculars are perceived as 0-risk to the business.</li>
  <li>Interests are confused with growth. Instead of finding ways to strategically grow in a role and in the company, people start growth conversations from “what kind of stuff are you interested in?”*</li>
</ul>

<p>Extracurriculars-as-growth has some major problems:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The machinery of the company is not set up to hold you accountable to actual delivery of extracurriculars. Nobody ever got a raise because they read a book. Nobody ever got fired because they didn’t read a book. It’s very common to see  extracurricular tasks in growth plans only to never be followed up on.</li>
  <li>Extracurriculars are usually done off the clock. Companies often don’t make time for people to actually do that work and it’s implicit that the report needs to find time to do both those things and their regular work. Company-driven growth should be done nearly exclusively on the company’s time. Because homework is often not a priority, the company often doesn’t support it being done on the clock, and this - appropriately, obviously - leads to conflict. Expecting homework from an employee isn’t fair.</li>
  <li>Extracurriculars are often interest-based, not growth-based. So the work often doesn’t translate into any meaningful increase in impact at the company.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ok, so extracurriculars-as-growth is bad. Let’s fix it. It’s easy - skills should be grown via work the business needs. The company supports that work and holds people accountable to doing it. That growth will be directly in-line with what the company needs. And growing via that work will also actually deliver impact in a way that gets you rewards.</p>

<p>Like eating your vegetables or daily exercise - it sounds easy, but putting this into practice can be difficult. In fact, getting it done is a major culture shift. You have to build a culture that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Is willing to invest in people at the cost of optimal delivery in the short term.</li>
  <li>Trusts people to fail. The other main anti-pattern is to give people a chance and then pull them out of the critical path the minute they make a mistake.</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		  <div role="main">
	<article>

		


		<p>Imagine tomorrow you go shopping and, for whatever reason, you never come back. Maybe be someone killed you, maybe someone kidnapped you, maybe you had an accident ... Now imagine you are travelling alone in Thailand and you die. How people who know you are going to find out what happen ? if you are being kidnaped how the police will do to find you, if you got lost how people will find you ? If you die how your family is going to find your papers ?</p>
<p>I wanted to find a way to answer all those questions, basically we can sum up the issues in 3 points :
- In case of being kidnaped or getting lost send as much information on your last location, and following locations, your last activity, all your digital information to someone who is going to help liberating you
- In case of dying, sending all your documents (passwords, friends list, legal documents, ...) to your family
- Not sending those documents by mistakes if you are not on the situations above</p>
<h2>First step : collect your position, your activity, your documents, ...</h2>
<p>The first step is to be sure that you have the data that you want to send, on my part, the data are:</p>
<ol>
<li>My current position and recent history</li>
<li>My last know activity and a recent history</li>
<li>The list of my credentials</li>
<li>The list of my legal documents (id, passport, health insurance, work papers, ...)</li>
</ol>
<p>I've written an <a href="https://blog.luap.info/how-i-track-my-life.html">article</a> explaining how I'm doing 1. and 2. (position in real time, and last activity), so this is fixed.</p>
<p>For my credentials, I use <a href="https://keepassxc.org/">keepassXC</a> with a keyfile + a master password, the keyfile and the password db is synced using <a href="https://syncthing.net/">syncthingd</a> with a server that I rent</p>
<p>My legal documents are all tied in one folder on my laptop which is also synced on the same server</p>
<p>So basically we have all the needed documents which are synced in real time on the same server</p>
<h2>Second step : Choose how to trigger the sharing of documents</h2>
<p>The biggest problem is you want the alert to react quickly but not fire because you have been sleeping for 8 hours. So I chose to rely on the time since I last changed of activity. Currently after 24h without changing activity a first notification is sent to my own email so that if this is a mistake I can stop the system before it is too late. And if 6 hours later I've still haven't changed of activity then a mail is sent to my parents.</p>
<p>So basically if something happens to me my parents will be notified maximum 30h after the event, this is not so great but this is a good beginning. In the future I should try to have an adaptive delay depending on the last activity, for example if my last activity is eating, then I won't eat for 24 hours, so I can trigger the alert after for example 4 hours.</p>
<h2>Last step : What to put inside the notification</h2>
<p>So my parents will receive an email after 30 hours of inactivity. In this email there is a link to a page which will allow them to retrieve all the documents.
<img alt="email" src="https://blog.luap.info/static/kidnap/email.png"></p>
<p>The link is random generated link available only 6 hours, this is important to be safe as you don't want anyone to be able to access all your passwords ...</p>
<p>And the page, there are explanations of that page is about, like, "maybe I was kidnaped, maybe I'm lost, check my last time active on whatsapp, contact xxxx to see if he knows anything"
You can also view the current position of my phone and a small location history, that way you can see if I'm still moving, or if the last point if 30 hours old, you can also see my last activity and when it started</p>
<p>And finally you can get the list of all my passwords, for that purpose I created a form, with 6 facts on my life, that only my parents can know all of them, like what was the color of my first car ..., then there you can submit your answer, there is a rate limit on the number of requests you can make to prevent a brute force. If the 6 answers are true, the backend will decode the keepassxc archive and return a json of the archive, containing all of my credentials, including the ssh password to connect on the server to get all the paper documents.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I know that all of that is far from being perfect. I check every few months that the alerting is working, by decreasing the delay to trigger the alert, but the server can go down, ton of things can happen to make the system not working, so that's why I tried to keep everything as simple as possible, postgresql + django + cron. Someone should create a service to manage that at a bigger scale, or maybe that's something that 1password or others could include in their offer</p>

   <time>August 2020</time>

   

   

   <p>Piloting an <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-de/product/ocean-exploration-ship-60266">ocean exploration ship</a> or <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-de/product/mars-research-shuttle-60226">Martian research shuttle</a> is serious business. Let’s hope the control panel is up to scratch. Two studs wide and angled at 45°, the ubiquitous “2x2 decorated slope” is a LEGO minifigure’s interface to the world.</p>

<p>These iconic, low-resolution designs are the perfect tool to learn the basics of physical interface design. Armed with 52 different bricks, let’s see what they can teach us about the design, layout and organisation of complex interfaces.</p>

<p>Welcome to the world of LEGO UX design.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.designedbycave.co.uk/images/posts/2020-08-LEGO-Interface-UX/interfaces.jpg" alt="LEGO interfaces"></p>

<h2 id="organised-chaos">Organised chaos</h2>

<p>At a glance, the variety of these designs can be overwhelming, but it’s clear that some of these interfaces look far more chaotic than others. Most interfaces in our world contain a blend of digital screens and analog inputs like switches and dials. These LEGO panels are no different.</p>

<p>Plotting the panels across these two axes reveals a few different clusters. Screens with an accompanying row of buttons sit in the top left. A small cluster of very organised switch panels lies to the far right. The centre bottom is occupied by some wild concepts that are hard to understand, even after several glances.</p>

<figure>

    <figcaption>Design positioning with LEGO, in LEGO</figcaption>
  </figure>

<p>Designing a complex machine interface is a juggling act of many different factors from ergonomics to engineering. But we can break down the problem into two key questions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>How can we <em>differentiate</em> between the function of different inputs?</li>
  <li>How can we <em>organise</em> the many inputs and outputs so that we understand how they relate to each other?</li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s take a deeper look at tackling these two challenges in LEGO.</p>

<h2 id="differentiating-inputs">Differentiating inputs</h2>

<p>What could cause 400 WWII pilots to raise the landing gear on their B-17 bomber just before touchdown? Catastrophic pilot error, or something more fundamental?</p>

<p>It was the psychologist Alphonsis Chapanis who first suggested that the high rate of crash landings might be the fault of poor interface design. The adjacent landing gear and flap control knobs were identically shaped. The pilots never stood a chance.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://www.designedbycave.co.uk/images/posts/2020-08-LEGO-Interface-UX/landing.jpg" alt="B-17 belly landing, and the shape coding that helped to irradiate the problem. Source: Wikipedia">
    <figcaption>B-17 belly landing, and the shape coding that helped to irradiate the problem. Source: Wikipedia</figcaption>
  </figure>

<p>His temporary solution was to glue differently shaped strips of rubber to each switch, enabling blind operation by touch alone. This gave rise to the idea of shape coding and a system of differentiation still being followed in aircraft cockpits today.</p>

<p>We can compare the three interfaces below to see this in action. Ignore the overall layout, it’s the differences between individual switches that matter here. Imagine trying to feel for one of these buttons without looking. The left panel (“Slope 45 2 x 2 with 12 Buttons”) would require careful hand-eye co-ordination. The right panel (“Aircraft Multiple Flight Controls”) clearly distinguishes between the throttle (large, linear vertical movement), toggle switches (round vertical flick) and the push buttons (square push-in).</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://www.designedbycave.co.uk/images/posts/2020-08-LEGO-Interface-UX/differentiation.jpg" alt="Left to right: terrible, poor and better input differentiation">
    <figcaption>Left to right: terrible, poor and better input differentiation</figcaption>

<p>Differentiation like this is a still a very real problem today. In 2015, <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2015/01/06/autos/ford-push-button-ignition-recall/index.html">Ford recalled 13,500 Lincoln SUVs</a> because drivers speeding down the motorway were mistakenly shutting off the engine when they tried to activate sport mode. See if you can spot why:</p>

<p>Shape coding is one approach to differentiation, but there are many others. Colour coding is perhaps the only one to break into our everyday vocabulary, but we can add four more: size, texture, position and operation coding. Together these six are our allies in the design of error-proof interfaces.</p>

<p>Size, shape and colour-coding are the fundamentals: quick-wins that can fix a lot of interface problems. Texture is also a great differentiator for blind operation, particularly on small dials requiring precise control.</p>

<p>Position-coding is seemingly straightforward but is often under used. Products with a clear default ergonomic position (like binoculars or a gaming console) can exploit the natural position of the hand to differentiate between primary and secondary actions.</p>

<p>Finally, operation-coding ascribes different types of movements (like a twist or vertical slide) to different inputs. This can be immensely powerful when the switch motion reinforces the operation behind it, e.g. a crane lever which raises the crane when the lever is raised.</p>

  </figure>

<p>Differentiation is a good first step that will avoid confusion between adjacent switches. But its only with organisation that we can create a clear and accurate mental model of the interface for the user.</p>

<h2 id="organising-inputs">Organising inputs</h2>

<p>Compare the three panels below. Identical layouts, but the blue one is much clearer than the white. This is the <a href="https://www.usertesting.com/blog/gestalt-principles">gestalt principles</a> at work, identifying related items with a common region.</p>

  </figure>

<p>Easy. But how are you going to decide which inputs to cluster together?</p>

<p>I like to use <a href="http://blog.presentandcorrect.com/27986-2">Soviet control panels</a> as a starting point. These beautiful walls of nonsensical dials and levers are brought to life when arranged in a giant factory schematic.  It would be hard to find a more literal organisation of the information.</p>

  </figure>

<p>These panels are what I’d called a consolidated interface. Every piece of input and feedback has been moved onto the same panel. This is the approach that <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/33847/the-defunct-dyson-evs-steering-wheel-looks-like-it-was-made-by-vacuum-cleaner-people">Dyson took with their car</a>. Now imagine the opposite, moving each of those lights and switches to the actual location of that valve in the factory. Sounds ludicrous, but these <a href="https://deeptread.com/blog/2016/11/21/audi-tt-air-vent-design">air vents in the Audi TT</a> show that this distributed approach can also be a great win for user experience. I wrote a lot more about these <a href="https://www.designedbycave.co.uk/2018/Interfaces/">distributed interfaces last year</a>.</p>

<figure>

    <figcaption>Lego vehicle dashboard: distributed (left) vs. consolidated (right)</figcaption>
  </figure>

<p>Back to the Soviet factories. Those interface panels were great for answering the question “does this valve let water into tank Б?”. But they’re very poor for answering “are all water valves closed?” or “where are all the switches I need to prepare for the shift changeover?”.</p>

<p>LEGO use the Soviet schematic approach for their <a href="https://www.bricklink.com/catalogItemIn.asp?P=3298pb005&amp;in=S">fantasy</a> <a href="https://www.bricklink.com/catalogItemIn.asp?P=3298px10&amp;in=S">orientated</a> designs, because schematics are superb at providing a mental model of the inner workings of an alien system. However for everyday use, there are some other approaches that work better.</p>

    <figcaption>LEGO Insectoid and UFO interfaces. I wonder what these buttons actually do?</figcaption>
  </figure>

<p><strong>Feature</strong> based organisation is the most common, perhaps even the “default” design philosophy. Group together all the inputs and outputs for each product feature. This <a href="https://www.cambridgeconsultants.com/press-releases/building-life-saving-ventilator-lightning-speed">COVID-19 ventilator from Cambridge Consultants</a> is a wonderful example but we also see this a lot in cars, with a cluster of switches for the airflow control and all of the lights on one control stick.</p>

<figure>

  </figure>

<p>Organising by <strong>operation</strong> means putting all the switches that function in a certain way in the same place. I’ve no idea what all the valves in the picture below do, but I bet they don’t all open things that relate to each other. Anytime you see a row of switches that look and function the same, but control disparate parts of the system, you’ve come across organisation by operation.</p>

<p>Today most interfaces are effectively <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fly-by-wire">fly-by-wire</a>, but historically the levers that you pulled in, say, a tractor cabin would literally move the hydraulic pistons beneath the seat to a new position. Routing all these different electrical, mechanical and hydraulic systems efficiently can severely compromise your interface clustering, leading to organisation by <strong>technology</strong>.</p>

<p>The modern equivalent of this is surprisingly common. Any touchscreen with buttons by the side exhibits this technology-based split. In a <a href="https://www.chrisharrison.net/index.php/Research/PneumaticDisplays">future</a> <a href="https://vimeo.com/343640141">world</a>, SpaceX might embed <a href="https://www.space.com/spacex-crew-dragon-touchscreen-astronaut-thoughts.html">these physical controls</a> right inside the screen next to the information they affect, but for now they sit awkwardly by the side as if nothing is wrong.</p>

<figure>

  </figure>

<p>In LEGO we find the feature based organisation in the “Monitor with -19° pattern”. Two clear clusters, perhaps one for temperature control and another for vital signs monitoring. In the second panel below, I don’t know what all those switches do, but they seem to be clustered based on their operation, not because of what they will operate.</p>

<p>There are many LEGO panels with a technology split like the SpaceX Dragon capsule, but I like to imagine that this early 90s police control unit was forced to divide the audio and video playback because the newer tape reel technology was incompatible with the older analog phone line system. This is organisation by technology in action.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://www.designedbycave.co.uk/images/posts/2020-08-LEGO-Interface-UX/organisation.jpg" alt="L-to-R: organisation by feature, operation, technology and use case">
    <figcaption>L-to-R: organisation by feature, operation, technology and use case</figcaption>
  </figure>

<p>All of our approaches so far: organisation by features, operation or technology, have been grounded in properties of the system, not of the user. Organisation by <strong>use-case</strong> is the antidote to this, a clustering based on the daily routines and tasks of the user.</p>

<p>Imagine arriving for work each day at the LEGO body scanner factory. Grouping the switches by task (prepare machine, load body, process scan…) would mean splitting up the radiation and scanner buttons into many different regions. More complex for the computer, but more streamlined for the operator. As the designer, only you and your users will be the judge of what works best.</p>

                <p>At one time, it certainly was easier to keep tabs on in-house team productivity. That’s no longer the case with today’s team collaboration software. Automated software development analytics programs like <a href="https://gitential.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gitential</a> and<a href="https://waydev.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Waydev</a> put remote developers on equal footing with in-house software development teams. They track all interactions with git repositories and produce a variety of performance metrics. This brings complete transparency to team member productivity.&nbsp; A shortlist of metrics includes code churn, code efficiency, code volume, coding hours, number of commits, and test volume.</p>
<p>Do you need actual “eyes-on” what everyone is doing?<a href="https://www.sococo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Sococo</a> provides a virtual office solution for Agile Teams. Whether in-house or distributed, all team members have a room in your “virtual building.” At a glance, you can see who’s online and what they’re working on, in real-time. It provides broadcasting capabilities, teleconferences, screen-sharing for presentations, and more. The only downside is that it requires everyone to use a headset.</p>

                <p>We can break this myth. Some offices are idealistic and serene. Some home offices may resemble mosh pits. A<a href="https://www.flexjobs.com/blog/post/flexjobs-2018-annual-survey-workers-believe-flexible-remote-job-can-help-save-money-reduce-stress-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 2018 FlexJobs Survey</a> of 3,000 participants indicated 75% are more productive working remotely. They cited coworker interruptions and general office noises as major issues. Less commuting and reduced office politics were also cited as boosting productivity. The<a href="https://www.smallbizgenius.net/by-the-numbers/remote-work-statistics/#gref" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Ultimate List of Remote Work Statistics</a> – 2020 Edition shows similar studies from Owl Labs, Buffer, Gallup, and others. They consistently reflect higher productivity and quality of work in telecommuting environments.</p>
<p>Veteran remote developers know two things are vital. The first is to remove distractions from one’s work area. The second is the discipline to not give in to temptations. Managers can coach team members they believe are challenged by their work remote environment. In-house teams may find the adjustment difficult at first. For outsourced teams, <i>it is their SOP</i> and they likely have productivity tips to share.</p>

                <p>Some managers believe that you lose control of your project without an in-house team. That can happen if you forget two important legal agreements. The first is a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA).&nbsp; It enforces that team members understand you own and control all intellectual property. That goes for any work product or inventions associated with any contract.</p>
<p>The second is a Service Level Agreement (SLA). This specifies the services an agency or individual will provide to you. It specifies the expected standards and metrics whereby the work will be measured. It lays out each party’s responsibilities. Additionally, it defines the remedies and penalties for any breach. Violations of SLA’s and NDA’s are subject to civil suits and monetary damages.</p>

                <p>Recruiter and hiring managers aren’t complaining about a lack of job applications. Their gripes concern a lack of qualified applicants. In 2019, the United States had about 4.2 million software developers. In contrast, there are roughly 5.5 million developers in Europe and 24 million worldwide. In-house software development teams rely upon limited local talent. You can attract more qualified developers by outsourcing through IT staffing agencies.</p>
<p>While the United States does have good programmers, they don’t stack up against the Top 10 very well. According to<a href="https://skillvalue.com/companies/en/it-ranking-best-developers-2019-skillvalue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Where to Find the Best Developers in 2019?</a> by SkillValue, the United States ranks a distant #27. US developers had scored 84.59% as rated against over 550 technical assessments.</p>
<p>In comparison, a wide swath of Eastern Europe scored in the 93% range. Ukraine, for example, ranked #5 with a score of 93.17%. But don’t forget to factor in Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) and Cost of Living. Add these and you’ll find that Ukraine’s ~250,000 developers offer the best combination of value and technical proficiency available.</p>

<p><strong>KLM is in the throes of a crisis of unprecedented magnitude. Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus at the start of 2020, numerous measures have already been taken to deal with the current circumstances. Expectations are that the road to recovery will be long and fraught with uncertainty. This means that KLM’s structure and size must be rigorously adjusted even further in the years ahead. Consequently, a total of 4,500 to 5,000 positions in the entire KLM Group (expressed in FTEs) will cease to exist.</strong></p>



<p>In the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, KLM gradually began reducing the size of its network in February to operate less than 10% of its original number of <a href="https://kokpitherald.com/united-airlines-plans-to-resume-service-on-more-than-25-international-routes-in-september/">flights</a> by the start of April. In the second quarter, only 15% of the original number of flights were operated. In July, 30% of the original flights were operated and load factors are lagging behind. As a result, while the network is again being gradually and carefully expanded, revenues are lagging far behind.</p>
 <!-- A generated by theme --> 



 <!-- end A --> 





<p>Prospects for the airline industry – and KLM in particular – are uncertain. Different countries are now beginning to tighten their more relaxed travel restrictions. This is making customers more cautious when it comes to booking a ticket. In all scenarios, demand is only expected to recover by 2023 or 2024 at the earliest. The degree and speed of recovery will depend on a number of factors including the development of the virus, economic recovery and customer travel behaviour.</p>



<h2>KLM Adjusting to the New Reality</h2>



<p>Government support in the form of a direct state loan and guaranteed bank credit facilities amounting to a maximum of €3.4 billion will enable KLM to navigate the crisis in the forthcoming period. <a href="https://news.klm.com/klm-adapts-organisation-further-due-to-covid-19-crisis/" target="_blank" aria-label="KLM (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">KLM</a> is extremely grateful for this support provided by means of the loan. In order to guarantee KLM’s existence in the longer term, the airline must adapt its size to the new reality. KLM therefore finds itself compelled to reduce its workforce down to the number needed for the planned operation in 2021/2022. Of the current total of 33,000 FTEs in the entire KLM Group, the workforce must be reduced by 4,500 to 5,000 FTEs to 28,000 FTEs in the course of 2021.</p>



<p>KLM’s size is already becoming smaller – and will continue to be reduced – based on the current measures, which include the non-renewal of temporary contracts (1,500 FTEs) and the Voluntarily Departure Scheme (2,000 FTEs). Additionally, natural attrition (500 FTEs) through retirement and the like in 2020 and 2021 will also contribute to the reduction needed.</p>



<p>Hence, despite the measures already taken, even fewer people will be needed at KLM in the years ahead. Additionally, for positions on the ground we also need to deal with some mismatch in functional skills and capabilities.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, for this reason and taking into account the mismatch, alternative solutions will have to be found for ca. 1,500 positions. This relates to up to 500 ground positions, 300 cabin crew positions and 300 cockpit positions and approximately 400 positions at KLM subsidiaries and Air France-KLM group functions.</p>



<p>Given the high level of uncertainty, KLM keeps open the possibility of further reductions in case the production levels will be revised further down for 2021/2022 than the -20% planned now.</p>

<h3>KLM to Cooperate with Trade unions and Works Council</h3>



<p>KLM’s reorganisation plans tie in with organisation-wide changes at Air France KLM. In the forthcoming period, KLM will be cooperating closely with the trade unions to draft a social plan for each collective labour agreement domain and subsidiary, as well as maintaining close consultation with the Works Council about further defining the reorganisation. This will include a more detailed specification of the conditions set by the Dutch government on issuing the financing package. Expectations are that this will be finished in its entirety in the course of October.“</p>



<blockquote><p><em>A great deal has already been done in recent months with respect to adjusting the size of our company in the face of a new reality. Unfortunately, more measures are needed in the short term to guarantee KLM’s continued existence in the future. For this reason, we are elaborating the reorganisation plan to emerge from this crisis in a stronger position, while retaining as many jobs as we can in a responsible manner and repaying the loans as quickly as possible.</em></p><p><em>KLM employees are loyal, professional and hard working. They are always ready to serve our customers, one another, the company and society at large. Recent developments have again served to prove that this is true. It is incredibly difficult and sad for KLM to now have to bid farewell to valuable, committed colleagues. Certainly in view of how much we have succeeded in achieving together in recent years. The forthcoming period will be devoted to saying goodbye to colleagues who have to leave with due care and to reconstructing KLM.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>I’ve been enjoying the ongoing <a href="http://psas.scripts.mit.edu/home/2020-workshop-information/">MIT STAMP workshop</a>. In particular, I’ve been enjoying listening to Nancy Leveson talk about system safety. Leveson is a giant in the safety research community (and, incidentally, an author of <a href="http://sunnyday.mit.edu/papers/nver-tse.pdf">my favorite software engineering study</a>). She’s also a critic of <em>root cause</em> and <em>human error</em> as explanations for accidents.  Despite this, she has a different perspective on safety than many in the resilience engineering community. To sharpen my thinking, I’m going to capture my understanding of this difference in this post below.</p>



<p>From Leveson’s perspective, <em>the engineering design should ensure that the system is safe</em>. More specifically, the design should contain <em>controls</em> that eliminate or mitigate <em>hazards</em>. In this view, accidents are invariably attributable to design errors: a hazard in the system was not effectively controlled in the design. </p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">"The operator's job is to make up for the holes in the designer's work." – Jens Rasmussen (1981)</p>— John Allspaw (@allspaw) <a href="https://twitter.com/allspaw/status/225615911074267136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 18, 2012</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>By contrast, many in the resilience engineering community claim that <em>design alone cannot ensure that the system is safe.</em> The idea here is that the system design will always be incomplete, and the human operators must adapt their local work to make up for the gaps in the designed system. These adaptations usually contribute to safety, and sometimes contribute to incidents, and in post-incident investigations we often only notice the latter case.</p>



<p>These perspectives are quite different. Leveson believes that depending on human adaptation in the system is itself dangerous. If we’re depending on human adaptation to achieve system safety, then the design engineers have not done their jobs properly in controlling hazards. The resilience engineering folks believe that depending on human adaptation is <em>inevitable</em>, because of the messy nature of complex systems.</p>

<div><p>“I haven’t seen <em>Evil Dead II</em> yet”. Much is made about this simple question in the movie adaption of <em><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Fidelity_(film)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">High Fidelity</a></em>. Does “yet” mean the person does, indeed, intend to see the film?  Jack Black’s character is having real trouble with the concept – not only does he know that the speaker, John Cusack’s character, has seen <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Fidelity_(film)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Evil Dead II</a>, but what idiot wouldn’t see it, “<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/High_Fidelity_(film)#:~:text=Barry%3A%20Because%20it's%20a%20brilliant%20film" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">because</a> it’s a brilliant film. It’s so funny, and violent, and the soundtrack kicks so much ass.”  I love this exchange, but I’m a fan of the film anyway. It is not always clear to me how to handle advanced variable types Rust, yet. </p><p>I think of these as wrappers that add abilities (and restrictions) to a variable. They give a variable super powers since the Rust compiler is so strict about what you can and can’t do with variables.</p></div>

The <strong>Box&lt;&gt;</strong> variable itself is just a pointer so its size is obvious and can, itself, be stored on the stack.</p><p>RESTRICTIONS:</p><p>USEFUL WHEN:<br>If the size of an item cannot be determined at compile time it will complain if the default is to store it on the stack (where a calculable size is necessary). Using <strong>Box&lt;&gt;</strong> will force the storage on the heap where a fixed size is not needed. For example, a recursive data-structure, including enums, will not work on the stack because a concrete size cannot be calculated. Turning the recursive field into a <strong>Box&lt;&gt;</strong> means it stores a pointer which CAN be sized. The example in the docs being:</p></div>



<pre data-enlighter-language="rust" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">enum List&lt;T&gt; {
    Cons(T, Box&lt;List&lt;T&gt;&gt;),
    Nil,
}</pre>







<p>Setting the value of a simple <strong>Box&lt;&gt;</strong> variable is easy enough and getting the <br>value back looks very normal:</p>

<h2>Cell&lt;T&gt;</h2>



<div><p>PROVIDES:<br>You can have multiple, shared references to the <strong>Cell&lt;&gt;</strong>(and thus, access to the value inside with <strong>.get()</strong>) and yet still mutate the value inside (with <strong>.set()</strong>). This is called <em>interior mutability</em> because the value inside can be changed but <strong>mut</strong> on the <strong>Cell&lt;&gt;</strong> itself is not needed.

<h2>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</h2>



<div><p>PROVIDES:<br><strong>RefCell&lt;&gt;</strong> is very similar to <strong>Cell&lt;&gt;</strong> except it adds borrow checking, but at run-time instead of compile time! This means, unlike <strong>Cell&lt;&gt;</strong>, it is possible to write <strong>RefCell&lt;&gt;</strong> code which will <strong>panic!()</strong>. You <strong>borrow()</strong> a ref to the inner value for read-only or <strong>borrow_mut()</strong> in order to change it.</p><p>RESTRICTIONS:<br><strong>borrow()</strong> will panic if a <strong>borrow_mut() </strong>is in place, and <strong>borrow_mut() </strong>will panic if either type is in place.</p><p>USEFUL WHEN:</p><p>NOTABLY PROVIDES:<br><strong>.borrow()</strong> to get a copy of the value at the ref<br><strong>.borrow_mut()</strong> to set the value at the ref<br><strong>.try_borrow()</strong> and <strong>.try_borrow_mut()</strong> will return a <strong>Result&lt;&gt;</strong> or error instead of a <strong>panic!()</strong>.<br>see the rust-lang.org <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cell/struct.RefCell.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">docs</a></p><p>EXAMPLES/DISCUSSION:<br><a href="https://ricardomartins.cc/2016/06/08/interior-mutability">https://ricardomartins.cc/2016/06/08/interior-mutability</a> (again)</p><p>You must successfully <strong>borrow_mut()</strong> the <strong>RefCell&lt;&gt;</strong> in order to set the value (by dereferencing) and then simply <strong>borrow()</strong> it to retrieve the value:</p></div>

<p>whereas, something as simple as this compiles, but panics at run-time.  Imagine how much more obscure this code could be. Remember, any number of read-only references or exactly 1 read-write reference and nothing else – although for RefCell, this is enforced at run-time:</p>

<p><span>Millions of users use Uber’s applications everyday across the globe, accessing seamless transportation or meal delivery at the push of a button. To achieve this accessibility at scale, our mobile apps require low-latency and highly reliable network communication, regardless of where customers use our services.</span></p>
<p><span>The network communication for all of Uber’s mobile applications are powered by the edge and the mobile networking infrastructures. The edge infrastructure provides secure connectivity for the HTTPS traffic originating from the mobile apps to the backend services. Uber’s edge infrastructure combines the global presence of public cloud platforms that help reduce app latencies with the additional ability to fallback to our own managed data-centers when required for enhanced reliability.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>On the mobile side, a core component of our networking stack is the failure handler that intelligently routes all mobile traffic from our applications to the edge infrastructure. Uber’s failure handler was designed as a finite state machine (FSM) to ensure that the traffic sent via cloud infrastructure is maximized. During times when the cloud infrastructure is unreachable, the failover handler dynamically re-routes the traffic directly to Uber’s data centers without significantly impacting the user’s experience.</span></p>
<p><span>After rolling out the failover handler at Uber, we witnessed a 25-30 percent reduction in tail-end latencies for the HTTPS traffic when compared to previous solutions. The failover handler has also ensured reasonably low error rates for the HTTPS traffic during periods of outages faced by the public cloud infrastructure. Combined, these performance improvements have led to better user experiences for markets worldwide.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In this article, we share the challenges faced in designing the mobile failover handler for Uber’s applications, and how the design evolved as we operationalized the system across our users globally.</span></p>

<h2><span>Uber’s edge infrastructure</span></h2>
<p><span>Uber’s edge infrastructure comprises front-end proxy servers that terminate secure TLS over </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol"><span>TCP</span></a><span> or </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC"><span>QUIC</span></a><span> connections from the mobile apps. The HTTPS traffic originating from the mobile apps over these connections are then forwarded to the backend services in the nearest data-center using existing </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection_pool"><span>connection pools</span></a><span>. The edge infrastructure spans across public cloud and privately managed infrastructures as shown in Figure 1, below, with the front-end proxies hosted both within public cloud regions and in Uber’s managed data-centers:&nbsp;</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_8070" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-8070"><a href="https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2nd-.gif"><img src="https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2nd-.gif" alt="" width="1200" height="541"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-8070">Figure 1. Uber’s edge infrastructure powers our mobile applications by routing mobile traffic either over the cloud infrastructure or directly to Uber’s managed data-centers.</figcaption></figure>

<p><span>Hosting the edge servers on public cloud enables us to leverage its widely deployed network of </span><a href="https://networkencyclopedia.com/point-of-presence-pop/"><span>Points of Presence</span></a><span>, or PoPs. </span><span>Terminating the QUIC/TCP connection closer to the user generally </span><span>results in better performance, translating to lower latency and error rates for the HTTPS traffic. In addition, the cloud’s front-end servers support newer, more </span><a href="https://eng.uber.com/employing-quic-protocol/"><span>performant protocols</span></a><span> that further lowers the latencies during poor network conditions. As such, it is critical we maximize the amount of HTTPS requests from mobile routed via the cloud regions to ensure the best possible user experience.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, if app requests are always routed to the cloud, we risk significant service interruptions during both&nbsp; local- and global-level disruptions. Such connectivity issues can be </span><a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/nsdi20spring_burnett_prepub.pdf"><span>attributed</span></a><span> to various components of the public clouds or the intermediate ISPs. Issues due to DNS service, load balancers, BGP routing, mis-configurations of network middleboxes, cloud outages etc. can lead to DNS or QUIC/ TCP connection timeouts. When disruptions occur, Uber’s platform must have the ability to dynamically failover and reroute incoming requests to our private data centers to ensure uninterrupted service.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The front-end servers hosted in the cloud and data-centers are registered as different </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name"><span>domain names</span></a><span>. By selecting the most appropriate domain-name, the mobile apps can route requests either through the cloud regions or directly to the Uber data-centers.</span></p>

<h2><span>Mobile Failover handling</span></h2>
<p><span>To facilitate highly performant and reliable app experiences for our users, we built an in-house failover handler that resides within the mobile networking stack as an interceptor placed above the core HTTP2/QUIC layers. As HTTPS requests are generated from the application, they pass through the failover handler, that rewrites the domain-name (or host-name) before they are processed by the core HTTP library. This ensures that the HTTPS traffic can be dynamically routed to the appropriate edge servers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Asynchronously, the failover handler continuously monitors the health of the domains and switches the domain if required based on the errors received from the HTTPS responses. The logic that decides when to switch the domains is the core component of the failover handler, and the main topic of discussion in this article.</span></p>
<p><span>The failover handler uses network errors for HTTPS responses as the signal to detect reachability issues with the domain. The fundamental challenge when designing the failover handler was distinguishing between errors on the user’s end due to mobile connectivity failures and errors on our end due to edge infrastructure unavailability or unreachability.&nbsp; This problem is further exacerbated due to the high usage of cellular/ LTE networks for Uber’s applications, especially at global scale. Mobile networks are </span><a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/00aa/a84be127c04a21b5f5f8dc5d2426921654e2.pdf"><span>less reliable and stable</span></a><span> than their wired counterparts, prone to intermittent failures, connectivity issues, and congestion.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Receiving temporary DNS errors or QUIC/ TCP connection timeouts for our primary domain (domain-name for the edge servers hosted within cloud regions) does not necessarily mean that it is unavailable; in most cases, this failure is actually due to an intermittent loss in connectivity. Imagine, for instance, going into a tunnel and losing mobile service. In such a scenario, switching the domain from a primary domain to a back-up domain does not help and may result in </span><i><span>lower</span></i><span> performance once connectivity recovers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>Round robin-based failover handler</span></h3>
<p><span>A few straight-foward solutions we tested failed to address this challenge effectively. An earlier iteration of our failover handler used a round robin-based system configured with a list of domains. The first domain was the primary domain that provided the best possible performance. The primary domain was followed by back-up domains, typically Uber’s managed data-center servers, to ensure ability to fallback when the primary domain is unavailable. On receiving a specific network error—DNS errors, timeouts, TCP/TLS errors, and so on—the system switched the domain to the next in the list for all subsequent HTTPS requests.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>While this round robin solution met our availability requirements, it had a few drawbacks regarding performance:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Aggressive host switches:</b><span> A few intermittent network errors cause the system to switch domains. Excessive switching across domains may result in unnecessary DNS lookups and connection setups causing additional delays.</span></li>
<li><b>Substantial requests routed to non-performant domains</b><span>: In the event of network errors, the system settles on one of the domains in the list with equal probability after the network recovers. We saw significant sessions settle on the lower-performing back-up domains, despite the primary domain being available. The system would only transition back to the primary domain following another round of network errors.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span>Threshold-based failover handler</span></h3>
<p><span>To avoid excessive domain switching, we also experimented with a threshold-based failover handler. Instead of triggering failover based on a single network error, the threshold-based solution switches domains only after encountering a minimum number of network errors.&nbsp; However, it proved hard to find a threshold value that worked efficiently across different applications, regions, and network types (LTE, WiFi etc.). Setting the value too low caused unnecessary switching, but setting it too high delayed recovery in scenarios where the primary domains were actually unavailable. Besides, this system did not completely solve the drawbacks of the previous approach.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>Edge-driven failover handling</span></h3>
<p><span>Uber’s edge infrastructure has automated recovery mechanisms to mitigate domain failures, such as DNS re-mapping. In this situation, excessive errors on our primary domain triggers a reconfiguration of the domain-name to IP address mapping for the affected domain. DNS propagation is not instantaneous though, since the revised mapping must propagate across all DNS nameservers globally.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Oftentimes, the unreachability of the primary domain is also limited to a small region, a city, or a specific mobile carrier, and cannot be effectively mitigated by DNS mapping updates alone. Mobile apps have a better context of the connectivity conditions and can react in real-time. Hence, we determined that a device-local failover handler is necessary to ensure connectivity in addition to our edge-driven failover handling mechanisms.</span></p>

<h2><span>Failover handler design</span></h2>

<p>A year ago I started working on a set of projects that requires accessing data from a huge legacy database. There was a decision to use <a href="https://github.com/StackExchange/Dapper">Dapper</a> to facilitate database access code. For those of you who are not familiar with Dapper, it’s a set of extension methods to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.data.idbconnection?view=netcore-3.1">IDbConnection</a>, which allows to easily map C# object to SQL query parameters, as well as SQL query result to C# objects. I was quite skeptical to use a library that requires writing <code>SQL queries</code> directly in the C# code, because I got used to relying always on ORMs (<code>NHibernate</code> in particular). Throughout the year, <code>Dapper</code> has proven to be the right tool for the job. In the meantime, I also discovered a couple of features and tricks that allow me to write quite concise and easy to maintain database access code, and I think it’s worth sharing them here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Key Takeaways:</p>

<ul>
<li>Always define aliases in SQL queries using <code>nameof()</code> operator</li>
<li>Use C# consts and enums in SQL queries instead of magic numbers</li>
<li>Use <code>FOR JSON PATH</code> to simplify fetching complex objects from database</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="resilient-to-refactoring">Resilient to refactoring<a href="#resilient-to-refactoring" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a> </h2>

<p>Dapper allows to easily map SQL query results to C# objects based on the naming convention. There’s no problem if the database table columns’ names match object fields’ name - if there’s a discrepancy, you can deal with it by adding aliases:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT 
    UserID AS [Id], 
    UserName AS [Name]
FROM 
    Users
</code></pre>

<p>However, the naming convention approach is fragile to rename refactoring. Changing the object field’s name will break your code and it can be hard to detect without an appropriate test suite. Fortunately, there’s a way to shorten this feedback loop and solve this issue in the design time. We can make our code more resilient by defining aliases using <code>string interpolation</code> and <code>nameof()</code> operator:</p>

<pre><code>private static readonly string GetUsersListQuery = @$"
SELECT 
    UserID AS [{nameof(UserDBO.Id)}], 
    UserName AS [{nameof(UserDBO.Name)}]
FROM 
    Users
"
</code></pre>

<p>This not only takes away the threat of breaking the code while renaming <code>DBO</code> fields but also gives better discoverability and navigability in the code. Using <code>find usage</code> option, we can also find where a given field is used in the SQL queries. And there’s no performance penalty because the compiler can evaluate this string interpolation during the compilation, because all of the parameters are const. You can verify it by yourself with this <a href="https://sharplab.io/#v2:EYLgZgpghgLgrgJwgZwLQAdYwggdsgZgB8ABAJgEYBYAKHIAIBVZHAEQCEB5Wgb1voH0SBegEtcMegEkAJvR70A5hBgBueizX0Avv0HCxE+gDkoAWwjylK9ZvW6aD2gYYAlCOgD2yUTE8IAT3k9enQEUQA3WEsSCgA2eiQoGU9cABsg2IAGegBxFWYcZAAZUWQYAEU4HCCAXiESABIAIloAZQBRYo6AYQAVehCmFgQpVnoAQTb6AG0eXHMITzAACkKEDk4AOlkASm0AXQAaQZpBYZxTC0npuYWLZbWRza2riH2D2gAxV04AWVO53WyFozVUtG0QA">Sharplab.io example</a></p>

<p>But what if we want to get the result of the string interpolation without the need to run the whole program in debug mode? This is often needed when there’s a bug in the query and we want to copy it and test in the <code>Management Studio</code>. This can be easily archived with <code>Immediate window</code> - yes, that’s right, you can use <code>Immediate window</code> to evaluate the code in the design time. To evaluate the string, just enter fully qualified field name that holds the query into the <code>Immediate window</code>:</p>

<p><img src="https://cezarypiatek.github.io/post/dapper-tips-and-tricks/evaluated_string_interpolation.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Unfortunately, the output is not well-formatted and contains additional characters for line endings. We can fix it by adding <code>nq</code> (no quote) suffix:</p>

<p><img src="https://cezarypiatek.github.io/post/dapper-tips-and-tricks/evaluated_string_interpolation_with_nq.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>If you are using <code>Resharper</code> then you can avoid typing long <code>FQN</code> and copy it with a special option for this purpose:</p>

<p><img src="https://cezarypiatek.github.io/post/dapper-tips-and-tricks/resharper_copy_FQN.jpg" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="no-magic-numbers">No magic numbers<a href="#no-magic-numbers" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a> </h2>

<p>Sometimes there is a need to use some sort of constant values in the SQL query (especially in the conditions). Queries with those cryptic values are very hard to review or even can cause a problem with understanding for the author himself after a while:</p>

<pre><code>public class Repository {
   private static readonly string GetActiveUsersListQuery = @$"
SELECT 
    UserID, 
    UserName
FROM 
    Users
WHERE
    UserType = 135
";
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is a classical example of well known code smell called <code>magic numbers</code>. We can solve this problem again with string interpolation. <strong>It’s tempting to introduce an enum that represents a set of available values but unfortunately using an enum as a parameter for the interpolated string will prevent the compiler from evaluating expression during the compilation. The evaluation will occur in the runtime and will result in creating a new string in the memory whenever the code is executed.</strong> This can hurt the application performance especially when you define SQL queries as local variables. You can check it on this <a href="https://sharplab.io/#v2:EYLgZgpghgLgrgJwgZwLQAdYwggdsgZgB8ABAJgEYBYAKHIAIBVZHAEQCEB5Wgb1voH0SBegEtcMegEkAJvR70A5hBgBueizX0Avv0HCxE+gDkoAWwjylK9ZvW6ag+rQe0IuOGaYsEAFQCe6BC8egIAggDGMKIAbpYAvPQUBACsADSh0rhQUbEJSQQAbC60tAYMAEoQ6AD2yKIwNQj+8qHoCLGwliQUhfRIUDI1uAA2LT0ADPQA4irMOMgAMqLIMACKcDgtiSQkACQARLQAygCii6cAwr7OjoLzCFKsabdOD6YWtABiFZwAsq97j5kLQAOoACVOFVOmQeASC9ESPDhgQgADpItE4g4DqoXEA">Sharplab.io example</a> If you need to keep strings with SQL queries as local variables then it’s better to define those magic values as const:</p>

<pre><code>public class Repository {
    
    static class UserType
    {
        public const string Active = "135";
        public const string Inactive = "136";
    }
    
   private static readonly string GetActiveUsersListQuery = @$"
SELECT 
    UserID, 
    UserName
FROM 
    Users
WHERE
    UserType = {UserType.Active}
";
}
</code></pre>

<p>Those constants must be a string type even if they are numeric values, otherwise the compiler generates invocation of <code>System.String.Format()</code> instead of creating a single string.</p>

<h2 id="bridge-the-gap-between-relational-and-object-oriented-models">Bridge the gap between relational and object-oriented models<a href="#bridge-the-gap-between-relational-and-object-oriented-models" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a> </h2>

<p>Very often posts advertising micro ORMs present fairly simple examples where database data structures match almost 1-1 the C# structures. However, the reality is quite different and the discrepancy between relational and object-oriented model might be expensive and result with a large amount of code responsible for fetching and transforming data.</p>

<pre><code>public class User
{
    public int Id {get; set;}
    public string FirstName { get; set; }
    public string LastName { get; set; }
    public Address MainAddress { get; set; }
}

public class Address
{
    public string City { get; set; }
    public string ZipCode { get; set; }
    public string Street { get; set; }
    public string FlatNo { get; set; }
    public string BuildingNo { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>In order to fetch complete user data we can use one of the following approaches:</p>

<p>We can introduce some sort of intermediate type for fetching a result of the SQL query and then map it to the destination type in the memory. I call those intermediate types <code>DBO - DataBase Object</code>:</p>

<pre><code>public class UserDBO
{
    public int Id {get; set;}
    public string FirstName { get;  }
    public string LastName { get; private set; }
    public string City { get; set; }
    public string ZipCode { get; set; }
    public string Street { get; set; }
    public string FlatNo { get; set; }
    public string BuildingNo { get; set; }
}

public class UserRepository
{
    static readonly string GetAllUserDataSqlQuery = ""; /*TODO: Here comes query for fetching user basic data*/
    
    public async Task&lt;User&gt; GetUser(IDbConnection connection, int id)
    {
        var userDBO = await connection.QueryFirstOrDefaultAsync&lt;UserDBO&gt;(GetAllUserDataSqlQuery, new {UserId = id});
        if(userDBO == null)
        {
            return null;
        }
        return new User
        {
            Id = userDBO.Id,
            FirstName = userDBO.FirstName,
            LastName = userDBO.LastName,
            //TODO: If the address is optional then we should check if all attributes are not empty before creating an instance of Address
            MainAddress = new Address
            {
                City = userDBO.City,
                ZipCode = userDBO.ZipCode,
                Street = userDBO.Street,
                FlatNo = userDBO.FlatNo,
                BuildingNo = userDBO.BuildingNo
            }
        };
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This solution has several disadvantages:</p>

<ul>
<li>It requires an intermediate DBO type.</li>
<li>It requires additional mapping code to adjust fetched data to the desired structure</li>
<li>If we change the relation between User and Address from one-to-one to one-to-many, it will result in data duplication.</li>
</ul>

<p>Another option is to fetch direct attributes (Id, FirstName, LastName) with one query, fetch address data with another one and merge user with address in memory:</p>

<pre><code>public class UserRepository
{
    static readonly string GetUserBasicDataSqlQuery = ""; /*TODO: Here comes query for fetching user basic data*/
    static readonly string GetAddressDataSqlQuery = ""; /*TODO: Here comes query for fetching address data*/

    public async Task&lt;User&gt; GetUser(IDbConnection connection, int id)
    {
        var user = await connection.QueryFirstOrDefaultAsync&lt;User&gt;(GetUserBasicDataSqlQuery, new {UserId = id});
        if(user == null)
        {
            return null;
        }
        user.MainAddress = await connection.QueryFirstOrDefaultAsync&lt;Address&gt;(GetAddressDataSqlQuery, new {UserId = id});
        return user;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This approach requires two calls to a database, but it can be reduced by merging those two queries into a single string and executing it with <code>SqlMapper.GridReader</code>:</p>

<pre><code>public class UserRepository
{
    static readonly string GetUserBasicDataSqlQuery = ""; /*TODO: Here comes query for fetching user basic data*/
    static readonly string GetAddressDataSqlQuery = ""; /*TODO: Here comes query for fetching address data*/

     static readonly string GetUserCompleteDataSqlQuery = @$"
        -- Fetch user basic data
        {GetUserBasicDataSqlQuery};
        -- Fetch address data
        {GetAddressDataSqlQuery};
    ";    

    public async Task&lt;User&gt; GetUser(IDbConnection connection, int id)
    {
        using var gridReader = await connection.QueryMultipleAsync(GetUserCompleteDataSqlQuery, new { UserId = id });
        var user = await gridReader.ReadFirstOrDefaultAsync&lt;User&gt;();
        if (user == null)
        {
            return null;
        }

        user.MainAddress = await gridReader.ReadFirstOrDefaultAsync&lt;Address&gt;();
        return user;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Looks like this solution is much cleaner and requires less code than the option with the intermediate DBO object, but things can get really messy when we want to fetch data for more than one user and the relation between user and address is one-to-many:</p>

<pre><code>public async Task&lt;IReadOnlyCollection&lt;User&gt;&gt; GetAllUsers(IDbConnection connection)
{
    using var gridReader = await connection.QueryMultipleAsync(GetUserCompleteDataSqlQuery);
    var users = …</code></pre></article></div>

  <h2>How it works</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><span></span> The app uses Bluetooth to exchange random codes with nearby phones.</li>
    <li><span></span> Every day, it checks a list of random codes from people who tell the app they tested positive.</li>
    <li><span></span> If you've been near one of those codes in the past 14 days, you'll get a notification.</li>
  </ul>

    <h2>More about how COVID Alert works</h2>
    <p>The app runs in the background and will not interrupt your activities.</p>
    <p>Whenever you're near someone else with COVID Alert, both phones exchange random codes every 5 minutes.</p>
    <p>The random codes change often and cannot be used to identify you.</p>
    
    <p><img src="https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/phac-aspc/images/services/diseases-maladies/coronavirus-disease-covid-19/covid-alert/how-comment2.png" alt=""></p>
    <h3>What's an exposure?</h3>
    <p>The app estimates how near people are by the strength of Bluetooth signals.</p>
    <p>If you're closer than 2 metres for more than 15 minutes, the app will record an exposure.</p>
    
    <p><img src="https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/phac-aspc/images/services/diseases-maladies/coronavirus-disease-covid-19/covid-alert/how-comment3.png" alt=""></p>
    <h3>Getting a positive test</h3>
    <p>If someone with the app is diagnosed with COVID-19, they can choose to upload the random codes their phone sent. The codes go into a central server.</p>
    <p>The server only gets the codes. It does not get any information about the person.</p>
    
    <p><img src="https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/phac-aspc/images/services/diseases-maladies/coronavirus-disease-covid-19/covid-alert/how-comment4.png" alt=""></p>
    <h3>Looking for exposures</h3>
    <p>Every day, whenever it has an Internet connection, your phone will get a list of the random codes from people who reported a diagnosis.</p>
    <p>If it finds codes that match, the app notifies you that you've been exposed and explains what to do next.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<small>2020-08-03</small><!-- RSS:2020-08-03T07:25:00Z -->
<p>I've been very surprised and delighted over a number of years now by Microsoft's strong efforts in open
    source. I understand the skeptics, I was on Slashdot when they tried to sue Linux out of existence and I think only
    time will tell. I figure MS contributing is better than them hunting Linux distributions for sport. So I was mostly
    onboard for Microsofts efforts and I've especially found Visual Studio Code useful.</p>
<p>To settle a few things. When I tweeted on this subject I only got the response that I should use vim. Thanks. Great.
    I can and do on use vim. That misses a number of points. Visual Studio Code is an immensely popular editor and
    likely the most common recommendations to new developers. The primary reason I've used Visual Studio Code is
    that it has an incredibly compelling solution for remote pairing in the form of LiveShare. I've used that for a
    while with great success mentoring, coaching and generally working with other developers of varying experience and
    editor preferences. Most programmers can handle a "normal" editor like VS Code while something like Emacs
    or Vim depends a lot more on what they've learned.</p>
<p>I also ended up enjoying the Remote series of extensions for developing effectively inside remote servers or local
    containers.</p>
<h2>These things are proprietary</h2>
<p>At some point I read a piece of license that said that LiveShare could only be used with the Visual Studio family of
    products. "Huh, that sounds weird, VS Code is open source right?"</p>
<p>Sure enough. VS Code is fully MIT. The binary distribution has a separate license to allow telemetry and protect
    Microsoft trademarks and stuff. Nothing particularly weird, I can't really get worked up about telemetry, I know
    some can. But the extensions.. These extensions are in my book core differentiators that makes VS Code compelling.
    For me it is definitely part of what pushes it beyond the much leaner Sublime (paid, closed source) I was using
    before.</p>
<p>These extensions have a license limiting them and their online service parts to only be used with the Visual Studio
    family of products. This is the <a href="https://microsoftdocs.github.io/live-share/license/eula.html" title="License for LiveShare">license for LiveShare</a> and this is the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/preview-license" title="License for Remote">license for Remote</a>.</p>
<p>For me LiveShare is the most important thing. Google Docs style collaborative code editing, terminal sharing, port
    sharing and a bunch more features. I know Atom had an extension like this, I haven't checked the licensing there
    or tried it recently.</p>
<p>Remote is a very strong extension as well for anyone working on a server over SSH or in a container. It helps by
    installing extensions on the destination to allow language servers and such. I've seen it do terrible things to
    servers sometimes but it is very useful and generally works well.</p>
<p>It makes me uneasy to accept VS Code as an "open" project in any wider meaning of the word when compelling
    features are legally locked to only work inside the family of Visual Studio products. It makes me less certain that
    this isn't the Extend in Embrace, Extend, Extinguish. It also frustrates me that this prevents someone from
    building a compatible plugin for VIM or any other editor. This would be much more powerful if it could be in all the
    IntelliJs as well.</p>
<p>You'll find a repo for <a href="https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/live-share" title="LiveShare on GitHub">LiveShare on GitHub</a> but it is only for documentation and issue tracking. There
    is no code. Same for <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-release" title="Remote on GitHub">Remote</a>.</p>
<h2>The entire marketplace is proprietary</h2>
<p>Some additional salt in this particular wound is that the use of the Marketplace of VS Code extensions is also
    proprietarily licensed. So all these open source developers are shoving their extensions into a competitive
    advantage for one of the world's largest tech firms. And they disallow other uses of the marketplace. Even if
    the letter of open source is followed there is none of the openness, collaborative or community essence that I think
    exemplifies open source and free software projects.</p>
<p>What does this mean in practice? I guess it protects from the competition. Such as the <a href="https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium" title="VS Codium">VS Codium</a> project which provides VS Code
    binaries without the proprietary parts. But also, as a consequence of this, without the Marketplace of extensions.
    There is an open source alternative called <a href="https://open-vsx.org/" title="Open VSX">Open VSX</a>, but since
    it isn't the canonical one it is missing a bunch of extensions and the big Liveshare and Remote ones are still
    not allowed.</p>
<p>This also blocks the <a href="https://github.com/cdr/code-server" title="code-server">code-server editor</a> that
    allows running VS Code in the browser from using it which otherwise would have been perfect for me to do development
    on an iPad Pro. I can still use that but a lot of packages are not in Open VSX.</p>
<h2>What about lock-in?</h2>
<p>Visual Studio Code is marketed with LiveShare and Remote as powerful extensions. VS Code is also marketed as open
    source. It is easy to use the editor, install the extensions and be under the impression that you are using an open
    source software suite where Microsoft simply hosts the peering service for identifying and connecting you and your
    collaborator.</p>
<p>But the peering service is not the only closed part. The extensions are not open source projects as far as I can find
    and they are licensed during distribution in a way that disallows using them with anything but Visual Studio
    products.</p>
<p>This leaves me with a sour taste in my mouth. I wasn't sold on having an Electron-based editor to begin with but
    VS Code was substantially leaner than Atom so I've been mostly accepting it.</p>
<p>If you have good suggestions for strong collaborative development tools that are open source, please let me know at

<p><a href="https://www.autodesk.co.uk/"><img src="http://extranetevolution.com/files/2013/11/autodesk.logo2013.jpg" alt="autodesk logo" width="181" height="31"></a>The recent <a href="https://letters-to-autodesk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open letter to Autodesk</a> from 17 named members of a 25-strong group of leading architects (28 July 2020: <a href="http://extranetevolution.com/2020/07/design-firms-demand-change-at-autodesk/"><em>Design firms demand change at Autodesk</em></a>) has been supported by more firms. They extend the geographical reach of those prepared to publicly criticise the US AEC software vendor over its support for architectural design businesses – many of them heavily reliant upon Autodesk’s Revit design software. An additional 18 practices now stand alongside the original letter’s signatories, bringing the total to 35. A further 10 practices are supportive, but have not gone public. In total, more than 50 firms have therefore backed the group’s grievances.</p>

</ul>
<p>Concerns about some software vendors’ monopolistic positions have also been raised internationally by industry organisations, including the <a href="http://www.fiec.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">European Construction Industry Federation (FIEC</a>).</p>
<h3>FIEC position paper</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.fiec.eu/"><img src="http://extranetevolution.com/files/2020/07/FIEC-logo-300x117.jpg" alt="FIEC logo" width="300" height="117" srcset="http://extranetevolution.com/files/2020/07/FIEC-logo-300x117.jpg 300w, http://extranetevolution.com/files/2020/07/FIEC-logo-160x62.jpg 160w, http://extranetevolution.com/files/2020/07/FIEC-logo.jpg 443w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a>On 24 February 2020, the FIEC published a position paper on the relationship between users and software companies/ editors/ service providers (<em><a href="http://extranetevolution.com/files/2020/07/2020-02-24-FIEC_position_on_software_companies-Final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">download</a></em>). No vendors are named, but, from the similarity of the claims, Autodesk is clearly one of the software providers that FIEC is sufficiently concerned about to urge the European Commission to review competition and data management regulations. Its paper discusses challenges and makes recommendations under four headings:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The dominant position of a few software companies/editors/providers raises major concerns.</strong> – The FIEC urges the European Commission to target competition issues relating to software user contracts</li>
<li><strong>The non-EU origin of these suppliers and their infrastructure is exacerbating the lack of autonomy in software capability in the EU.</strong> – The FIEC says EU software users should be allowed to decide where their data is stored (“EU companies should be able to have their data hosted on EU territory, by EU servers/companies, under EU legislation”), calls for the creation of a secure European Cloud, and says software services “should be required to meet EU standards for interoperability and open access”.</li>
<li><strong>Contracting authorities must remain software-neutral and promote open standards</strong>. – The FIEC calls for enforcement of EU public procurement rules, and urges promotion of open standards for data, protocols and file formats in public procurement.</li>
<li><strong>Rules need to be established for multiple-user-access platforms such as BIM models.</strong> – Similarly, the FIEC urges EU measures aimed at protecting the data owner while ensuring appropriate data access rights for other users.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Autodesk not alone in hosting, US dominance, interoperability issues</h3>
<p>Some of these issues are already familiar. Where project data is hosted has been a concern ever since Software-as-a-Service applications began to be deployed in the 1990s, and as use of construction collaboration platforms expanded in the early 2000s, most leading vendors have responded by creating localised hosting centres to serve different operational regions. Hosting&nbsp; project data in the United States, for example, has been resisted by most clients based in Europe and other parts of the world (eg: the Middle East, southeast Asia, etc; read <em>EE</em> August 2014 post <a href="http://extranetevolution.com/2014/08/no-saas-safe-harbor/"><em>No SaaS ‘Safe Harbor’</em></a>).</p>
<p>Concentration of large portions of the construction software industry through merger and acquisition activity has resulted in an increasingly dominant position for US software giants. By gobbling up strong players in Europe, Australasia and elsewhere, Autodesk, Bentley, Oracle and Trimble have assembled strong AEC software portfolios, while some of the more generic US software providers such as Microsoft and IBM have also developed applications, services and relationships that give them an increasingly strong foothold in the AEC space.</p>
<p>And software interoperability has been a perennial issue that <em>EE</em> has covered since it started in 2005 (eg: <a href="http://extranetevolution.com/2005/09/new_roi_return_/"><em>New ROI: Return on Interoperability</em></a>, September 2005). BuildingSmart (formerly the International Alliance for Interoperability) started out as an Autodesk initiative in the mid-1990s, but, over 25 years later, global shifts towards open standards are still proceeding almost glacially slowly, with Autodesk’s leading BIM authoring product “widely ridiculed” for its IFC import/export capabilities.</p>
<h3>Autodesk responds on key themes</h3>

However, a <a href="https://adsknews.autodesk.com/views/reply-to-open-letter-on-revit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">follow-up blog post by Amy Bunzsel</a> published today (31 July 2020) addresses the main themes, and on openness and interoperability says: “<strong>We continue to invest in supporting IFC</strong> and based on customer feedback we’ve <strong>recently increased development for new industry requirements, focusing on IFCv4 certification</strong>.”</p>
<p>Bunzsel continues:</p>
<p>“Looking to the future, we believe that ways of working will evolve, from the direct modeling of today to outcome-based design driven by analysis…, to the convergence of manufacturing and construction, and that <strong>data needs to be unlocked from native formats and flow more readily throughout Autodesk and non-Autodesk products</strong>.”</p>

<p><strong>This is how the software industry should be working with the construction industry.

<![CDATA[We Love Tailwind]]>

August 2, 2020 | https://formcake.com/blog/why-we-love-tailwind | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://formcake.com/blog/why-we-love-tailwind">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind CSS</a> is a CSS framework of composable HTML utility functions and it's <em>great</em>. It favors markup-heavy design with little-to-nothing in the way of stylesheets.</p>
<p>Here's an example of it in action - our link styling.</p>
<p>This is what the markup looks like:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;a class="c-link" href="/blog"&gt;Our Blog&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>

<p>Now here's the relevant section of <code>tailwind.css</code>:</p>
<pre><code>.c-link {
    @apply text-primary-highlight;
}

.c-link:hover {
    @apply underline;
}</code></pre>

<p>Simple, concise, powerful - there are so many things that make this and the rest of Tailwind great. Here are a few of them.</p>
<h2 id="standardization-and-theming">Standardization and Theming</h2>
<p>The ability to theme (e.g. <code>text-primary-highlight</code>) gives Tailwind a powerful consistency, but one of its killer realizations of standardization comes in the way it envisions spacing.</p>
<p>With padding (<code>p-1</code>) and margin (<code>m-1</code>) denominated with a simple unit range, available in combinations like padding-top (<code>pt-1</code>), margin top and bottom spacing (<code>my-1</code>), etc, with tailwind you can dedicate yourself to a few common sizes (say 2, 4, 6) use them in a reasonable way, and achieved the desired effect of visual balance. The system obviously depends on you exercising a certain amount of discipline, but it's a big improvement on just shooting from the hip with random space values (<code>12px</code>? <code>1.25rem</code>? Sure). It puts layout in the UI on rails.</p>
<h2 id="composability">Composability</h2>
<p>Because classes in Tailwind can be used together in any combination, you can do things like abstract the design of an element into a component via <code>@apply</code>, (for example, our link component) then add the spacing (e.g. <code>mt-1</code>, <code>p-2</code>, etc) in the individual markup element, separating out the layout and design code.</p>
<h2 id="semantic-value">Semantic Value</h2>
<p>Tailwind does a great job of using consistent structures for classes. Padding, margin, width, height - everything with some kind of space value - uses the same spread of unit values. Tailwind makes it easy to guess what a given utility class <em>should</em> be, given a rational naming system, which just makes you as a developer that much more productive.</p>
<p>This also addresses one of the biggest criticisms of Tailwind, that it's "just another DSL" adding a layer of complexity and buggy cruftiness between you and what should be pure, sweet markup. <em>Why not do this all in straight CSS, wouldn't it be simpler?</em></p>
<p>But because the way the public API in Tailwind is laid out makes it easy to comprehend and make guesses about, there's less you need to straight up memorize, and you become comfortable using it quickly.</p>

<p>One side-effect of making the Tailwind utilities composable is that you get a long "recipe" of all the classes that make up a particular design element. Pair with this with an active community of developers (they love their tools!) and continuing support from the original creators of Tailwind via their new library of paid Tailwind components, <a href="https://tailwindui.com/">Tailwind UI</a> and it's exceedingly easy to use a few community-sourced features as a starter and evolve them to suit your particular needs</p>
<p>Even the design of Tailwind itself is more conducive to community - passing around CSS snippets is awkward. You have to make sure the selectors are applied correctly and the CSS itself put in the right place to make sure that the right rules win out. But with Tailwind, just copy the class string from a given HTML component, add it to yours, and you're done. It makes it much easier to share small, component-level snippets.</p>
<p>These are just some of the reasons we've taken a shine to Tailwind, but the strongest thing we can say in its favor is that it's accelerated our frontend development. Tailwind delivers on its promise to wrap small, essential blocks of design and layout logic into their own standardized, bit-sized HTML classes, and in so doing empower developers to haggle less with their CSS spacing and instead just get on with the business of bootstrapping a prototype quickly.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><blockquote><p>I do hear sometimes from programmers who are kind of sad that they don't have the opportunity to write game engines from scratch like I did and have it matter or make an impact...</p> <p>-John Carmack</p></blockquote> <p>I was definitely a programmer who felt like I'd missed a golden era of opportunity. I didn't <em>really</em> start programming until my 30s. Just like many devs hoping to have an impact on the industry, it's sometimes felt like the golden era has already passed.</p> <p>Surveying the market from a more entreprenurial mindset and looking for a potential niche to fill with a SaaS app (or worse, a social network), the situation appears even more dire! News aggregators have been done and Reddit is thoroughly dominant. The professional social network is done and LinkedIn owns it. Market after market is done. <a href="https://questinglog.com/everything-is-done">Everything in tech is done.</a></p> <h2 id="technology-doesn-t-stay-technology"><a href="#technology-doesn-t-stay-technology">#</a> Technology doesn't stay technology</h2> <p>Part of the problem is the word "tech". There are two different—but overlapping—ideas that are both commonly referred to as "tech".</p> <p>By its literal definition, techonology is anything that involves <em>applying scientific knowledge for practical purposes</em>. In a literal sense, we're surrounded by tech. Some, such as the spoon are ancient and others, like the Kinesis keyboard I'm typing on are much newer.</p> <p>But people don't talk about ancient inventions like the fire bow, or Clovis points as "technology", outside of a historical context. Most people don't even call somewhat modern inventions like light bulbs, refrigerators or microwaves as technology either. When we call something technology, we generally mean something invented recently... <em>or</em> we mean something related to computers.</p> <p>Douglas Adams summed it up into three rules:</p> <ol><li>Anything that is in the world when you’re born is normal and ordinary and is just a natural part of the way the world works.</li> <li>Anything that's invented between when you’re fifteen and thirty-five is new and exciting and revolutionary and you can probably get a career in it.</li> <li>Anything invented after you're thirty-five is against the natural order of things.</li></ol> <p>Having a musician turned firmware hacker and then programmer for an uncle, I'm a bit more optimistic about aging and see the boundary as more about whether a given technology has been widespread for a decade or not.</p> <p>Cassette tapes and microwave ovens used to be fantastic new technologies in the late 60s and early 70s. Now they aren't. DVDs, the web and 3D video games used to be amazing technologies in the 90s. Now they're taken for granted. Smart phones were incredible in the late aughts. Now they're just phones.</p> <h2 id="when-pundits-say-tech-they-generally-mean-computing"><a href="#when-pundits-say-tech-they-generally-mean-computing">#</a> When pundits say "tech" they generally mean computing</h2> <p>The rapid advances in personal computing during the 80s, 90s and early 2000s was nothing short of breathtaking. Computers were gaining new powers every year or two and PCs were deprecating nearly 50% per year! The web took the boom to an exponentially growing number of users. [<a href="#1">1</a>]</p> <p>It's entirely natural that computer software dominated the discussion of technology for a generation. First journalists, and now many of us are referring to everything from web SaaS apps to mobile productivity apps as "tech".[<a href="#2">2</a>] Since the wider meaning of tech hasn't been abandoned, this makes it very easy to conflate the two.</p> <p>But not all technology is computing and not all computing is technology anymore.</p> <h2 id="where-is-the-edge"><a href="#where-is-the-edge">#</a> Where is the edge?</h2> <p>To an ambitious engineer looking for a market opportunity in "tech", things look crowded. Advances in programming languages, frameworks, open source collaboration, dev ops, visual site-building tools and more have made it <em>dramatically</em> easier to create both web apps and mobile apps than it was a decade ago. This has lead to a flood of competition and an increased importance of marketing and other skills an engineer might not have.</p> <p>But web apps aren't (necessarily) tech. They're "tech".</p> <p>But not all is lost for the aspiring engineer.</p> <p>There are newer technologies, closer to the frontier that aren't common in in 2020 but will be in 2030. Some of them are still wide open to people with more learning power than earning power. Bio-tech, blockchain, and VR <em>are</em> tech and the technical challenges to be solved are real. It's a lot harder to ship a product in those areas than to build yet another SaaS targeting small to medium sized businesses. But that's a <em>good</em> thing if technical skills are your strength.</p> <p>For those whose strengths lean more to the marketing, sales or design sides, the B2B SaaS may represent a better goal. This is good for everyone. There's vast landscape for different people with different comparative advantages to find their niches.</p> <h2 id="you-are-not-too-late"><a href="#you-are-not-too-late">#</a> You are not too late</h2> <blockquote><p>...here's where some perspective really helps - I can remember when I was a teenager, I thought I had missed the Golden Age of 8-bit Apple 2 gaming, that I was never going to be Richard Garriott...time went by, and I got to make my own marks in things after that. And, in that time, I also see so many opportunities that have come by.</p> <p>The 90s PC wave was great - I was happy to be there, and I'm glad I took a swing and knocked one out of the park with that. But since then, we've seen mobile games, and web games, and free-to-play games, the Steam revolution...and now virtual reality. And all of these are amazing!</p> <p>So, yeah, the opportunities that I had aren't there for people today - but there are new and better ones. And personally, I'm more excited about these than anything that's come before. So, thank you very much for this honor, but I'm just getting started.</p> <p>-John Carmack (BAFTA acceptance speech)</p></blockquote> <p>The speech John Carmack gave when accepting his BAFTA fellowship filled me more professional optimism than I've felt in quite a while. Even he felt like it was "too late" because of missing all the opportunities of the 80s.</p> <p>In retrospect, that seems crazy. The web was huge and just around the corner.</p> <h3 id="notes"><a href="#notes">#</a> Notes</h3> <p><a name="1">[1]</a> Well more of an S-curve, but it looked exponential then.</p> <div><p><a name="2">[2]</a> As one commenter on HN </p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24034703" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pointed out</a><p>, it's a spectrum.

		<p>The second half of this blog post now lives in video form <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqBMPHFEHKg">here</a></p>
<p>About a week ago I began a deep dive into the internals of Javascript (and similarly ECMAScript). Javascript is pretty whacky, and some people are more comfortable with that whackiness than others, so it took me a while to find explanations that properly satisfied my curiosity. Dmitry Shoshnikov's wonderful <a href="http://dmitrysoshnikov.com/category/ecmascript/">blog post series</a> on ECMAScript connected a lot of dots for me, but I wanted to create one big post that combines everything I've learnt.</p>
<p>What I want to do with this post is to only make claims that I can back up with direct experimental evidence, so I've included plenty of code snippets that you can run yourself. Alright, let's go!</p>
<h2>Variable Scoping</h2>
<p>Your typical variable has three stages in its life:</p>
<ol>
<li>declaration</li>
<li>initialisation</li>
<li>usage</li>
</ol>
<p>When you declare a variable <code>foo</code> you're registering the fact that there is a variable called <code>foo</code> which other places can access. When you initialize <code>foo</code>, you bind it to an actual value. And then the variable can be used by other parts of the code. Here's the typical example:</p>
<pre><code>let x; // declare

x = 1; // initialize

console.log(x); // use</code></pre>
<p>Why separate declaration from initialisation? One reason is to enable recursion. The factorial function, which takes a number like 3 and returns 6 (3 x 2 x 1) can be defined recursively (it calls itself internally). Consider this example in Go where we try to declare and initialize our function at the same time:</p>
<pre><code>factorial := func(n int) int { // declare and initialize `factorial` at the same time
  if n == 1 {
    return 1
  }

  return n * factorial(n-1) // Error: undeclared name: factorial
}</code></pre>
<p>Because we evaluate expressions before assigning them to variables, the compiler attempts to evaluate our function and comes across the <code>factorial</code> variable name and has no idea what it's talking about because it hasn't yet been declared. We need to declare our variable first so that the compiler knows what we're talking about when it comes across the call to <code>factorial</code> inside the function.</p>
<pre><code>var factorial func(int) int // declare `factorial`

factorial = func(n int) int { // initialize `factorial`
  if n == 1 {
    return 1
  }

  return n * factorial(n-1)
}

fmt.Println(factorial(3)) // 6 (i.e. 3 * 2 * 1)</code></pre>
<h3>Hoisting</h3>
<p>Hoisting is a feature of various programming languages where declarations are done ahead of time so that you don't need to worry about doing it yourself. When we say a function has been 'hoisted' we mean its declaration has been pulled up to the top of its scope before any code is executed in that scope. Go has hoisting for top-level functions but not for functions assigned to variables. Javascript has hoisting for all functions:</p>
<pre><code>const factorial = n =&gt; {
  if (n === 1) {
    return 1;
  }

  return n * factorial(n - 1); // no error
};

console.log(factorial(3)); // 6 (i.e. 3 * 2 * 1)</code></pre>
<p>It's worth mentioning that there are different ways of defining functions, and they are hoisted differently. <em>Function declarations</em> are hoisted differently to variables bound to <em>function expressions</em>:</p>
<pre><code>function outer() {
  debugger; // foo: undefined, bar: f bar(n)

  const foo = function(n) { // function expression assigned to a variable
    return n + 1;
  };
  function bar(n) { // function declaration
    return n + 2;
  }

  bar();
  foo();

  debugger; // foo: f(n), bar: f bar(n)
}

outer();</code></pre>
<p><em>I'm wrapping many of these examples in an outer function because behaviour differs at the top level (i.e. the global scope). I'll explain later!</em></p>
<p>If you open up your browser dev tools (<code>cmd+shift+i</code> in Chrome), you'll see our local scope at the first <code>debugger</code> breakpoint:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/0KVyCux.png" alt=""></p>
<p>And here it is at the second breakpoint:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/2Vak1sN.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Though the term 'hoist' typically refers to declarations, we see here that <code>bar</code> (a function declaration) has both its declaration <em>and</em> its initialisation hoisted to the top of <code>outer</code>'s scope, whereas <code>foo</code> (a variable bound to a function expression) only gets its declaration hoisted, meaning it is undefined until it's explicitly initialised.</p>
<p>This might seem strange, but it turns out that in Javascript, all variables (as opposed to function declarations) have their declarations (and not their initialisations) pulled up, whether or not the variables are themselves bound to a function. To demonstrate:</p>
<pre><code>function outer() {
  debugger; // a: undefined, b: undefined, c: undefined

  var a = 1;
  let b = 2;
  const c = 3;

  debugger; // a: 1, b: 2, c: 3
}

outer();</code></pre>
<p>At the first breakpoint:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/cLguLvr.png" alt=""></p>
<p>At the second breakpoint</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/64CDv7K.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In this case, we have <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code> all being declared at the start of the function call, with a value of <code>undefined</code>. It's only later that they are given their 'initial' values.</p>
<h3>Hoisting variables</h3>
<p>Hoisting functions makes sense, as we've seen with the example of our recursive <code>factorial</code> function. But hoisting variables? Why would anybody need that?</p>
<p>Brendan Eich, creator of Javascript, <a href="https://twitter.com/BrendanEich/status/522394590301933568">says</a>:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/I2gveXU.png" alt=""></p>
<p><code>let</code> may help with what?</p>
<p><code>let</code> was introduced in ES6 to solve some of the problems of <code>var</code>. For example, even though variables declared with either <code>let</code> or <code>var</code> are hoisted, <code>var</code> won't raise if you try to access an uninitialised variable:</p>
<pre><code>function outer() {
  console.log(x); // undefined
  var x = 5;
  console.log(x); // 5
}

outer();</code></pre>
<p>Compare this to let:</p>
<pre><code>function outer() {
  console.log(x); // Cannot access 'x' before initialization
  let x = 5;
  console.log(x); // isn't reached
}

outer();</code></pre>
<p>Another benefit of <code>let</code> is that it's scoped to the block rather than the function. For example:</p>
<pre><code>function outer() {
  for (var i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) {
    console.log(i); // 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
  }
  console.log('after loop: ', i); // 5
}

outer();</code></pre>
<p>Here our <code>i</code> variable is declared with <code>var</code> and so it is scoped to the function. This means it's accessible from anywhere in the function. What about if we swap out <code>var</code> for <code>let</code>:</p>
<pre><code>function outer() {
  for (let i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) {
    console.log(i); // 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
  }
  console.log('after loop: ', i); // Uncaught ReferenceError: i is not defined
}

outer();</code></pre>
<p>Now <code>i</code> is only scoped to the <code>for</code> loop's block, meaning once we leave the block, the variable can't be accessed (and in this case its memory is freed up for some other variable to use)</p>
<p>You can also see that var and let are placed on two different scope objects in the debugger despite both lexically appearing in the same block scope:</p>
<pre><code>function outer() {
  if (true) {
    var functionScoped = 1;
    let blockScoped = 2;
    debugger;
  }
}

outer();</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/zSKdDju.png" alt=""></p>
<h2>Execution Contexts</h2>
<p>We've been wrapping all of these examples in <code>outer</code> functions. What happens when we're not in a function and instead we're sitting at the top level of a program?</p>
<pre><code>var aaa = 1;
let bbb = 2;
debugger;</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/rbdbu0s.png" alt=""></p>
<p><code>bbb</code> is scoped to the script (which literally means the script tag in your html) and aaa is scoped to the global object (which will be <code>window</code> if you're in a browser).</p>
<p>How is it even possible that our <code>aaa</code> variable ends up as a property of the global object? To explain this we need to introduce some new concepts. It's about to get intense but I'll be with you the whole way. Let's take a look at this example:</p>
<pre><code>var a = 1;
let b = 2;

function outer() {
  let c = 3;
  var d = 4;

  function inner() {
    let b = 5;
    let c = 6;

    // diagram refers to this point in the code (i.e. outer has been called, which has in turn called inner)

    console.log(a); // 1
    console.log(b); // 5
    console.log(c); // 6
    console.log(d); // 4
  }

  inner();
}

outer();</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/3TkbMu7.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Alright so what's happening in this diagram? On the right we've got a stack of execution contexts. What are they? An execution context is analogous to a stack frame on a call stack. When we call and enter a function a new execution context is created on the call stack to keep track of our state as we execute the function's code.</p>
<p>If we're in <code>inner</code> and we want to log the value of the variable <code>a</code>, we first look at our execution context's lexical environment (shown in green). This contains an environment record for internally storing the locally defined variables. In this case it's a <em>declarative</em> environment record, which just means it stores the variables in an efficient way hidden from the programmer. We can't find our 'a' variable there so we follow the lexical environment's reference to its parent lexical environment, whose environment record also doesn't have an <code>a</code> variable. Next up we arrive at the global execution context's lexical environment, which contains a composite environment record consisting of both a declarative environment record, and the other kind of environment record, the <em>object</em> environment record.</p>
<p>Back in the day, every lexical environment used an object environment record which stored all local variables as properties on a 'binding object' which was just a Plain Old Javascript Object (POJO). Using a POJO to store local variables of a function turns out to be inefficient and also breaks encapsulation, which is to say your local variables could be messed with by Javascript code that could access the binding object. Nowadays everybody agrees storing local variables on an object is a bad idea, but an exception is made for <code>var</code> variables defined in the global execution context (i.e. at the top level of the program) for legacy reasons. That's why <code>b</code>, which is declared with <code>let</code> ends up in the global execution context's declarative environment variable, rather than being stored as a property on the global object like <code>a</code>. Variables stored in the declarative environment record of the global execution context will appear under the 'Script' section of your debugger, but don't be mislead by the name: all scripts share the same global execution context, meaning all scripts share whatever ends up in that <code>Script</code> section.</p>
<p>The main takeaway here is to use let, not var. Even better, use const. <code>const</code> is the same as let but disallows reassigning of variables.</p>
<h2>Static vs Dynamic Scoping</h2>
<p>Okay now that we've talked about how local variables are scoped let's talk about non-local variables. What will this script output?</p>
<pre><code>const x = 1;

const …</code></pre></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

				
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The code for this article is available on my Github [<a href="https://github.com/weigert/TinyEngine/tree/working/examples/11_Voronoi">here</a>].</p>



<p>The other day I had an idea for how one can leverage the power of the GPU to generate voronoi textures.</p>



<p>The idea is to utilize an OpenGL depth test to perform conical intersections by writing the distance-to-centroid to the depth buffer in the fragment shader, with an instanced render.</p>



<p>It turns out this idea was <a href="https://nullprogram.com/blog/2014/06/01/">not entirely new</a>, but my idea is slightly different, so I decided to implement it (using my <a href="https://github.com/weigert/TinyEngine">TinyEngine</a>) to see how performant it was.</p>



<p><strong>Note:</strong> Key changes are a point distribution assumption for performance, a different approach to depth testing, dynamic centroid capabilities due to new OpenGL features (i.e. modern OpenGL) and implementation in C++ / general optimization.</p>



<p>I was positively surprised that it was <em><strong>very performant</strong>.</em> In fact, it was so performant that generating voronoi diagrams <br>at over 60 FPS, for upwards of 2^16 nodes and an image of size 1024×1024 (with limitations!).</p>



<p>In this article, I will explain the general concept, implementation and some potential applications of real-time voronoi texture generation.</p>



<figure><video controls="" src="https://weigert.vsos.ethz.ch/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/voronoi_foam.mp4"></video><figcaption>Voronoi based foam image filter in real-time. The voronoi diagram corresponds to a large cluster of bubbles, which act as a lens.</figcaption></figure>



<h2>Voronoi Diagrams</h2>



<p>A voronoi diagram is uniquely defined by a set of <strong>N</strong> points (“centroids”) in some space (in our case: 2D).</p>



<p>The diagram is an image where each pixel is colored by the index <strong>i</strong> of whatever centroid is nearest. The diagram is thereby essentially a clustering / labeling of pixels to centroids by a distance function.</p>



<figure><img src="https://weigert.vsos.ethz.ch/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/voronoi_diagram.png" alt=""><figcaption>A voronoi diagram. Each region corresponds to the set of pixels for which the centroid in the center is the nearest centroid.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The line between any two regions is the perpendicular bisector of their centroids’ connecting line. This is because positions on the boundary between two regions are equally far away from both centroids, <em>or the value of the distance function to both centroids is equal</em>.</p>



<p>If we picture a 3D plot where we plot the distance to the origin on the z-Axis for each position (x,y), we get a cone.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://weigert.vsos.ethz.ch/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/cone.gif" alt=""></figure></div>



<p>The separation lines between centroids thereby correspond to lines where the two centroids’ cones  intersect (i.e. values are the same), projected onto the 2D plane.</p>



<p>As two cones intersect, one cone passes over the other, i.e. they change their “stacking order”. Looking at the combined intersections from below at a given point, only the lowest cone will be visible, which is the cone with its centroid nearest to that point.</p>



<p>Therefore, coloring all cones and performing a depth-test on their intersections from below yields the voronoi diagram. This concept is exploited on the GPU.</p>



<h3>Generating Voronoi Diagrams</h3>



<p>Given a set of centroids, the task is to either generate the edge and corner information or to generate a labeling image. These two representations are interchangeable for arbitrary resolution images.</p>



<p>Fast algorithms exist for generating the vertex data (such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune%27s_algorithm">Fortune’s Algorithm</a>). Direct vertex data is necessary for certain applications, such as using these diagrams as a mesh or network structure.</p>



<p>For other applications it is sufficient to generate a voronoi texture. Such an approach lends itself well to generation on the GPU. My implementation is explained below.</p>



<h4>GPU Accelerated Texture Approach</h4>



<p>An OpenGL fragment shader will run a certain piece of code for every pixel on screen. Because a voronoi diagram is just a clustering, a simple naive implementation comes to mind:</p>



<ol><li>Pass all centroids to shader in a buffer</li><li>Iterate over all centroids, find nearest index</li><li>Set pixel color based on index</li></ol>



<p>Iteration over all centroids in the fragment shader is very slow, particularly when the image becomes large and a high number of centroids is used. This doesn’t scale well.</p>



<p>Instead, it is possible to utilize the built-in depth-test to perform the cone intersections that give the diagram:</p>



<ol><li>Instance render a quad <strong>N</strong> times, passing centroid <strong>i</strong></li><li>Color the entire quad uniformly according to <strong>i</strong></li><li>Write the distance to centroid to the depth buffer</li></ol>



<p>The resulting depth test then performs the intersection by only drawing the portion of all quads which are in the front. We then have our voronoi texture!</p>



<h2>Implementation</h2>



<h3>Voronoi Shader</h3>



<p>The voronoi texture is generated in a single shader program.</p>



<h4>Vertex Shader</h4>



<p>The vertex shader takes a full screen quad and an instanced centroid. Since the entire quad is one color, the color is computed in the vertex shader by converting <strong>gl_InstanceID</strong> into a color. The quad is scaled by <strong>R</strong> and shifted by the centroid (centroid is instance passed!).</p>



<pre><code>#version 330 core
layout (location = 0) in vec2 in_Quad;
layout (location = 2) in vec2 in_Centroid;

out vec2 ex_Quad;
flat out vec3 ex_Color;
out vec2 ex_Centroid;

uniform float R;

vec3 color(int i){
  float r = ((i &gt;&gt;  0) &amp; 0xff)/255.0f;
  float g = ((i &gt;&gt;  8) &amp; 0xff)/255.0f;
  float b = ((i &gt;&gt; 16) &amp; 0xff)/255.0f;
  return vec3(r,g,b);
}

void main(){
  ex_Centroid = in_Centroid;         //Pass Centroid Along
  ex_Color = color(gl_InstanceID);   //Compute Color
  ex_Quad =  R*in_Quad+in_Centroid;  //Shift and Scale
  gl_Position = vec4(ex_Quad, 0.0, 1.0);
}</code></pre>



<p>The quad could theoretically be translated and scaled by a model matrix, by passing a 4×4 float matrix per instance.</p>



<p>Since all regions are drawn as quads with a fixed size (given by the expected particle inter-distance), it is cheaper to pass 2 floats per instance (i.e. the centroid) and a float uniform (the radius) to shift and scale the quads in the vertex shader.</p>



<p>The color is computed in this way so each index has a unique color. With 8-bit color depth, 16 million colors are possible. Color can also be converted back to a unique index later.</p>



<h4>Fragment Shader</h4>



<p>In the fragment shader, we write the distance between the fragment (pixel) <strong>ex_Quad</strong> and the centroid to the depth buffer. To further reduce fragment waste, we discard the quad’s corner fragments (distance test against radius).</p>



<pre><code>#version 330 core

in vec2 ex_Quad;
in vec2 ex_Centroid;
flat in vec3 ex_Color;
out vec4 fragColor;

uniform float R;

uniform bool drawcenter;
uniform int style;

void main(){
  gl_FragDepth = length(ex_Quad-ex_Centroid); //Depth Buffer Write
  if(gl_FragDepth &gt; R) discard; //Make them Round

  if(style == 1) //Draw Depth
    fragColor = vec4(vec3(gl_FragDepth/R), 1.0);
  else           //Draw Labeling Map (Normal Voronoi Texture)
    fragColor = vec4(ex_Color, 1.0);

  if(gl_FragDepth &lt; 0.1*R &amp;&amp; drawcenter) //Draw Centroids
    fragColor = vec4(1.0);
}
</code></pre>



<p>That’s it! The rest of the code is just for adding centroids in the visualization or drawing the depth map instead.</p>



<h4>Fragment Waste</h4>



<p>Rendering a large amount of fragments only to discard them in the depth test is expensive, even if all fragments in an instance are given the same color. This ended up being the key performance factor.</p>



<p>The easiest way to fix this would be to make an assumption about the distribution of distances <strong>R</strong> between points. That way, the size of the quad can be reduced to side-length <strong>2R</strong>.</p>



<p>A poisson disc generates points in a plane with a constraint on the distance between two points (“blue noise”). Such an assumption is justified for many applications, as it is more common for objects or particles to be spaced with uniform distance rather than uniformly in space.</p>



<p>Scaling the quad-size with the distance between samples means that the number of centroids can be scaled quite large without a significant performance penalty</p>



<p>I implemented a poisson disc sampler for generating a set of points in a region, and used this for generating the texture.</p>



<p>Note: My poisson disc sampler is not very good. Sometimes it fails, I don’t know why.</p>



<h2>Results</h2>



<p>The shader generates a label image where each color corresponds uniquely to a centroid. The shader is very fast, so it is possible to update the centroid position every frame and redraw the entire diagram.</p>



<figure><video controls="" src="https://weigert.vsos.ethz.ch/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/voronoi_labeled.mp4"></video><figcaption>Centroids are moved by using their initial position plus an offset computed using Perlin noise. The deep red color is because of the bit ordering in how the color is computed and is arbitrary.</figcaption></figure>



<figure><video controls="" src="https://weigert.vsos.ethz.ch/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/voronoi_depth.mp4"></video><figcaption>The corresponding depth texture. Black means zero, so near to the front = high on the cone.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Recomputing the centroids using the poisson disc is relatively quick, so the number of centroids can also be changed at run-time, with no visible performance penalty.</p>



<figure><video controls="" src="https://weigert.vsos.ethz.ch/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/voronoi_scale.mp4"></video><figcaption>Sorry for the big video.</figcaption></figure>



<p>There are some visual artifacts at the boundary because the poisson disc attempted to fill the space with too few centroids. This could be fixed with a better poisson disc sampler than mine (force in more points at boundary).</p>



<h3>Performance</h3>



<p>The shader performs very well at high resolutions and with high pixel counts. Here is a small amount of data that I generated on my Laptop running this program:</p>



<table><tbody><tr><td>Node Number <br>vs. Image Size</td><td>[512×512]</td><td>[768×768]</td><td>[1024×1024]</td></tr><tr><td>2^6</td><td>185 us</td><td>621 us</td><td>642 us</td></tr><tr><td>2^8</td><td>200 us</td><td>603 us</td><td>550 us</td></tr><tr><td>2^10</td><td>151 us</td><td>580 us</td><td>612 us</td></tr><tr><td>2^12</td><td>104 us</td><td>250 us</td><td>482 us</td></tr><tr><td>2^14</td><td>480 us</td><td>103 us</td><td>283 us</td></tr><tr><td>2^16</td><td>520 us</td><td>122 us</td><td>529 us</td></tr></tbody></table>



<p><strong>Note:</strong> I benchmarked specifically the part where I render using the voronoi shader. I applied glFlush() afterwards to guarantee an accurate timing. The values were consistent across different seedings of points. I have a laptop with an integrated GPU.</p>



<p>Interestingly, as the number of centroids rises, the program can actually become faster!</p>



<p>This tells me that the program <strong>does not care</strong> about the instancing, but cares very much about what is going on in the fragment shader, because we are drawing smaller quads.</p>



<p>Otherwise it is hard for me to detect any patterns, except that there clearly is some <em><strong>cache magic</strong></em> going on.</p>







<p>Still: The shader is capable of generating a high resolution voronoi texture consistently in under a millisecond. This makes it <em>very feasible</em> for real-time applications and integration into other problems in the form of a shader. Nice.</p>

<p>Austin-based Volusion LLC has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the Southern District of Texas. Volusion is a provider of cloud-hosted online stores for small and medium-sized businesses. However, in late 2019, hackers compromised the Google cloud infrastructure of the company and stole 239,000 credit card records. The hackers <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-get-16-million-for-card-data-from-breached-online-shops/">sold the stolen credit cards for at least $1.6 million.</a></p>

<p>Volusion was founded by Kevin Sproles in 1999 when he was 16 years old. He returned to the company in 2015 as CEO, though he stepped down from that role in August 2019, shortly before the breach took place.</p>
<p>Mr Sproles still owns 88% of the equity. Main Street Capital, a Houston-based public company, owns 8% of the equity, which they valued at $12.95 million in their most recent annual report. Main Street also has a further $19.2 million in secured debt and $0.3 million in unsecured debt invested in the company.&nbsp; The other 4% of the equity is owned by another Houston company, HMS Equity Holdings, which also has secured debt outstanding.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://geminiadvisory.io/breached-volusion-card-data-surfaces-in-dark-web/">research report</a> by Gemini, the hackers inserted malicious JavaScript code onto the company’s servers. This was then loaded onto at least 6,589 online stores of customers of Volusion. The malicious code recorded payment card details as it was being entered onto checkout forms. The breach occurred on September 7, 2019 and was discovered on October 8. The stolen card data was put up for sale on the dark web in November.</p>
<p>Tim Stallkamp of Conway MacKenzie has been appointed Chief Restructuring Officer of the company.</p>

<li><p>First <a href="https://formcake.com/blog/stripe-atlas-includes-five-thousand-credits-this-is-what-we-got">we posted an article</a> politely noticing that we hadn't been able to secure the full $5,000 and kinda wondering out loud why.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://formcake.com/blog/the-founders-guide-to-stripe-atlas">Stripe contacted us</a> and explained that the credit amount was more of a lifetime cap and that it was ultimately up to AWS what we got.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We send <em>one more</em> email just 'cause, even though it seems clear AWS only offers $1,000 for bootstrapped startups. The email is simple and amounts to: "Is there any way we could get the full five thousand in credits?"</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Stripe responds to this chain of events with yet another email, this one even kinder and more politely worded.</p>
<section>
Hey David,

<p>Thank you for sharing the details here. It sounds like we should be able to get this sorted out so that you receive the $5K in AWS credits for Stripe Atlas users.  </p>
<p>I believe it may be the case that you applied for AWS credits with a different link than the one shared for Stripe Atlas users to activate. We do not typically see users needing to answer the question regarding funding sources. I did check in with AWS on this and it sounds like they're currently processing your most recent application that you submitted through the Stripe Atlas link. They've let me know that they will email you directly with next steps, which may take up to 4 weeks. </p>
<p>Hopefully this will all soon be sorted! If you do have any questions on this or anything else, please feel free to reach out! I'll check back in a couple weeks on the AWS front, or feel free to share any updates as well!</p>
<p>Warm regards,
Taylor</p>
</section> 

<p>It looks like the funded/bootstrapped question indicated the process had gotten miffed somewhere and <em>Stripe reached out to AWS on our behalf</em> to make sure things got cleared up.</p>
<p>This weekend we saw $5,000 in credits enter our AWS account. Keep in mind that's actually <strong>in addition</strong> to the $1,000 we've already received, bringing out total up to $6,000 in AWS credits through the Stripe Atlas program.</p>
<p>For us this is a big injection. It basically funds our full application operations and lets us play around with putting money elsewhere - or just continuing to build features and mature without any kind of pressure.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>A couple of takeaways from the entire affair.</p>
<h4 id="1-send-that-one-last-email">1. Send that one last email</h4>
<p>Even if it seems like a bit much, or things are settled, just be sure you ask and give the other person a chance to help you in ways you can't predict. A hail mary "Is there anything I'm missing?" can sometimes land.</p>
<h4 id="2-stripe-is-truly-wonderful">2. Stripe is truly wonderful</h4>
<p>Stripe monitored the developer community enough to see our initial posts, proactively reached out to us, and then worked with AWS to ultimately get us a greater-than-even-promised payout. When people say Stripe is a company for developers, they often mean its great API or clear documentation, but this is I think one of the greatest testaments to their dev-first culture.</p>

                                <div><div><p>Lord &amp; Taylor, known for its upscale fashions and&nbsp;extravagant holiday window displays, sought bankruptcy protection from creditors after a turnaround effort faltered amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>

The oldest U.S. department store&nbsp;filed&nbsp;for Chapter 11 protection in Richmond, Virginia, on Sunday and will submit a reorganization plan with the court. The company, founded in Manhattan by two English immigrants in 1826, said it had about US$137.9 million&nbsp;of debt obligations.</p></div>

<div><p>Lord &amp; Taylorâ€™s owner, fashion&nbsp;start-up&nbsp;Le Tote Inc., filed for Chapter 11 along with the retail chain. Le Tote bought the rights to the companyâ€™s stores, brand and e-commerce site from Saks Fifth Avenue owner Hudsonâ€™s Bay Co. for US$71 million last year.</p><p>

The company, with 38 stores and 651 employees as of the filing, joins a burgeoning list of department-store casualties tied to the virus, which turned malls into ghost towns. Former fashion stalwarts like J. Crew Group Inc. and Neiman Marcus Inc. already filed for bankruptcy protection this year.</p></div>

<div><p>Lord &amp; Taylor closed all of its stores temporarily in March as governors ordered residents to shelter in place to combat the spreading virus. In court filings, company officials said they are slowly starting to reopen some stores and have recalled 400 employees.</p><p>

San Francisco-based Le Tote offers fashion-apparel rentals. Executives at the company have planned to cut the number of Lord &amp; Taylor stores and target younger women with luxury try-on studios, beauty subscriptions and rental drop-off points.</p><p>

Under the deal with Hudsonâ€™s Bay, the seller agreed to cover Lord &amp; Taylorâ€™s rent for three years, saving Le Tote $58 million annually. Le Tote said in a court&nbsp;filing&nbsp;Sunday that its companies reported revenue of about US$253.5 million in 2019.</p></div>

<p>The economic body blows wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic pushed Le Tote into putting Lord &amp; Taylor into Chapter 11, Ed Kremer, the companyâ€™s chief restructuring officer, said Monday in court filings.</p>

<p>Le Tote officials were grappling with â€œcarrying the increased expenses associated with the acquisition, as well as the brick-and-mortar assets which were unusable for a substantial period of time,â€� Kremer said in the filings. â€œThese unprecedented market developments, compounded by lower-than-expected financial results, adversely impacted liquidityâ€� and left the retailer drowning in debt, he added.</p>

<p>Le Total officials cut a deal with lenders to allow them access to cash to fund an effort to sell the company and â€œmaximize value for all stakeholders,â€� Kremer added.</p>

<p>The case is Le Tote Inc.,&nbsp;20-33332, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Eastern District of Virginia (Richmond).</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main" role="main"> <article role="article">  <p>Online dating is as old as the internet. It has exploded in popularity in recent years: roughly <a href="https://gallery.mailchimp.com/2506bda6ca9a8b7ce8b3c54b4/files/1a8cc94c-6198-4f3d-b27d-8a6060ed6c5d/Tyro_Dating_Market_Thesis_Final_For_Twitter_Pub_v2.pdf">40% of straight couples now meet online</a>. It has given women more safety and choice as they participate in the dating market, and brought down divorce rates as people date more widely and make better-informed decisions than in the past.</p> <p>However, these benefits are effects of online dating becoming <em>more common</em>, not <em>better</em>. The recipe for online dating itself has been static since the 90s: some pictures, a quick description of yourself and what you’re looking for in a partner, and endless looking through other profiles. No matter whether you’re on Hinge in 2020 or OKCupid in 2005, the structure is the same. Only the volume is different.</p> <p>Disappointingly, innovation in online dating has mostly been marginal. There are hundreds of dating apps, but differences are slim. Some limit the number of daily matches, others force someone to chat first, others yet differ in their question prompts to the users, etc. These are micro-optimizations, but of minimal value because the existing model is generally suboptimal.</p> <p>What’s broken in the current model is that it encourages <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preference_falsification">preference falsification</a>. Normally, preference falsification is very overt – for example, when someone lies to their friends about which political candidate they’re going to vote for. In online dating, it’s subtle – people are usually not actively lying, but they are (often unknowingly) misrepresenting, to themselves and to others, who they are and what they’re looking for.</p> <h3 id="self-misrepresentation">Self-Misrepresentation</h3> <p>People struggle to represent themselves accurately for two core reasons:</p> <ol> <li>Self-knowledge is hard</li> <li>People try to make themselves appear as appealing as possible.</li> </ol> <p>The first point is obvious, though unpleasant: lots of people go through life doing things they hate, or simply killing time. Few manage to ultimately find their passions. I’m sure you’ve met people who were all about <em>Hobby X</em>, until they dropped it one day because it didn’t bring them joy and they were doing it for some other reason. The second point is twisted game theory: people are insecure in themselves, so they try to imagine what the opposite gender might most like to see, and then to ape that.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p> <p>Consequently, dating app profiles are full of wildly wishful descriptions – <em>surfer, investment banker, loves reading, passionate about sunsets</em>. When you meet the real person, it turns out they don’t care about sunsets and put that in purely as a romantic signal, and they’ve been surfing just once a year ago but they’d sure love to try it again. They actually spend 14 hours a day working and the remaining 2 watching <em>King of the Hill</em>, but they can’t write that – what would the other people on the app think? Surely they’re only interested in surfing, sunset-loving, well-read investment bankers.</p> <p>These dating app bios are not just unrealistic to appeal to potential matches, but also as constructions for the users themselves: no-one wants to admit to themselves that they are not living quite the life they aspire to. Thus, when you give them a paintbrush, they paint an idealized version of themselves. Reading is the dead giveaway: barely anyone actually reads books, but virtually everyone says they love reading. What they love is the idea of themselves being well-read. Consequently, a love of reading is an extremely common bio line, even when most people spend less than 1% of the year reading.</p> <h3 id="false-preferences-about-partners">False Preferences about Partners</h3> <p>People also struggle to accurately identify what they’re really looking for in a partner. Again, there are two main reasons:</p> <ol> <li>Filters are necessary on dating apps</li> <li>Knowing who is a good fit for you is another, even harder form of self-knowledge</li> </ol> <p>Because of the enormous number of people on dating apps, having filters is the only way to manage the quantity of potential matches. The trouble is that people usually have only weak priors to base those filters on. This is especially bad for younger people, who haven’t dated very much, and who might even fall to peer pressure dictating who they should date. They filter hard, and consequently never end up dating <em>broadly</em>, which would be the only way to figure out what kinds of people are good fits or not.</p> <p>This leads into the second reason – you try to filter for people who will be good fits, but that’s extremely difficult to know <em>a priori</em>. I’ve been personally surprised by this many times over. Every time I thought I knew <em>exactly</em> what kind of woman I wanted to date, life threw me a curveball and I fell for someone totally outside that box. By the time I was in my mid/late-20s, I learned to filter less: romantic attraction and compatibility was actually very difficult to predict without really getting to know the other person. I learned that common interests didn’t mean much, whereas common <em>attitudes</em> seemed to be the strongest predictor of a fit.</p> <p>But many people in the dating world aren’t having those experiences now. They filter so specifically that they never learn who else might be out there. I’m reminded of an acquaintance of mine – she spent the better part of three years aggressively dating only people more successful than her – and not a single one worked out. I was baffled that at no point did she ever consider whether her “I am only dating CEOs” mantra was the wrong filter.</p> <h3 id="outcomes-and-solutions">Outcomes and Solutions</h3> <p>The dating pool is large and liquid, but the core issue is that individual participants are hard to match because (1) they falsify who they are and (2) they falsify what they want in their partners. This makes it profoundly difficult to generate matches at a better-than-random rate. Both of these issues are fundamentally due to the user having too much choice, both in how they describe themselves and how they choose others. Importantly, these are not really blamable faults of the users, and it’s clear that the current generation of dating apps will not remedy these problems.</p> <p>I am hopeful that the next generation of dating apps will solve this issue by relying more on large-scale, latent data: I am imagining an app where an amalgamation of your Reddit, Spotify, Twitter, Facebook, Google Search, etc. histories know you better than you know yourself – and that can be used to match you perfectly with a partner. I’ve been surprised that I haven’t seen such technology in the wild just yet. Probably the greatest obstacle to building a matching engine leveraging such data is that there isn’t any good training data to use, but I would’ve expected some of the big incumbents to use their datasets for this purpose by this point. We will see.</p>  <hr>  <br> </article> </div></div>]]>

      <p id="1eddbb67-5dd7-4557-bf2a-20c313c87466">My quest for programmable smartwatches lead me to a lot of googling sessions, during which I've discovered <a href="https://banglejs.com/">BangleJS</a>, open source smartwatches programmable with JavaScript.</p>
      
      
      <p id="a3b80dcb-b0c3-4f6a-9c47-ef0346ae1545">Right after the start, my first thoughts were: wow, colorful. The resolution looks good enough. Wait, what's with the weird position of the display?</p>

      <p id="3a71b0b9-1814-47aa-a4b1-1521ffe66566">Watches themselves boasts that you can make your own apps in JavaScript, so lets see how you do that.</p>
      
      <p id="f3b14ff4-8e9a-4997-930e-cd1c21416372">First <em>ouch</em> came when I've tried to pair the watches with my phone, and found out that you need paid third party application to do that. It costs 49kč, which is something like €2, so that's not that bad.</p>

      <p id="2af66c09-7b54-40a2-b285-f9927c9e2b99">So I've downloaded it, paired my phone and watches and found out, that the watches won't receive the notifications, because the app doesn't support that. Lovely.</p>
      <p id="ce6b5ad2-e80a-4618-964d-d63b7eeabf6c">App's layout is super weird:</p>

      <p id="c1e4384d-fa12-41fd-9a6f-8f9e749473e2">It is actually just a web browser with Bluetooth support, so whole "app" is just <a href="https://banglejs.com/apps/">somebody's website</a>. That's actually good, because you can self-host your own marketplace pretty easily.</p>
      <p id="249ac407-6c31-45a8-80df-f0778453daf8">What's not good is that a Bluetooth support is just some basic serial console emulation, which means that Bluetooth upload is really, really slow. I've downloaded an app and the whole process took more than five minutes, failed several times, and I had to keep the app and the phone awake the whole time.</p>
      
      <p id="661f9a14-249d-4278-805b-b47417e06092">The dev environment is again, a web page. <em>Sigh</em>. You have to open <a href="https://www.espruino.com/ide/">https://www.espruino.com/ide/</a> and then connect the app on your phone, which will be able to upload apps to your watches.</p>
      
      <p id="71ce4d60-d53d-4c7a-8834-1ad6d42ede54">There is quite enough <a href="https://www.espruino.com/Bangle.js">tutorials</a> on all kinds of topics:</p>
      <figure id="a6be609f-f782-45ec-beba-cd8da02d78cd">

      </figure>
      <p id="897437ed-33e8-47ce-bbb8-8a4ef4dd31d7">I've been able to create simple application without any problems, I've uploaded it to the watches and everything worked just fine. So this part of the project is quite well done, except for the web IDE, which is obviously just the most basic editor. But it is usable.</p>
      
      <p id="2bb45af3-4640-4cf1-aa7b-04fd5a93bc19">I've decided to upgrade the firmware, because I've found this thread on the forum, from the guy that added experimental support for iPhone notifications:</p>
      <ul id="8627287d-384a-4ec0-a80a-4c581166c91a">
        <li>
          <a href="http://forum.espruino.com/conversations/345949/">http://forum.espruino.com/conversations/345949/</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p id="7df3a393-e3c8-436f-96fc-e9f1969635a9">Whole thing was really nightmarish process that requires you to install another app from Nordic (semiconductor manufacturer) on your phone, then download firmware on the phone and upload it. The upload is of course extremely slow, because it uses the same serial console emulation.</p>
      <p id="64412367-93a1-47ac-839a-9abe55900ba8">I've toyed with the project for several hours, but I couldn't make it work.</p>
      
      <p id="1b1cf268-13a1-42ec-baf9-753a8f5444c0">After a few days of usage, I've decided to sell the watches, because:</p>
      <ol id="9be79562-6724-4559-b732-d647bf67bb98" start="1">
        <li>They are huge. I am big guy, almost exactly 2 meters (~6.5 feet) tall, and they were still huge for my arm.</li>
      </ol>
      <ol id="14be9cad-1de3-4020-8aa4-31638b886e89" start="2">
        <li>They are uncomfortable. I had literally bruises after two days of usage.</li>
      </ol>
      <ol id="14eca968-11f4-48f1-9613-9390fe5c0c9a" start="3">
        <li>The watches couldn't keep time. Quite absurd really, but they diverged by more than ten minutes / day, even after firmware upgrade.</li>
      </ol>
      <ol id="a17ed4b1-8d16-4c25-b6ef-b7201ec572b2" start="4">
        <li>No easy way to make notifications work on iOS / iPhone. It is quite possible that this will get better with time, but my patience run out.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p id="8e00e5e7-9381-4006-addf-443f95c4e8de">The watches are relatively cheap. They are <em>hackable</em>, and you can really change everything. This has its disadvantage in that the community is relatively small, and almost everything is a hack, or in a <em>proof of concept</em> stage of development.</p>
      <p id="55e00f07-08a1-47d1-ad0e-511913d80313">I could probably make an app (or watch face) that would automatically correct the diverged time. I could add some kind of notification support, and integration with calendar and all that standard stuff, all users of smartwatches are used to. Everything is probably fixable, given enough attention and time.</p>
      <p id="b997dcfa-762e-4883-821b-70993572d147">Overall, I've decided that this is not the right project for me, as it is one of those thing, that act like babies; you have to take care of them, feed them, keep informed about them and generally give a lot of attention to them. And I don't have enough time for that.</p>

        <p>
          Lesson learned about all alternative smartwatch project is that the ecosystem matters, and the app for your mobile matters most. Without it, you don't really have smartwatches, you have programmable watches locked out of the rest of your info-sphere.

<p>Here's something for nobody. We've been past this a long while ago now.
OOP is one of those substances that stick to the wall if you throw it.
Writing about it is almost always pointless because
people who should learn refuse to learn,
and everybody else has learnt their lesson.</p>
<p>I review and criticize
<a href="https://medium.com/young-coder/the-case-against-oop-is-wildly-overstated-572eae5ab495">"The Case Against OOP is Wildly Overstated"</a> by Matthew MacDonald.
The article itself references few other posts and I give the same treatment to those.
You may have seen these before:</p>

<li><a href="http://kawagner.blogspot.com/2006/08/oop-is-dead.html">OOP is dead</a> by Karsten Wagner</li>
</ol>
<p><em>I go through the main points of these posts so that you don't need to read them.</em>
<strong>Additionally we'll have</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A peek into Grady Booch's book
from which "4 pillars of OOP" is claimed to originate from.</li>
<li>How the whole <em>OOP is a lauded proglang hack to a record datatype</em>.</li>
<li>Predictable alternative for polymorphism (parametric polymorphism).</li>
<li>Why pattern matching doesn't do dynamic dispatch but is instead a substitute for inheritance.</li>
<li>Misconceptions you might have about types.</li>
<li>Why "no" for multiple dispatch.</li>
<li>How <code>"dog extends animal"</code> is not evil because you got isomorphisms.</li>
<li>Logic programming hidden in sight at Haskell programming language.</li>
<li>Concluding with a methematical explanation why OOP sucks big time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not every weekend you get to see such a jewel in the sewer that's the Internet.
Lets peek in!</p>
<h2>Micro-summaries/reviews of OOP posts</h2>
<p>On each post I'll go through the main points they had to say.
Ilya's post was largest of them all with 27min read,
the second largest was Karsten's post.</p>
<p>I've got my opinions inserted in and the things I pick
up form the basis for subjects that the rest of this post covers.</p>
<h3>The trillion dollar disaster</h3>
<p>Ilya SuzdaInitski makes lot of claims but doesn't bother to present evidence.
He makes that up by doing a lot and lot of claims.
There are plenty of references to popular anti-OOP stuff so it's not a total loss.
Also it's a structured post that's easy to skim unlike the others in this bunch.</p>
<p>The high point in this post is Edsger W. Dijkstra's quote
"Object oriented programs are offered as alternatives to correct ones..."
I chuckled at that one, yeah Dijkstra obsessed over correctness and
I guess I've ended up to doing that as well.</p>
<p><strong>All the claims:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>There's no evidence that OOP is better than plain procedural programming.</li>
<li>Programming paradigms should constrain bad programmers from doing too much damage.</li>
<li>Object oriented programming was supposed to be about messages and actors,
rather than about objects and methods.</li>
<li>OOP fails to keep the complexity because of
shared mutable state, errorneous abstractions and low signal-to-noise ratio.</li>
<li>Shared mutable state is hard to track and causes concurrency issues.</li>
<li>Encapsulation is a trojan horse hiding mutable state.</li>
<li>OOP tries to model the real world as objects and class trees through inheritance.</li>
<li>OOP is difficult to unit test.</li>
<li>Forms heavy dependencies between classes unless
you create interfaces everywhere and then mock them.</li>
<li>Difficult to refactor without tools.</li>
<li>Mentions design patterns, SOLID, dependency injection as band-aids to OOP.</li>
<li>Mentions abstraction, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism
 as four pillars of OOP <em>with intent to refute these</em>.</li>
<li>OOP is popular due to Java.</li>
<li>It's time to move on.</li>
<li>You're already a functional programmer
 and learning functional programming makes you better.</li>
<li>Usual defensive arguments are weak and probably never met a true functional language.</li>
<li>Talks about Law of Demeter as useless under-the-rug-sweep.</li>
<li>People try to discredit anything that claim OOP sucks.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Notable references:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Mentions functional programming and Linus Tolvalds hating on C++ programming.</li>
<li>Alan Kay's famous quote and refers to Erlang as a "pure form" implementation of OOP. </li>
<li>Stevey Yegge's blogpost "Execution in the Kingdom of Nouns".
I prefer the <a href="https://www.eecis.udel.edu/~decker/courses/280f07/paper/KingJava.pdf">PDF version of Yegge's post</a>.
It's criticizing Java programming language for sticking to OOP.
<em>I somehow remembered you could find it from the old <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/">WikiWikiWeb</a> but I didn't find it there. Just thought it might be fun to remember that site.</em></li>
<li>Reference to problem factory. I'm sure this is a reference.
<em>I just don't know this one. Help welcome! Remind me where the problem factory -term originated from? Yes, there's a design pattern called 'factory', I don't ask about that.</em></li>
<li>Reference to Joe Armstrong's "Banana, Gorilla, Jungle" -quote.</li>
<li>Transition from horses to automobiles used as argumentation device.</li>
</ol>
<p>First of all, Alan Kay's remark about classes and objects cannot be used against OOP.
<em>Classes and objects were featured in Simula programming language and it went along from there.</em>
That it was inspired by something potentially better doesn't demerit it.
<em>OOP is a datatype customization feature with an overinflated ego.</em>
It exposes decades old implementation details and makes them a principal model where you do programming.</p>
<p>The conception that you discard shared mutable state
when you stop doing OOP is the thing that keeps people in.
<em>You can do "immutable" OOP and it's not any better!</em></p>
<p><em>Taxonomies and attempts to understand the world through them aren't OOP's problem.</em>
Besides when you pick this up they point out that you're not supposed
to write classes such as a "Car" or a "Banana"
and they're just as wrong as Ilya is wrong claiming the opposite.</p>
<p>OOP was verbose from the beginning and it didn't prevent it from going.
You're supposed to buy stuff with that verbosity so
bickering about "low-signal-to-noise" ratio receives eye rolls only.</p>
<p>They're going to tell you that they're using tools for refactoring
and just declare interfaces everywhere so that it can be unit tested.
IDE refactors the boilerplate code so they don't worry about it.
Interfaces and mocks just everywhere and it is not a problem.</p>
<p><strong>On claims of unit testing and OOP</strong>,
I'm not going to go there much more because I still don't unit test my stuff.
I'm currently not against it. I just don't know about it much.
I find it much easier to formally verify things correct
than to test that they're correct.</p>
<p><strong>OOP precedes Java.</strong>
<em>C++ was raging hot popular object oriented language before Java became popular.</em></p>
<h3>Goodbye, Object Oriented Programming</h3>
<p>Charles Scalfani was "gung-ho to leverage
the benefits of Inheritance, Encapsulation and Polymorphism".
He was disappointed that the planes didn't land to his backyard.</p>
<ol>
<li>Half the post is about the banana-monkey-jungle problem.</li>
<li>Other half is about the fragile base class and contain-and-delegate as a solution to it.</li>
<li>Categorical hierarchies (taxonomies) don't work for programming?</li>
<li>Encapsulation doesn't work because it hides stateful variables.</li>
<li>You don't need object oriented programming for polymoprhism.
Presents interface-based polymorphism as an alternative.</li>
<li>Shills Elm. <em>Lol. (Scalfani's post is from 2006)</em></li>
</ol>
<p>These guys attack the pillars of OOP a lot.
This is why I did look into Grady Booch's book.</p>
<p><em>I guess it'll be also time to talk about these taxonomies and maps.</em>
Is this going to be the programmer equivalent of bees and flowers talk?</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragile_base_class">The fragile base class -problem</a>
seem to be well-covered and settled and has not affected the remaining discussion,
so I didn't cover that one here.
What it's about: Seemingly safe modifications to a base class may
cause the derived classes to malfunction.
The programmer cannot determine whether base class modification is safe
simply by examining the base class in isolation.</p>
<p>He mentions interface-based polymorphism as an alternative
<em>but doesn't say what it is or link to anything!</em></p>
<p><strong>Elm</strong> has become a laughing stock.
They skipped typeclasses in hopes that something better appears.
So far they're still waiting for it and they got full libraries.
They've done plenty of things to make it simple for a beginner
but when it comes to retaining users, LOL.
The language enforces its own best practices and it's getting to your way
by limiting the size of tuples that you can make,
tripping your homogeneous coordinate construction,
and banning <code>undefined/absurd</code> in release.</p>
<p>Here's absurd from Idris, so you get some idea what they prevent in release.</p>
<pre><code>absurd : Uninhabited t =&gt; t -&gt; a</code></pre>
<p>Non-dependent languages don't have this,
but they got <code>undefined</code> for the same purpose.
Elm has this too but it's in debug module and prevents its use in release.
It's very fun to wrap the function into a maybe
and handle it without the maybe monad,
or come up with a placeholder value,
when you know for certain that it's something that
means the program has something very badly wrong if it happens.
Nah, it's <code>Nothing</code>, tells Elm!</p>
<h3>Why OOP is bad</h3>
<p>Konrad Musial tells how he used to be excited about OOP.
He learned about circles and ellipses as objects with properties.
This is a story about struggling to understand OOP.
As an example he throws in a bit of C#.
Glancing at this code, it's not particularly complex
but sprinkled with attributes like this <code>[Serializable]</code> here.</p>
<pre><code>[Serializable]
</code><code>public class SampleClass {}</code></pre>
<p><em>These aren't technically even OOP.</em>
They're C#'s way to give code additional declarations and structure
that can be used for metaprogramming.
It's one of the flagship features of C#,
something you should definitely know how to use if you're going to use that language.</p>
<p>The post is filled with popular anti-OOP quotes and in the end
he tells us he figured it out and went back to doing OOP.
Week or two later he wrote "Why OOP is Awesome".
<em>That you don't understand something doesn't mean it's flawed or bad.</em></p>
<p><em>This one is a prose-formed text and it's not the only.</em>
<em>I struggled to go through these despite them being shortest in the bunch.</em>
It requires that I read the whole text through in at an one throw.
I just recently figured out myself the pieces I was missing to writing
<a href="http://boxbase.org/entries/2020/jul/20/on-how-i-write/">effortlessly skimmable texts</a>.
I don't say that I perfected it but you're reading one text
that's been <em>almost</em> written in this style.</p>
<h3>OOP is dead</h3>
<p>Karsten Wagner thinks OOP reached its peak and is on the decline.
Interest is increasing toward functional programming …</p></article></div>

<h3 id="crud">CRUD?</h3>
<p>Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) are the four basic functions of persistent storage (Database).</p>

<h3 id="why">Why?</h3>
<p>After a failed search for a basic admin panel that not involves writing code or installs web-based solutions, I come with ElectroCRUD idea.</p>

<h3 id="electrocrud-v1">ElectroCRUD v1</h3>
<p>The ElectroCRUD v1 was born in 2016, An Electron application that made it possible to create a friendly dashboard with data tables, search, widgets, filter &amp; relations with few clicks without any experience in programming.</p>

<h3 id="electrocrud-v2">ElectroCRUD v2</h3>
<p>After a few years that the project was inactive, I decided to bring it an alive again. The codebase was build from scratch using Electron+Angular8. The new version contains most of the features of the first version, and new features added on a weekly basis.</p>

<p>From version 2.7.0 SQLite has been added, currently its very limited support but we working on full support for next version.</p>

						<p><b>There is a new e-mail provider in town and it’s an excellent opportunity to have a reasoned conversation about how to improve your e-mail management. I do not believe that decisions around your e-mail provider should be made lightly. Your e-mail address is often the hub of your online presence and your inbox is your sanctuary. Well, at least it could be.</b></p>
<p>First, let me break down why there is this nagging feeling of urgency to sign up for the HEY e-mail service and “be saved”. There are a number of biases in play that could be affecting you:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Authority bias.</b> Basecamp founders are household names in the tech industry, and they also have friends in high places. There is no shortage of prominent advocates who are now buzzing about the HEY e-mail service. This could make the opinions hit closer to your heart.</li>
<li><b>Selective perception.</b> When we favour information that we agree with we may avoid information that could have a negative impact. The ability to choose who can send you e-mail may sound fantastic. So much so that any peripheral concerns about accessibility, lock-in and privacy may pass you by.</li>
<li><b>Scarcity bias.</b> Choosing to initially be invitation-only is a purposeful choice by HEY. It works. Since it targets a human weakness.</li>
<li><b>Bandwagon effect.</b> Many people are talking about it – at least in your circles – and asking for invites. But going along with the crowd, when the choice is not required, can be harmful when it’s not in an individual’s best interest. HEY is not free.</li>
<li><b>Noble-edge effect.</b> Products of caring companies are seen as superior. Basecamp is not just any company. They’ve done a lot of impressive work, often challenge common truthisms and generally contribute in a positive way to concepts of designing and working. This of course does not mean one has to jump when they say jump.</li>
<li><b>Speak-easy effect.</b> Words that are easier to say are more trustworthy and valuable. Hey, I don’t need to explain this one , right?</li>
<li><b>FOMO.</b> Fear of missing out. What if this really is the next big thing? Trust me, then it won’t die.</li>
</ul>
<p>It may truly feel like you need the new shiny thing. And I’ll be honest, when I heard Jason Fried being <a href="https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/vox/recode-decode/e/71072616">interviewed by Kara Swisher on Recode Decode</a>, HEY did sound like the best thing since sliced bread. Kara was noticeably craving for it.</p>
<p>And no one’s wrong to be entranced. The reason many of us are susceptible to the allurement of HEY is because the current state of e-mail really is failing many of us. We live with e-mail that needs fixing. From overload, from disarray, from mass-marketing and more.</p>
<p>But before we decide that HEY is the answer to that fix, I’ll encourage anyone and everyone to stop, reflect and reason. Because getting excited about something before it has proven its worth can too easily led us astray.</p>
<h2 id="A completely new e-mail address">A completely new e-mail address</h2>
<p>Here’s the thing. Signing up for HEY and using it as your main e-mail address really will mean that you have to change your e-mail address. In many places. Or get used to managing yet another e-mail address. While this can solve a lot of things it could also lead to more labor for you.</p>
<ul>
<li>Will you need to maintain two e-mail addresses, and for how long? For many years if you still want that searchable archive.</li>
<li>Will you forward all e-mail from the old account? Then how much have you solved?</li>
<li>Can you migrate all your e-mail from the old account ?-The answer to that is a <a href="https://hey.com/faqs/#can-i-import-my-gmail-outlook-apple-email-into-hey">resounding no</a>. You are starting fresh in this aspect.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re prepared to switch e-mail address to solve your current problems with e-mail, and not bring any old e-mail with you, then you are prepared for some major changes in your e-mail management.</p>
<p>Remember, many reviews of HEY are going to be positive in the beginning. Everyone will have vastly less e-mail and it will naturally feel liberating. The primary reason they will have vastly less e-mail is that they are starting a new e-mail address with zero e-mails. Something that could be achieved with just about any service.</p>
<p>If you’re ready for the big change that a new e-mail address sets in motion, maybe you’re ready for decision-making that helps you seize more control over your inbox, rather than blindly trust another actor to know what’s best for you.</p>
<p>Before I walk you through that decision process, let me share som other facts about HEY that may help you stop and think some more:</p>
<h2 id="Locking your e-mails inside HEY">Locking your e-mails inside HEY</h2>
<blockquote><p>HEY treats email in <a href="https://hey.com/faqs/#can-i-check-my-hey-email-with-my-existing-email-app">all sorts of special ways</a>, so off-the-shelf 3rd party email apps won’t work with HEY.<br>
— <i>from the HEY FAQ</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To use HEY you can only use their app and their website. There is no POP/IMAP access from other e-mail clients. If you ‘ve ever moved between accounts before you’ll remember this as a common way to migrate your e-mail, or reach multiple e-mail accounts from the same app.</p>
<p><em>On a sidenote: To get your e-mail out of HEY, if you don’t like it, they offer MBOX as an export format. And as long as you’ve paid for a first year of service your <a href="http://hey.com/">hey.com</a> e-mail is yours forever to forward wherever you want. So you could pay $99 for the heck of it, if that ’s how you like to, and can, play the game.</em></p>
<p>More importantly, this closed garden means deviating from e-mail standards of structure, protocols and security. This does not have to be bad through-and-through, but should trigger questions around openness and transparency, and a wish to understand more before committing.</p>
<h2 id="Accessibility">Accessibility</h2>
<p>Some e-mail clients <a href="https://uxpajournal.org/usability-evaluation-of-email-applications-by-blind-users/">are better than others</a> when it comes to making content accessible to people with, for example, variations in visual, sensory and auditive perception.&nbsp;Being able to use <a href="http://www.accessibilitycentral.net/accessible%20email%20client%20mozilla%20thunderbird.html">your own client of choice</a> (software or online service) for e-mail can make all the difference between being able to even read it or not. This is one of several reasons the lack of POP and/or IMAP access can pose a huge problem.</p>
<p>All users, regardless of ability, become reliant on the HEY web client and apps. This means they need to cater to many different needs and abilities. And as it turns out, some concerning lapses in accessibility have already been uncovered:</p>
<blockquote><p>So I’m checking out @dhh’s new HEY email service as I’m keen to get away from Gmail and like what they preach about smaller sustainable business. After a few minutes of looking, there is inexcusable accessibility issues that means I won’t recommend it or subscribe. — <a href="https://twitter.com/NickColley/status/1272986177155538946">@NickColley</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When a new tool by design excludes people who are time and time again excluded in society and communities, it’s generally a tool I do not wish to support. Even if I personally could fare well with the service, the way I voice my values is by not supporting tools that reject others – and especially people who are forced into vulnerability by not being listened to enough.</p>
<h2 id="Finding old e-mail">Finding old e-mail</h2>
<p>If you’re anything like me, searching for e-mail with advanced operators is one of the ways I get by with e-mail management and working effectively with e-mail. HEY mentions little about how their search engine helps you do this. Again, remember that their search engine is all you’ve got since you can’t use another e-mail client to access your e-mail.</p>
<h2 id="The rewards of being patient">The rewards of being patient</h2>
<p>HEY does introduce some nifty ideas on threads, subjects lines and notifications. I doubt that these will go unnoticed by other e-mail providers. If proven successful, they will likely be copied in some form. Should this occur, I’ll certainly acknowledge that we have HEY to thank for pushing the envelope.</p>
<p>Some features may already be available with other providers to some extent. In their marketing for the “Reply Later” feature, HEY writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>You often know you need to get back to someone, but you don’t have time <i>right now</i>. Gmail, Outlook, and the rest, force you to come up with kludgy workarounds to deal with this (like marking an email unread so you hopefully remember to deal with it later). <b>That’s ridiculous.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For anyone familiar with Gmail, there is a Snooze feature that allows you to accomplish what “Reply Later” does, and then some. I see people already posting on how much better designed the HEY version is. But hey, the marketing copy wasn’t really true to fact, was it?</p>

<p>Remember you’re looking to make your e-mail work for <b>you</b>. Keep your eye on the goal, we’re getting closer to the checklist.</p>
<h2 id="Getting privacy conscious">Getting privacy conscious</h2>
<p>One valid reason to avoid free Gmail is absolutely to avoid having personal data and attention traded as a product, which is often how you pay when you’re not paying with money. HEY underscores how Google’s email service relies on your data and rightfully emphasises how HEY blocks tracking pixels.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if privacy is a primary reason for you to choose HEY, first have a look at the <a href="https://basecamp.com/about/policies/privacy/hey-subprocessors">sub-processors for the HEY e-mail service</a>. A sub-processor is a data processor who, on behalf of HEY, processes the personal data of customers. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Amazon Web Services. Cloud services provider.</li>
<li>Braintree. Payment processing services.</li>
<li>Google Cloud Platform. Cloud services provider.</li>
<li>Help Scout. Help desk software.</li>
<li>Mailchimp. Email newsletter service.</li>
<li>Sentry. Error reporting software.</li>
<li>TaxJar. Sales tax calculation.</li>
<li>Zapier. Software integration service.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s not a (very) long list, but may feel like a damning one depending on the trust you place in the companies on the list, and how much you wish to support them.</p>
<p>I’m not surprised by the list at all, and I’m sure the data processing agreement between HEY and these companies is by the book. It’s just one of those wake-up calls reminding us all of how many companies choose to build online software today. Relying on a network of third-party platforms is often quicker and more cost-efficient in the short term.</p>
<p><em>Note (update): The number of subprocessors does not necessarily affect privacy. This can all be well-managed, and I trust that it is. But complexity (and thus vulnerability) can increase with the number of dependencies – and for someone wishing to avoid certain companies, knowing where those dependencies lie can be important.</em></p>

August 2, 2020 | https://www.poolmarketing.com/does-google-answer-box-steal-web-traffic/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.poolmarketing.com/does-google-answer-box-steal-web-traffic/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		




<p>In a recent article first posted on Medium, Joe Trusty – CEO of Pool Marketing asked an important question – <a href="https://medium.com/@poolmarketing/google-answer-box-is-eating-all-the-traffic-up-2a24cc516788" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Is Google Answer Box Stealing Web Traffic?</a> <strong>The answer is – unintentionally, yes.</strong> A few years ago, Google Answer Box, and showing up for a featured snippet as a Google Answer was considered a high value target for many SEO’s. Heck, it still is – but right now analytically minded SEO’s everywhere are being forced to re-examine initial findings on the benefits of showing up in this position as it potentially can cause disasterous results on your web traffic.</p>



<h2>Is Google Intentionally Stealing My Web Traffic?</h2>



<p>Absolutely not. It’s an <em>unintentional side effect </em>due to <strong>human nature</strong>. Let’s examine <em>Why Google Answer Box impacts web traffic</em>. Don’t know <a href="https://contentmarketinginstitute.com/2019/03/google-answer-box/#:~:text=What%20is%20Google's%20answer%20box,and%20above%20the%20organic%20results." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">what google box is</a>? Say I was to do a search for something simple that I’ve always wanted to know – “Who is faster Flash or Superman?”. If I type a search query like that into Google they will provide me with an Instant Answer to my question.</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.poolmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/is-google-answer-box-stealing-clicks.gif" alt="This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is is-google-answer-box-stealing-clicks.gif"><figcaption>The highlighted portion demonstrates that this is a <strong>Featured Snippet</strong>. Google is answering the question immediately so that the user will not have to click in order to find the context of the answer being provided by the favorite result it determined best suits the search query.</figcaption></figure>



<h2>Are Google Instant Answers Stealing Clicks?</h2>



<p>Due to the condition of human nature, once we have the information we want – we may not feel compelled to completely explore the issue any further. For instance – if you want to know how to cook an omelet and you ask Google for an Omelet Recipe and Google immediately provides you with a <a href="https://backlinko.com/hub/seo/featured-snippets" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">featured snippet</a> with the information, you may not feel compelled to visit the #1 Search Result for “<strong>What is the best way to cook an omelet?</strong>“.</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.poolmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-2.png" alt="Featured snippets providing all the directions for the recipe."><figcaption>The search query for “what is the best way to cook an omelet” comes with a featured snippet that unwittedly costs the publisher clicks.</figcaption></figure>



<p>This costs publishers potential web traffic and millions of clicks because Google is in effect leveraging the content from the website in order to provide the fastest information possible to the visitor performing the search query.</p>



<h2>Instant Answer = Zero Clicks</h2>



<p>The consumer in effect has been provided an instant answer which results in an anomaly called “<a href="https://searchengineland.com/now-more-50-of-google-searches-end-without-a-click-to-other-content-study-finds-320574" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">zero clicks</a>” where the user doesn’t need to click any further. This isn’t necessarily “<a href="https://themefuse.com/are-google-featured-snippets-stealing-your-traffic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">click stealing</a>” but this inadvertently costs publishers millions of dollars in ad revenue &amp; potential sales because consumers are not clicking through to the website. Hence they are not consuming ads, only content. If Google is leveraging that to hedge the clicks the #1 information provider gets, it is working. The number #2 provider may not always provide the best information though. Hence the scenario presented below.</p>



<h3><strong>I typed in “<a href="https://www.poolcontractor.com/how-much-does-it-cost-to-install-an-inground-pool/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">inground pool prices</a>“.</strong></h3>



<p>The first result that comes up is HomeGuide.com which displays as a featured snippet informing me of the approximate <a href="https://www.poolcontractor.com/how-much-does-it-cost-to-install-an-inground-pool/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cost of an inground pool</a>. The website provides a ton of information and is basically a lead trap for consumers to submit their information where it is sold to advertisers, pretty standard stuff going on here.</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.poolmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/example-of-zero-clicks.png" alt="This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is example-of-zero-clicks.png"><figcaption>Homeguide.com grabs the top spot with a featured result that doesn’t generate as many clicks as the #1 search result below it. An ironic twist in the condition of human nature and how it impacts web traffic.</figcaption></figure>



<p>HomeGuide.com is unable to leverage the clicks for this result however, as it is statistically shown that the 1st position featured snippet does not receive the lions share of search traffic. In fact, it’s the very next listing that does, which is ironic – but not when you understand human nature, and here’s why.</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.poolmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ctr-of-featured-snippets.png" alt="Average CTR of Featured Snippets - Ahrefs - 26% of clicks go to the positon #1 spot when no featured snippet is present. Only 8.6% go to the snippet. 19.6% go to the first search result." width="726" height="603" srcset="https://www.poolmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ctr-of-featured-snippets.png 700w, https://www.poolmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ctr-of-featured-snippets-300x249.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 726px) 100vw, 726px"><figcaption>Ahrefs – 26% of clicks go to the positon #1 spot when no featured snippet is present. Only 8.6% go to the snippet. 19.6% go to the first search result.</figcaption></figure>



<figure><img src="https://www.poolmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/seo-bounce-rate.png" alt="This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is seo-bounce-rate.png"><figcaption>Search volume on “inground pool prices” is around 1.3k with a 46% CTR</figcaption></figure>



<h2>Grabbing The Real #1 Spot Caused A Crazy High Bounce Rate</h2>



<p>The second place result Thursday Pools a fiberglass pool manufacturer, receives the lions share of the clicks in this instance. This is because consumers may not be happy with the answer provided in the Google Featured Snippet for Home Guide. Since <a href="https://medium.com/@poolmarketing/google-answer-box-is-eating-all-the-traffic-up-2a24cc516788" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google Answer Box</a> isn’t presenting Thursday’s answer as well, consumers that still aren’t satisfied with the instant answer they were provided feel <strong>compelled to click</strong> on Thursday Pool’s website.</p>



<figure><img src="https://www.poolmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bounce-rate-for-inground-pools.png" alt="This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is bounce-rate-for-inground-pools.png"><figcaption>Thursday Pools killed it on SEO, but not on retention. A 96% bounce rate indicates that consumers were looking for something else. Not being able to correctly monetize on high value keywords is a problem associated with marketing strategy, not necessarily SEO. Sometimes even the best SEO strategies come with major caveats.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Thursday did an amazing job at writing a great SEO piece to capture this rank. The bounce rate however indicates that consumers just don’t like the page. Sure the content itself was good enough to rank, but upon further examination we can see there is something wrong. High bounce rate could be for a few of the following reasons:</p>



<ol><li>Consumers may want pool prices for <a href="https://www.poolcontractor.com/inground-pools/gunite-pools/">Gunite Pools</a> or <a href="https://www.poolcontractor.com/inground-pools/vinyl-liner-pools/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vinyl Liner pools</a>. Thursday only manufacturers <a href="https://www.poolcontractor.com/inground-pools/fiberglass-pools/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fiberglass pools</a>. The majority of searches are probably <a href="https://www.poolcontractor.com/hiring-a-pool-contractor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">looking for a pool builder</a>.</li><li>A long wordy article not broken up by effective eye catching headlines, graphics, visuals, videos, or other media causes significant eye drain on the user.</li><li>A lack of effective calls to action that prompt the visitor to take another action other than reading an article.</li><li>Inaccurate information – the article is informative but may not offer the <em>precise information</em> the visitor is seeking for their particular geographic location.</li></ol>



<h3>Why going after high value targets isn’t always best in SEO…</h3>



<p>This is not to take a shot at Thursdays overall <a href="https://www.poolmarketing.com/search-engine-marketing/seo-search-engine-optimization/">SEO strategy</a>, which in my book is <em>above average</em> especially in context to other pool builders, manufacturers and lead generation websites vying for the same keyword. Seriously, hats off to whoever wrote that article. It is <a href="https://www.poolmarketing.com/search-engine-marketing/seo-search-engine-optimization/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ranking high in search</a> – but the bounce rate has to be a cause for a few red flags and is a serious indicator that something is off. My estimation is it revolves around the 4 factors I mentioned above.</p>



<p>Google however, is the culprit here in this instance, because inadvertently they’ve presented a <em>fiberglass pool manufacturer</em> for the lions share of the clicks for a generalized topic rather than a Lead Generation portal that sells leads on a marketplace to advertisers nationally. It’s an amusing and ironic twist in how this particular search saga is being played out over this particular keyword.</p>



<h2>Why you should listen to this SEO advice… </h2>



<p>We are the <strong>900 pound gorillas at SEO</strong> and marketing and know best practices, <a href="https://www.poolmarketing.com/pool-marketing/">how to win at SEO</a> and the benefits of putting together a solid SEO strategy. Just to show that we eat our own dog food around here, we’ve SEO’d this article. The information here ranks higher than the 2 articles that were used for source information below it.</p>

<h2>Is Google Stealing Traffic?</h2>



<p>So what is your call, <strong>is Google stealing traffic or not?</strong> We are interested to see what you think, reply in the comments below.</p>



<p>It’s hard to tell how <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://moz.com/blog/optimize-featured-snippets" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google’s Featured Snippet</a> will impact anyone’s overall web strategy. SEO is more about trial and error than fixed and defined rules, heck it has “Optimization” in the acronym and I think alot of people miss that fact. </p>



<p>There are best practices guidelines to follow sure, but it’s more about <em>evaluating how your content performs over time</em>. <strong>Featured snippets </strong>definitely have their benefit. We are not going to sell them short just yet. As a branding tool for positioning they are enormously useful and have their place in SEO.</p>

                <p>In the last two weeks, <a href="https://twitter.com/PeterZaitsev">Peter Zaitsev</a> published a 4-part series on measuring Linux performance on this blog.</p>
<p>His writings cover the 4 main areas where you can spot performance problems on any Linux machine, with practical tips on how to draw the right conclusions. Here are the individual pieces:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ma.ttias.be/how-to-measure-linux-performance-avoiding-most-typical-mistakes-cpu/">Measuring Linux Performance: CPU</a></li>
<li><a href="https://ma.ttias.be/how-to-measure-linux-performance-avoiding-most-typical-mistakes-disk-storage/">Measuring Linux Performance: Disk</a></li>
<li><a href="https://ma.ttias.be/how-to-measure-linux-performance-avoiding-most-typical-mistakes-memory/">Measuring Linux Performance: Memory</a></li>
<li><a href="https://ma.ttias.be/how-to-measure-linux-performance-avoiding-most-typical-mistakes-network/">Measuring Linux Performance: Network</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I found these gave a good overall summary of the things to be on the look-out for whenever you’re troubleshooting slow applications or slow servers.</p>
<p>Hope you enjoyed them!</p>

    <p>Managers are responsible for partnering with reports to grow their career. This growth should be primarily facilitated by the work that is given to the report. This growth should not be primarily facilitated by “extracurriculars.” Let’s dive into some details.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of ways people can grow skill-sets: the work the business needs or extracurriculars. Extracurriculars are things that are not (or are not in service of accomplishing) a priority for the business. Extracurriculars commonly include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Reading a book</li>
  <li>Doing side projects</li>
  <li>Taking an online class</li>
  <li>Going to meetups</li>
  <li>Going to conferences</li>
</ul>

<p>Companies should to the best of their ability support people who want to do these things. However, it’s a common anti-pattern for managers (and reports, and companies) to treat these activities as primary drivers of growth. There’s a couple main reasons why people intuitively lean on extracurriculars when trying to drive growth:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The alternative to extracurriculars is having people take on work that stretches their ability/skill set, which is less efficient for the business. Stated otherwise: extracurriculars are perceived as 0-risk to the business.</li>
  <li>Interests are confused with growth. Instead of finding ways to strategically grow in a role and in the company, people start growth conversations from “what kind of stuff are you interested in?”*</li>
</ul>

<p>Extracurriculars-as-growth has some major problems:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The machinery of the company is not set up to hold you accountable to actual delivery of extracurriculars. Nobody ever got a raise because they read a book. Nobody ever got fired because they didn’t read a book. It’s very common to see  extracurricular tasks in growth plans only to never be followed up on.</li>
  <li>Extracurriculars are usually done off the clock. Companies often don’t make time for people to actually do that work and it’s implicit that the report needs to find time to do both those things and their regular work. Company-driven growth should be done nearly exclusively on the company’s time. Because homework is often not a priority, the company often doesn’t support it being done on the clock, and this - appropriately, obviously - leads to conflict. Expecting homework from an employee isn’t fair.</li>
  <li>Extracurriculars are often interest-based, not growth-based. So the work often doesn’t translate into any meaningful increase in impact at the company.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ok, so extracurriculars-as-growth is bad. Let’s fix it. It’s easy - skills should be grown via work the business needs. The company supports that work and holds people accountable to doing it. That growth will be directly in-line with what the company needs. And growing via that work will also actually deliver impact in a way that gets you rewards.</p>

<p>Like eating your vegetables or daily exercise - it sounds easy, but putting this into practice can be difficult. In fact, getting it done is a major culture shift. You have to build a culture that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Is willing to invest in people at the cost of optimal delivery in the short term.</li>
  <li>Trusts people to fail. The other main anti-pattern is to give people a chance and then pull them out of the critical path the minute they make a mistake.</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>In the past couple of months, folks asked me how I got into product management. While everyone probably wants to hear an overly romanticized story about how this was my passion from an early age, the reality is much funnier - it was an accident. I never had any plan to be in product management, and yet, this is how I built my career. This essay is a story of how I got to be in the role I am today.</p>

<p>The year is 2012. I am a junior at Wichita State University in Wichita, KS, looking for my summer internship. I’ve always aspired to build a career in software engineering - ever since the early days when I first had access to a computer, I wanted to get better at writing code and ultimately work for one of the big companies that make the software the world runs on.</p>

<p>Now, I am dead serious when I say that it’s something that I was really into since the late 90s, when I would come to my parents’ office after school with the goal to drink some tea, grab a snack, and browse programming forums. Back then, for me it was all about the power of Visual Basic 6. No other tool I knew could make graphical user interface (GUI) design as intuitive or easy to fiddle with. I even have photographic proof of my time as an incompetent novice engineer, trying to ask questions from professionals online.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.den.dev/images/postmedia/pm/den-early-days.jpg" alt="Early days of my engineering career"></p>

<p>To give you an idea how serious I was about actually being employed by a large company in the software engineering space, I, once again, am able to summon photographic proof, thanks to my parents taking quite a few absolutely random photos of occasions that probably didn’t warrant a photo. Nonetheless, here I am, in the same parents’ office in Eastern Europe, looking at Microsoft employment information, with another tab open to the now-defunct MSDN Magazine<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.den.dev/images/postmedia/pm/den-looking-at-computer.jpg" alt="Looking at Microsoft employment information on a CRT monitor"></p>

<p>But I digress. Back in my college years, I was very certain that the kind of internship that I wanted to get was one where it will be possible for me to write code. The effort I put into learning the fundamentals of programming should be put to use in an area that is best suitable for that kind of skill. Given my experience with Microsoft folks<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>, I went ahead and started looking for internships at the same company.</p>

<p>I vividly recall that there were three options that I could choose from: software development engineer (SDE), software development engineer in test (SDET, which is no longer a role at Microsoft), and program manager (PM). Thanks to the magic of the Internet Archive, I was able to travel back in time and look at the exact page that led me to make my career decision.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.den.dev/images/postmedia/pm/internship-site.png" alt="Microsoft internship site back in 2012"></p>

<p>On that page, SDE was the primary focus - it was <em>the</em> role to be in if one wanted to create software, but the PM role sounded just as intriguing, even though less emphasized. Up until that point, I never actually formally researched what the role itself entailed, and my mouse cursor was already hovering over the SDE link. Naturally, I clicked on the PM link instead, and started reading the description:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[…] you drive the technical vision, design and implementation of next-generation software solutions. You predict and research how software is used and work closely with Software Development Engineers (SDEs) and Software Development Engineers in Test (SDETs) to ensure our end products exceed those expectations.</p>

<p>You gather customer requirements, write functional specifications and analyze usage cases to represent customers’ needs throughout the development process. You’ll invest your time in partnering with other product teams across Microsoft to drive collaborative solutions. If you love negotiating, evangelizing and empathizing on behalf of our customers, the PM role is for you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I was done reading it, the first thought that popped into my mind was “<em>Well, I haven’t really taken any product management courses in college. Should I have?</em>” The breadth of skills that were needed were <em>kind of</em> aligned with what I knew the basics of, but I also had no idea how to “negotiate and evangelize.” How would I even go about gaining any experience like this as a junior in college? Thinking back, one is likely to have at least a few opportunities for growing those skills during their higher education years, such as joining student organizations (<em>which I did later</em>) or participating in student government, among other things. That did not negate the fact that the path to expertise here was pretty opaque for someone that had no idea what it takes to be a good program/product manager.</p>

<p>And while we are talking about product management - you already noticed that at Microsoft this role is called “<em>Program Manager</em>.” You will see semantics of the title change from company to company, but the core competencies will remain the same. There are also variations of the PM role, such as Technical Program Manager (TPM), and Product Manager - Technical (PM-T), but that is a story for another article.</p>

<p>Before you knew it, I was sending my resume for the role. A couple of days later, I got confirmation that Microsoft was interested in talking to me - the next step was the phone informational. I briefly chatted with my friend Clint<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> - he was super-helpful in outlining some hypothetical scenarios that I needed to prepare for in the interview. All of them revolved around determining my way of thinking. As it turns out, when I was applying for the PM internship, the most important thing that the interviewer was looking at was not my earlier experience, but rather the approach that I am taking to problem solving. I tried to walk through some product management “riddles” that I found online, but come phone interview time, they all flew out of the window.</p>

<p>“<em>So, imagine that you are designing an appliance. What would be the information you would need to be able to determine what to build?</em>” was the first question that I got asked. This was <em>nothing</em> like the riddles that I was preparing myself to answer. I tried to walk through the process and mentioned that I would first do some market research, and try to understand what are the existing market needs. The interviewer and I discussed the ins and outs of how I would go about finding the right customers to talk to, what to do if customers are asking for something that my company was not best suited for, and what would be the steps to start implementing the project. My “zero experience in product management” answers were good enough, so I was moved to the next stage - a couple of days later, I got an email letting me know that I am invited to an on-site interview. Sure enough, a couple of weeks later I was taking a cab from a hotel in Bellevue to the main Redmond campus.</p>

<p>Upon arrival, my recruiting contact handed me the information sheet for the day.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.den.dev/images/postmedia/pm/internship-interview-slip.png" alt="Microsoft internship interview slip"></p>

<p>Nice! Up until that point, I did not know what team I will be interviewing for. Looking at the sheet, it said <strong>WPD</strong>, which was <strong>Windows Phone Division.</strong> That was exciting to me, because at the time I was a Windows Phone Development MVP, and the platform was near and dear to my heart. “<em>I can hit this out of the ballpark,</em>” I thought. I knew so much about Windows Phone, and I was comfortable both discussing the nice and not-so-nice things about the platform, and code around those. In hindsight, I probably wasn’t as much of an expert as I assumed I would be, but the confidence was there nonetheless.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.den.dev/images/postmedia/pm/visitor-pass.png" alt="Microsoft visitor pass"></p>

<p>I step into the building, and the first thing I see on walls around me is a bunch of different Microsoft Office posters. An odd choice for a Windows Phone building, but maybe these folks are just passionate about Office? As I step into the office with my first interviewer, they introduce themselves and start talking about their job. And then it hits me - they do not work on Windows Phone. They work in the Office division. This is going to be a PM interview for Office, and I am not prepared for it at all. I used Office a lot, but off top of my head I was not quite sure how things like its extensibility platform or the web stack worked. Things I wish I knew before the interview.</p>

<p>I am pretty sure that all the interviewers throughout that day could tell that I was nervous. The questions were a mix of behavioral, thinking big, and technical product aspects. I was so nervous, that I barely recall what I discussed during <strong>four different conversations.</strong> The one thing I do remember was that I had to whiteboard a solution to a multiplayer version of a Rubik’s cube. I jotted down how I would use XML to store and pass cube state between machines, and ensure that every player had the other cube represent the true state of their opponent’s toy. The solution needed to be designed to be resilient to network outages and potential manipulation. That was probably the only question where I felt sure that I knew what I was doing - I was used to dealing with the technical stack more so than with the human stack.</p>

<p>The day went well, because my last meeting was the “as appropriate” interview with the Outlook group program manager (GPM), who, and somehow I do remember this, wore cowboy boots to the office. Unlike the previous interviews, he didn’t want to ask me questions, and instead had me ask him questions about his organization, type of work the folks do, and his career path. The conversation was very laid-back, and I felt that I was finally through the hardest part of the process. Around 4PM that day, I walked back to the HR building, and discussed the day with my recruiter. “<em>Thank you for coming, we’ll let you know of the results in a week or so.</em>” At least it was not a no-hire on the spot, I thought.</p>

<p>As I walked out of the building, and was waiting for the shuttle to the hotel, my phone rang. “<em>Hi Den, I just had a brief sync with the team, they would love to extend you an offer for a summer internship as a program manager. What do you think?</em>” This was the moment when I realized - I will be a program manager. While I knew nothing about what it means to be a good PM, at least I had enough of a base that the team thought I was a good fit. “<em>Uh… …</em></p></div></div>

<![CDATA[Measuring and examining TLS 1.3, IPv4, and IPv6 performance]]>

August 2, 2020 | https://nooshu.github.io/blog/2020/07/30/measuring-tls-13-ipv4-ipv6-performance/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://nooshu.github.io/blog/2020/07/30/measuring-tls-13-ipv4-ipv6-performance/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <article role="article" aria-labelledby="postTitle">  <div> <p>Earlier in the year we enabled Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.3 on the Fastly point of presence (POPs) for GOV.UK. Fastly have been gradually rolling out a whole set of improvements to the cache nodes in their POPs. This includes a new <a href="https://h2o.examp1e.net/">h2o</a> TLS architecture, which was required for enabling TLS 1.3. I believe with this upgrade it also paves the way for enabling <a href="https://www.fastly.com/quic-http-3">HTTP/3 &amp; QUIC</a> in the future, which should <a href="https://www.fastly.com/blog/how-http3-and-quic-help-long-tail-connections">improve performance on connections that suffer from high packet loss</a> (e.g. unstable, rural connections). A win-win all round! So assuming you are using a modern browser (and aren’t stuck behind a proxy that forces a TLS downgrade), you should see something like this when you next visit GOV.UK:</p> <figure> <a href="https://nooshu.github.io/images/2020/07/govuk-tls-13.png"> <img loading="lazy" width="864" height="647" src="https://nooshu.github.io/images/2020/07/govuk-tls-13.png" alt="GOV.UK now supports TLS 1.3, as can be seen in the certificate information in Firefox."> </a> </figure> <p>TLS 1.3 is the latest version of the Transport Layer Security cryptographic protocol, and it offers a <a href="https://www.fastly.com/blog/tls13-available">number of improvements</a> over previous versions, including:</p> <ul> <li>improved security by removing insecure or less secure ciphers (as well as insecure features)</li> <li>improved performance due to a reduction in the number of round trips (RTT) to establish a secure connection</li> </ul> <p>Improved security and web performance, sign me up! So when TLS 1.3 was enabled on the UK POPs for GOV.UK on 15th April, I was a little disappointed to not see anything reflected in our synthetic web performance tests in <a href="https://speedcurve.com/">SpeedCurve</a>, as I’d expected to see a change in the Time to First Byte (TTFB) metric. I thought it may be related to <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5077">TLS session resumption</a>, but WebPageTest gives details about this in a pages HTML ‘Raw Details’ tab, and they are all <code>"tls_resumed": "False"</code>. But these results are only from synthetic testing on a limited set of devices and connections, so that’s probably why. I’d guess if we were capturing Real User Monitoring (RUM) data over the same time period, we would have most likely have spotted it. So after reading <a href="https://twitter.com/chendo">Chendo’s</a> blog post <a href="https://chen.do/tls-v1-3-performance-compared-to-tls-v1-2/">TLS 1.3 performance compared to TLS 1.2</a>, it got me thinking: how could I replicate these tests for GOV.UK and verify (purely for my own sake) that TLS 1.3 does in fact offer a web performance improvement for our users. And does IPv4 vs IPv6 have any effect on the results (IPv6 is enabled for GOV.UK). The rest of this blog post goes into how I did this, what was involved and what were the results.</p> <h2 id="ways-of-measuring-connection-time">Ways of measuring connection time</h2> <p>The first step in this process is being able to collect data about the connection timings. There are a few ways of measuring the time taken for TCP connections to be established. Here are a few I looked into:</p> <h3 id="time-command">Time Command</h3> <p>The <code>time</code> command is what Chendo used in the blog post I referred to earlier. The command isn’t specific to timing network activity. In fact it can be used to time any command used on the command line. It’s incredibly simple to use, just prepend <code>time</code> to the command you wish to time:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>time </span>npm <span>-version</span>
<span># output: 0.16s user 0.04s system 109% cpu 0.186 total</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>The above is the output from Zsh: 0.16s CPU time was spent in user mode. 0.04s spent in kernel mode. The task got 109% of the CPU time, and took a total of 0.186 seconds to run. There’s a whole heap of customisations possible which can be seen on the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/time.1.html">commands man-page</a>.</p> <h3 id="curl">cURL</h3> <p><code>curl</code> is used in command lines or scripts to transfer data. It’s open source and pretty much used everywhere, from cars to mobile phones. The number of options available on its <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html">man-page is huge</a>. If you need to transfer data with URLs, then cURL is the tool for you. Thankfully we will only need a very small number of settings: those related to connection timing. <a href="https://twitter.com/josephscott">Joseph Scott</a> wrote an <a href="https://blog.josephscott.org/2011/10/14/timing-details-with-curl/">excellent blog post</a> back in 2011 about how to extract detailed connection timing information using cURL, which can then be used to find things like the TTFB or TLS negotiation time. Joseph has even created a very simple shortcut called <a href="https://github.com/josephscott/shell/blob/master/bin/curlt">curlt</a> that outputs the timing information and response headers for a particular connection.</p> <h3 id="httpstat">HTTPStat</h3> <p><code>httpstat</code> is essentially a visualisation plugin built upon <code>curl</code>. It takes the <code>curl</code> connection timing statistics and visualises them in an easy to digest format. <a href="https://github.com/reorx/httpstat">Very simple to install</a> and also outputs all the response headers too, so a very handy tool for basic debugging.</p> <p>One of the advantages of using cURL on its own is that you have fine-grained control of the output from the command. So for example, if you want to write a large number of results to a file as JSON or a CSV, then this is entirely possible. Given this option, this is the route I decided to take when measuring TLS 1.3 performance.</p> <h2 id="testing-performance">Testing performance</h2> <p>So there were a few specific points I wanted to cover in testing:</p> <ul> <li>what’s the impact of the distance from a user to the server when it comes to latency and TLS negotiation time</li> <li>semi-automate a way to collect a ‘large’ amount of data related to connection metrics</li> <li>could I spot any difference in connection metrics when using IPv6 or IPv4</li> </ul> <p>The last point is only really because my ISP has IPv6 available (and is enabled), as does GOV.UK. So I was just curious if anything could be seen in the resulting data when using IPv6 vs IPv4. Does IPv6 offer web performance advantages? There are a <a href="https://blog.sucuri.net/2016/08/ipv4-vs-ipv6-performance-comparison.html">number</a> of <a href="https://blogs.infoblox.com/ipv6-coe/can-ipv6-really-be-faster-than-ipv4-part-1/">posts</a> out <a href="https://blogs.infoblox.com/ipv6-coe/can-ipv6-really-be-faster-than-ipv4-part-2/">there</a> that <a href="https://teamarin.net/2019/06/25/why-is-ipv6-faster/">compare performance</a>. Some seem to suggest there is, others not.</p> <h3 id="collecting-results">Collecting results</h3> <p>As mentioned before I’m using cURL to capture detailed timing information. I captured a set of data which could then be plotted on a graph for each of the connection scenarios. So lets go through how this is done step by step.</p> <p><strong>Capture a single request / response</strong></p> <p>Using the method Joseph mentions in his <a href="https://blog.josephscott.org/2011/10/14/timing-details-with-curl/">blog post</a>, it is very simple to capture detailed timing information from a URL. Once the <code>curl-format.txt</code> file has been <a href="https://gist.github.com/Nooshu/731f2df621a880d6df3d377cb967ea49">created</a>, run the following command:</p> <div><div><pre><code>curl <span>-w</span> <span>"@curl-format.txt"</span> <span>-o</span> /dev/null <span>-s</span> https://www.gov.uk
</code></pre></div></div> <p>The output gives the response headers, as well as the detailed timing information that looks like this:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>{</span>
	<span>"</span><span>time_namelookup</span><span>"</span><span>:</span>      <span>0.045055</span><span>,</span>
	<span>"</span><span>time_connect</span><span>"</span><span>:</span>         <span>0.058824</span><span>,</span>
	<span>"</span><span>time_appconnect</span><span>"</span><span>:</span>      <span>0.107569</span><span>,</span>
	<span>"</span><span>time_pretransfer</span><span>"</span><span>:</span>     <span>0.109468</span><span>,</span>
	<span>"</span><span>time_redirect</span><span>"</span><span>:</span>        <span>0.000000</span><span>,</span>
	<span>"</span><span>time_starttransfer</span><span>"</span><span>:</span>   <span>0.127577</span><span>,</span>
	<span>"</span><span>time_total</span><span>"</span><span>:</span>           <span>0.130754</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>What do each of these values mean? They are detailed on the <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html">cURL man-page</a>, but I’ve also pulled together a quick visualisation to help you understand it too:</p> <figure> <a href="https://nooshu.github.io/images/2020/07/curl-timings.png"> <img loading="lazy" width="1244" height="678" src="https://nooshu.github.io/images/2020/07/curl-timings.png" alt="Visualisation of the cURL timings metrics"> </a> </figure> <p>It’s important to remember that many of these metrics are relative to the start of the connection, not the end of the previous activity. This is solved with a little simple data manipulation in the spreadsheets (see <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EaBjG9scj1FSbUD9BmXuXrKMQNz1UzR9uPyUvPmT1Ao/edit#gid=326484325">results</a> for more info on this).</p> <p><strong>Capture multiple request/responses over time</strong></p> <p>Now that we can capture a single response from a URL, what about if we wanted to capture timing information over a period of time? This is where a simple bit of shell script comes in handy. Note that the <code>curl_format</code> has been moved into the shell script for ease.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>#!/bin/bash</span>
<span># create `timing-data.sh` and make it executable (chmod +x timing-data.sh)</span>

<span>curl_format</span><span>=</span><span>'{
	"time_dns":      	%{time_namelookup},
	"time_connect":         %{time_connect},
	"time_appconnect":      %{time_appconnect},
	"time_pretransfer":     %{time_pretransfer},
	"time_ttfb":   		%{time_starttransfer},
	"time_total":   		%{time_total}
}'</span>

<span># used as headers for the CSV file</span>
<span>echo</span> <span>'["DNS","Connect","SSL","Wait","TTFB","Total Time"]'</span>

<span>total</span><span>=</span>521

<span>for</span> <span>((</span><span>n</span><span>=</span>0<span>;</span>n&lt;total<span>;</span>n++<span>))</span>
<span>do
	</span>curl <span>-w</span> <span>"</span><span>$curl_format</span><span>"</span> <span>-k</span> <span>--compressed</span> <span>-s</span> <span>-o</span> /dev/null <span>"</span><span>$@</span><span>"</span>
	<span>sleep </span>0.3 <span>#space the timings out slightly</span>
<span>done</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>The above script is used like so:</p> <div><div><pre><code>timing-data.sh https://www.gov.uk <span>--tls-max</span> 1.2
</code></pre></div></div> <p>The script goes off and captures a large number of timing results (in this case 521). I’ve omitted <code>time_redirect</code> from the above script as I know this will always be 0 in my case, but you could leave it in if you are using on a URL with redirects. The above test took approximately 10 minutes to run. Here I’m capping the TLS version to 1.2 (<code>--tls-max 1.2</code>), as this allows us to compare different versions. Without this cap, cURL would use the highest version supported by the server, which is 1.3 for <code>www.gov.uk</code>. So the script above works, but it isn’t capturing the results to a file, or converting it to a format that can be easily imported into a spreadsheet and plotted. It comes out as one huge string of timing info in a JSON object. Time to bring in <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a> is a Swiss army knife for manipulating JSON data on the command line. You can easily transform JSON data into any structure you need:</p> <div><div><pre><code>timing-data.sh https://www.gov.uk <span>--tls-max</span> 1.2 | jq <span>-r</span> <span>'[.[]] | @csv'</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Here I’m taking the JSON output from the cURL response and piping it into <code>jq</code>. I’m then constructing an array made up of each element in the input (the timing values). Then lastly I’m piping the array into the <code>@csv</code> formatter to output the values as a CSV. Once converted to a CSV, the data can be easily imported into a spreadsheet (e.g. Google Sheets) for further manipulation and graphing.</p> <p>Lastly, lets make sure we write all this manipulated data to a file so we can actually use it. A final bit of shell script can do this for us:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span># final script</span>
timing-data.sh https://www.gov.uk <span>--tls-max</span> 1.2 | jq <span>-r</span> <span>'[.[]] | @csv'</span> <span>&gt;</span> output-test-results.csv
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Here we redirect the output to a file. The file is created automatically if it doesn’t exist.</p> <p><strong>Capture multiple locations</strong></p> <p>The script is now capturing a large amount of connection timing data from a URL, but we have no control over the server cURL is looking at to get this data from. As mentioned above, I’d like to see how a servers geographic location (CDN POP) effects TLS and connection negotiation speed. Thankfully cURL comes with a useful <code>--resolve</code> option that allows us to do this:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span># final script</span>
timing-data.sh https://www.gov.uk <span>--resolve</span> www.gov.uk:443:[another_edge_node_ip] <span>--tls-max</span> 1.2 | jq <span>-r</span> <span>'[.[]] | @csv'</span> <span>&gt;</span> output-test-results.csv
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Here we are asking cURL to resolve any secure requests for <code>www.gov.uk</code> to a different IP address. So instead of allowing the CDN to choose the closest geographic location for our request (most likely London for me), we can tell it to request it from elsewhere. For example Sydney, or …</p></div></article></div></div>

customers</p></blockquote><p>This isn’t <em>that</em> clear, so let’s get into more terminology and look at a diagram:</p><h4 id="merchant"><a href="#merchant"></a>Merchant</h4><p>“The Merchant” is a fancy way of saying you, i.e. an online business selling stuff.</p><h4 id="the-issuing-bank-aka-issuer"><a href="#the-issuing-bank-aka-issuer"></a>The issuing bank aka issuer</h4><p>The bank that a customer’s credit/debit card is from - usually a major commercial bank.</p><h4 id="the-acquirer-aka-the-acquiring-bank"><a href="#the-acquirer-aka-the-acquiring-bank"></a>The acquirer aka the acquiring bank</h4><p>The acquiring bank processes payments on your behalf, and offers you what is known as a
<strong>merchant account</strong></p><p>Here’s a diagram of the whole sequence:</p><p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="payment gateway diagram" title="payment sequence" src="https://coursemaker.org/static/ab8773471ad2e5e183237dee79c42ea7/b1001/payment_gateway_diagram.png" srcset="https://coursemaker.org/static/ab8773471ad2e5e183237dee79c42ea7/e4d6b/payment_gateway_diagram.png 345w,https://coursemaker.org/static/ab8773471ad2e5e183237dee79c42ea7/1e043/payment_gateway_diagram.png 690w,https://coursemaker.org/static/ab8773471ad2e5e183237dee79c42ea7/b1001/payment_gateway_diagram.png 1380w,https://coursemaker.org/static/ab8773471ad2e5e183237dee79c42ea7/61583/payment_gateway_diagram.png 1616w" sizes="(max-width: 1380px) 100vw, 1380px" loading="lazy">
    </span></p><p><em>Role of the payment gateway</em></p><p>There is an important distinction between a payment gateway and an acquiring bank (and the
merchant account it provides you with), but for a lot of SaaS companies starting out this is obscured.
For example, Stripe is both a payment gateway <strong>and</strong> a merchant account. Fundamentally, the
payment gateway and the merchant account work together to conduct end-to-end payment processing.
This means that you do not need to have a relationship with merchant banks yourself, nor with credit
card companies like American Express.</p><p>A crucial service that payment gateways offer is taking care of compliance requirements
around payments, notably <a href="https://www.pcicomplianceguide.org/faq/">PCI compliance</a>, which
is notoriously difficult to roll yourself.</p><p>If you’re running a SaaS company, you still have three key issues to consider beyond a payment
gateway:</p><ul><li>Subscription Management</li><li>Recurring Billing</li><li>Sales Tax &amp; Value Added Tax</li></ul><h3 id="subscription-management--recurring-billing"><a href="#subscription-management--recurring-billing"></a>Subscription Management &amp; Recurring Billing</h3><h4 id="subscriptions"><a href="#subscriptions"></a>Subscriptions</h4><p>Subscriptions are the lifeblood of SaaS companies, producing the coveted Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR).
Whilst on the surface they can appear simple, there is a lot of logic involved in managing subscriptions such as:</p><ul><li>Managing trials</li><li>Issuing refunds</li><li>Dunning (a fancy name for retrying failed payments)</li><li>Making changes to ongoing subscriptions</li><li>Canceling</li></ul><p>Many of these areas are crucial to get right for SaaS companies - slick free trials, elegant upgrades,
monitoring churn, and gathering feedback during a cancellation to name a few.</p><h4 id="recurring-billing"><a href="#recurring-billing"></a>Recurring Billing</h4><p>Slightly different from subscription management is <strong>recurring billing</strong>. This is the process that allows
a business to invoice customers on a regular basis.</p><p>To make things more confusing, many payment gateways offer elements of subscription management and recurring
invoicing. For example, the <a href="https://stripe.com/gb/billing">Stripe Billing</a> product works hand-in-hand with
<a href="https://stripe.com/gb/payments">Stripe Payments</a> to offer a robust subscription management solution and a
basic recurring billing capability. However recurring billing can get extremely complex, and as a result
there are a vast array of dedicated SaaS “Subscription Billing &amp; Revenue Operations” companies that aim
to assist with this complexity. We’ll look at some of the key players in a moment.</p><p>In case it wasn’t clear, not all billing systems can handle subscription payments - instead just covering
the basics of a billing system such as managing billing cycles and invoicing. </p><h3 id="sales-tax--value-added-tax"><a href="#sales-tax--value-added-tax"></a>Sales Tax &amp; Value Added Tax</h3><p>Many of the big payment providers provide no assistance when it comes to calculating requirements such as
EU Value Added Tax (EU VAT), US sales tax, and more exotic offerings such as Japan’s “consumption tax”,
or India’s GST. This in turn has resulted in many dedicated companies that provide services such as verifying
that a customer’s IP address and credit card billing details are from the same country (required for EU
VAT calculations). </p><hr><p>If piecing together all these components to form a payment stack sounds like a lot of work to you, you’re
not alone. That explains the final category to highlight: The Merchant of Record.</p><h3 id="merchant-of-record"><a href="#merchant-of-record"></a>Merchant of Record</h3><p>A merchant of record basically does it all for you: They act on your behalf not only
to collect payment (i.e. acting as the payment gateway) but also to calculate the
appropriate tax and crucially to also remit that tax to the appropriate government
for you. In other words, this is a kind of authorized reseller relationship</p><p><span>

a combination of both payment gateway, subscription management + billing, and probably sales tax
compliance. Many of the players we are about to discuss operate a hybrid model where
they offer solutions across the different categories defined above. Each has its
strengths and weaknesses, which we will look into next. Needless to say, the sheer
range of options can be overwhelming. Here is a graphic to give some perspective.</p><p><em>Note: feature/pricing not to scale</em></p><p><span>

<h2 id="the-hunt-for-text-to-speech">The Hunt for Text To Speech</h2>

<p>I have been searching for an offline text to speech library for a while now.  A couple of future side projects I’m considering are a voice assistant and converting ebooks or blog posts into audio so I can listen to them rather than read.</p>

<h3 id="google-cloud-text-to-speech-api">Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API</h3>

<p>Google offers a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech">Text-to-Speech API</a> that is priced at $4 / 1 million characters or $16 / 1 million characters for the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/voices">advanced WaveNet voices</a>.  The variety of voices and languages is impressive, but I was more interested in finding an offline solution, even if it produces lower quality audio.</p>

<h3 id="amazon-polly">Amazon Polly</h3>

<p>Unsurprisingly, Amazon offers an API as well called <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/polly/">Amazon Polly</a>.  The variety of voices appears to be a bit less than Google’s offering and the number of supported languages is also behind.  The pricing is the same as Google’s with a cheaper standard model and a more expensive “neural” model.</p>

<h3 id="espeak">eSpeak</h3>

<p>I figured there would be a fairly simple command line program that would do fairly basic and robotic speech-to-text.  <a href="http://espeak.sourceforge.net/">eSpeak</a> emerged as an option and I gave it a try.  <code>sudo apt-get install espeak</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>espeak "Nothing is impossible, the word itself says, I'm possible! Audrey Hepburn" -w output.wav
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><audio controls="controls">
  <source type="audio/mp3" src="https://www.xyzdigital.com/assets/audio/impossible-quote-espeak.mp3">&lt;/source&gt;
  <p>Your browser does not support the audio element.</p>
</audio></p><p>eSpeak scores some major points for simplicity.  Unfortunately, the speech is quite robotic and annoying to listen to.  I continued my search until I found Mozilla TTS.</p>

<h2 id="mozilla-tts">Mozilla TTS</h2>

<p>I finally stumbled upon <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/TTS">https://github.com/mozilla/TTS</a>, a project that is a part of <a href="https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/en">Mozilla Common Voice</a>.  Mozilla’s mission, “Keep the internet open and accessible to all”, captures what they do well.  It also exemplifies a belief likely held by most software engineers.  With Common Voice, Mozilla is attempting to collect a large publically available dataset of labelled speech.  <a href="http://www.image-net.org/">ImageNet</a> was a similar project <a href="https://qz.com/1034972/the-data-that-changed-the-direction-of-ai-research-and-possibly-the-world/">ignited the development of computer vision models</a> by providing a massive list of labeled images that researchers could freely access.  With a public dataset, it was possible to design these models outside of the major companies (like Google and Amazon) that already had private access to this kind of data.  The Common Voice website makes it easy to either donate your voice or validate others.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-run-mozilla-tts">How to Run Mozilla TTS</h3>

<p>I was surprised to find that the main Readme didn’t really have straightforward instructions for how to run, or even what the end product was when you did finally run it.  Their wiki included some <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/TTS/wiki/Build-instructions-for-server">Build Instructions</a>, but after following them I was unable to get things running because the config file provided did not have all the values set.  After diving through some issues, I could tell there were quite a few parameters that even if I could identify them wouldn’t know what to set them to.  Thankfully, below the models and configs you were supposed to download was a <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/TTS/wiki/Released-Models#simple-packaging---self-contained-package-that-runs-an-http-api-for-a-pre-trained-tts-model">simpler route</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># Create a fresh virtual environment with Python 3.6</span>
apt-get <span>install </span>espeak libsndfile1
pip <span>install </span>https://github.com/reuben/TTS/releases/download/ljspeech-fwd-attn-pwgan/TTS-0.0.1+92aea2a-py3-none-any.whl
python <span>-m</span> TTS.server.server
<span># Open http://localhost:5002</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://www.xyzdigital.com/assets/images/Mozilla-TTS.png" alt="Mozilla TTS"></p>

<p>The output was pretty good overall (this is the one used at the <a href="#mozilla-tts-quote">top of the article</a>).  However, if I were to use this in any kind of a project, I would not want to have to manually enter it in to the browser and manually download outputs.  I dug a bit deeper to see if I could extract a fairly simple CLI based on the web application.</p>

<p>I was able to modify the included <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/TTS/blob/master/server/server.py">server.py</a> file to run on the command line instead of the Flask application it really was.  I added a text argument so the input file could be passed in and updated the export to write the bytes to a user specified .wav file.</p>

<h3 id="how-does-mozilla-tts-stack-up">How Does Mozilla TTS Stack Up?</h3>

<p>The first test I ran was on a random short story I found <a href="https://www.classicshorts.com/stories/aos.html">here</a>.  At about 16 seconds in to the clip below, the output appears to choke on the word pasture.  It manages to recover quickly, but not before letting out a ghoulish “ttteeeeaaarrr” at around 26 seconds.  When I first heard the stuttering I was laughing.  Now I think I may need to sleep with the lights on.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>They even executed a few innocent people to prove that they knew how to kill, and in roaming through virgin fields still belonging to the Prussians they shot stray dogs, cows chewing the cud in peace or sick horses put out to pasture.</p>

  <source type="audio/mp3" src="https://www.xyzdigital.com/assets/audio/mozilla-tts-stutter.mp3">&lt;/source&gt;
  <p>Your browser does not support the audio element.</p>
</audio></p><p>This was the only “bug” I really ran in to while using.  Otherwise, I was quite impressed with the performance.  While it doesn’t quite sound as “human-like” as the paid alternatives, it is a huge step up from the eSpeak option.  The project will likely see more improvements as time goes on and their dataset improves.</p>

<h2 id="whats-next">What’s Next?</h2>

<p>At some point I will likely want to explore the opposite direction: speech-to-text.  Mozilla apparently has things covered there with <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech">DeepSpeech</a>, a project that appears to have significantly more support at the moment.</p>

<p>You’ve probably heard the word eigenvectors hundreds of times in class and have been asked to calculate it hundreds more. But why is this concept so central in Linear Algebra? Why is it that we study the eigenvector of a matrix so often?</p>

<p>In this post, we’ll see how Eigenvectors help us immediately understand what a linear function will do to an input. We’ll do so by playing with an interactive visualization that allows us to see just that.</p>

<h3 id="quick-refresher">Quick Refresher</h3>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/eigenvector_pull/eigenvector_scaling.png" width="300">
    Here, applying <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> on its eigenvector <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> leades to a new vector <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>λ</mi><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is in the same direction as <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. Image Source: Wikipedia.
</p>

<p>Let’s do a quick refresher to begin with. The eigenvector of a linear function <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is just the vector <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> s.t. <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi><mi>v</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>λ</mi><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">Av = \lambda v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> for some constant <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>λ</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> which we call the eigenvalue. At a high level, the eigenvector is just a dimension along which the linear function only stretches its input (for real valued eigenvalues).</p>

<p>This is great and all but what can we do once we find an Eigenvector? What does it tell us about the underlying Matrix?</p>

<h3 id="linear-functions-pull-inputs-towards-the-dominant-eigenvector">Linear Functions Pull Inputs Towards the Dominant Eigenvector</h3>

<p>Let’s start with an example. Take the following linear function:</p>

<p><span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo fence="true">[</mo><mtable><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>3</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>4</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd></mtr></mtable><mo fence="true">]</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A = \begin{bmatrix}3 &amp; 2 \\ 1 &amp; 4\end{bmatrix}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p>

<p>Let’s see what happens when we apply <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> repeatedly on the input <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mrow><mo fence="true">[</mo><mtable><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd></mtr></mtable><mo fence="true">]</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1\end{bmatrix}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</p>


    
    
    




<p>To play with this visualization, do the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Drag the slider to increase the number of times we apply <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</li>
  <li>Notice how the output vector tilts towards <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v_1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, an eigenvector of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</li>
</ol>

<p>So just by knowing an eigenvector of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> (namely the dominant eigenvector), we can get a sense of what <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> does -  <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> <strong>pulls</strong> its input towards the axis of the dominant eigenvector.</p>

<p>How is this happening? And why is it only towards one eigenvector?</p>

<h3 id="breaking-up-the-input-with-an-eigenbasis">Breaking Up the Input With an Eigenbasis</h3>

<p>You’ll be surprised to see that this behavior comes very naturally from the properties of linear functions.  Let’s see this with an example.</p>

<p>Let’s keep the same matrix/linear function <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo fence="true">[</mo><mtable><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>3</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>4</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd></mtr></mtable><mo fence="true">]</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A = \begin{bmatrix}3 &amp; 2 \\ 1 &amp; 4\end{bmatrix}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, and analyze applying <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> three times on the input <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>v</mi><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo fence="true">[</mo><mtable><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow></mstyle></mtd></mtr></mtable><mo fence="true">]</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> (i.e. <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>A</mi><mn>3</mn></msup><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A^3v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>).</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/eigenvector_pull/standard_flow.png">
    In the standard way, we'd just use standard matrix multiplication to find <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>A</mi><mn>3</mn></msup><mi>v</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A^3v.</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>
</p>

<p>The standard way to do this is to simply follow the rules of multiplication and carry out <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>A</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>A</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>v</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>)</mo><mo>)</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A(A(A(v))).</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> But instead, let’s do this a different way using eigenvectors.</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/eigenvector_pull/split_flow.png">
    In the following discussion we will split <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> into a linear combination of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>'s eigenvectors. We then apply <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>A</mi><mn>3</mn></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A^3</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> to each of these pieces and combine the result.
</p>

<p>We know that that any vector <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> can be written as the sum of the eigenvectors of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. After all, eigenvectors are linearly independent and form a basis for the space (if the matrix <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is diagonalizable, which it is). If <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v_1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v_2</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> are the eigenvectors of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A,</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> we can break up <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> as:</p>

<p><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>v</mi><mo>=</mo><msub><mi>c</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>⋅</mo><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>+</mo><msub><mi>c</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>⋅</mo><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v = c_1 \cdot v_1 + c_2 \cdot v_2</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> for some constants <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>c</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">c_1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>c</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">c_2.</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/eigenvector_pull/split.png">
    We first split <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> into its eigenvector subcomponents.
</p>

<p>When we have this representation, we can then rethink <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>A</mi><mn>3</mn></msup><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A^3v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> as:</p>

<p><span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>A</mi><mn>3</mn></msup><mi>v</mi><mo>=</mo><msup><mi>A</mi><mn>3</mn></msup><mo>(</mo><msub><mi>c</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>⋅</mo><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>+</mo><msub><mi>c</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>⋅</mo><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A^3v = A^3(c_1 \cdot v_1 + c_2 \cdot v_2)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p>

<p>or more simply:</p>

<p><span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>A</mi><mn>3</mn></msup><mi>v</mi><mo>=</mo><msub><mi>c</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>⋅</mo><msup><mi>A</mi><mn>3</mn></msup><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>+</mo><msub><mi>c</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>⋅</mo><msup><mi>A</mi><mn>3</mn></msup><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A^3v = c_1 \cdot A^3v_1 + c_2\cdot A^3v_2</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/eigenvector_pull/process.png">
    We then carry out <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>A</mi><mn>3</mn></msup><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A^3v_1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>A</mi><mn>3</mn></msup><mn>3</mn><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A^33v_2.</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>
</p>

<p>We then carry out the computation of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>A</mi><mn>3</mn></msup><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A^3v_1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>A</mi><mn>3</mn></msup><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A^3v_2</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/eigenvector_pull/combine.png">
    We finally combine the results to get <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>A</mi><mn>3</mn></msup><mi>v</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A^3v.</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>

<p>We then finally combine the results to get <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>A</mi><mn>3</mn></msup><mi>v</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A^3v.</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> We find:</p>

<h3 id="dominant-eignevalues-and-eigenvectors">Dominant Eignevalues and Eigenvectors</h3>

<p>Now, what happens when <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><msub><mi>λ</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">|\lambda_1|</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is larger than <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><msub><mi>λ</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">|\lambda_2|</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> (i.e. there exists a dominant eigenvalue)? In this example, <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>λ</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>=</mo><mn>5</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda_1 = 5</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>λ</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>=</mo><mn>2</mn><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda_2 = 2.</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> Let’s now display what it would look like to carry out <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>A</mi><mn>3</mn></msup><mi>v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A^3v</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> when we have this difference in eigenvalues.</p>

<p>The interaction below shows this setup:</p>




    
    
    




<ol>
  <li>Drag the slider to increase or decrease the number of times we apply <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> on <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>v</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v.</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></li>
  <li>Notice how “Output Eigenvector 1” and “Output Eigenvector 2” change at different rates.</li>
  <li>Notice how “Final Output Vector” tilts towards “Output Eigenvector 1” as you drag the slider to the right.</li>
</ol>

<p>We thus see that when there’s one eigenvalue larger than the other (<span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><msub><mi>λ</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><mo>&gt;</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><msub><mi>λ</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">|\lambda_1| &gt; |\lambda_2|</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>), the linear function pushes its inputs towards the eigenvector associated with that large eigenvalue (“Output EigenVector One”). The more times we apply <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, the larger this effect.</p>

<p>Note this “push” effect will only happen towards this eigenvector with the largest eignevalue - not any of the other eigenvectors.</p>

<h3 id="why-this-happens">Why this happens</h3>

<p>This tilt towards “Output Vector One” happens due to exponential growth. <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msubsup><mi>λ</mi><mn>1</mn><mi>x</mi></msubsup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda_1^x</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> grows much faster than <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msubsup><mi>λ</mi><mn>2</mn><mi>x</mi></msubsup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda_2^x</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. As such the more times we apply <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> (<span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> in our exponentials), the bigger the difference between <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msubsup><mi>λ</mi><mn>1</mn><mi>x</mi></msubsup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda_1^x</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msubsup><mi>λ</mi><mn>2</mn><mi>x</mi></msubsup><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda_2^x.</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> Hence the <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>v</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">v_1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> term has much more weight in the final sum. This increasing difference is shown in the plot below.</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/eigenvector_pull/exponentials.png">
    Due to the power of exponentials, the dominant eigenvector will play a bigger and bigger role the more times we apply A. Notice how the distance between the two expontial functions increases with x.
</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>So, just using the properties of linear functions, we are able to see why eigenvectors are so important. They show us where a linear function will “push” its inputs.</p>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Documentation is undoubtedly a key component to a successful project, in addition to the actual useful code. I have been knowing <a href="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/">Sphinx</a> for Python documentation for a while. However, since I don’t have any knowledge in <a href="https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html">reStructuredText</a> which Sphinx heavily relies on and there is no beginner’s tutorial that is really close to a real Python project, my attempt to learn Sphinx had not been very successful. Instead, I had been using Markdown for documenting projects. It turns out that Markdown is OK for a simple README or some simple usages of the project. When the project becomes heavy and huge, such as when developing a library, systematic and automatic documentation becomes necessary.</p>



<p>There are quite a few tutorial blogs or videos on Sphinx that could be found using Google. Usually the blogs and the videos are very short and the authors claimed that the readers or watchers should be able to use Sphinx in their own projects after reading or watching. This is not entirely true in practice. In those tutorials, there are missing logical connections between the kind of documentation we wanted to create and how we are going to create it. The concrete examples in those tutorials are nowhere close to a real Python library project. So those tutorials did not really helped me in studying Sphinx.</p>



<p>Recently, I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNHM7q2hLh8">Brandon Rhodes’s Sphinx tutorial session at PyCon 2013</a> by chance on YouTube. Although Brandon talked too much and it took almost three hours for the tutorial session, I found the concrete example he provided, the introduction to reStructuredText, the motivations and logical connections, and the hands-on Sphinx experiences are somethings that I was looking for. After watching the tutorial session and doing some offline practice, I am now able to create good documentation using Sphinx for my Python projects.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I am going to make some notes or updates on Brandon’s tutorial. Note that the Sphinx beginners should always watch Brandon’s long tutorial in the first place, and this blog post could by no means replace Brandon’s tutorial.</p>

<h3 id="triangle-python-library">Triangle Python Library</h3>

<p>Brandon has created a simple <a href="https://github.com/brandon-rhodes/sphinx-tutorial/tree/master/triangle-project"><code>trianglelib</code></a> library specifically for his <a href="https://github.com/brandon-rhodes/sphinx-tutorial">Sphinx tutorial</a>. The library and the accompanying Sphinx tutorial were created using Python 2 and Sphinx 1.x. To make the library and Sphinx tutorial compatible for Python 3 and the latest Sphinx 3.x, I modified Brandon’s code a little bit. In addition, I have also moved the API documentations entirely to the Python scripts, restructured the project directory layout, and taken better advantage of the latest <a href="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autodoc.html"><code>autodoc</code></a> extension in Sphinx.</p>



<p>The upgraded <code>trianglelib</code> could be found in <a href="https://github.com/leimao/Sphinx-Python-TriangleLib">Sphinx Python TriangleLib</a> on my GitHub. The <a href="https://sphinx-python-trianglelib.readthedocs.io/">documentation</a> corresponding to this project could be found on Read the Docs.</p>

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<h4 id="sphinx-cultivates-the-best-practice-in-documentation">Sphinx Cultivates the Best Practice in Documentation</h4>

<p>Previously, during the project development, I usually only put some brief comments in the Python functions or methods. However, since Python is not a strictly typing programming language, and those comments would not usually contain the typing information, I would hardly remember how those variables could be used.</p>



<p>In addition, creating a documentation after the entire project is done is an approach that I know it is wrong but I have been doing. It is low-efficiency and often error-prone. The correct approach should be documenting while programming. Since Sphinx could automatically generate documentations for all the modules, classes, and functions that follow its supported <a href="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autodoc.html"><code>docstring</code> format</a>, we are encouraged to document the Python program more comprehensively. Tools, such as <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=njpwerner.autodocstring">Python Docstring Generator</a> for VS Code could automatically generate the template for <code>docstring</code> to save our time in documentation.</p>



<p>A well-documented Python program that is Sphinx-compatible looks like this.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>"""
Use the triangle class to represent triangles.
"""</span>

<span>from</span> <span>math</span> <span>import</span> <span>sqrt</span>

<span>class</span> <span>Triangle</span><span>(</span><span>object</span><span>):</span>
    <span>"""
    A :class:`~trianglelib.shape.Triangle` object is a three-sided polygon.

    You instantiate a :class:`~trianglelib.shape.Triangle` by providing exactly three lengths ``a``, ``b``, and ``c``.

    They can either be intergers or floating-point numbers, and should be listed clockwise around the triangle.

    If the three lengths *cannot* make a valid triangle, then ``ValueError`` will be raised instead.

    &gt;&gt;&gt; from trianglelib.shape import Triangle
    &gt;&gt;&gt; t = Triangle(3, 4, 5)
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(t.is_equilateral())
    False
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(t.area())
    6.0

    Triangles support the following attributes, operators, and methods.

    .. attribute:: a
                   b
                   c

        The three side lengths provided during instantiation.

    .. index:: pair: equality; triangle
    .. method:: triangle1 == triangle2

        Returns true if the two triangles have sides of the same lengths,
        in the same order.
        Note that it is okay if the two triangles
        happen to start their list of sides at a different corner;
        ``3,4,5`` is the same triangle as ``4,5,3``
        but neither of these are the same triangle
        as their mirror image ``5,4,3``.

<h4 id="make-good-use-of-doctest">Make Good Use of Doctest</h4>

<p>Sphinx allows running some simple tests on the programs we created via <a href="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/doctest.html"><code>doctest</code></a>. So sometimes writing some test code snippets in the reStructuredText not only helps documentation but also helps program validation.</p>



<p>The test code could be something like the followings.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from trianglelib.shape import Triangle
&gt;&gt;&gt; t1 = Triangle(3, 4, 5)
&gt;&gt;&gt; t2 = Triangle(4, 5, 3)
&gt;&gt;&gt; t3 = Triangle(3, 4, 6)
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(t1 == t2)
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(t1 == t3)
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(t1.area())
6.0
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(t1.scale(2.0).area())
24.0
</code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code>.. testcode::

    from trianglelib.shape import Triangle
    t = Triangle(5, 5, 5)
    print('Equilateral?', t.is_equilateral())
    print('Isosceles?', t.is_isosceles())

.. testoutput::

    Equilateral? True
    Isosceles? True
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="version-control">Version Control</h4>

<p>We could publish the documentations to our projects on <a href="https://readthedocs.org/">Read the Docs</a> for free. Read the Docs also allows us to do version control for our projects and documentations by creating <code>tag</code> or <code>branch</code> to our GitHub projects. It is extremely useful for the users who are not using the latest version of the software.</p>



<p>Learning Sphinx is not easy and I think there is no 15-minute shortcut for beginners. Instead of randomly Googling and reading superficial blogs and videos, spending two to three hours on studying <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNHM7q2hLh8">Brandon Rhodes’s Sphinx tutorial session at PyCon 2013</a> actually saves time.</p>

  <div><p>1) It feels great to own a great business that continues to grow. It's not the same as owning it wholly though, as stock ownership is usually fractional. You only get to hang this picture in your house maybe one day out of the year. I don't feel as happy if my great business is trading at a dangerously overvalued price, it can be tempting to sell because you no longer have the same margin of safety compared to other more reasonably valued assets.</p></div><div><p>Buffett solved this by owning 100% of his most favorite businesses, so that he can extract FCF directly rather than cash out his ownership. The most recent example is where he extracted Duracell from his P&amp;G; stake in a stock for stock transaction that had tax advantages as well. Since Duracell produces steady, albeit slightly declining, FCF -- he will collect the cash value over time rather than sell it all at once and trigger tax consequences -- and still retain 100% ownership of a great brand. It is also important that this is complementary to his insurance float, which alleviates the trade off of receiving a lump sum today versus a prolonged payback period. Who knew that 15 minutes could save you quite a bit on cost of capital?</p></div><div><p>Going back to your art metaphor, this is more like owning a museum and collecting an entrance fee. And all the expensive artwork is donated by people who can't find a safe place to store them, and they even help you pay for the security guards.</p></div><div><p>2) Everyone thinks they are buying below intrinsic value, otherwise there wouldn't be any buyers. Margin of safety is about buying far below even the worst case scenario. It is about finding tangible value that you can hold on to even when everything else gets wiped out by the worst storm imaginable.</p></div><div><p>You have to be creative in destroying the value that you think is there, intrinsic value is not a constant. Capitalism is very destructive, which is the nature of creation. CEO's get overly creative all the time and the true value of your business changes. Knowing your margin of safety well allows you to buy more during a disaster.</p></div><div><p>3) The FCF of an enduring franchise may go on for a long time. But due to the time value of money, the NPV of this perpetuity portion is not very significant once you go past about 10 years and assume growth converges toward 0 as the business matures.</p></div><div><p>This is where dividends really matter, because it sets a floor for recovering your cost basis and escaping from the trap of discounted cash from the far future. Companies can also buyback shares today, which increases the dividends per share that you receive in the now. Therefore, the more cash that piles up to the shareholder, the more provable that the value is actually secured rather than subject to destructive spending or time inflation.</p></div><div><p>Some may argue that you can sell your entire stake and therefore prove your value calculations based on the cash in and cash out of your trades, but that profit is actually earned from the secondary market rather than the primary business. Be careful not to confuse secondary market profits from the underlying business. A stock going up doesn't prove that you are right, it just means that the market agrees with you for a certain period of time. Cash generation is a permanent fact stemming from the reality of business competition. I am laser focused on trying to ascertain the durability of cash generation rather than market fluctuations.</p></div><div><div><blockquote>"The key to investing is not assessing how much an industry is going to affect society, or how much it will grow, but rather determining the competitive advantage of any given company and, <strong>above all, the durability</strong> of that advantage. The products or services that have wide, <strong>sustainable</strong> moats around them are the ones that deliver rewards to investors." Â&nbsp;<br>- Warren Buffett</blockquote></div></div><div><p>4) Intellectual honesty doesn't require a lot of intellect, but a lot of honesty. The first step toward being honest to others is to first be honest with yourself.</p></div><div><p>I enjoy great value investors not because they are great at investing, but because they are great at being honest humans. Doing proper research involves seeing through to the core of the issue and moving past all the noise. If you think noise is important, then you are being dishonest to yourself. Reaching clarity is an iterative process. Underlying every complicated problem is uncomplicated, common sense.</p></div><div><p>Once I built some competence in avoiding inherently unpredictable or non-durable businesses, and recognizing these issues as soon as possible, it contributed to a larger pool of time to focus on the next layer of the sphere. Even a predictable, durable business may be trading at a price that makes the investment unpredictable in terms of offering enough downside protection.</p></div><div><p>Once you are in this zone of predictable and attractively priced, which is predicated on your sensitivity to accounting tricks and adjustment toward economic realities, only then is it worthwhile to spend a lot more time on the qualitative business, industry, and management factors -- beyond what your gut instincts might have already suggested.</p></div><div><p>I would say that I've picked a deep focus on deconstructing corporate history and company culture. You'll notice that companies with 10-20 year histories give you a lot more insight and you can study each turning point to see how they've adapted. Companies with less than 10 years history are too hard to extrapolate anything meaningful.</p></div><div><p>I would avoid generalizing industry biases and most often it is the exception to the rule that has the most hidden value. Company culture will tell you how they overcame the industry hurdles. It's still about the ratio of price versus quality, and you don't always get to choose which quadrant Mr. Market is hanging out in, but extremely low price is always a great starting point.</p></div>

<p>There are rumors about NVIDIA in advanced talks of buying ARM. Softbank has been in need of cash injection for some time, and ARM itself is a good asset.</p>
<p>The question to ponder, more interestingly, is how the synergy would work out for ARM and its potential buyers.</p>
<h2 id="nvidia">NVIDIA<a href="#nvidia" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>NVIDIA has some presences in mobile. From its ill-fated Denver CPU to the modest success with Tegra X1 in Shield and Nintendo Switch, for one, it is not lack of trying. So far, NVIDIA has established itself as an interesting player in the mobile space, while not gaining meaningful market share in the otherwise vast mobile market.</p>
<p>On the other hand, NVIDIA’s data center business has enjoyed a strong growth trajectory in the past a few years. It has established itself, rightfully, as the go-to choice for any high-performance computing needs.</p>
<p>It is likely that the acquisition of ARM won’t be for the mobile market share. With a strong CPU design portfolio like ARM, NVIDIA can have more flexibility in its high-performance computing package design. Right now, NVIDIA’s flag-ship design is DGX A100, with its CPU being AMD Epyc. The past few years, in the high-performance computing world, the role of the CPU is transitioning from computing powerhouse, to a computation coordinator. This is particularly obvious from the accelerated development pace of PCIe 4 and PCIe 5 standard.</p>
<p>That won’t be nearly enough for Jensen Huang. Mobile-based solutions such as NVIDIA Xavier have been based on the shared memory design for quite some time. While there are challenges particularly on cache coherency model for such design, a CPU-GPU shared memory design would alleviate many pains for software developers to unlock the computation power of such a machine. The recent deep-learning models have been hinting a future of at least two orders of magnitude more parameters. To accommodate these new trends, a bigger departure from current PCIe based interconnect and form factor for accelerated computing co-processor is needed badly.</p>

<p>One thing interesting about Jensen is that for the past two decades, he always has the right insight. However, his endeavors were expensive for the company to pursue, with an often stretched credit line.</p>
<p>Apple has far more cash reserves for such an expensive purchase. But an ARM purchase would be a defensive move. Apple’s roadmap, while heavily ARM-based, doesn’t require radical departure from what ARM’s currently doing. The cost of inaction to Apple, would be a new adversary owner of ARM. From the past track record, NVIDIA's ARM would likely not prioritize any Apple’s request.</p>
<p>Apple had made defensive purchases in the past, and has the habit of hoarding good technology companies for many years until its technology has matured. Apple’s ARM purchase would be boring, but a strategically important one for them.</p>
<h2 id="google">Google<a href="#google" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2>
<p>A Google’s ARM would be a distracted one. There are many product lines within Google that would benefit from an ARM purchase, from its mobile phone, Chromebook to its data center. The distraction and the likely politics interplay will likely terminate these endeavors prematurely. This will be an OK turnout for its competitors such as Apple. A Google’s ARM won’t be anywhere near as adversarial to them as NVIDIA's purchase.</p>
<p>A good asset like ARM would have many potential buyers. Many of them I didn’t cover here but equally likely. To me, as an interested observer, the most exciting one would be NVIDIA by far.</p>

		<p>This web page contains a simple Javascript that creates and configures a CouchDB user and database on a CouchDB installed on your desktop computer.</p>

		<p>Get CouchDB here: <a href="https://couchdb.apache.org/" title="Get CouchDB">https://couchdb.apache.org/</a></p>
		
		<p>After you've installed and opened CouchDB you'll be prompted to create an "Admin User".</p>
		
		<p>After you've created your CouchDB admin user you can use the form below to setup the "Rich Text" app to use your CouchDB to save your documents in. </p>
		
		<p>When you submit the form below it will create a regular CouchDB user and database on your CouchDB. When that's done you'll be redirected to the text app page and prompted to login with the username and password you entered in this form. </p>
		
		<p>This page's source contains all the Javascript code to create a user and a database in a CouchDB installed on your desktop PC.</p>

		<p>The <a href="https://cherrypc.com/app/editor/index.html" target="new" title="Text Editor HTML Source">Text Editor app page</a> source code contains all the Javascript code to login and create, save, update, list, display, and delete the rich text documents that are stored in your CouchDB.</p>
		
		<p>Together, these two web pages provide a very simple and complete example of how to create a Local-First web app using CouchDB to store user data on the client side.</p>
		
		<p>The database routines use <a href="https://pouchdb.com/" title="PouchDB Docs">PouchDB.js</a></p>

		<p>Authentication uses <a href="https://github.com/pouchdb-community/pouchdb-authentication/blob/master/docs/api.md" title="PouchDB-Authentication Docs">PouchDB-Authentication.js</a> </p>

		<p>The text app uses this<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Editable_content" title="Mozilla Guide"> rich text demo provided by Mozilla</a>.</p>
	</div><div>
		
		<p><small>You're welcome to copy the source code for both this and the app page.</small></p>
		<p><small>All of the app code is in the source of these two pages.</small></p>
		<p><small>All Javascript dependencies are supplied by CDNs except for <a href="https://github.com/pouchdb-community/pouchdb-authentication/blob/master/docs/api.md" title="PouchDB-Authentication Docs">PouchDB-Authentication.js</a> (I couldn't find one for it)</small></p>
		<p><small>This demo is intentionally as simple and sparse as I felt I could get away with. It's the example code in the html source of this and the Text Editor app page linked above that's of interest here. </small></p>
		
		<p><small>You really should copy the two pages linked and run them on your own web server. And you should either edit out the authentication routines or go get pouchdb.authentication and use it. The docs for that are worth diving into anyway if your going to make web apps with CouchDB.</small></p>

<p>The Fujitsu FM Towns is a strange sort-of-PC made in Japan by Fujitsu 
starting in 1989. While they eventually ran Windows 3.1 and 95, initially they 
were basically PC-incompatible. Fujitsu created a custom GUI OS called TownsOS, 
which is essentially undocumented online, at least in English. I do not speak 
Japanese and I do not have access to much in the way of original literature to 
obtain context. However, I'd like to share this OS with you as far as I'm able 
with my limited understanding.</p>
<p>I will be using machine translation and experimentation to try to make sense 
of what I'm seeing, so please take every word of this as my <em>best guess</em> 
rather than an authoritative statement. I will also be speculating on how some 
things work on a technical level, but I have no ability to confirm any of this. 
This is purely for the sake of entertainment; please take it with a cup of salt.</p>
<p>I have currently only covered the V1.1 editions. V2.1 will come later.</p>

Seth’s contention is simple, we’re all marketers we just don’t know it. Marketing is the ability to move someone to act, not the sleezy getting someone to buy something they don’t want stereotype of Mad Men. </p><p>Marketing is in our DNA. We are constantly being marketed to or marketing to others: Do you want an extra large latte this morning? You gotta take a 10% pay cut to keep your job, what do you want to do? Will you marry me? Can I get an extension on my essay assignment? Seth helps you see marketing from 30,000 feet for what it is and then zooms into the dirt to show you how its done in a digital age. </p><p>While it took me over five years to get the most out of Seth Godin’s work, my goal here is to take the insights it took me five years to come to and put it into one spot so you don’t have to. Hence, the article’s title: The Seth Godin Encyclopedia. </p><p><strong>Table of Contents:</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Why Seth Godin?</p></li><li><p>Why Marketing?</p></li><li><p>Why Now?</p></li><li><p>10.5 Ideas from Seth Godin that Changed My Life</p></li><li><p>My Top Five Seth Godin Books W/ Notes</p></li><li><p>25 Quotes to Reboot Your Marketing by Seth Godin</p></li><li><p>Treasure Trove of Videos/Ted Talks/Podcasts/Articles Featuring Seth</p></li></ul><p><strong>Why Marketing?</strong></p><p>The ability to ethically move others to take action through storytelling is marketing. And, good marketing has helped me experience success as a U.S. Peace Corps Ukraine Volunteer, teacher for over 9 years, build a successful 6-figure private coaching business, helped me meet all my NFL heroes growing up as a kid, talk to interesting people on my podcast and convince my wife to marry me (or take enough pity on me to do so). </p><p>Any meaningful thing you seek to do in life will involve people who have the power to say yes or no to your dreams. Knowing how to weave a story that moves them to support your dreams is crucial. Knowing how to create a product that is part of a bigger mission is crucial. Knowing how to convince others of your ability to do what your resume or business says it can do is crucial. </p><p>You’ve <em>already</em> been marketing your whole life. The first time you let out a wail as a newborn you were moving others around you to act on your behalf to fulfill your dream of needing to feel safety, security and warmth was marketing. All those times you deflected your parents’ fury onto your brothers instead of yourself was marketing. Persuading your girlfriend to say yes to your proposal was marketing. </p><p>The question becomes, do you want to get <em>even </em>better at it? </p><p>Seth shows you how. Enjoy. </p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1596135828412_21883"><div><h4>10.5 Ideas From Seth Godin That Changed My Life</h4><p><strong>Idea #1: Ship</strong></p><p>Shipping is what creators do. At some point, you need to hit post, hit send or click upload to open your work up to be received or be rejected by your market. Rejection stings. We’ve been conditioned by school to avoid rejection at all costs. Yet, if you don’t ship, if you don’t hit send, you’ll never know what the market wants. Instead of seeing shipping as a win-lose binary experiment, you need to see it as a win-win: It’s a win when the market rejects me because now I am wiser at knowing what doesn’t work. It’s a win when the market accepts it because now I know what to do more of. Shipping is really just a different way of seeing risk. You need to take some. </p><blockquote><p><strong>The only thing shipping will cost you is little time and all of your ego. </strong></p></blockquote><p><strong>Idea #2: Wine Glasses</strong></p><p>In his book <a href="https://amzn.to/2X8W4Bx"><em>All Marketers Are Liars (Tell Stories)</em></a> Seth talks about a company that makes glasses shaped especially to bring out the most flavor from Chardonnay versus Merlot and so on. Yet, in double blind taste tests there is no correlation between flavor and the type of glassware used. Did that kill this business? Absolutely not. In fact, they are doing quite well. Their clients only bought <em>more</em> of these glasses. People want to believe stories they have about themselves. In this case, customers want to believe they are sophisticated wine-drinkers and this company’s product helps them believe it (even though it isn’t true scientifically). <br></p><blockquote><p><strong>People buy products that confirm the story they </strong><span><strong>want</strong></span><strong> to believe about themselves. </strong></p></blockquote><p><strong>Idea #3: Milk Cartons </strong></p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1596193917055_25021"><div>

That’s why your business needs a purple cow - something remarkable that people cannot help <em>but</em> share with their friends. When Seth’s book <a href="https://amzn.to/3jRhzQW"><em>Purple Cow</em></a> came out, the first 5,000 copies of it actually came in a purple milk carton container. People loved this so much that they placed the empty purple milk carton on their desks. Of course, others would ask what this odd thing was and then his book would be shared even more. Seth made no money on the cartons, but he did make a ruckus. Your business would be much better off experimenting with the blurry line between absurd and remarkable to gain people’s attention than paying Facebook for ineffective advertisements. </p><blockquote><p><strong>If your message isn’t remarkable, it won’t be shared.</strong></p></blockquote><p><strong>Idea #4: Not For Everyone</strong></p><div><p>What you offer can’t be for everyone and it shouldn’t be. Mass marketing, mass business and mass production all died with the advent of the internet. No one is going to out-Amazon Amazon at driving prices into the ground, so your best bet is to go in the opposite direction: specializing. All you need is a small nucleus of ten or so clients to determine if what you have to offer is ultimately going to be profitable or not. And, if what you have to offer isn’t <em>for</em> someone that’s OK. Rejection is a win because someone found your business compelling enough that they felt the need to trash it! Did Hillary try to win over conservatives? Did Trump try to win over liberals? No. Both sides highly targeted their campaigning to the 5% of the US population that was undecided and could sway the vote. See <a href="https://amzn.to/2Xv0K51"><em>We Are All Weird</em></a><em> </em>for more of Seth’s take on niche. </p></div><blockquote><p><strong>A business for everyone is ultimately a business for no one. </strong></p></blockquote><p><strong>Idea #5: Quitting is OK</strong></p><div><p><a href="https://amzn.to/2Xeshas"><em>The Dip</em></a> was Seth Godin’s look at something society treats as a taboo: quitting. The premise is simple - if you' can’t be best in the world at something, quit. <strong>But, best in world doesn’t mean best out of 8 billion people, it means out of someone’s perceived market.</strong> You might not be the best football coach in America, but you are certainly the best one in your town so you receive a steady stream of private clients. You might not be the best tap dancer in the world, but you are the best tap dancer at a certain style of Vaudeville tap that no one else can teach. I think the irony of <a href="https://amzn.to/2Xeshas"><em>The Dip</em></a> is that it’s not really a book about quitting so much as a call imploring people to get hyper focused on the market they are trying to be best in the world at. </p></div><blockquote><p><strong>Get hyper focused on defining your “best in the world”. </strong></p></blockquote><p><strong>Idea #6: Positioning &gt; Product</strong></p><div><p>This is something I took away from Seth’s <a href="https://themarketingseminar.com/"><em>The Marketing Seminar</em> on Akimbo,</a> which I highly recommend you check out. Positioning is simply finding a hole in the market and placing your product/service as the thing to fill it. Volvo did this in the car market by finding that there was no company trying to dominate the luxury-safety market. So, Volvo is now positioned as the safest luxury vehicle in the market today. Tesla stayed in the luxury category, but went for electric saying “it’s kinda like an electric Mercedes”. Ford, still occupies the American-made + blue collar + everyday man vehicle market. Find all the various attributes that exist in your market place and see which combinations of these attributes your company can combine to create its own monopoly in a unique market.</p></div><blockquote><div><p><strong>Position yourself into a corner of the market where no one else is. </strong></p></div></blockquote><p><strong>Idea #7: What if you had to charge 10x for your product, how would you justify it?</strong></p><div><p>One of the biggest things I struggled the most with early on with my business was figuring out how to price myself. Most business owners when they begin drastically under price themselves. When you charge higher prices, you raise the stakes for your customers, attract more serious ones, and you also have an opportunity to prove that you are now worth the price you just charged.  Price, if it is part of the internal story of your customer that they want to believe about themselves, can be just as much as part of the value proposition of your service or product as the service or product itself. Price, weirdly, can actually make people feel better about themselves. </p></div><blockquote><p><strong>Price is a story.</strong></p></blockquote><p><strong>Idea #8: Locks Vs. Keys</strong></p><div><p>You can want your business to be so successful so badly that you struggle to even be good. That’s probably because you confused your product’s importance for your customer’s importance. You built a product to solve a very specific problem that you’ve labored day and night over, but now, once you introduce it to the world, no one wants it. Why? You treated your product as more important than your people. You build a key before you found a lock for it. Now you find yourself scrambling to retrofit a person to your product. Reverse your process: find the lock first, find the people try to break it open and then design them a key. </p></div><blockquote><p><strong>Find the lock. Find the people. Then, create your key. </strong></p></blockquote><p><strong>Idea #9: Who is it for, how did they get here and what do you want them to do?</strong></p><p>When creating ask yourself three questions: Who is it for? How did they get here? And, what do you want them to do? The type of person you built your website for will dictate the function of your site.

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Deutsch’s algorithm is the simplest quantum computing algorithm invented to solve a slightly contrived problem. Suppose we have a black-box function $f(x)$ which maps from the set $\{0,1\}$ to the set $\{0,1\}$. It is easy to speculate that there are four possible mappings for $f(x)$. We call the function $f(x)$ constant if $f(0) = f(1)$, otherwise we call the function $f(x)$ balanced.</p>



<p>With classical circuits, we would have to run the black-box $f(x)$ twice to evaluate $f(0)$ and $f(1)$ and compare the values of $f(0)$ and $f(1)$ to see if they are equivalent or not. With quantum circuits, because we could take advantage of superposition, probably we could do better with fewer runs and operations.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to discuss the Deutsch’s algorithm.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<h4 id="separable-and-entangled-states">Separable and Entangled States</h4>

<p>States that can be broken into the Kronecker product of states from the constituent subsystems are called separable states, whereas states that are unbreakable are referred to as entangled states.</p>



<p>For example, we have the following two states $| \psi \rangle$ and $| \psi^{\prime} \rangle$.</p>



<p>$| \psi \rangle$ is separable and $| \psi^{\prime} \rangle$ is entangled.</p>

<h4 id="unitary-quantum-operator">Unitary Quantum Operator</h4>

<p>Every quantum operator $U$ is unitary and thus reversible. Because $UU^{\dagger} = U^{\dagger}U = I$, we have</p>



<h4 id="hadamard-operator">Hadamard Operator</h4>

<p>Hardmard operator is a special quantum operator.</p>



<p>Notice that $H^{\dagger} = H$, therefore</p>











<h4 id="reducing-sum-or-difference-to-boolean">Reducing Sum or Difference to Boolean</h4>

<p>If $f(x)$ maps from the set $\{0,1\}$ to the set $\{0,1\}$, we have</p>



<p>Where $\oplus$ is $\text{XOR}$ (binary addition modulo 2).</p>

<h3 id="deutschs-algorithm">Deutsch’s Algorithm</h3>

<p>The black-box $f(x)$ is represented using a quantum gate $U_f$. Just like the classical gate for $f(x)$, it has four possible candidates. Our job is to determine whether the $f(x)$ corresponding to the $U_f$ is constant or balanced.</p>

<div>
<figure>
    <img src="https://leimao.github.io/images/blog/2020-06-23-Deutsch-Algorithm/Uf.png">
    <figcaption>$U_f$</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>The quantum gate $U_f$ is a unitary matrix which maps from $| x \rangle \otimes | y \rangle$ to $| x \rangle \otimes | y \oplus f(x) \rangle$, namely $U_f (| x \rangle \otimes | y \rangle) = | x \rangle \otimes | y \oplus f(x) \rangle$, for $x, y \in \{0, 1\}$. When $y = 0$, $| y \oplus f(x) \rangle = | 0 \oplus f(x) \rangle = | f(x) \rangle $, $| y \oplus f(x) \rangle$ is just $| f(x) \rangle$.</p>



<p>Note that the above mapping is only valid when $| x \rangle$ and $| y \rangle$ are basic qubit states $| 0 \rangle$ or $| 1 \rangle$. When $| x \rangle$ and $| y \rangle$ are superpositions, the mapping does not necessarily hold.</p>



<p>Let’s further check when $| x \rangle$ and $| y \rangle$ are superpositions, what the outputs from $U_f$ will be. Perhaps we could achieve fewer runs with superpositions.</p>

<h4 id="first-attempt">First Attempt</h4>

<p>In the first attempt, we made the first qubit input to $U_f$ a superposition, which is achieved by applying a Hadamard operator to the input basic state $|0\rangle$. The superposition is</p>



<p>The second qubit input to $U_f$ is just a normal  basic state $|0\rangle$.</p>

<div>

    <figcaption>First Attempt</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>







<p>If $f(0) = 0$, $f(1) = 1$, one of the balanced cases,</p>



<p>Note that this $|\varphi_2\rangle$ is entangled and could be be expressed as the Kronecker product of two qubits. The first qubit output from $U_f$ is not $H|0\rangle$ either. In fact it could not be described using single qubit! The two qubits must be described as a whole due to quantum entanglement. When we observe either the first qubit output or the second qubit output, we immediately know the observation of the other qubit. For example, if we observed the second qubit is 0, we know the observation of the first qubit must be 0. There are 50-50 percent chance observing 0 or 1 for both the first qubit and the second qubit.</p>



<p>If $f(0) = 1$, $f(1) = 0$, one of the balanced cases,</p>



<p>This $|\varphi_2\rangle$ is entangled and there are 50-50 percent chance observing 0 or 1 for both the first qubit and the second qubit.</p>



<p>If $f(0) = 0$, $f(1) = 0$, one of the constant cases,</p>



<p>This $|\varphi_2\rangle$ is separable. Although we are not sure the exact state the two qubit outputs would be in, due to the phase is not defined, we are sure that the observation of the bottom qubit must be 0.</p>



<p>If $f(0) = 1$, $f(1) = 1$, one of the constant cases,</p>



<p>This $|\varphi_2\rangle$ is separable. Although we are not sure the exact state the two qubit outputs would be in, due to the phase is not defined, we are sure that the observation of the bottom qubit must be 1.</p>



<p>However, all of these are not helpful if we are only allowed to run once. After running once, no matter what we observed from the first qubit and the second qubit, we are not sure whether $f(x)$ is constant or balanced.</p>

<h4 id="second-attempt">Second Attempt</h4>

<p>In the second attempt, we made the second qubit input to $U_f$ a superposition, which is achieved by applying a Hadamard operator to the input basic state $|1\rangle$. The superposition is</p>



<p>The second qubit input to $U_f$ is a variable and it could be either $|0\rangle$ or $|1\rangle$.</p>

<div>
<figure>
    <img src="https://leimao.github.io/images/blog/2020-06-23-Deutsch-Algorithm/attempt-2.png">
    <figcaption>Second Attempt</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>







<p>Because $\frac{|f(x)\rangle - |\overline{f(x)}\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}$ is either $\frac{|0\rangle - |1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}$ or $\frac{|1\rangle - |0\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}$, $|\varphi_2\rangle $ could be further simplified as</p>



<p>The observation from the first qubit output is always the same to the first qubit input, whereas there are 50-50 percent chance observing 0 or 1 for the second qubit.</p>



<p>This provides no information of determining whether $f(x)$ is constant or balanced either.</p>

<h4 id="third-attempt">Third Attempt</h4>

<p>In the third attempt, we made the both qubit inputs to $U_f$ superpositions. The superpositions for the first qubit and the second qubit are $H|0\rangle$ and $H|1\rangle$, respectively.</p>

<div>
<figure>
    <img src="https://leimao.github.io/images/blog/2020-06-23-Deutsch-Algorithm/deutsch-algorithm.png">
    <figcaption>Deutsch's Algorithm</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>







<p>Note that if $f(0) \oplus f(1) = 0$, $f(x)$ is constant; if $f(0) \oplus f(1) = 1$, $f(x)$ is balanced. This information is encoded in the phase of the first qubit. How could we extract this key information?</p>



<p>We noticed that in the first qubit output $|0\rangle + (-1)^{f(0) \oplus f(1)} |1\rangle$ is either $|0\rangle + |1\rangle$ when $f(0) \oplus f(1) = 0$ or $|0\rangle - |1\rangle$ when $f(0) \oplus f(1) = 1$. Applying a Hadamard operator to it results in $|0\rangle$ when $f(0) \oplus f(1) = 0$ or $|1\rangle$ when $f(0) \oplus f(1) = 1$.</p>



<p>This means if $f(x)$ is constant, we must observe 0 for the first qubit whereas if $f(x)$ is balanced, we must observe 1 for the first qubit. Therefore, we are able to determine if $f(x)$ is constant or balanced using such quantum circuits.</p>



<p>Conventionally, we compare algorithms on the same platform, either it is a classical computer or a quantum computer. However, in our case, it is a little bit weird that the classical algorithm is using classical gate whereas the quantum algorithm uses quantum gate, yet we still have to compare the two algorithms. Therefore, in my opinion, such comparison is not fair.</p>

Amazon allegedly invested in small firms to actually obtain information about products developed by them. Amazon used such confidential information to launch its own services. Google has far worse compared to Amazon.</p><p>On 30th June, Google announced acquiring North, a smart glass maker. Google reportedly paid upwards of $150 million to acquire the Canadian 8-year-old startup, North which started off as Thalmic Labs. North was manufacturing smart glasses called Focals smart glass. At the time of Google’s acquisition, It had started shipping the Focals 1.0 and in the process of developing next-gen, Focals 2.0.</p><p>It seemed natural that Google would be interested in North as its product line was similar to Google Glass. “We’re building towards a future where helpfulness is all around you, where all your devices just work together and technology fades into the background,” Rick Osterloh, senior vice president of devices and services at Google had said in a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/30/google-acquires-north-augmented-reality-glasses-start-up.html">statement that time</a>. “North’s technical expertise will help as we continue to invest in our hardware efforts and ambient computing future.”</p><p>Exactly one month after Google’s acquisition, North has killed off its flagship product.&nbsp;In a statement on the <a href="https://www.bynorth.com/">North website</a>, it says that Focals smart glasses will not be sold any longer beginning July 31.&nbsp;“Focals smart glasses and its services are being discontinued and will no longer be available after July 31st, 2020. You won’t be able to connect your glasses through the app or use any features, abilities, or experiments from your glasses,” the statement reads.</p><p>Not only is North killing its flagship Focals 1.0 smart glasses, but it is also stopping work on the upcoming Focals 2.0 completely.&nbsp;The website says that customers who ordered the Focals 1.0 smart glasses after June 30 are provided with a refund.</p><h2>Google’s predatory instincts</h2><p>Google refused to comment on North killing off its Focals 1.0 and 2.0. North (now under Google) also did not give any reason for abandoning its flagship product.</p><p>North hasn’t provided any information on the reasons for abandoning the product. <strong>However, the company had mentioned that Focals 1.0 would be dropped after Google acquires it</strong>. “We’re proud to have grown our company in the Kitchener-Waterloo region and are thankful for the tremendous support we’ve received from the community. We are looking forward to remaining in the region with Google. We are winding down Focals 1.0 and we will not be shipping Focals 2.0, but we hope you will continue the journey with us as we start this next chapter,” North’s co-founders had said when announcing the Google takeover.</p><p>Many will argue that the North got a fresh lease of life, better funding and research facilities from Google but the question is whether Google was ethical in killing off a rival smart glass?</p></div></div></div></article></div>]]>

<p><span><span>Ted Han, our amazing software developer, has been working hard to combine a data-driven “back end” with ease of use for the people who are testing and, we hope, will ultimately be deploying this tool in their news flow. Several key features are available now with many more to come.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Partner newsrooms — including several in the McClatchy media group’s central-U.S. region and Uruguay’s largest publisher —&nbsp; have been putting Correx, our web-based software, through its paces. We’re getting excellent feedback, and see great potential.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>From the beginning, we’ve envisioned Correx as a key way to help news organizations improve transparency and more fully engage with their communities. Straightforward corrections of mistakes are a vital kind of transparency, and can boost trust.</span></p>
<p><span>Because so much of what journalists publish reaches people via social media, we designed Correx to help journalists a) know better who’s sharing their work; b) easily correct/update widely shared stories; and c) communicate efficiently with sharers to encourage them to re-share the corrections and updates.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://newscollab.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Correx-User-Guide.pdf">We’ve created a “users guide” of an early Correx version</a>. It explains how the tool works. In this post, we want to show how several news organizations have put it into action.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><em><strong>Kansas City Star</strong></em></h3>
<p><span>Last month, McClatchy’s </span><i><span>Kansas City Star</span></i><span> became the first newsroom to use Correx. In one of its first tests, it updated a coronavirus article, a topic that demands frequent updates given the fast-moving nature of this crisis.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Here’s the <a href="https://twitter.com/kcstar/status/1268632225219776518">original tweet</a>:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Kansas City area has 3rd consecutive day of triple-digit rise in new COVID-19 cases <a href="https://t.co/FMrPCsrUDZ">https://t.co/FMrPCsrUDZ</a></p>

<p><span>Several days later, an editor at the Star used Correx to find out who had shared the original story. The editor then, also using Correx, posted an update along with replies to some of the sharers with significant followings. </span></p>
<p><span>(Notice, in the update, the “Correx” link next to the time and date; Twitter tells you what software was used to post individual tweets.)</span></p>
<p><span>Needless to say, the most gratifying part of the exercise for the Star newsroom people was the reply thanking the organization for its “outstanding journalism” — an assessment with which we agree.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Eric Nelson, McClatchy’s Central regions grown editor, has been our primary contact at the Star since the project began. We asked him how it’s going from their perspective. His reply:</span></p>
<p><i><span>The testing of the corrections tool with the ASU News Co/Lab has been incredibly valuable on a couple of fronts. Of course, we always are aiming to be as transparent as possible with our audience, and this new corrections tool puts us in a better position to communicate with digital users when sources have changes in a story or something needs to be addressed immediately.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span>But it also has provided us with a great weapon in this fast-moving news cycle with COVID-19 and the landscape of protests. We are able to reconnect with our engaged audience and give them immediate updates on each developing story as it happens.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span>Readers have been very appreciative of our communication with the tool and have even thanked us for the updates and our work. That is incredibly rewarding.</span></i></p>

<p><span>Uruguay’s largest news organization is headed by Martín Aguirre, who spent an academic year at ASU as part of the State Department-sponsored Humphrey Fellowships (part of the Fulbright program that brings foreign scholars and professionals to the U.S. each year). </span></p>
<p><span>He and his social media editor, Matías Rocha, saw the potential in the Correx tool during a video call last month, and they immediately put it to use in their own work.</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>First, some historical background to provide some context. (Meta: There is a TL;DR at the bottom if you want to skip to it.)</p>

<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>I’ve been an independent/freelance software developer/engineer/consultant/whatchamacallit for 10+ years. All thoughout, I recorded my business activities in an accounting software package (an ancient version of Quickbooks). I did a couple of units in accounting in my undergraduate years so I understood the fundamentals of accounting (assets/liabilities/equity/debit/credit etc.) and the value of having proper financial records. It was easy to do and made sense to me.</p>

<p>In addition to providing software services and consulting to clients, I also dabbled in creating my own startups. Some had moderate success. Some bombed out completely. Nevertheless, I’ve been trying to do ‘bootstrapped’ businesses for quite a while (though maybe it wasn’t known by that term back then).</p>

<p>Then, about 5-6 years ago, an old client of mine asked me to join his new startup. He was very persuasive. So I did.</p>

<p>However, since I was in Australia and the startup company was in California, it was just easier to have a client/consultant relationship than to be an employee. Legally employing me would mean the company would have to incorporate a subsidiary in Australia and all the ensuing hassle that involved.</p>

<p>Nah, too much trouble.</p>

<p>I remained, technically and legally, a consultant/contractor although, for those five years, I worked exclusively for the startup and no one else. But since I was an independent contractor, I had to keep my own books.</p>

<p>And so, I continued to use my accounting software package (which I’m now going to abbreviate to <strong>ASP</strong>) to record the business activities that I did for my ‘boss’. Which was just as well because I still have some recurring revenue from an old SaaS of mine. Those need to be booked as well.</p>

<p>All through the last 10+ years, the ASP been served me well. It’s not perfect, but it was good enough. Quite good for the $80 (ish? It was on special, I think) that I paid for it at the time. However, it was getting quite dated and the license would eventually expire. (I actually have it running in a non-Internet-accessible Windows XP virtual machine. That’s how old it is.)</p>

<p>One day, I was going to have to replace it, or otherwise do something about it, but not yet.</p>

<p>Then, in 2020, the coronavirus/covid-19 pandemic happened. The company I was working for lost funding and folded.</p>

<p>Well …</p>

<p>That was enjoyable: Having a regular a job for 5+ years. And I was getting used to it. What now?</p>

<p>Five years for a tech startup is … tiring (I didn’t expect it to last as long as it did). I didn’t want to rush into looking for another job straightaway. I wanted to take some time off.</p>

<p>I spent a couple of weeks catching-up/reading-up/revising the startup literature. Inevitably, I got drawn back into the ‘bootstrapped business’ game again.</p>

<h2 id="idea">Idea</h2>

<p>As the wisdom goes, the way to come up with startup ideas is to ‘notice’ a problem that you have (<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/startupideas.html">How to Get Startup Ideas</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why is it so important to work on a problem you have? Among other things, it ensures the problem really exists. It sounds obvious to say you should only work on problems that exist. And yet by far the most common mistake startups make is to solve problems no one has.</p>

  <p>…</p>

  <p>The verb you want to be using with respect to startup ideas is not “think up” but “notice.” At YC we call ideas that grow naturally out of the founders’ own experiences “organic” startup ideas. The most successful startups almost all begin this way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>During the couple of weeks, I tried to ‘go zen’ and notice things. In particular, I tried to notice things which are problems but which my mind would normally just dismiss as ‘that’s just how things are’.</p>

<p>It was a fun time and a challenging exercise to temporarily rewire my brain to look at the world differently. I noticed some things. I brainstormed some ideas. Some were wacky. Most were terrible.</p>

<p>And then I noticed my ancient accounting software package. It’s a problem that’s existed for many years but had always been pushed back as ‘Not now’.</p>

<p>I was surprised. Very. This problem had been dormant for many years. I had just never noticed it before.</p>

<p>I thought about it some more. The software is fine but it needs replacing. Could I create a replacement? How much work would it be? Would anyone else want it? Would they pay for it? I’ve been using it for 10+ years but I only use a small fraction (5%?) of its functionality. Could I improve it by omitting the other 95%? Lots and lots of questions.</p>

<p>It prompted me to do some research around the Internet and I noticed the following: All the major accounting software vendors have gone online/SaaS. SaaS is great for the vendor but, in the case of accounting, it’s terrible for the user. Think about it.</p>

<p><strong>Business-critical accounting data is stored in the cloud where it’s all controlled by the vendor.</strong> Essentially, the major vendors are forcing small businesses to give up control and then holding the data hostage in return for ongoing SaaS subscription fees. (And it looks like the vendors are getting away with it.)</p>

<p>No way was I, as a user, gonna go with that.</p>

<p>If I was inclined to purchase a replacement for my ASP, I would have trouble finding a suitable one that wasn’t SaaS. I don’t want my business-critical data to be in the cloud. I want it to be in a file on my computer. Furthermore, I don’t want to pay $10-$20 every month to do what, 10 years ago, an $80 product could do for another 10+ years. Think about it: $10-$20 per month vs a $80 one-off fee. It’s a ridiculous comparison.</p>

<h2 id="niche">Niche</h2>

<p>So, here, I think, there is a gap in the market. Small and micro-businesses which would otherwise purchase an entry-level ASP are not being well served by the SaaS offerings which are available. (I’m not talking about large businesses which spend much more on accounting software, irrespective of whether it’s SaaS or not. Those are fine.)</p>

<p>So … do I want to go after this market segment?</p>

<p>I’d like to … but I’m not.</p>

<p>Um, why not?</p>

<p>Because I’m just one person. I don’t have the resources/time/funding to go for that.</p>

<p>And anyway, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/14046313-start-small-stay-small-a-developer-s-guide-to-launching-a-startup">respected</a> <a href="https://sivers.org/book/StartSmallStaySmall">sources</a> recommend starting out as niche as possible (<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/startupideas.html">How to Get Startup Ideas</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>you can either build something a large number of people want a small amount, or something a small number of people want a large amount. Choose the latter. Not all ideas of that type are good startup ideas, but nearly all good startup ideas are of that type.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, instead of targeting the entire market segment, I’m going to go for a niche.</p>

<p>What’s the niche? Well, basically, the niche is … ‘me’ :)</p>

<p>Or rather, the niche would be the characteristics which describe me as a user. So it’d be things like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Solo operator. No employees. No stock. Not a corporation.</li>
  <li>Manage own accounting data. Don’t need an accountant.</li>
  <li>Control over own data. Non-SaaS.</li>
  <li>… and maybe some other stuff that hasn’t manifested yet.</li>
</ul>

<p>Having used my ASP for 10+ years, I know exactly the feature set that I use. I don’t think I’m anyone special so there should be other people in a situation like mine. In theory, my feature set should be a good match for them too.</p>

<p>So I’ve found, or rather, noticed, a problem and a niche. And the way I’ve defined it, it’s small enough that I can aim a “bootstrapped startup” at it.</p>

<p>Do I wanna go for it?</p>

<p>Yeah, let’s give this a shot and see how things turn out.</p>

<h2 id="tldr-conclusion">TL;DR (conclusion)</h2>

<p>This is why I started GigoBooks: I have an itch to scratch. The itch has been around for <em>several years</em> before I eventually noticed it. It points me to (I think) a market niche which is underserved. I’m going to scratch my itch, and also, create something to serve the niche better. The ‘something’ is a more suitable, more affordable, non-SaaS accounting software.</p>

<![CDATA[Fixing MacBook Pro Thermal Performance Issues]]>

August 2, 2020 | https://www.dannyguo.com/blog/fixing-macbook-pro-thermal-performance-issues/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.dannyguo.com/blog/fixing-macbook-pro-thermal-performance-issues/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        

        

        

<p>Over the past several months, my 2018 15” MacBook Pro developed thermal
performance issues. Here's what I did to fix the problem. The two key changes
were that I switched to using the right side <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderbolt_(interface)#Thunderbolt_3">Thunderbolt
3</a> ports
instead of the left side ones, and I cleaned the dust buildup in the internal
fans.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem<a aria-label="Anchor" href="#the-problem"><svg><use xlink:href="/images/icons.svg#icon-link"></use></svg></a></h2>
<p>The problem first started when I noticed my CPU usage spiking to near 100%. In
the process list, I saw <code>kernel_task</code> taking up most of the CPU.</p>
<p>I <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207359">learned</a> that macOS does this
intentionally to prevent the CPU from overheating.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the functions of kernel_task is to help manage CPU temperature by
making the CPU less available to processes that are using it intensely. In
other words, kernel_task responds to conditions that cause your CPU to become
too hot, even if your Mac doesn't feel hot to you. It does not itself cause
those conditions. When the CPU temperature decreases, kernel_task
automatically reduces its activity.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="fan-speed">Fan Speed<a aria-label="Anchor" href="#fan-speed"><svg><use xlink:href="/images/icons.svg#icon-link"></use></svg></a></h2>
<p>For many years, I've used
<a href="https://github.com/hholtmann/smcFanControl">smcFanControl</a> to manually increase
my fan speed because I don't mind fan noise, especially if it means getting
better performance out of my laptop or being able to comfortably put it on my
lap.</p>
<p>However, it stopped working reliably after a macOS update. I purchased <a href="https://bjango.com/mac/istatmenus/">iStat
Menus</a>, which comes with a well supported
fan control feature. Note that you have to buy it from their own website to get
fan control. The Mac App Store version <a href="https://bjango.com/help/istatmenus6/macappstore/">doesn't include that particular
feature</a> for some reason.</p>
<p>I turned the fans up to max regularly in an attempt to preempt the <code>kernel_task</code>
issue, but it still kept popping up.</p>
<h2 id="thunderbolt-3-ports">Thunderbolt 3 Ports<a aria-label="Anchor" href="#thunderbolt-3-ports"><svg><use xlink:href="/images/icons.svg#icon-link"></use></svg></a></h2>
<p>I found <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/363933/275342">this excellent StackExchange
answer</a> that recommends using
the right side Thunderbolt 3 ports instead of the left side ones. Apparently the
ports aren't equal. The left ones can cause thermal issues. Also, using both
ports on either side can be problematic.</p>
<p>I use a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/CalDigit-TS3-Plus-Thunderbolt-Dock/dp/B07CZPV8DF/ref=as_li_ss_tl?crid=223U28DX1402C&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=caldigit+ts3+plus&amp;qid=1595940705&amp;sprefix=caldigit+,aps,223&amp;sr=8-2&amp;th=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=thdalo00-20&amp;linkId=016d783904cae8cac9d952a3c58d816b&amp;language=en_US">Thunderbolt 3
dock</a>
for a single cable solution that handles charging and all my peripherals,
including monitors. I tended to plug it into a left port. I switched it over to
a right port and saw an immediate difference in temperature. iStat Menus reports
the temperatures from various sensors.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/2oiPxjF.png" alt="iStat Menus temperature readings"></p>
<p>I tested and verified that using a left port caused the CPU temperature to go up
much higher than using a right port.</p>
<p>For a few months, this simple change was enough to resolve the issue. Luckily, I
was able to continue using a single cable, and I didn't have to plug in my dock
on one side and then a separate charger on the other side.</p>
<h2 id="resolution-scaling">Resolution Scaling<a aria-label="Anchor" href="#resolution-scaling"><svg><use xlink:href="/images/icons.svg#icon-link"></use></svg></a></h2>
<p>Then the problem started happening again. I also experienced issues playing
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabletop_Simulator">Tabletop Simulator</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Strike:_Global_Offensive">Counter-Strike</a>,
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valorant">Valorant</a> (on Windows through Boot
Camp), all games that my machine should be able to handle without any problems.
It would stuttter even after I turned the resolution and graphical settings all
the way down.</p>
<p>I thought it might have something to do with my monitors. In my desk setup, I
have two external monitors that I run at a scaled resolution that looks like
2560 x 1440.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/xPz7nXG.png" alt="external display resolution"></p>
<p>Note the warning that “Using a scaled resolution may affect performance.” The
problem is that macOS <a href="https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/1043">achieves this
resolution</a> by rendering
everything in double the size and then scaling it down. So my MacBook is
essentially doing the rendering work for two 5K monitors.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/0oroxGb.png" alt="System Information displays"></p>
<p>See <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/4k-monitor-at-1440p-scaling-performance.2232164/">this
thread</a>
or <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/338581/275342">this StackExchange answer</a>
for more details.</p>
<p>I considered turning the resolution down to look like 1920 x 1080, which isn't a
scaled resolution, but then everything looked too big.</p>
<p>I was pretty frustrated at this point, especially because
<a href="https://zoom.us/">Zoom</a> video calls started freezing up on me. I got into the
habit of unplugging my monitors before joining video calls.</p>
<h2 id="dust">Dust<a aria-label="Anchor" href="#dust"><svg><use xlink:href="/images/icons.svg#icon-link"></use></svg></a></h2>
<p>This entire time, I thought the problem was my MacBook producing too much heat.
Beyond making the fans run at max more often, I never considered that the
problem could be that it stopped being able to get rid of heat.</p>
<p>Then I read <a href="https://quanticdev.com/articles/cleaning-macbook-after-16800-hours-of-use/">this
post</a>
from someone who cleaned the inside of a MacBook after 7 years of use. I was
initially skeptical that clogged fans were my problem because my MacBook was
only about a year and a half old. But the more I thought about it, the more it
made sense, and I didn't have anything to lose by trying to clean it.</p>
<p>To open my MacBook, I followed <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/MacBook+Pro+15-Inch+Touch+Bar+2018+Lower+Case+Replacement/121426">this iFixit
guide</a>.</p>
<h3 id="autoboot">AutoBoot<a aria-label="Anchor" href="#autoboot"><svg><use xlink:href="/images/icons.svg#icon-link"></use></svg></a></h3>
<p>I learned that by default, macOS turns on the MacBook when you press any button
(not just the power button) or open the lid. This was very surprising to me. I
did recall being confused in the past when my MacBook turned on even though I
didn't press the power button. When it first happened, I thought there was
something wrong. At least from Apple's perspective, it turns out <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/its-not-a-bug-its-a-feature/">this is a
feature, not a bug</a>.</p>
<p>So to make sure the MacBook stays off through the process, you have to run this
in a terminal to turn off booting on lid open.</p>
<p>To turn the setting back on later, run this. Though I just left mine off after I
was done.</p>
<h3 id="removing-the-bottom">Removing the Bottom<a aria-label="Anchor" href="#removing-the-bottom"><svg><use xlink:href="/images/icons.svg#icon-link"></use></svg></a></h3>
<p>The next step was to take off the screws. Apple uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentalobe_security_screw">pentalobe
screws</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/FQndl8j.jpg" alt="pentalobe screw"></p>
<p>I've opened MacBooks before to replace <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/spicypillows">swollen
batteries</a>, so I was prepared with an
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072HNBL9Z/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=thdalo00-20&amp;linkId=09c787c5245a192a816fd263da8ad7ea&amp;language=en_US">electronics screwdriver
set</a>
that includes pentalobe bits.  I also had a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Endust-Electronics-Compressed-bitterant-11407/dp/B00HX7VZ5M/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&amp;keywords=endust+duster&amp;qid=1596317241&amp;sr=8-4&amp;th=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=thdalo00-20&amp;linkId=4bb9cd9f61cc6a4a158ec8dfbfb00e3d&amp;language=en_US">can of compressed
air</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/JWhg3vL.jpg" alt="screwdriver and duster"></p>
<p>I removed the screws and learned that Apple has made the bottom harder to open
because now you need a suction cup. I repurposed the suction cup from my <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GKXPL6M/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=thdalo00-20&amp;linkId=a201bd337a2a7814cff67674269ea94f&amp;language=en_US">car
dash cell phone
holder</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ewlAsGh.jpg" alt="cell phone holder with suction cup"></p>
<p>You have to use the suction cup to lift part of the bottom enough to slide in
something to release a few internal latches. I used a library card.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/tDEaslF.jpg" alt="lifting the bottom cover"></p>
<h3 id="cleaning-the-dust">Cleaning the Dust<a aria-label="Anchor" href="#cleaning-the-dust"><svg><use xlink:href="/images/icons.svg#icon-link"></use></svg></a></h3>
<p>Once I got my MacBook open, it was obvious that dust was the main cause of my
performance issues. Just taking the bottom off caused a cloud of dust to come
out.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/CN5oz3j.jpg" alt="dust on the bottom cover"></p>
<p>There was also cat hair from this troublemaker.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Feill8c.jpg" alt="my cat"></p>
<p>Both fans were totally gunked up.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/IAGcS0j.jpg" alt="dust on the inside"></p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/BF8Sinf.jpg" alt="dust on the left fan"></p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/gX2FxJ5.jpg" alt="dust on the right fan"></p>
<p>I used compressed air to blow out the dust. I also used a toothpick to get some
off the fans that wouldn't come off from blowing alone.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/BxW6OOp.jpg" alt="overview after cleaning"></p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/OMmeXnG.jpg" alt="left fan after cleaning"></p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/E60RF3J.jpg" alt="fan closeup after cleaning"></p>
<p>I put the cover back on and haven't had any more thermal performance issues.</p>
<h2 id="retrospective">Retrospective<a aria-label="Anchor" href="#retrospective"><svg><use xlink:href="/images/icons.svg#icon-link"></use></svg></a></h2>
<p>It would be nice if macOS could provide some actionable advice when
<code>kernel_task</code> is trying to stop the MacBook from overheating. I would have
appreciated an OS suggestion to use the right side Thunderbolt 3 ports.</p>
<p>But I also never considered that my laptop fans could require cleaning. In
retrospect, that's foolish because I've seen how dirty it can get in desktop
PCs, and I know that heat is an inhibitor to computer performance. It's just
like running in humid weather. Your body starts shutting down because its main
mechanism for getting rid of heat (sweating) stops working because humidity
prevents sweat from evaporating.</p>
<p>It would be cool if the machine could detect and alert when the fans are no
longer effective, perhaps with a sensor that looks for a lack of airflow at the
vents.</p>
<p>To prevent the issue from occurring again, I've set up a recurring task in
<a href="https://todoist.com/r/danny_guo_xlyrub">Todoist</a> to remind me to clean my
computers once a year.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Error handling in Rust is very different if you’re coming from other languages. In languages like Java, JS, Python etc, you usually <code>throw</code> exceptions and <code>return</code> successful values. In Rust, you return something called a <code>Result</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code> type is an <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch06-01-defining-an-enum.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enum</a> that has two variants - <code>Ok(T)</code> for successful value or <code>Err(E)</code> for error value:</p>
<pre><code><span>enum</span> Result<span>&lt;</span>T<span>,</span> E<span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
   <span>Ok</span><span>(</span>T<span>)</span><span>,</span>
   <span>Err</span><span>(</span>E<span>)</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Returning errors instead of throwing them is a paradigm shift in error handling. If you’re new to Rust, there will be some friction initially as it requires you to reason about errors in a different way.</p>
<p>In this post, I’ll go through some common error handling patterns so you gradually become familiar with how things are done in Rust:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ignore the error</li>
<li>Terminate the program</li>
<li>Use a fallback value</li>
<li>Bubble up the error</li>
<li>Bubble up multiple errors</li>
<li>Match boxed errors</li>
<li>Libraries vs Applications</li>
<li>Create custom errors</li>
<li>Bubble up custom errors</li>
<li>Match custom errors</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Ignore-the-error"><a href="#Ignore-the-error" title="Ignore the error"></a>Ignore the error</h2><p>Let’s start with the simplest scenario where we just ignore the error. This sounds careless but has a couple of legitimate use cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>We’re prototyping our code and don’t want to spend time on error handling.</li>
<li>We’re confident that the error won’t occur.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s say that we’re reading a file which we’re pretty sure would be present:</p>
<pre><code><span>use</span> std<span>:</span><span>:</span>fs<span>;</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> content <span>=</span> fs<span>:</span><span>:</span><span>read_to_string</span><span>(</span><span>"./Cargo.toml"</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>unwrap</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span> content<span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Even though we know that the file would be present, the compiler has no way of knowing that. So we use <code>unwrap</code> to tell the compiler to trust us and return the value inside. If the <code>read_to_string</code> function returns an <code>Ok()</code> value, <code>unwrap</code> will get the contents of <code>Ok</code> and assign it to the <code>content</code> variable. If it returns an error, it will “panic”. Panic either terminates the program or exits the current thread.</p>
<p>Note that <code>unwrap</code> is used in quite a lot of Rust examples to skip error handling. This is mostly done for convenience and shouldn’t be used in real code as it is.</p>
<h2 id="Terminate-the-program"><a href="#Terminate-the-program" title="Terminate the program"></a>Terminate the program</h2><p>Some errors cannot be handled or recovered from. In these cases, it’s better to <em>fail fast</em> by terminating the program.</p>
<p>Let’s use the same example as above - we’re reading a file which we’re sure to be present. Let’s imagine that, for this program, that file is absolutely important without which it won’t work properly. If for some reason, this file is absent, it’s better to terminate the program.</p>
<p>We can use <code>unwrap</code> as before or use <code>expect</code> - it’s same as <code>unwrap</code> but lets us add extra error message.</p>
<pre><code><span>use</span> std<span>:</span><span>:</span>fs<span>;</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> content <span>=</span> fs<span>:</span><span>:</span><span>read_to_string</span><span>(</span><span>"./Cargo.toml"</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>expect</span><span>(</span><span>"Can't read Cargo.toml"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span> content<span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>See also: <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.panic.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>panic!</code></a></p>
<h2 id="Use-a-fallback-value"><a href="#Use-a-fallback-value" title="Use a fallback value"></a>Use a fallback value</h2><p>In some cases, you can handle the error by falling back to a default value.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say we’re writing a server and the port it listens to can be configured using an environment variable. If the environment variable is not set, accessing that value would result in an error. But we can easily handle that by falling back to a default value.</p>
<pre><code><span>use</span> std<span>:</span><span>:</span>env<span>;</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> port <span>=</span> env<span>:</span><span>:</span><span>var</span><span>(</span><span>"PORT"</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>unwrap_or</span><span>(</span><span>"3000"</span><span>.</span><span>to_string</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span> port<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Here, we’ve used a variation of <code>unwrap</code> called <code>unwrap_or</code> which lets us supply default values.</p>
<p>See also: <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/enum.Result.html#method.unwrap_or_else" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>unwrap_or_else</code></a>, <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/enum.Result.html#method.unwrap_or_default" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>unwrap_or_default</code></a></p>
<h2 id="Bubble-up-the-error"><a href="#Bubble-up-the-error" title="Bubble up the error"></a>Bubble up the error</h2><p>When you don’t have enough context to handle the error, you can bubble up (propagate) the error to the caller function.</p>
<p>Here’s a contrived example which uses a webservice to get the current year:</p>
<pre><code><span>use</span> std<span>:</span><span>:</span>collections<span>:</span><span>:</span>HashMap<span>;</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>match</span> <span>get_current_date</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Ok</span><span>(</span>date<span>)</span> <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"We've time travelled to {}!!"</span><span>,</span> date<span>)</span><span>,</span>
    <span>Err</span><span>(</span>e<span>)</span> <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>eprintln!</span><span>(</span><span>"Oh noes, we don't know which era we're in! :( \n  {}"</span><span>,</span> e<span>)</span><span>,</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>get_current_date</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> Result<span>&lt;</span>String<span>,</span> reqwest<span>:</span><span>:</span>Error<span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> url <span>=</span> <span>"https://postman-echo.com/time/object"</span><span>;</span>
  <span>let</span> result <span>=</span> reqwest<span>:</span><span>:</span>blocking<span>:</span><span>:</span><span>get</span><span>(</span>url<span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>let</span> response <span>=</span> <span>match</span> result <span>{</span>
    <span>Ok</span><span>(</span>res<span>)</span> <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> res<span>,</span>
    <span>Err</span><span>(</span>err<span>)</span> <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>return</span> <span>Err</span><span>(</span>err<span>)</span><span>,</span>
  <span>}</span><span>;</span>

  <span>let</span> body <span>=</span> response<span>.</span>json<span>:</span><span>:</span><span>&lt;</span>HashMap<span>&lt;</span>String<span>,</span> i32<span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>let</span> json <span>=</span> <span>match</span> body <span>{</span>
    <span>Ok</span><span>(</span>json<span>)</span> <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> json<span>,</span>
    <span>Err</span><span>(</span>err<span>)</span> <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>return</span> <span>Err</span><span>(</span>err<span>)</span><span>,</span>
  <span>}</span><span>;</span>

  <span>let</span> date <span>=</span> json<span>[</span><span>"years"</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>to_string</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>Ok</span><span>(</span>date<span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>There are two function calls inside the <code>get_current_date</code> function (<code>get</code> and <code>json</code>) that return <code>Result</code> values. Since <code>get_current_date</code> doesn’t have context of what to do when they return errors, it uses pattern matching to propagate the errors to <code>main</code>.</p>
<p>Using pattern matching to handle multiple or nested errors can make your code “noisy”. Instead, we can rewrite the above code using the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch09-02-recoverable-errors-with-result.html#a-shortcut-for-propagating-errors-the--operator" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>?</code> operator</a>:</p>
<pre><code><span>use</span> std<span>:</span><span>:</span>collections<span>:</span><span>:</span>HashMap<span>;</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>match</span> <span>get_current_date</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>Ok</span><span>(</span>date<span>)</span> <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"We've time travelled to {}!!"</span><span>,</span> date<span>)</span><span>,</span>
    <span>Err</span><span>(</span>e<span>)</span> <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>eprintln!</span><span>(</span><span>"Oh noes, we don't know which era we're in! :( \n  {}"</span><span>,</span> e<span>)</span><span>,</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>get_current_date</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> Result<span>&lt;</span>String<span>,</span> reqwest<span>:</span><span>:</span>Error<span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> url <span>=</span> <span>"https://postman-echo.com/time/object"</span><span>;</span>
  <span>let</span> res <span>=</span> reqwest<span>:</span><span>:</span>blocking<span>:</span><span>:</span><span>get</span><span>(</span>url<span>)</span>?<span>.</span>json<span>:</span><span>:</span><span>&lt;</span>HashMap<span>&lt;</span>String<span>,</span> i32<span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>?<span>;</span>
  <span>let</span> date <span>=</span> res<span>[</span><span>"years"</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>to_string</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>Ok</span><span>(</span>date<span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>This looks much cleaner!</p>
<p>The <code>?</code> operator is similar to <code>unwrap</code> but instead of panicking, it propagates the error to the calling function. One thing to keep in mind is that we can use the <code>?</code> operator only for functions that return a <code>Result</code> or <code>Option</code> type.</p>
<h2 id="Bubble-up-multiple-errors"><a href="#Bubble-up-multiple-errors" title="Bubble up multiple errors"></a>Bubble up multiple errors</h2><p>In the previous example, the <code>get</code> and <code>json</code> functions return a <code>reqwest::Error</code> error which we’ve propagated using the <code>?</code> operator. But what if we’ve another function call that returned a different error value?</p>
<p>Let’s extend the previous example by returning a formatted date instead of the year:</p>
<pre><code><span>+ use chrono::NaiveDate;</span>
  use std::collections::HashMap;

  fn main() {
    match get_current_date() {
      Ok(date) =&gt; println!("We've time travelled to {}!!", date),
      Err(e) =&gt; eprintln!("Oh noes, we don't know which era we're in! :( \n  {}", e),
    }
  }

  fn get_current_date() -&gt; Result&lt;String, reqwest::Error&gt; {
    let url = "https://postman-echo.com/time/object";
    let res = reqwest::blocking::get(url)?.json::&lt;HashMap&lt;String, i32&gt;&gt;()?;
<span>-   let date = res["years"].to_string();</span>
<span>+   let formatted_date = format!("{}-{}-{}", res["years"], res["months"] + 1, res["date"]);</span>
<span>+   let parsed_date = NaiveDate::parse_from_str(formatted_date.as_str(), "%Y-%m-%d")?;</span>
<span>+   let date = parsed_date.format("%Y %B %d").to_string();</span>

    Ok(date)
  }</code></pre>
<p>The above code won’t compile as <code>parse_from_str</code> returns a <code>chrono::format::ParseError</code> error and not <code>reqwest::Error</code>.</p>
<p>We can fix this by <code>Box</code>ing the errors:</p>
<pre><code>  use chrono::NaiveDate;
  use std::collections::HashMap;

  fn main() {
    match get_current_date() {
      Ok(date) =&gt; println!("We've time travelled to {}!!", date),
      Err(e) =&gt; eprintln!("Oh noes, we don't know which era we're in! :( \n  {}", e),
    }
  }

<span>- fn get_current_date() -&gt; Result&lt;String, reqwest::Error&gt; {</span>
<span>+ fn get_current_date() -&gt; Result&lt;String, Box&lt;dyn std::error::Error&gt;&gt; {</span>
    let url = "https://postman-echo.com/time/object";
    let res = reqwest::blocking::get(url)?.json::&lt;HashMap&lt;String, i32&gt;&gt;()?;

    let formatted_date = format!("{}-{}-{}", res["years"], res["months"] + 1, res["date"]);
    let parsed_date = NaiveDate::parse_from_str(formatted_date.as_str(), "%Y-%m-%d")?;
    let date = parsed_date.format("%Y %B %d").to_string();

    Ok(date)
  }</code></pre>
<p>Returning a trait object <code>Box&lt;dyn std::error::Error&gt;</code> is very convenient when we want to return multiple errors!</p>

<h2 id="Match-boxed-errors"><a href="#Match-boxed-errors" title="Match boxed errors"></a>Match boxed errors</h2><p>So far, we’ve only printed the errors in the <code>main</code> function but not handled them. If we want to handle and recover from boxed errors, we need to “downcast” them:</p>
<pre><code>  use chrono::NaiveDate;
  use std::collections::HashMap;

  fn main() {
    match get_current_date() {
      Ok(date) =&gt; println!("We've time travelled to {}!!", date),
<span>-     Err(e) =&gt; eprintln!("Oh noes, we don't know which era we're in! :( \n  {}", e),</span>
<span>+     Err(e) =&gt; {</span>
<span>+       eprintln!("Oh noes, we don't know which era we're in! :(");</span>
<span>+       if let Some(err) = e.downcast_ref::&lt;reqwest::Error&gt;() {</span>
<span>+         eprintln!("Request Error: {}", err)</span>
<span>+       } else if let Some(err) = e.downcast_ref::&lt;chrono::format::ParseError&gt;() {</span>
<span>+         eprintln!("Parse Error: {}", err)</span>
<span>+       }</span>
<span>+     }</span>
    }
  }

  fn get_current_date() -&gt; Result&lt;String, Box&lt;dyn std::error::Error&gt;&gt; {
    let url = "https://postman-echo.com/time/object";
    let res = reqwest::blocking::get(url)?.json::&lt;HashMap&lt;String, i32&gt;&gt;()?;

    let formatted_date = format!("{}-{}-{}", res["years"], res["months"] + 1, res["date"]);
    let parsed_date = NaiveDate::parse_from_str(formatted_date.as_str(), "%Y-%m-%d")?;
    let date = parsed_date.format("%Y %B %d").to_string();

    Ok(date)
  }</code></pre>
<p>Notice how we need to be aware of the implementation details (different errors inside) of <code>get_current_date</code> to be able to downcast them inside <code>main</code>.</p>
<p>See also: <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/error/trait.Error.html#method.downcast" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>downcast</code></a>, <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/error/trait.Error.html#method.downcast_mut" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>downcast_mut</code></a></p>
<h2 id="Applications-vs-Libraries"><a href="#Applications-vs-Libraries" title="Applications vs Libraries"></a>Applications vs Libraries</h2><p>As mentioned previously, the downside to boxed errors is that if we want to handle the underlying errors, we need to be aware of the implementation details. When we return something as <code>Box&lt;dyn std::error::Error&gt;</code>, the concrete type information is erased. To handle the different errors in different ways, we need to downcast them to concrete types and this casting can fail at runtime.</p>
<p>However, saying something is a “downside” is not very useful without context. A good rule of thumb is to question whether the code you’re writing is an “application” or a “library”:</p>
<h3 id="Application"><a href="#Application" title="Application"></a>Application</h3><ul>
<li>The code you’re writing would be used by end users.</li>
<li>Most errors generated by application code won’t be handled but instead logged or reported to the user.</li>
<li>It’s okay to use boxed errors.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Library"><a href="#Library" title="Library"></a>Library</h3><ul>
<li>The code you’re writing would be consumed by other code. A “library” can be open source crates, internal libraries etc</li>
<li>Errors are part of your library’s API, so your consumers know what errors to expect and recover from.</li>
<li>Errors from your library are often handled by your consumers so they need to be structured and easy to perform <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.30.0/book/2018-edition/ch06-02-match.html#matches-are-exhaustive" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exhaustive match</a> on.</li>
<li>If you return boxed errors, then …</li></ul></div></div>

<p>TL;DR – Hierarchically arranged API gateways can be used to build “macro” bounded contexts. This can make microservices “less”of a problem by reducing them to an implementation detail within that macro context. This results in a simplified architecture composed of stable interactions between hierarchical domain boundaries.</p>
<hr>
<p>Microservice architectures have many advantages as well disadvantages, and the internet is rife with debate about the size of a “micro”-service. A less talked about problem is the “conceptual sprawl” that individual microservices modelling a rich problem space create. There can be dozens or hundreds of well-defined bounded contexts each represented by a microservice.</p>
<p>However, discovering the right combination of these services to fulfil a new business requirement becomes an increasing challenge. Each individual part (service) may be well designed, but we start losing our way in the exponential number of interactions between them.</p>

<h3>Case Study : Backend for Frontend</h3>
<p>A “backend for frontend” is a service supporting a frontend by combining data from multiple underlying services. This is the node server backing a react app, the controller layer behind thymeleaf/JSP pages and so on.<br>Let’s walk through how new UIs are often built. The first version almost always directly calls existing APIs across many services (likely because there aren’t many such calls). As more and more services need to be called and their data merged into each other in more complicated ways, a debate arises as to whether all this should be done in the frontend or the backend and which team should do this.</p>
<p>The typical response these days is to spin off a “service” which does whatever the frontend team wants it to do.</p>
<figure><img src="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/custom-backend-for-frontend-1024x888.jpg" data-src="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/custom-backend-for-frontend-1024x888.jpg" alt="" data-srcset="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/custom-backend-for-frontend-1024x888.jpg 1024w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/custom-backend-for-frontend-300x260.jpg 300w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/custom-backend-for-frontend-768x666.jpg 768w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/custom-backend-for-frontend-1070x928.jpg 1070w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/custom-backend-for-frontend.jpg 1330w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/custom-backend-for-frontend-1024x888.jpg 1024w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/custom-backend-for-frontend-300x260.jpg 300w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/custom-backend-for-frontend-768x666.jpg 768w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/custom-backend-for-frontend-1070x928.jpg 1070w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/custom-backend-for-frontend.jpg 1330w"></figure>
<p>While we can think of this new service as a system that supports a particular UI, what it is actually doing is providing an abstraction that allows the frontend to have only a limited exposure to the full complexity of the backend.</p>
<h3>The Cognitive Overhead Problem</h3>
<p>The problem described above happens because a single frontend team cannot possibly deal with a microservice-based backend fragmented into tiny “domain” capsules exposed all at once. The cognitive overhead in combining these tiny pieces into larger things is tremendous. One has to understand all of them as they relate to each other and the ways they communicate with each other (e.g. are they eventually consistent with each other? Do they have independent state machines and how do they relate to each other?).</p>
<p>The other problem is that the underlying architecture is constantly shifting, with more microservices coming up, services getting deprecated and changing contracts etc. All this makes our “abstraction service” brittle. The microservice owners have to be on the lookout for all consumers lest they break them with any change. Service users are always tinkering with their service to keep it in line with the underlying services. Migrations become a permanent fixture on the sprint board.</p>

<p>Given this scenario, a specialized solution in the form of one service for one UI is actually a good solution – it is the only way to move forward! Anyone looking to combine information across multiple domains as defined by each microservice has to create a solution of their own because that is all they can do.</p>
<p>But in the larger scheme of things, this is clearly not a good place to be in. How can we reduce this complexity in combining things so that we are better able to leverage the existing systems?</p>

<h3>Organization in Complex Systems</h3>
<p>Here’s a quick, shallow recap of organization in complex systems.<br>Complex systems are made of hierarchies of independent subsystems. The hierarchical arrangement emerges as an evolutionary response to changing environment and leads to more and more sophisticated features. Each level is a response to needs faced by one or more lower level systems and it abstracts their details while still facilitating their functioning. The overall system is therefore partially resilient to failure of its somewhat independent subsystems. Collectively, this gives to an ever rising dynamic complexity which is highly resilient and adaptive.</p>

<p>If this sounds remarkably similar to distributed system design (buzzwords et al) because it is. Large distributed systems are rich complex systems with all constituent parts interacting with each other and triggering concurrent changes in each other. So let’s try to bring some systems thinking to bear on the problem of custom backends-for-frontends.</p>
<p>The custom backend-for-frontend we just saw is the microservice architecture’s highly specialized evolutionary response to the pressure of the external world, viz. the functional requirements of the frontend and the limited time in which to meet those requirements. Evolutionary timescales are generally long because the system tries out many combinations before “discovering” what works best in the new environment. However, by putting a timeline on “survival” we have hamstrung the usual mechanics resulting in a system response much like growing corns to protect against shoes that pinch instead of allowing better shoes to “emerge”.</p>
<figure><img src="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/coevolving-systems-and-environment-1024x826.jpg" data-src="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/coevolving-systems-and-environment-1024x826.jpg" alt="" data-srcset="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/coevolving-systems-and-environment-1024x826.jpg 1024w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/coevolving-systems-and-environment-300x242.jpg 300w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/coevolving-systems-and-environment-768x620.jpg 768w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/coevolving-systems-and-environment-1070x863.jpg 1070w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/coevolving-systems-and-environment.jpg 1490w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/coevolving-systems-and-environment-1024x826.jpg 1024w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/coevolving-systems-and-environment-300x242.jpg 300w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/coevolving-systems-and-environment-768x620.jpg 768w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/coevolving-systems-and-environment-1070x863.jpg 1070w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/coevolving-systems-and-environment.jpg 1490w"></figure>
<p>The evolutionary pressure is also intense because there is no sense of hierarchy in our microservice architecture. The entire complexity of the domain is laid bare all at once to everyone. While upstream-downstream relationships can be inferred between domains looking at data and call flow, there is no concept of hierarchy of ideas that can simplify comprehension for new users.</p>
<p>So while domains are the building blocks of our systems, we have not yet managed to layer these building blocks in layers of increasing complexity in representation and function.</p>
<h3>Domain Modelling is Hierarchical</h3>
<p>Bounded contexts are the philosophical building blocks of microservice architectures. If we want to layer our architecture, we need to layer our concepts. And as you might imagine, this is not difficult at all! We have the entire organization’s structure to be inspired, and since domain driven systems tie in very closely with how organizations are organized, there is plenty of opportunity to copy-paste.</p>
<p>Our organization’s structure clearly tells us that a “domain” can mean very different things at different levels of abstractions. As soon as we say “abstraction”, we know that we are in a hierarchical world.</p>
<p>If you have ever seen a junior developer try to explain a production outage to a senior manager, you know what I am talking about. The minutiae of system implementation don’t matter to the senior manager because at his level of operation, “outage due to timeout in calling payment authentication service from checkout validator service” is interpreted as “outage in checkout due to payment system”. He doesn’t care about “timeout”, “authentication”, “validator” or “service” – he cares about “checkout”, “outage”, and “payment”. The CEO doesn’t even care about “checkout” and “payment”, he probably just hears “tech” and “outage”.</p>
<p>This gives us a direct line to solving our problem – let’s bundle our bounded contexts in a way that all contexts in one group can be represented by one word. This is the reverse process of how we break down the system into microservices; a microservice-to-monolith migration, if you will.</p>
<h3>Representing domain hierarchies</h3>
<p>So we want to bundle multiple closely allied domains (physically represented by their corresponding microservices) into a single umbrella.and then those umbrellas into a larger umbrella and so on. Note that the bundling process is subjective because people can disagree with what “closely allied” means. An instinct for naming is a good guide – the collective name should not sound dissonant from the individuals.</p>
<figure><img src="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/domain-boundaries-1024x760.jpg" data-src="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/domain-boundaries-1024x760.jpg" alt="" data-srcset="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/domain-boundaries-1024x760.jpg 1024w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/domain-boundaries-300x223.jpg 300w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/domain-boundaries-768x570.jpg 768w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/domain-boundaries-1070x794.jpg 1070w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/domain-boundaries.jpg 1417w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/domain-boundaries-1024x760.jpg 1024w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/domain-boundaries-300x223.jpg 300w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/domain-boundaries-768x570.jpg 768w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/domain-boundaries-1070x794.jpg 1070w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/domain-boundaries.jpg 1417w"></figure>
<p>In the real world, a higher level domain can be represented by a separate team (Payment Coordination Team) or a separate manager at a certain level (VP, Director, Architect etc). How do we do this in the technical world? If we want to build an interface that can span across multiple internal systems and combine them into a cohesive experience wrt system vocabulary and capabilities, then we need not look farther than an API Gateway.</p>
<h3>API Gateways</h3>
<p>API gateways are used as single points of ingress and egress of data from the system. They are typically the points where administrative functions like authentication, rate limiting etc are applied. Companies often employ “public” API gateways to expose a limited subset of their tech stack to external users (external meaning any software not running on the company’s servers, including mobile apps).</p>
<figure><img src="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/api-gateway-1024x938.jpg" data-src="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/api-gateway-1024x938.jpg" alt="" data-srcset="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/api-gateway-1024x938.jpg 1024w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/api-gateway-300x275.jpg 300w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/api-gateway-768x703.jpg 768w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/api-gateway-1070x980.jpg 1070w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/api-gateway.jpg 1462w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/api-gateway-1024x938.jpg 1024w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/api-gateway-300x275.jpg 300w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/api-gateway-768x703.jpg 768w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/api-gateway-1070x980.jpg 1070w, https://kislayverma.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/api-gateway.jpg 1462w"></figure>
<p>The traditional role of API gateways has been that of gatekeepers of all traffic coming into the company. They are meant to be lightweight with no business logic (though they may contain minimal schema transformations), and they often expose an aggregate of the capabilities of multiple internal components as a single unit. E.g. Signing up for a website via its API gateway might create an account in the “User Service” and create a newsletter subscription in the “Newsletter Service” in one go.</p>
<h3>API Gateway as domain boundaries</h3>
<p>The backend-for-frontend we saw earlier is essentially an API gateway designed from the wrong side, i.e., by consumers of the API rather than publishers of APIs. The consumer is compelled to do so because no standard conceptual hierarchies exist for them to leverage.</p>
<p>We can apply this API gateway’s aggregation capability in an internal context to develop coarse-grained system boundaries between our microservices to model hierarchical domains. We can hide the microsevices we had previously put under the same umbrella behind an API gateway which now represents the new domain boundary. No one is allowed to call these services directly. Any capabilities that need to be exposed must be exposed via the API gateway.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>Every once in a while, a new product comes along and changes everything — the way we work, the way we think, and how we behave.</p><p>Open up any blog post on product management and it’ll tell you to solve a problem. The key, it would say, is to understand your customers. While people may be accurate commentators on the problem they’re facing and the emotional state it causes — usually pain and frustration — the causes of that emotional state are often unknown to them. </p><p>This is often the reason why features don’t get adopted by the very same customer who demanded it in the first place. </p><blockquote>For all the talk of providing value to customers, there’s a significant and often unspoken factor at work in great products: uncertainty. </blockquote><p>Just last week, I made a rather expensive purchase on an e-commerce store and received a message saying it would arrive the following day between 9am and 9pm. My problem was, I had to go to work the following day and nobody would be at home to collect the package. </p><p>I know it’s bad news, but I didn’t have sufficient information to act on it. What if they delivered the package at 1pm? I couldn’t risk losing it. After all, I did spend a fortune on it. By taking the day off, I was sure to receive my package, but the degree of uncertainty involved in waiting for the delivery person to show up was still a form of mental torture.</p><p>Anyone who has spent even a few hours waiting for their package to arrive knows that it’s a bit like being in a house arrest. You can’t have a bath or pop out to get a bag of crisps, because you fear that the second you do, the delivery guy will turn up. </p><p>Similarly, <strong>for all the technological prowess that Google Maps achieved, its greater achievement is psychologically removing not just the uncertainty of how to get from point A to B, but also the time it would take to get there</strong>. The number of billion-dollar companies who deliver their primary value using this method is just staggering — Uber, Lyft, food delivery apps, to name a few.</p><figure><img src="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/02/uber-arriving.jpg" alt="How good product managers at car sharing and food delivery apps remove uncertainty"><figcaption>Uber removes uncertainty by showing you where your cab is and when it'll arrive</figcaption></figure><p>Today, it would be weird to go on a road trip with an extra passenger whose only job throughout the journey is to look at a giant A3 paper and ensure you’re going in the right direction. </p><h2 id="not-just-in-tech-uncertainties-are-everywhere">Not just in tech, uncertainties are everywhere</h2><p>The city I live in has suburban and metro trains, both of which have a frequency of one train arriving every 10 minutes on a weekday. </p><p>However, when waiting for a train to arrive, the levels of anxiety displayed by passengers who use the suburbs is rather high and visible. They’d be fidgeting and be looking at the railway track to see if there’s any visible sign of a train arriving. On the other hand, folks who use metros are calm, often busy watching Tik-tok videos, and sometimes even walk out for a quick bite before the train arrives.</p><p><strong>The only difference between the suburban station and a metro station, apart from the obvious cost per ticket, is the display that’s put in place on every platform at a metro station that tells people precisely when the next train will arrive.</strong></p><p>Similarly, if you’re feeling rather mischievous and you’re looking to create chaos in an airport, all you have to do is remove the information on how long the flight is delayed from the departure board. Because anyone who has had their flight delayed also knows that “delayed” is merely a predecessor to “cancelled”. </p><blockquote>The loss of power and control that uncertainties create can cause far stronger feelings of annoyance. </blockquote><p>You can see similar examples at play in traffic signals where you have a countdown timer of when the signal will go from red to green. </p><hr><p>Which brings me to an interesting point in building products and features. </p><p>Luckily, most of us are already spending time and energy removing uncertainties on things like onboarding or things related to payments —sending payment receipts quickly. But it doesn’t have to stop there.</p><p>Regardless of your industry and target audience, uncertainty in the minds of your customers play a significant role in the success of your product. By identifying where those uncertainties lie in their daily workflow and solving for them within your product, you can bolster your product’s quality and its metrics.</p><p>So, the next time you sit down with your team to build a new feature or <a href="https://zepel.io/blog/product-improvement/?utm_source=zepelblog&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=best-pm-remove-uncertainties">improve an existing one</a>, be sure to also ask what uncertainty you’re removing. </p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At the start of this year I decided I'd had enough.</p>
<p>I've been writing software and making games since my early teens and for most of my life I've worked on side projects. Some of them made a little money. Others grew a large following. Quite a few failed miserably.</p>
<p>My last project was an open source game development library called <a href="https://github.com/craftworkgames/MonoGame.Extended" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><strong>MonoGame.Extended</strong></a>. Relative to my previous projects, this project felt very successful. Many hundreds of people starred it on Github. Loads of people joined the Discord chat and it even has it's own tag on Stack Overflow. To this day, people are still using it to make their games.</p>
<p>I always assumed that one day I'd be able to turn it into some side income and maybe eventually replace my full-time job.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But I always felt like something wasn't quite working.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I tried my very best to help indie game developers make their games. In the beginning the project really resonated with people. Lots of contributors joined to add new features and a community formed around it quite quickly. This felt amazing.</p>
<p>However, this little side project took 5 years of my life. It's the longest amount of time I'd ever spent on anything outside my marriage and kids.</p>
<p>And what did I have to show for it? A bit of pocket money and a whole lot of support requests. As the project got bigger, it put more strain on my limited free time. Eventually it broke me.</p>
<p>Compare that to a game I'd previously published that only took 3 weeks to create and made roughly the same amount of monthly revenue.</p>
<p>Then around Christmas I was talking to my dad about his recent retirement. This conversation got me thinking a lot about what I want to do with the next 10 to 20 years of my life. Where do I want to be when I retire?</p>
<p>That's when I decided it was time to do something else.</p>
<h2 id="the-lesson-i-learned-about-failure">The Lesson I Learned about Failure</h2>
<p>After taking some time to reflect on all of my previous projects I realized that failure comes in many forms and some are better than others.</p>
<p>I don't have a problem with failure. Not every project works out the way you want and that's okay.</p>
<p>For example, some of my previous projects didn't have <em>market fit</em>. When I launched them into the world, nobody really cared. Luckily when this happens early in the project it's not a big deal. Either discard the idea and move on or figure out how to make it work.</p>
<p>Another project I started didn't have <em>founder fit</em>. In other words, I initially got excited about the idea and it looked great on paper but over time I really didn't want to work on it anymore.</p>
<p>But the worst kind of failure I've experienced is <em>failure disguised as success</em>. The mistake I made was not recognizing failure early enough. Surprisingly, this was an easy trap to fall into because when it looks like things are working, it feels like just a little more effort will bring everything together.</p>
<p>Unforutnately, more effort applied in the wrong place makes it worse. When the project was small it was easy to manage and I enjoyed working on it everyday. At the time it seemed like a good idea to keep adding more features and watch as more people started using it. But the downside of adding more features is that it becomes increasingly time intensive to fix bugs, update demos, deal with pull requests and respond to questions.</p>
<p>This wouldn't have been so bad if I wasn't doing it all for free. I knew at some point I needed to start generating income to be able to dedicate more time to the project. So I launched a Patreon page and immediately had a few people support me finanically. This positive feedback fueled my desire to keep going. Only now, I had another job, creating content to reward my patrons.</p>
<p>I never figured out how to make it work and it was suprisingly difficult to let go.</p>
<h2 id="quitting-was-the-best-thing-i-ever-did">Quitting Was the Best Thing I Ever Did</h2>
<p>Eventually I decided to stop working on <strong>MonoGame.Extended</strong> and handed the project over to someone else.</p>
<p>At first, this was a really hard decision. It felt like I was throwing away thousands of hours of work and letting down the community around it. But really, it was just a bad case of <strong>sunk cost fallacy.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The sunk cost fallacy is when people continue a behavior or endeavor as a result of previously invested resources (time, money or effort)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I now firmly believe this was the right choice. The project is still alive and being actively worked on by long time contibutors that use it. Having a new set of eyes on the code base has breathed new life into it.</p>
<p>What I got out of it was a wealth of experience, a chance to reflect and really think about what I wanted to do next.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-am-i-going-to-do-next">So, What Am I Going To Do Next?</h2>
<p>I recently discovered a whole new world of <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">indie hackers</a> creating profitable side projects in their spare time. It's an amazing feeling to find a community of like minded people doing what I've always wanted to do.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've finally found my people.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many years ago, before I started spending all my time on MonoGame.Extended I built and launched several products. Sometimes they where games and other times it was an app or tool to solve my own problems.</p>
<p>My goal is to get back to my roots. Only this time I've got more experience under my belt. I've learned a lot about building an audience, finding a market, and launching great products.</p>
<p>There's still a mountain of work ahead but I'm excited to be starting the next phase of my journey.</p>
<p>Succeed or fail I'll be writing about it here. If you'd like to see what happens next I'd love to have you on the mailing list below.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>June, 2017: my partner Eve and I are stuck at the visa-on-arrival desk in the domestic transfer wing of Bole International Airport, Addis Ababa. The rest of the transfer passengers, all Ethiopian, are waltzing past us to form a monster queue at passport control. As soon as I get my precious stamp, I sprint off to hold our place before more passengers sneak in front of us.</p><p>Ten minutes later, Eve finds me, groggy from our redeye and nonplussed about navigating the Ethiopian visa desk on her own. “Why did you have to run off like that?!” Somehow, “so that we could wait at the departure gate instead of in the passport control line” doesn’t seem like a very good reason.</p><p>It was at this moment that I realized I was an unreasonably impatient person.</p><p>(In retrospect, I probably should have been tipped off by my compulsion of doing a mental <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_path_method" target="_blank">critical path analysis</a> on any everyday activity taking more than 15 seconds, but I just thought that was normal until I started dating people and noticed they often did things in a sub-optimal order.)</p><hr><p>Now that I’ve confessed to the sin of impatience, I’m going to spend the rest of this post trying to convince you that it’s actually a good thing.</p><p>(The good part is the habit of frequently asking yourself “how could this thing take less calendar time.” I don’t recommend manifesting it in annoying ways like ditching your partner in an Ethiopian airport.)</p><p>Being impatient is the best way to get faster at things. And across a surprising number of domains, being really fast correlates strongly with being effective.</p><p>Obviously, lots of these are non-causal correlations. Still, the sheer number of different datapoints is a surprising convergence:</p><h3 id="e-mail">E-mail</h3><p>It seems trivial, but lots of different people have observed that being slow to respond to emails is a bad sign, or that famous people whom you’d expect to be swamped respond surprisingly quickly.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/sriramk/status/1214278840358359040" target="_blank">Sriram Krishnan</a>:</p><blockquote><ul><li><p>the most famous, interesting, powerful people all read their own email</p></li><li><p>they’re almost universally good at responding to it quickly</p></li><li><p>they’re always very, very curious.</p></li><li><p>they have very little time. Anything with friction gets done “later”</p></li></ul></blockquote><p><a href="https://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-invest-in-startups" target="_blank">Sam Altman</a>:</p><blockquote><p>people tend to be either slow movers or fast movers and that seems harder to change. Being a fast mover is a big thing; a somewhat trivial example is that I have almost never made money investing in founders who do not respond quickly to important emails.</p></blockquote><h3 id="startups">Startups</h3><p>It’s become common wisdom that launching (and iterating) quickly is a major factor behind whether startups succeed.</p><p><a href="https://startupclass.samaltman.com/courses/lec02/" target="_blank">Sam Altman again</a>:</p><blockquote><p>[Y]ou have to be decisive. Indecisiveness is a startup killer. Mediocre founders spend a lot of time talking about grand plans, but they never make a decision. They’re talking about you know I could do this thing, or I could do that other thing, and they’re going back and forth and they never act. And what you actually need is this bias towards action.</p><p>The best founders work on things that seem small but they move really quickly. But they get things done really quickly. Every time you talk to the best founders they’ve gotten new things done. In fact, this is the one thing that we learned best predicts a success of founders in YC. If every time we talk to a team they’ve gotten new things done, that’s the best predictor we have that a company will be successful.</p></blockquote><p>This propagates even down to the level of how quickly you deploy software changes. <a href="https://twitter.com/schrockn/status/1130569945891258369" target="_blank">Nick Schrock</a> on Facebook / Instagram moving fast and breaking things:</p><blockquote><p>Instagram was even faster operationally than Facebook. They had continuous deployment. Any engineer could deploy at any time (they would run a command called “Yolout” lol). Facebook was on weekly deploys at the time on the web and way slower on mobile.</p><p>IG story definitely lends credibility to the those-who-ship-faster-win argument</p><p>…Worth noting that Facebook learned from this. As the company grew, the release cadence got faster. First daily, then twice daily, and it is now continuous. It’s a remarkable achievement by the release engineering team.</p></blockquote><p>It’s not just Facebook; <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Accelerate-Software-Performing-Technology-Organizations-ebook/dp/B07B9F83WM/" target="_blank"><em>Accelerate</em> found a strong correlation between deploy frequency and performance</a>:</p><blockquote><p>To summarize, in 2017 we found that, when compared to low performers, the high performers have:</p><ul><li><p>46 times more frequent code deployments</p></li><li><p>440 times faster lead time from commit to deploy</p></li></ul></blockquote><h3 id="appstools">Apps/tools</h3><p>The “speed matters a lot” principle applies even to things that are already very fast. Google has found that <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/why-performance-matters" target="_blank">users <em>dramatically</em> prefer faster webpages</a>:</p><blockquote><ul><li><p>The BBC found they lost an additional 10% of users for every additional second their site took to load.</p></li><li><p>DoubleClick by Google found 53% of mobile site visits were abandoned if a page took longer than 3 seconds to load.</p></li></ul><p>…</p><ul><li>When AutoAnything reduced page load time by half, they saw a boost of 12-13% in sales.</li></ul></blockquote><p><a href="https://jsomers.net/blog/speed-matters" target="_blank">James Somers</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Google famously prioritized speed as a feature. They realized that if search is fast, you’re more likely to search. The reason is that it encourages you to try stuff, get feedback, and try again. When a thought occurs to you, you know Google is already there. There is no delay between thought and action, no opportunity to lose the impulse to find something out. The projected cost of googling is nil. It comes to feel like an extension of your own mind.</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://blog.nelhage.com/post/reflections-on-performance/" target="_blank">Nelson Elhage put it best</a>:</p><blockquote><p>What is perhaps less apparent is that <em>having faster tools changes how users use a tool or perform a task.</em> Users almost always have multiple strategies available to pursue a goal — including deciding to work on something else entirely — and they will choose to use faster tools more and more frequently. Fast tools don’t just allow users to accomplish tasks faster; they allow users to accomplish entirely new types of tasks, in entirely new ways. I’ve seen this phenomenon clearly while working on both Sorbet and Livegrep…</p><p>Many individual tests at Stripe would take 10-20s or more…. Because we succeeded at building Sorbet so that it could typecheck the entire codebase in that time window, it became the fastest way many developers could get decent feedback on their code, to check for basic typos, misused APIs, and other low-hanging classes of errors. Since it was their fastest option, we saw users reaching for Sorbet as their first line of checking their code fairly early on in our development and rollout. Getting even mediocre feedback and some confidence fast was much more important than anything that would take minutes.</p><p>Watching users use livegrep, I’ve seen a related upside from its performance…. Because livegrep is so fast, users use it <em>interactively</em> in a way I’ve rarely seen people interact with other search engines: they enter an initial query, and then, if they get too many or too few results, they edit it based on the result list, which gets a new set of results, which they continue to refine or expand until they hit on the results they are seeking.</p></blockquote><h3 id="personal-workflow">Personal workflow</h3><p><a href="https://blog.samaltman.com/productivity" target="_blank">Sam Altman</a>:</p><blockquote><p>I also made an effort to learn to type really fast and the keyboard shortcuts that help with my workflow.</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/we-are-typists-first-programmers-second/" target="_blank">Steve Yegge via Jeff Atwood</a>:</p><blockquote><p>I was trying to figure out which is the most important computer science course a CS student could ever take, and eventually realized it’s Typing 101.</p><p>The really great engineers I know, the ones who build great things, they can type.</p></blockquote><p>This matches my experience at Wave, where the best engineers are disproportionately likely to type quickly, know their keyboard shortcuts, and have invested a lot of time making their common tasks efficient.</p><p>Obviously, those aren’t the main things that make them good engineers—but I think they help in more than just the obvious ways.</p><h3 id="negotiations">Negotiations</h3><p>At Wave, when hiring, we’ve noticed that moving someone through the hiring process faster makes them <em>much</em> more likely to accept our offer. If we take a long time to get back to them or schedule the next steps, it both gives them more time to lose interest, and makes it seem like we’re not excited about them. Not a good look!</p><p>This is apparently common trope in sales as well—<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/1204077/time-kills-deals" target="_blank">“time kills all deals”</a>.</p><p>Paul Graham on <a href="http://paulgraham.com/ds.html" target="_blank">how the founders of Stripe got time on their side</a>:</p><blockquote><p>At YC we use the term “Collison installation” for the technique they invented. More diffident founders ask “Will you try our beta?” and if the answer is yes, they say “Great, we’ll send you a link.” But the Collison brothers weren’t going to wait. When anyone agreed to try Stripe they’d say “Right then, give me your laptop” and set them up on the spot.</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://avc.com/2018/08/strike-when-the-iron-is-hot/" target="_blank">Fred Wilson</a> on the same effect in networking:</p><blockquote><p>That night when I got home I told the Gotham Gal “I met Danny Meyer today and he gave me his card and said I could call him whenever I need a table.” To which she replied “go there for lunch tomorrow.” And I told her “I don’t have a lunch tomorrow.” She said “Get one. He will remember who you are tomorrow but won’t next month.”</p></blockquote><h3 id="combat">Combat</h3><p>One of the most influential military strategy writers, John Boyd, is most famous for the idea of the “OODA loop:” that human action is an iterated process of <em>observing</em> the world, <em>orienting</em> within it, <em>deciding</em> how to respond and finally <em>acting</em> on the decision. Boyd’s claim was that <em>going through the OODA loop faster was a decisive advantage</em>:</p><blockquote><p>In order to win, we should operate at a faster tempo or rhythm than our adversaries—or, better yet, get inside [the] adversary’s Observation-Orientation-Decision-Action time cycle or loop … Such activity will make us appear ambiguous (unpredictable) thereby generate confusion and disorder among our adversaries—since our adversaries will be unable to generate mental images or pictures that agree with the menacing, as well as faster transient rhythm or patterns, they are competing against.</p></blockquote><p>As a recent example, for instance, many states and countries <a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/macovid/">waited far too long</a> to lock down when the COVID epidemic hit because <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/03/09/plot-economics/" target="_blank">the virus got inside their OODA loop</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Right now, the perception of agency at all levels is falling. Individuals, corporations, governments, heads of state, stock traders, the UN, <em>everybody</em> feels they’re losing the plot, but they don’t see anybody else <em>finding</em> it…. As far …</p></blockquote></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>You may have heard the term <strong>JAMStack</strong> being thrown around a lot recently in web development circles.</p><p><a href="https://jamstack.org/">JAMStack</a> (JAM standing for Javascript, APIs <!-- -->&amp;<!-- --> Markup) is a set of principles for developing web applications.</p><p>In my opinion, the defining features of <strong>JAMStack</strong> can be summarised as follows...</p><ol><li>Statically render your markup</li><li>Use client-side fetching to make your site dynamic</li><li>Decouple your backend from your frontend</li></ol><p>These ideas have been championed by <em>cool</em> developer-tooling companies such as <a href="https://netlify.com/">Netlify</a> (whose founders coined the term), <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a> and a whole bunch of other companies building tools that empower the stack. For example, companies providing CMS products like <a href="https://sanity.io/">Sanity</a> or image hosting like <a href="https://cloudinary.com/">Cloudinary</a>.</p><h2>JAMStack isn't that new</h2><p>Chances are, if your blog is a bunch of static files, then you're already using <strong>JAMStack</strong>. Congratulations. Welcome to the club!</p><h2>JAMStack is being <em>sold</em> to developers</h2><p>The main way this new approach is being pushed forward is by capturing the attention of developers. Of course, these ideas wouldn't mean much to non-developers anyway.</p><p>This has led to what I would say is the <strong>biggest misconception about JAMStack</strong>, and that is... "JAMStack is about Developer Experience".</p><h2>JAMStack Is Not About Developer Experience</h2><p>Don't get me wrong. The developer tooling associated with the <strong>JAMStack</strong> revolution is well built and exciting.</p><p>Separating a messy backend from the frontend can be incredibly empowering for frontend developers. Having full decision-making control over the frontend without being constrained by choices made on the backend can be hugely impactful. Often this leads to more considered and accessible web experiences with an additional performance boost too.</p><p>But <strong>JAMStack</strong> is more than just the look on a developer's face after a really good coding session.</p><p>One of the down sides to <strong>JAMStack</strong> is that there can be so many decisions to make. What framework? Which tools? Which service?</p><p>There are lots of other approaches to web development that have a simpler onboarding process that also don't require you to make so many decisions. For many developers, this alone is a good enough reason to stick to their well-understood, battle-tested tools.</p><p><strong>Developer experience</strong> is subjective.</p><h2>Pushing it to the edge</h2><p>I would argue that <strong>JAMStack</strong> is actually more of a push towards developing web applications that can take full advantage of improvements in cloud technology.</p><p><strong>JAMStack</strong> apps were born to be served on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network">CDNs</a>.</p><p><strong>CDNs</strong> are cloud networks that can serve your content from "edge nodes" in regions all around the world. The advantages of using a <strong>CDN</strong>, as opposed to having a server <em>somewhere</em> in the world, which will probably fall over at some point, is that your application can be <strong>highly available</strong>, <strong>scalable</strong> <!-- -->&amp;<!-- --> <strong>fast</strong> to serve.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Highly available</strong> because if one region goes down, users will just be served up content from the next closest region.</p></li><li><p><strong>Scalable</strong> because web traffic is automatically load balanced.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fast</strong> because <strong>CDNs</strong> are optimised for fast content delivery, wherever you are in the world.</p></li></ul><h2>This is how the world works now</h2><p>The development of this kind of technology is based on the fact that this is how the world works now. The nature of the internet is that your users can be anywhere. Therefore, it is important to make sure that irrespective of where your users are, they will always receive the best service.</p><h2>JAMStack doesn't always make sense</h2><p>On the other hand, deploying your site globally doesn't always make sense.</p><p>Whether you're building internal tools for your company or you just prefer the tried and tested path, you can always make a good argument for not choosing the <strong>JAMStack</strong> way.</p><p>I should also mention that using a <strong>CDN</strong> isn't a unique thing to the <strong>JAMStack</strong>. It feels most natural to use a <strong>CDN</strong> when serving static files but you can serve cached contents from a server-rendered application in the same way. There are added complications, such as cache-invalidation, but many applications run quite happily behind a reverse-proxy cache served through a <strong>CDN</strong> in regions all over the world.</p><p>The difference is, with <strong>JAMStack</strong>, this is delightfully easy.</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>For most developers, the wisest path to tread in 2020 is to build web applications the <strong>JAMStack</strong> way.</p><p>The overall advantage that <strong>JAMStack</strong> gives developers from the start is the opportunity to focus less on deployment and general performance and more about crafting an excellent user experience.</p></section></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>When I was still a kid, I was always so excited to sit in the front passenger seat on holiday trips. You see, there were no navigation devices yet, and thus we had a physical roadmap. My dad frequently knew the route from memory, but I was eager to follow along on the map (and point out when we could find a quicker or alternative route).</p><p>My excitement for maps has not gone away. It's not coincidental that I'm currently writing about roadmaps in another, similar, sense—product roadmaps.</p><p>In general, the power of a map is to help you get to a destination. But how we create and use product roadmaps is essential. <a href="https://www.jibranelbazi.com/blog/why-you-should-look-at-everything-as-a-process">It is a process</a> that is both creative and analytical.</p><p>In this series, I aim to guide you through everything you need to know about creating the ultimate product roadmap. In this first installment, I aim to explain what a product roadmap is and why it's such a great tool.</p><h2>What is the purpose of a product roadmap?</h2><p>Let me first tell you what I feel is a good definition of a Product Roadmap, which will help us frame the rest of the points in this guide.</p><blockquote><em>"A product roadmap is a high-level visual summary that maps out the vision and direction of your product offering." - </em><a href="https://www.productplan.com/"><em>ProductPlan</em></a></blockquote><p>We're going to break down the definition step by step, so we understand what it entails.</p><h3><strong>"high-level"</strong>‍</h3><p>This means we don't go into the details of a product vision too much (that's what backlogs are for). We need the roadmap to stay on a strategic level where we can use it to set the course over the long term. To illustrate: think about a ship sailing to some destination. A captain on the vessel needs to look out over the horizon for direction. In contrast, an engineer on the same boat takes care of the machines in the engine room: both necessary for the end goal, but very different levels of focus.</p><h3><strong>"visual"</strong>‍</h3><p>This means the product roadmap, like a land roadmap, can be understood without needing to read it (apart from titles, notes, names, etc.). Visual representation helps make the roadmap easier and quicker to understand, which is necessary to get buy-in from everyone involved.</p><h3><strong>"summary"</strong>‍</h3><p>This is similar in the "high-level" part we saw earlier. (Not focus on all the details.) But it does drive home the point that the roadmap should simplify, but definitely not leave out critical parts of the vision. Doing this is hard, especially when a product is big. Note, summarizing is a continuous process.</p><h3><strong>"vision"</strong>‍</h3><p>This means the "why" of a product. Why create the product in the first place? What goal does it have? What is the value proposition for users? What is the incentive for the business to create this product? Tip, don't spend a lot of time creating a product roadmap before your vision is crystal clear.</p><h3><strong>"direction"</strong>‍</h3><p>This means the execution part of getting to a finished product. It is "how" you go from nothing to providing the value intended. Do I need to say this is important? Well, yes, it is; it is essential. In the execution plan, you find most detail (and struggles) while creating and updating the product roadmap. After you formed a product vision (<a href="https://www.jibranelbazi.com/blog/why-product-market-fit-is-not-enough">hopefully in line with your customers and your company!</a>), most stakeholders don't sway from that idea. The route to that goal, however, is a bumpy and complicated road. (I'm almost getting ahead of myself in wanting to talk more about this here, but there will be multiple sections where we'll get into the details of this!)</p><h3><strong>"product offering"</strong>‍</h3><p>This means "what" you'll eventually end up creating—the finished product. The whole reason you create a product roadmap is to offer a valuable product to the end-user, your customer.</p><p><em>An interesting aside. Maybe you're already familiar with the last three parts from the definition (vision, direction, and product offering) but under different wording. </em><a href="https://simonsinek.com/"><em>Simon Sinek</em></a><em> talks about the "why, how, and what" (vision, direction, and product offering, respectively). He calls it the "Golden Circle" by his book with the same name.</em></p><h2>What does a product roadmap look like?</h2><p>A product roadmap can take many forms, feature-based, goal-based, time based, release-based, and a few more. But good roadmaps have a few things in common.</p><ul role="list"><li>They are timed based (be it specific dates or timelines).</li><li>They have more detail for near term (higher priority) items than for later (lower priority) items.</li><li>They have 'themes' as the highest level (like "increase customer retention for yearly subscribers"), not features.</li></ul><p><strong>Here's an example of a roadmap (</strong><a href="https://roadmunk.com/"><strong>source</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p><figure id="w-node-47cfe779986d-8ab48f91"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5d9f07d3a410722397e9fd77/5f233514485d617b4cac9b6e_homepage-slider-1-1.png" alt="Roadmap example from roadmunk"></p></figure><p>In the next article, I will walk you through the details of an example product roadmap. As well as listing the different types of product roadmaps that are possible to make. First I'll tell you a bit more about how you can use your roadmap.</p><h2>How can you use a product roadmap?</h2><p>Ok, so now you know what a product roadmap is supposed to do and what it looks like. Right? Well, on a high level, yes. But the utilization of a product roadmap becomes even more evident in the specific cases you use it.</p><p>These are all about people, social dynamics, collaboration, and communication. You can use a product roadmap</p><ol role="list"><li>as a reference document for the (Scrum )team.</li><li>to get stakeholder alignment.</li><li>to provide options for planning and conversation.</li><li>to prevent someone from 'hijacking' your sprints.</li><li>to tell a story to your customers.</li></ol><p>These five uses all come down to the most important reason for creating a product roadmap. To set the narrative of your product vision and execution.</p><blockquote><em>A Product Roadmap is a narrative tool.</em></blockquote><p>With a product roadmap you can tell a story of intent. The intent to build a product towards a certain goal. This narrative is essential to get others to work with you in creating great products.</p><p><em>There is one crucial point I want to drive home. A product roadmap is a living document. The things you plan are not set in stone. The product you're building is undergoing iteration upon iteration. Thus your roadmap should reflect the latest findings and details, especially in the age of Agile and Lean (software) development.</em></p><h2>Closing thoughts</h2><p>Hopefully, you're now familiar with the idea of what a product roadmap is, why you should use one, and what it looks like.</p><p>If you have any questions, thoughts, or feel something is missing, please do shoot me a message on <a href="https://www.twitter.com/askjibran">Twitter</a>.</p><p>By the way, I also created a checklist with "<a href="https://www.jibranelbazi.com/notes/product-roadmap-checklist">40 Product Roadmap tips</a>." So if you can't wait to get into creating and using a product roadmap, I highly recommend you check it out.</p><h2>Support</h2><p>If you'd like to see more content like this, I'd be thrilled to have you join my <a href="https://www.jibranelbazi.com/newsletter">mailing list.</a></p></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>When I launched Feature Upvote, my B2B SaaS, in 2017, the price was $29/month, with a 20% discount for paying yearly. I chose that price  arbitrarily, but also because it is what I felt I would pay for a similar service.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/2006/08/14/you-can-probably-stand-to-charge-more/">hearing repeatedly that developers who start businesses need to charge more</a>, I wanted to experiment with a small increase.</p>
<p>I delayed doing this until I had enough new customers each month to really be sure of the price change’s effect.</p>
<p>In January 2019 I put the price up to $35/month, a 20% increase.</p>
<p>Why such a small increase? I knew in theory that I should charge significantly more, but in practice I wasn’t confident about it. I am, after all, still a developer <img src="https://sjc3.discourse-cdn.com/business6/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" alt=":slight_smile:"> .</p>
<p>What happened? The conversion rate stayed roughly the same. That is, the same number of new customers per month, but each paying more.</p>
<p>Nobody complained. Ever. Not a single person questioned the change in our pricing.</p>
<p>A year later, in January 2020 I got bolder. I put the price up to $49/month, a 40% increase.</p>
<p>What happened? The conversion rate initially dropped a little but not much. It might have just been statistical noise, or the post-Christmas lull.</p>
<p>I was  getting fewer new customers, but they were paying more. Pricing experts say that customers who pay more tend to remain customers longer, resulting in a much higher customer life time value, so this seemed okay.</p>
<p>Then the pandemic started and we were all in shock and sales stalled for a little while. So it was really hard to tell the true effect of the price increase.</p>
<p>But now, six months later, I’m signing up more new customers than ever, at the conversion rate we had before the price increase.</p>
<p>As with the first price change, nobody complained. Ever.</p>
<h2>What about existing customers?</h2>
<p>I’ve never put up prices for existing customers. I’m okay with people getting the price they started with indefinitely. It is the way I’d want to be treated as a customer. Anyway, within a couple of years, as existing customers churn, the “problem” of older customers paying less will simply go away.</p>
<h2>Has the customer base changed?</h2>
<p>Yes. As the price goes up we tend to get larger organisations as customers. Unfortunately, they are also more likely to ask for custom legals, T&amp;Cs, and security audits. In all cases, I say no. That may change in the future.</p>
<h2>What did I tell existing customers about the price change?</h2>
<p>Nothing. I probably should have, but it fell off my to-do list.</p>
<p>To make sure existing trial customers weren’t shown one price and charged another, I did the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>December 2019: change the prices listed on our pricing page, but still charge new customers the old pricing.</li>
<li>January 2020: start actually charging the new prices.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Other pricing plans</h2>
<p>I have bootstrapper pricing at $19/month (with a 20% discount when paying yearly). I’ve had this pricing since the very start, and never changed it. It is an easy way to answer would-be customers who write “I want to use Feature Upvote, but it is too expensive for me.”</p>
<p>For charities or non-profits who ask, we have a plan that’s 25% cheaper. Almost no-one asks for this plan. I don’t know why, because it is featured on our pricing page.</p>
<p>Just about any Open Source project that asks can use us for free. There are a couple of stipulations, but I tend not to check too carefully.</p>
<h2>Do I charge enough?</h2>
<p>I don’t know. I’m content with the pricing now, and have no plans to change it in the near future. Next year I might add a much more expensive enterprise plan, for those people who ask about custom legals, T&amp;Cs, and security audits.</p>

		<p>When it comes to recruitment interviews, there's an overwhelmingly popular opinion (on the Internet) that one should test candidates in conditions that do resemble <strong>real-life work scenarios</strong> as much as possible. Tasks &amp; challenges should mimic the ones that the candidate would face in her/his daily work. Everything else (<em>"how many golf balls would fit into Opel Corsa?"</em>) is the subject of laughter and mockery.</p><p>I dare to disagree. My interviews are nothing like real work (but TBH we have a final stage of a "trial day" within the actual team, mainly to check <em>the chemistry</em> between a potential new-joiner and the team members and to give her/him a chance to verify what we've said about the company).</p><p>A recruitment interview is a freaking intense experience. We have a strictly limited time - we can't build full context to get someone up-to-speed with the product details, local specifics, whole workflow, etc. Of course, we can try easy, shallow, "mundane" scenario, but let's face the truth - we need to evaluate candidate's capability to tackle TRULY demanding stuff (most likely <strong>10% of the actual work</strong> (s)he'll perform - but that part truly makes the difference).</p><p>The purpose of the interview is not to emulate work 1:1, but to answer certain questions: about particular personality traits, attitude, aptitude, mindset. Technical skills can always be taught later - if someone has a matching motivation, proper engineering foundation, is bright enough and has an ability of structured abstract thinking.</p><p>That's why my interviews are aimed to check how does the individual think (instead of verifying her/his memorization skills). How does (s)he approach problems, split them, classify them, explore possible solutions? When does (s)he abandon the path that doesn't look promising anymore? Is (s)he able to effectively share her/his thoughts (verbally, graphically, in code)? What about focus - does (s)he navigate in terms of a given goal or roam chaotically around? And in the end ... <strong>is (s)he actually having fun</strong> (when solving challenging problems)?</p><p>Call me old-fashioned, but I do ask abstract questions as well. The problems candidates are facing at my interviews usually have NOTHING in common with the company's domain, BUT they have a super-low entry level (e.g. they are about common problems everyone encounters every day): building up the context takes seconds (literally), so the candidate can focus on tackling the problem, not understanding its basics. They also share one another characteristic: they are picked to be <strong>unique, intriguing and memorable</strong> - so regardless of the outcome (whether the candidate joins us or not), our interview remains an interesting experience in her/his memory.</p><p>There are ones who are surprised and do criticize such a form of the interview. They usually ask whether these exercises truly represent the everyday problems of this organization. Some even get irritated (very few) - but no-one has asked to stop the interview prematurely.</p><p>Honestly, I don't mind. These days candidates get very picky - they have so many offers available in the market, that the less gritty ones don't even want to participate in the interview that exposes them to the challenges out of their comfort zone (e.g. which is - syntactical language problems or knowing the specifics of the framework). It's their right, but it also means they are definitely <strong>not the people I'm looking for</strong>.</p><hr><p>P.S. Of course, sometimes (rarely) I look for a high level of expertise within a specific technological niche - that requires a different assessment and it's a completely separate topic.</p>

<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">Technology’s Double-Edged Sword</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The global COVID-19 pandemic has made clear that Chinese technology companies are at the cutting edge of surveillance innovation and predictive analytics. In April 2020, Amazon, the wealthiest technology company in the world, received a shipment of&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-amazon-com-cameras/exclusive-amazon-turns-to-chinese-firm-on-u-s-blacklist-to-meet-thermal-camera-needs-idUSKBN22B1AL"><span data-contrast="none">1,500 heat-sensing camera systems</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;from the Chinese surveillance company&nbsp;Dahua. Many of these cameras, which are worth approximately $10 million, will be installed in Amazon warehouses to monitor the heat signatures of employees and alert managers if workers exhibit COVID-19-like symptoms. Other cameras included in the shipment will be distributed to IBM and Chrysler, among other buyers.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In 2017,&nbsp;Dahua&nbsp;received over $900 million to build comprehensive surveillance systems which supported a “re-education” system of extra-legal internment, checkpoints, and ideological training for&nbsp;</span><a href="https://ipvm.com/reports/xinjiang-dahua-hikvision"><span data-contrast="none">Muslim populations in northwestern China</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. Since then, the U.S. Department of Commerce placed it on a list of companies banned from buying or selling in the United States. Yet despite the legal and ethical ramifications of buying products from&nbsp;Dahua, Amazon continues to do business with them.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">With the help of&nbsp;Dahua&nbsp;and hundreds of other private and public Chinese companies, as many as 1.5 million Uighurs and Kazakhs have been “disappeared” into a widespread system of “re-education camps” in the Uighur Autonomous Region (Xinjiang).[1]</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">Nearly all Uighurs and Kazakhs in China have an immediate family member who is, or has been, interned in this camp system.

Whole streets have been abandoned in Uighur towns and villages. Because of the re-education system, it is likely that within a single generation Muslim embodied practice and Turkic languages in Northwest China will cease to provide essential ways for Uighurs and Kazakhs to sustain their knowledge systems.[2]&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">This process affects every aspect of their lives not only due to mass detentions, but also because of the way biometric and data surveillance systems supporting the camps have been used to monitor and transform their behavior.</span><span data-contrast="auto">[3]</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">People who were not immediately detained were nevertheless ordered to go to local police stations and clinics to submit blood and <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/12/13/china-minority-region-collects-dna-millions">DNA samples</a> have their irises, faces and fingerprints scanned and a unique voice signature recorded.</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">One Kazakh woman told me, “The village government leader told us openly that those who refused would be taken to the re-education camps.” This biometric data was then added to their citizenship file as part of a new “smart” ID card system. Once this system was fully implemented by the end of 2017, it became impossible for Uighurs and Kazakhs to enter a bank or shopping mall without having their face scanned and matched to the image on their ID at fixed checkpoints. Han people were often waved through these checkpoints without a scan,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://chinachannel.org/2018/11/23/checkpoint-nation/"><span data-contrast="none">particularly in Turkic Muslim majority areas</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;The Kazakh woman told me, “On average, over the span of a single day, I had my ID and face scanned more than 10 times.”&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">It is unclear how all of this data is used. As James&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">Leibold</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;has noted, there is likely a significant gap between the advertised capacities of the systems in place and their actual ability to turn biometric and digital data into actionable forms of social control.</span><span data-contrast="auto">[9]</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">Much of the data in the IJOP system is input manually or through targeted scans of smart phones, while other forms of data are fed into the system through banking records, GPS tracking and license plate and face recognition camera systems. Yet despite potential gaps in purported knowledge and technical capability, the ubiquity of checkpoints and cameras make Turkic Muslims modify their behavior in their daily life and reorient their activities around ideals promoted by state authorities. The technologies begin to create a new reality.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">The Logic of Chinese Counterterrorism&nbsp;</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The history of Chinese counterterrorism is born largely out of post-9/11 counterinsurgency theory (COIN). Soon after U.S. Army General Petraeus crafted a new counterinsurgency field manual in 2007, Chinese military and policing scientists began to consider what they could learn from a <a href="https://madeinchinajournal.com/2019/10/25/preventative-policing-as-community-detention-in-northwest-china/">new approach</a> to asymmetrical warfare.</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">They considered central COIN principles such as full spectrum intelligence; placing people in categories of insurgent, neutral, and pro-regime change populations; breaking up social networks through targeted detentions; and “winning the hearts and minds” of those who remained.[10]</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As elements of counterinsurgency theory were implemented in the United States and Europe in the form of Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) programs that strove to “deradicalize” Muslim citizens, Chinese policing theorists began to think more about “preventative policing” and the way surveillance and education systems could be used to transform non-Han Muslim populations.</span><span data-contrast="auto">[11]</span><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;</span><span data-contrast="auto">Building on an intelligence-led policing program called&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2019/05/01/chinas-algorithms-repression/reverse-engineering-xinjiang-police-mass-surveillance"><span data-contrast="none">the Golden Shield project</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;that had already been established post-9/11, they took note of Edward Snowden’s revelations of the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data"><span data-contrast="none">PRISM mass data analytics project</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;that collected and assessed data from social media both in the United States and around the globe.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b>Introduction</b></p><p>As many of you know the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Agreement#:~:text=The%20Schengen%20Agreement%20(English%3A%20%2F,the%20then%20European%20Economic%20Community." target="_blank">Schengen Agreement</a> (Named after the Luxemburg City "Schengen" where it was signed) introduced the free flow of goods and people across the European Union and many claim it to be on of the core backbone agreements of the European Union.</p><p><b>Synopsis</b></p><p>Germany decided to introduce border controls following the SARS-CoV-2 Epidemic during&nbsp; March-Mai 2020. Luxembourg has a particular situation that is best displayed via this illustration: every day over 1/3 of the entire working population enters the country via Germany, France, and Belgium to drive home in the evening thus passing these very borders every day.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/1/18/Commuter_flows_within%2C_into_and_out_of_Luxembourg%2C_2015_(%C2%B9)_(thousands)_RYB2016.png"><img data-original-height="664" data-original-width="800" height="427" src="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/1/18/Commuter_flows_within%2C_into_and_out_of_Luxembourg%2C_2015_(%C2%B9)_(thousands)_RYB2016.png" width="515"></a></p><p>Germany decided, for reasons that are still not clear to me as of today, that Luxembourg nationals (not germans) need to have a justified reason to enter Germany (a limited list of these existed). It appears that German State Heads believed that the virus somehow differentiates between nationalities and that this made total sense considering the thousands of German border commuters enter and exit every day "freely".</p><p>Back to the topic.&nbsp; The Schengen agreement allows for the introduction of border controls <b>under certain rules and under certain requirements</b>. I have been curious to find out what Germany brought forward as reasons as I could not imagine a scientific reason to do just that.</p><p><b>Art. 25.1 &amp; 25.2&nbsp; :</b></p><br><ul><li>Where [..] there is a <span><b>serious threat </b>to public policy or internal security in a Member State</span>, that Member State may exceptionally reintroduce border control [..] for a limited period of up to 30 days or for the foreseeable duration of the serious threat [..]</li><li>Border control at internal borders shall <span>only be reintroduced <b>as a last resor</b></span><b>t</b>, and in accordance with Articles 27, 28, and 29. The criteria referred to, respectively, in Articles 26 and 30 shall be taken into account in each case where a decision on the reintroduction of border control at internal borders is considered pursuant, respectively, to Article 27, 28, or 29.</li></ul><p><b>Art 26 ("Criteria") :</b></p><div><ul><li>Where a Member State decides, as a <b>last resort,</b> on the temporary reintroduction of border control [..] it shall assess the extent to which such a measure is likely to adequately remedy the threat to public policy or internal security,<span> and shall assess the <b>proportionality of the measure in relation to that threat</b>. </span></li></ul><p><b>Art. 27&nbsp; :&nbsp;</b></p></div><div><ul><li>Where a Member State plans to reintroduce border control [..], it [...]&nbsp;<b> shall supply the following information :<br></b>(a) the reasons for the proposed reintroduction, <span>including all relevant data</span> detailing the events that constitute a serious threat to its public policy or internal security;<br>(b) the scope of the proposed reintroduction, specifying at which part or parts of the internal borders border control is to be reintroduced;<br>(c) the names of the authorized crossing-points;<br>(d) the date and duration of the planned reintroduction;<br>(e) where appropriate, the measures to be taken by the other Member States.</li></ul></div><p><b>Art. 28 </b>:</p><ul><li>If the serious threat to public policy or internal security persists beyond the period provided for in paragraph 1 of this Article, the Member State may decide to prolong the border control at internal borders for renewable periods of up to 20 days. <span>In doing so, the Member State concerned shall take into account the <b>criteria referred to in Article 26</b>,</span> including an updated assessment of the necessity and the proportionality of the measure, and shall take into account any new elements.</li></ul><p><b>Requesting Acces to the Documents</b></p><p>Germany appears to have a solid Information Access law ("Informations Zugangs Gesetz") that even allows foreign nationals to request documents that are even sent free of charge across the European Union.&nbsp;</p><p>My Initial Request for Information from the 04.05.2020 included the Information and requests below :</p><div><ul><li>A copy of the Notification Letter addressed to the European Commission</li><li>Which reasons, data, and other factors led to the conclusion that proportionality of the measure in relation to that threat is adequate.&nbsp;(Quoting Art 26)</li><li>During the time the BMI decided to forbid Luxemurgish nationals entry to Germany (unless they demonstrated important reasons). Luxemburg had on average 15 (!) infections&nbsp;<span>per week including German commuters, </span><span>so my question was: In light of 15 infections per week how did Germany come to the conclusion that "</span>proportionality of the measure in relation to that threat that Luxembourg nationals pose is adequate".</li></ul></div><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-48-EYBNByoA/XyVm53pJW6I/AAAAAAAAA2E/UHJBVdJyQwYJQnSY4Wuok6CPEpNOGoCIQCLcBGAsYHQ/s907/Anfrage1.PNG"><img data-original-height="907" data-original-width="669" height="513" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-48-EYBNByoA/XyVm53pJW6I/AAAAAAAAA2E/UHJBVdJyQwYJQnSY4Wuok6CPEpNOGoCIQCLcBGAsYHQ/w379-h513/Anfrage1.PNG" title="Request to the BMI" width="379"></a></td></tr><tr><td>My Request to the BMI<br></td></tr></tbody></table><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-n7xm8egvLms/XyVn9GF8LUI/AAAAAAAAA2Y/oAk6mZg8XZgCLW4E_QP1gq_t42FgGpEpgCLcBGAsYHQ/s797/Anfrage2.PNG"><img data-original-height="797" data-original-width="718" height="410" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-n7xm8egvLms/XyVn9GF8LUI/AAAAAAAAA2Y/oAk6mZg8XZgCLW4E_QP1gq_t42FgGpEpgCLcBGAsYHQ/w370-h410/Anfrage2.PNG" width="370"></a></td></tr><tr><td>Answer<br></td></tr></tbody></table><p>One of their answers included the following quite revealing sentence :</p><div><ul><li>"We are not required to communicate legal assessments that have yet to be done"</li></ul></div><p>I am publishing these documents because they may have historic value and offer food for thought.&nbsp;</p><p>Why food of thought you might as? Well, Germany didn't really give a reason as required by the Articles 25/26/27/28 that would explain how closing the borders is necessary and proportional. In the first letter, it states it's intent and simply "that it is required" and in every followup letter extending the closure (a total of 4), Mr. Seehofer just points to the first letter creating a circular non founded argument.&nbsp; Especially in the context of thousands of daily german commuters that stay for a minimum of 9 hours in Luxembourg (In offices, Hospitals, and so forth) closing the border to Luxemburgish nationals made absolutely no sense whatsoever and could be even seen as being discriminatory.</p><p>Summary of my Analysis (There may be more in these letters but that's currently all I am being equipped to answer). Please feel free to contact me in case you stumble across something you want to point out.</p><div><ul><li><b>15 March 2020 (Letter1): </b>Notification per Article 28 of the planned<b> 10 days of Border Controls</b>. Art. 28 is referenced.<p><b>Reason given :</b></p><p><b>German<br></b>"Unser Gemeinames Ziel muss&nbsp; angesicht der raschen Zunahme der Infektionen sein, möglichst frühzeitig Reisende aus Risiko gebieten sowie diejenigen mit Anzeichen für eine derartige Infektion zu erkennen um auf diese weisen durch unverzügliche medizinische Massnahme eine weitere Verbreitung bestmöglich einzudämmen"</p><p>"Auch unter Berücksichtigung der grossen Bedeutung de Grenzkontrollfreien reisens innerhalb das Schengenraums bin ich der Ueberzeugung dass die vorübergehende&nbsp; Wiedereinführung&nbsp; von Binnen Grenzkontrollen eine notwendige flankierende Maßnahme zur Eindämmung der Ausbreitung und Unterbrechung der Infektionskettendarstellt.</p><p><b>English (Translation) <br></b>"In view of the rapid increase in infections, our common goal must be to identify traveler from risk areas early as possible and to identify those who show signs of such an infection in order to reduce its spread as far as possible through immediate medical measures.</p><p>Also consider the importance of border control-free travel within the Schengen area, I am convinced that the temporary reintroduction of internal border controls is a necessary accompanying measure to contain the spread and interruption of the infection chain."</p><p><b>Commentary:</b> What a display of nativity and a simplistic view of the world. As if somehow the virus would differentiate between Germans and Luxemburgih nationals and that refusing entry to the country would allow for "Immediate medical measures".&nbsp; Also of note is that Luxemburg is quite clearly an area of collateral damage where no data whatsoever justified closing the borders to Luxemburgish nationals.&nbsp; We see no analysis of whether or not the measures are proportionate to the threat. My opinion is simple, in case of Luxembourg, there is a very very high probability they were not.</p><p>Also, note the choice of words: "<a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flankierende_Ma%C3%9Fnahmen_zum_freien_Personenverkehr" target="_blank">Flankierende Massnahme</a>" is usually used to describe the political approach to immigration of third party nations (outside of the EU).</p></li></ul><ul><li><b>19 March 2020</b>&nbsp; (Letter 2): Adds&nbsp; Air Travel ways to the list of border controls</li><li><b>25 March 2020</b> (Letter 3): Extends Border Control another 20 days<br>Reason given : "Based on the previous communications"</li><li><b>14th of April 2020</b> (Letter 4): Extends Border Control by another 20 days<br>Reason given : "Based on the previous communications"</li><li><b>4th of May 2020</b>: Extended by 14 days<br>Reason given:&nbsp; "Fragile situation development"&amp; "Based on previous communication"</li></ul></div><p><b><br>Copies of the letters</b></p><p><b>Letter 2</b></p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xDQYgL9OLZY/XyV3SOpEJRI/AAAAAAAAA3Y/n7XxcYinOwI1yzlUrT3aX22KWglo24Y3ACLcBGAsYHQ/s967/2_bmi_schreiben0_1_19maerz.PNG"><img data-original-height="967" data-original-width="759" height="640" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xDQYgL9OLZY/XyV3SOpEJRI/AAAAAAAAA3Y/n7XxcYinOwI1yzlUrT3aX22KWglo24Y3ACLcBGAsYHQ/s640/2_bmi_schreiben0_1_19maerz.PNG"></a></p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-olh6tVNsS_U/XyV3SP2TKyI/AAAAAAAAA3c/fhsSDnQ9JHcMjADwxS4AioF2bpcY_oC3gCLcBGAsYHQ/s948/2_bmi_schreiben0_2_19maerz.PNG"><img data-original-height="948" data-original-width="757" height="640" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-olh6tVNsS_U/XyV3SP2TKyI/AAAAAAAAA3c/fhsSDnQ9JHcMjADwxS4AioF2bpcY_oC3gCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/2_bmi_schreiben0_2_19maerz.PNG"></a></p><p><b>Letter 3</b></p><div><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uCXnwU3VZaU/XyV3bjQM1BI/AAAAAAAAA3g/-5sOoGlxgikYTmOCLoSz4LUSnNwycKxdgCLcBGAsYHQ/s936/3_bmi_schreiben0_1_25maerz.PNG"><img data-original-height="936" data-original-width="772" height="640" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uCXnwU3VZaU/XyV3bjQM1BI/AAAAAAAAA3g/-5sOoGlxgikYTmOCLoSz4LUSnNwycKxdgCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/3_bmi_schreiben0_1_25maerz.PNG"></a></p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QRmrZwSZM50/XyV3bhbEPFI/AAAAAAAAA3k/rb941BSrozsu9W3B-BOIEF1z9rhYSL80QCLcBGAsYHQ/s965/3_bmi_schreiben0_2_25maerz.PNG"><img data-original-height="965" data-original-width="794" height="640" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QRmrZwSZM50/XyV3bhbEPFI/AAAAAAAAA3k/rb941BSrozsu9W3B-BOIEF1z9rhYSL80QCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/3_bmi_schreiben0_2_25maerz.PNG"></a></p><br></div><p><b>Letter 4</b></p>

<p>A few months ago, I mentioned on my stories an up to the minute niche experiment just after <b> Google's May 2020 Core Update </b>, this was a strong incentive too to talk about one of the most powerful techniques in SEO which most of us do not give much attention to, which is timeroid. </p>
<p>
<b>Timeroid</b> is an SEO technique for writing articles focused on potential coming events to rank without obtaining any backlinks.
</p>
<p>The overused content is an essential thing for us here, a kind of data source for our working on niches. In my case here I published articles about Zoom’s Frequently Asked Questions and Troubleshooting issues, before that I searched for the most common problems with groovy competitors like Skype, Google Hangouts Meet, etc..., they left behind many consumable articles that can be rewritten and enhanced over and over again before people even catch those problems. In short, I was racing and using the time factor to rank without building a single link.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.ajarouih.me/img/timeroid_0.png" alt="Timeroid_google"></p>
<p>You are now wondering about how I got the articles by a certain period of time and you can use them too for example on the next iPhone based on the previous releases, right? You can use Google's Queries to filter the results of old articles searches by entering the timing query as follows in the Google’s search box <code>intitle:”How to”-”Skype” before:2020-01-01</code> and rewrite them for new releases for the coming years.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.ajarouih.me/img/timeroid_1.png" alt="Timeroid_google"></p>
<p>Your articles should be well-written. In fact, you shouldn’t copy/paste any of others articles. This is just a waste of time and you need to spend your time write and in scaling them.</p>
<p>All that matters here is that you are the first to write useful, relevant, helpful, and fresh content. There are so many things to do with the same strategy, all we need is just a little 'Patience'. You have an effective strategy to get results. I tried this on several micro-niches and it worked very well.</p></div><p>Thank you for taking the time to read. If you learnt something sharing the thread is really appreciated. I’m open to any suggestions from you. Do not hesitate to tell me what you think.</p></div>]]>

    <p>I recently got to use a very curious Haskell technique

 time traveling. I say this with
the utmost seriousness. This technique worked like
magic for the problem I was trying to solve, and so
I thought I’d share what I learned. In addition
to the technique and its workings, I will also explain how
time traveling can be misused, yielding computations that
never terminate.</p>
<h3 id="time-traveling">Time Traveling</h3>
<p>Some time ago, I read <a href="https://kcsongor.github.io/time-travel-in-haskell-for-dummies/">this post</a> by Csongor Kiss about time traveling in Haskell. It’s
really cool, and makes a lot of sense if you have wrapped your head around
lazy evaluation. I’m going to present my take on it here, but please check out
Csongor’s original post if you are interested.</p>
<p>Say that you have a list of integers, like <code>[3,2,6]</code>. Next, suppose that
you want to find the maximum value in the list. You can implement such
behavior quite simply with pattern matching:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="Haskell"><span>myMax</span> <span>::</span> [<span>Int</span>] <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span>
<span>myMax</span> <span>[]</span> <span>=</span> <span>error</span> <span>"Being total sucks"</span>
<span>myMax</span> (x<span>:</span>xs) <span>=</span> max x <span>$</span> myMax xs
</code></pre></div>
<p>You could even get fancy with a <code>fold</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="Haskell"><span>myMax</span> <span>::</span> [<span>Int</span>] <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span>
<span>myMax</span> <span>=</span> foldr1 max
</code></pre></div>
<p>All is well, and this is rather elementary Haskell. But now let’s look at
something that Csongor calls the <code>repMax</code> problem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Imagine you had a list, and you wanted to replace all the elements of the
list with the largest element, by only passing the list once.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How can we possibly do this in one pass? First, we need to find the maximum
element, and only then can we have something to replace the other numbers
with! It turns out, though, that we can just expect to have the future
value, and all will be well. Csongor provides the following example:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="Haskell"><span>repMax</span> <span>::</span> [<span>Int</span>] <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> (<span>Int</span>, [<span>Int</span>])
<span>repMax</span> <span>[]</span> rep <span>=</span> (rep, <span>[]</span>)
<span>repMax</span> [x] rep <span>=</span> (x, [rep])
<span>repMax</span> (l <span>:</span> ls) rep <span>=</span> (m', rep <span>:</span> ls')
  <span>where</span> (m, ls') <span>=</span> repMax ls rep
        m' <span>=</span> max m l
</code></pre></div>
<p>In this example, <code>repMax</code> takes the list of integers,
each of which it must replace with their maximum element.
It also takes <strong>as an argument</strong> the maximum element,
as if it had already been computed. It does, however,
still compute the intermediate maximum element,
in the form of <code>m'</code>. Otherwise, where would the future
value even come from?</p>
<p>Thus far, nothing too magical has happened. It’s a little
strange to expect the result of the computation to be
given to us; it just looks like wishful
thinking. The real magic happens in Csongor’s <code>doRepMax</code>
function:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="Haskell"><span>doRepMax</span> <span>::</span> [<span>Int</span>] <span>-&gt;</span> [<span>Int</span>]
<span>doRepMax</span> xs <span>=</span> xs'
  <span>where</span> (largest, xs') <span>=</span> repMax xs largest
</code></pre></div>
<p>Look, in particular, on the line with the <code>where</code> clause.
We see that <code>repMax</code> returns the maximum element of the
list, <code>largest</code>, and the resulting list <code>xs'</code> consisting
only of <code>largest</code> repeated as many times as <code>xs</code> had elements.
But what’s curious is the call to <code>repMax</code> itself. It takes
as input <code>xs</code>, the list we’re supposed to process… and
<code>largest</code>, the value that <em>it itself returns</em>.</p>
<p>This works because Haskell’s evaluation model is, effectively,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_reduction">lazy graph reduction</a>. That is,
you can think of Haskell as manipulating your code as
<span>
<label for="tree-note">a syntax tree,</label>

<span>
<span>[note:</span>

Why is it called graph reduction, you may be wondering, if the runtime is
manipulating syntax trees? To save on work, if a program refers to the
same value twice, Haskell has both of those references point to the
exact same graph. This violates the tree's property of having only one path
from the root to any node, and makes our program a DAG (at least). Graph nodes that
refer to themselves (which are also possible in the model) also violate the properties of a
a DAG, and thus, in general, we are working with graphs.

<span>]</span>
</span>
</span>
 performing
substitutions and simplifications as necessary until it reaches a final answer.
What the lazy part means is that parts of the syntax tree that are not yet
needed to compute the final answer can exist, unsimplified, in the tree.
Why don’t we draw a few graphs to get familiar with the idea?</p>
<h3 id="visualizing-graphs-and-their-reduction">Visualizing Graphs and Their Reduction</h3>
<p>Let’s start with something that doesn’t have anything fancy. We can
take a look at the graph of the expression:</p>

<p>Stripping away Haskell’s syntax sugar for lists, we can write this expression as:</p>

<p>Then, recalling that <code>(:)</code>, or ‘cons’, is just a binary function, we rewrite:</p>

<p>We’re now ready to draw the graph; in this case, it’s pretty much identical
to the syntax tree of the last form of our expression:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://danilafe.com/blog/haskell_lazy_evaluation/length_1.png" alt="The initial graph of length [1]."> <figcaption>
            <p>The initial graph of <code>length [1]</code>.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In this image, the <code>@</code> nodes represent function application. The
root node is an application of the function <code>length</code> to the graph that
represents the list <code>[1]</code>. The list itself is represented using two
application nodes: <code>(:)</code> takes two arguments, the head and tail of the
list, and function applications in Haskell are
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying">curried</a>. Eventually,
in the process of evaluation, the body of <code>length</code> will be reached,
and leave us with the following graph:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://danilafe.com/blog/haskell_lazy_evaluation/length_2.png" alt="The graph of length [1] after the body of length is expanded."> <figcaption>
            <p>The graph of <code>length [1]</code> after the body of <code>length</code> is expanded.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Conceptually, we only took one reduction step, and thus, we haven’t yet gotten
to evaluating the recursive call to <code>length</code>. Since <code>(+)</code>
is also a binary function, <code>1+length xs</code> is represented in this
new graph as two applications of <code>(+)</code>, first to <code>1</code>, and then
to <code>length []</code>.</p>
<p>But what is that box at the root? This box <em>used to be</em> the root of the
first graph, which was an application node. However, it is now a
an <em>indirection</em>. Conceptually, reducing
this indirection amounts to reducing the graph
it points to. But why have we <span>
<label for="altered-note">altered the graph</label>

<span>
<span>[note:</span>

This is a key aspect of implementing functional languages.
The language itself may be pure, while the runtime
can be, and usually is, impure and stateful. After all,
computers are impure and stateful, too!

<span>]</span>
</span>
</span>
 in this manner? Because Haskell is a pure language,
of course! If we know that a particular graph reduces to some value,
there’s no reason to reduce it again. However, as we will
soon see, it may be <em>used</em> again, so we want to preserve its value.
Thus, when we’re done reducing a graph, we replace its root node with
an indirection that points to its result.</p>
<p>When can a graph be used more than once? Well, how about this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="Haskell"><span>let</span> x <span>=</span> square <span>5</span> <span>in</span> x <span>+</span> x
</code></pre></div>
<p>Here, the initial graph looks as follows:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://danilafe.com/blog/haskell_lazy_evaluation/square_1.png" alt="The initial graph of let x = square 5 in x + x."> <figcaption>
            <p>The initial graph of <code>let x = square 5 in x + x</code>.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As you can see, this <em>is</em> a graph, but not a tree! Since both
variables <code>x</code> refer to the same expression, <code>square 5</code>, they
are represented by the same subgraph. Then, when we evaluate <code>square 5</code>
for the first time, and replace its root node with an indirection,
we end up with the following:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://danilafe.com/blog/haskell_lazy_evaluation/square_2.png" alt="The graph of let x = square 5 in x + x after square 5 is reduced."> <figcaption>
            <p>The graph of <code>let x = square 5 in x + x</code> after <code>square 5</code> is reduced.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>There are two <code>25</code>s in the graph, and no more <code>square</code>s! We only
had to evaluate <code>square 5</code> exactly once, even though <code>(+)</code>
will use it twice (once for the left argument, and once for the right).</p>
<p>Our graphs can also include cycles.
A simple, perhaps <em>the most</em> simple example of this in practice is Haskell’s
<code>fix</code> function. It computes a function’s fixed point,
<span>
<label for="fixpoint-note">and can be used to write recursive functions.</label>

<span>
<span>[note:</span>

In fact, in the lambda calculus, <code>fix</code> is pretty much <em>the only</em>
way to write recursive functions. In the untyped lambda calculus, it can
be written as: <span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>λ</mi><mi>f</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>λ</mi><mi>x</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi><mi>f</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mtext>&nbsp;</mtext><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mtext>&nbsp;</mtext><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>λ</mi><mi>x</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi><mi>f</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mtext>&nbsp;</mtext><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda f . (\lambda x . f (x \ x)) \  (\lambda x . f (x \ x))</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>
In the simply typed lambda calculus, it cannot be written in any way, and
needs to be added as an extension, typically written as <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mtext mathvariant="bold">fix</mtext></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\textbf{fix}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.

<span>]</span>
</span>
</span>

It’s implemented as follows:</p>

<p>See how the definition of <code>x</code> refers to itself? This is what
it looks like in graph form:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://danilafe.com/blog/haskell_lazy_evaluation/fixpoint_1.png" alt="The initial graph of let x = f x in x."> <figcaption>
            <p>The initial graph of <code>let x = f x in x</code>.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I think it’s useful to take a look at how this graph is processed. Let’s
pick <code>f = (1:)</code>. That is, <code>f</code> is a function that takes a list,
and prepends <code>1</code> to it. Then, after constructing the graph of <code>f x</code>,
we end up with the following:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://danilafe.com/blog/haskell_lazy_evaluation/fixpoint_2.png" alt="The graph of fix (1:) after it&amp;rsquo;s been reduced."> <figcaption>
            <p>The graph of <code>fix (1:)</code> after it’s been reduced.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We see the body of <code>f</code>, which is the application of <code>(:)</code> first to the
constant <code>1</code>, and then to <code>f</code>'s argument (<code>x</code>, in this case). As
before, once we evaluated <code>f x</code>, we replaced the application with
an indirection; in the image, this indirection is the top box. But the
argument, <code>x</code>, is itself an indirection which points to the root of <code>f x</code>,
thereby creating a cycle in our graph. Traversing this graph looks like
traversing an infinite list of <code>1</code>s.</p>
<p>Almost there! A node can refer to itself, and, when evaluated, it
is replaced with its own value. Thus, a node can effectively reference
its own value! The last piece of the puzzle is how a node can access
<em>parts</em> of its own value: recall that <code>doRepMax</code> calls <code>repMax</code>
with only <code>largest</code>, while <code>repMax</code> returns <code>(largest, xs')</code>.
I have to admit, I don’t know the internals of GHC, but I suspect
this is done by translating the code into something like:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="Haskell"><span>doRepMax</span> <span>::</span> [<span>Int</span>] <span>-&gt;</span> [<span>Int</span>]
<span>doRepMax</span> xs <span>=</span> snd t
  <span>where</span> t <span>=</span> repMax xs (fst t)
</code></pre></div>
<h4 id="detailed-example-reducing-dorepmax">Detailed Example: Reducing <code>doRepMax</code>
</h4>
<p>If the above examples haven’t elucidated how <code>doRepMax</code> works,
stick around in this section and we will go through it step-by-step.
This is a rather long and detailed example, so feel free to skip
this section to read more about actually using time traveling.</p>
<p>If you’re sticking around, why don’t we watch how the graph of <code>doRepMax [1, 2]</code> unfolds.
This example will be more complex than the ones we’ve seen
so far; to avoid overwhelming ourselves with notation,
let’s adopt a different convention of writing functions. Instead
of using application nodes <code>@</code>, let’s draw an application of a
function <code>f</code> to arguments <code>x1</code> through <code>xn</code> as a subgraph with root <code>f</code>
and children <code>x</code>s. The below figure demonstrates what I mean:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://danilafe.com/blog/haskell_lazy_evaluation/notation.png" alt="The new visual notation used in this section."> <figcaption>
            <p>The new visual notation used in this section.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Now, let’s write the initial graph for <code>doRepMax [1,2]</code>:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://danilafe.com/blog/haskell_lazy_evaluation/repmax_1.png" alt="The initial graph of doRepMax [1,2]."> <figcaption>
            <p>The initial graph of <code>doRepMax [1,2]</code>.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Other than our new notation, there’s nothing too surprising here.
The first step of our hypothetical reduction would replace the application of <code>doRepMax</code> with its
body, and create our graph’s first cycle. At a high level, all we want is the second …</p></div></div>

August 2, 2020 | https://baserow.io/blog/open-source-release-of-baserow | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://baserow.io/blog/open-source-release-of-baserow">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
      We are very happy to announce that Baserow has been released open source
      publicly under the MIT license. The last few weeks we have worked on
      writing lots of documentation, fixing bugs, refactoring code, created
      the plugin boilerplate and worked on the final preparations for the
      release. We do want to note that the software is still in a very early
      alpha phase.
    </p> <p><a href="https://gitlab.com/bramw/baserow" target="_blank">
        Baserow repository
        <i></i></a></p> <h2>GitLab</h2> <p>
      We have decided to host our official repository at GitLab. One of the
      reasons for this is because of already existing in house experience with
      the tool. GitLab has also served us very well for past private projects.
      It also has services like continuous integration pipelines, a container
      registry, issue tracker and lots of other things already included. There
      is going to be a mirror repository at GitHub as well.
    </p> <h2>Developer documentation</h2> <p>
      The main reason why we have postponed the open source release a little
      bit is because of the missing developer documentation. This has now been
      finished and is included in the repository. We also have a copy on the
      Baserow website. It contains various topics that might be of interest to
      developers ranging from the backend API to plugin development.
    </p> <p><a href="https://baserow.io/docs/index">
        Baserow developer docs
      </a></p> <h2>API documentation</h2> <p>
      The backend and the web-frontend communicate via a REST API with each
      other. Of course the endpoints can also be used by other parties. We
      have created an OpenAPI schema to make this process easier. Use one of
      the buttons below to view the Redoc or to download the JSON schema.
    </p> <p><a href="https://api.baserow.io/api/redoc/" target="_blank">Baserow Redoc</a> <a href="https://api.baserow.io/api/schema.json" target="_blank">Baserow OpenAPI schema</a></p> <h2>Cookiecutter plugin boilerplate</h2> <p>
      Because of the modular architecture of Baserow it is possible to create
      plugins. You can create custom fields, views, applications, pages,
      endpoints and much more. To make this even easier we have made a
      Cookiecutter plugin boilerplate. It contains a basic setup for a plugin
      and has a Docker development environment included. You can literally
      start developing within a few minutes.
    </p> <p><a href="https://baserow.io/docs/plugins%2Fboilerplate">
        Plugin boilerplate docs
      </a></p> <h2>Some other changes</h2> <p>
      We have also worked on some other small changes listed here below.
    </p> <ul><li>
        Refactored the SCSS classes into BEM.
      </li> <li>
        Changed the fields that are created when creating a new account or a
        new table.
      </li> <li>
        Fixed a datepicker bug that closed when you clicked on the input.
      </li> <li>
        Added a machine readable error to the response of the 404 errors.
      </li></ul></div></div>]]>

For the last few months, I’ve been assembling a collection of patch cables

<p>As I learn more about Eurorack and the modular ecosystem, it reminds me more and more
of the magical feeling of working with UNIX tools:
it is a world that exchanges programs for filters, oscillators, and VCAs,
text for voltage, and pipes for patch cables.</p>
<h2 id="text-audio-and-control-voltage">Text, Audio, and Control Voltage</h2>
<p>We’re all used to voltage representing audio.
An “AUX cord”, correctly called a 3.5mm TRS (tip, ring, and sleeve)
stereo cable<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>,
carries two channels of voltage and a common ground between audio devices through
a nearly universal<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> standard.
For audio signals, this voltage jumps between a maximum and minimum voltage.
Its value over time is eventually turned into the movement of a speaker or
headphone diaphragm, which in turn moves the air and can be heard.</p>
<p>In modular synthesis, though, we don’t just use these analog signals to represent the
movements of air that our ears hear as audio.
We also use them to control other parameters: pitch, for example.
Like the text streams that we use to move data around in UNIX tools,
or the JSON payloads that power a huge portion of the modern web,
voltage-based communication is simple but versatile.</p>
<figure>
    <p><img src="https://nora.codes/images/synth/control-voltage.jpg" alt="A module in my synthesizer displaying the changes in control voltage representingpitch"></p>
<p>The micro-Ornament and Crime module displaying changing pitch values,
as represented by the voltage coming into its CV1 input.</p>

</figure>

<p>These voltages are, by their nature, analog -
there are infinitely many values between C4 and D4, or even between C4 and C#4.
Among other things, this means that complex microtonal music is not just possible,
but just as easy for the hardware to produce as music in any Western scale.</p>
<p>Text, of course, isn’t analog, but it does have similar characteristics.
It’s not always easy to parse or generate exactly the right text,
but with enough information, it’s always possible to interoperate with something
that uses a text interface, or even JSON structured data.</p>
<h2 id="oscillators-filters-grep-and-awk">Oscillators, Filters, <code>grep</code>, and <code>awk</code></h2>
<p>The traditional synthesizer, as invented by Bob Moog and co., produces sound
through a so-called <strong>subtractive</strong> process.
Sound, some kind of complex wave-form, is produced by an <strong>oscillator</strong>,
according to control voltage representing pitch.
That waveform, which has lots of harmonics, is put through an amplifier
which turns the sound on when a note is being played, and off when it is not,
and through a filter, which removes some harmonics and emphasizes others.</p>
<figure>
    <p><img src="https://nora.codes/images/synth/threshold.jpg" alt="A Threshold module, outside of the synthesizer."></p>
<p>Just one module, removed from my synthesizer.
This is a four-oscillator retro digital voice, which produces three channels of
square waves and one “complex” waveform (noise, stepped triangle, etc.)</p>
<p>Each voice has four voltage inputs and one output, along with two buttons
and two knobs. The module also provides a “mixed” output.</p>

</figure>

<p>Of course, this is not so different from a standard UNIX log mangling pipeline,
where <code>cat</code> grabs some output from a file, <code>awk</code> formats it in some easy-to-work-with
way, <code>grep</code> cuts out irrelevant information, and <code>head</code>, <code>tail</code>, or a second <code>awk</code>
invocation formats the output.
This is the versatility of universal, standard interfaces like text, JSON, or voltage;
each tool does what it does, and interoperates cleanly.</p>
<h2 id="envelopes-signal-flow-and-mkfifo">Envelopes, Signal Flow, and <code>mkfifo</code></h2>
<p>In my rack, I have a simple signal flow mapped out by the sequence of modules.
My <a href="https://winterbloom.com/store/winterbloom-sol">Winterbloom Sol</a> turns digital
signals into control voltage.
The <a href="https://mutable-instruments.net/modules/kinks/">Kinks</a>,
<a href="https://pushermanproductions.com/product/jakplugg-open-source-pique-4hp-peaks-pcb-fr4-panel/">Pique</a>
and <a href="https://ornament-and-cri.me/">Ornament and Crime</a> modules shape that CV.
Then come two oscillators, a filter, a set of amplifiers, and some effects.</p>
<p>But that’s not necessarily the order I actually patch the signal chain.</p>
<p>Most synths have an “envelope” control, sometimes controlling the level of a signal,
and sometimes controlling a filter.
The magic of modular is that each of those components is discrete.
One module generates control voltage every time a note is played.
Another module (a <strong>voltage controlled amplifier</strong> or VCA) uses that control voltage
to change the volume of the note,
turning a rising voltage into attack and falling voltage into decay.
A third  module (a <strong>voltage controlled filter</strong>) uses that control voltage to change
the harmonic content of the sound. Just by moving a cable from the “FM” input to the
“Q” input, that filter can go from subtracting harmonics to emphasizing them,
or maybe both!</p>
<p>This is the flexibility of modular synthesis.
Every signal exists within a constrained realm, and every module manufacturer
knows what their interface should expect.
Each module does some transformation - in a sense, every module represents
a mathematical funtion, transforming voltage-over-time and knob positions
into voltage-over-time, which can itself be transformed by further modules.</p>
<p>This is not necessarily something we see often in UNIX programming -
but it is possible!
With <code>mkfifo</code>, we can create more complex data flows and unique ways of moving
information around, using multiple FIFOs as input and output files.
In web systems, this kind of many-way connection is very common;
even relatively simple systems like If This Then That allow users to create
long, wide, branching data flows, and even flows that contain cycles.
Ideally, each program or API does work like a mathematical function,
taking command line arguments and input and transforming them into
output and perhaps some side effects, like making a Mastodon post or
writing to disk or a database.</p>
<h2 id="modularity-open-source-and-market-forces">Modularity, Open Source, and Market Forces</h2>
<p>In the forward to  <em>The UNIX Time-Sharing System</em><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>,
the seminal 1978 paper on UNIX, Doug McIlroy articulates the philosophy of modularity
thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Make each program do one thing well. To do a new job, build afresh.</li>
<li>Expect the output of every program to become the input of another, unknown,
program.</li>
<li>Design and build software […] to be tried early, ideally within weeks. <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>These are the same values that motivate the design of the best Eurorack modules.
Each module is easy to experiment with, designed to accomplish one or a few tasks,
explicitly built to integrate with other modules, and well-documented.</p>
<p>Eurorack’s modularity works well because there is no incentive to lock in users -
indeed, there is a significant disincentive, since no one small company
could ever hope to produce a universal product line.
Building modules that work well in as many systems as possible is the best way
to maximize sales.</p>
<figure>
    <p><img src="https://nora.codes/images/synth/front-shot.jpg" alt="A front-on shot of my case, along with my Beatstep Pro controller"></p>
<p>My whole synthesizer is controlled by this Beatstep Pro, and optionally by Linux
software like 100r ORCA.</p>

</figure>

<p>Indeed, even in the cases where larger companies (like Intellijel) have tried to
invent their own standards to get at least some degree of lock-in revenue,
the size of the market limits the effectiveness of that strategy.
Their smaller, 1U form factor has been widely adopted, and there are now nearly
a dozen small manufacturers making compatible modules.</p>
<p>We, as software engineers, should strive to build software that is amenable to
interoperability, because that is the most effective way to support creativity.
Documented, open, and capable APIs are good, if your software must be centralized;
federation through open protocols is even better.</p>
<p>Critically, your interface does not need to be optimal.
Control voltage in 1v/Oct certainly isn’t; it requires difficult and imprecise
exponential conversion circuits, or slow and expensive floating point computations.
Consider, for instance, ActivityPub and the Mastodon ecosystem.
Eugen Rochko could have easily stuck with OStatus, which does have some advantages,
but the Mastodon project’s move to ActivityPub catalzyed an entire ecosystem,
with dozens of other microblogging products, as well as blogs, video sharing,
music sharing, and photo sharing software springing up, all able to interoperate
at least somewhat.</p>
<p>Modularity also promotes longevity.
The predecessor to <code>ls</code> was written in 1961<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>; the GNU <code>find</code> command has
history as far back as 1987<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. These programs are so deeply embedded in the brain
stem of computing that building a modern server operating system without something
compatible is nearly unthinkable.</p>
<figure>
    <p><img src="https://nora.codes/images/synth/open-source.jpg" alt="Another side shot of my synthesizer."></p>
<p>Every module in this photograph is open source - software and hardware.</p>

</figure>

<p>I should also point out that, while free and open source software is,
in my opinion, a moral good,
software freedom and open protocols/interfaces are tangential concerns.
While many Eurorack modules are open source, some of the most popular are not;
for example, Make Noise’s analog computer Maths is not an open source design,
but it is the heart of many modular systems because it integrates well into
the ecosystem and has a clearly documented and well-specified interface.</p>
<p>Amazon’s Simple Storage Service, for instance, is a proprietary service with an open
protocol, and it is hugely successful - so much so that many projects have sprung up
to implement its interface, and a huge volume of cloud software is designed to work
with “S3 - and other stuff that works the same.”</p>
<p>Modularity is the most direct path to innovation. As software engineers,
we should do our absolute best, both technically and politically, to build
programs that do one thing well,
programs that can be tried early,
and programs that work well together.
Anything else guarantees stagnation, lock-in, frustration, and eventual obscurity.</p>

                    <p>Back in the old days when information was scarce and limited, it made sense to blame all project management challenges on people management skills.</p><p>Here are 5 common challenges you might have come across across multiple articles:</p><ul><li>Not having a clear goal</li><li>Having unrealistic deadlines and expectations</li><li>Not creating accountability</li><li>Miscommunication</li><li>Lack of engagement with stakeholders</li></ul><p>However, a lot of teams are able to get past these challenges today thanks to the internet.

The pain of not being able to collaborate cross functionally because the tool is too rigid and you’ll have to setup multiple configurations. The pain of getting teams to learn new terminologies. The pain of not being able to make sense of all the changes your team makes and how it all affects the macro-level picture.</p><p>They are clearly in a lot of pain. And the solution to it isn’t about assigning tasks and setting due dates. Let me explain why by expanding each of these challenges.</p><h3 id="1-aligning-everyone-on-a-common-big-picture-goal"><strong>1. Aligning everyone on a common, big picture goal</strong></h3><p>A lot of teams use a project management tool that makes them fill out a form which keeps those user stories and tickets in isolation.

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Having your user stories and tasks sit in isolation makes it exponentially harder to make your team care about what they’re building or understand why they’re building it. It only incentivizes your team to complete things faster.</p><h3 id="2-learning-new-terminologies"><strong>2. Learning new terminologies</strong></h3><p>Let’s be honest…</p><p>The first time you tried to learn agile and its methodologies you scratched your hair wondering what on earth an epic meant. Or what the difference between Scrum and Agile was. </p><figure><img src="https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/03/what-is-an-epic.gif" alt="The unspoken project management challenge - how most teams are when learning agile terminologies"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>While the methodology might work, <mark><strong>it’s incredibly hard for someone new to get a grip of what each of those terminologies even mean.

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>What if if your team could become agile without having to spend time learning the terminologies or the tool? Wouldn't that be great?</p><h3 id="3-unable-to-collaborate-cross-functionally"><strong>3. Unable to collaborate cross-functionally</strong></h3><p>It isn’t enough to just ship new features today.

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Surely you can’t be switching between multiple tools for each team!

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p>This guide describes how to tune your AMD64/x86_64 hardware and Linux system for
running real-time or low latency workloads. Example workloads where this type of
tuning would be appropriate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Line rate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_analyzer">packet capture</a></li>
<li>Line rate
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_packet_inspection">deep packet inspection (DPI)</a></li>
<li>Applications using kernel-bypass networking</li>
<li>Accurate benchmarking of
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/868568/what-do-the-terms-cpu-bound-and-i-o-bound-mean">CPU bound</a>
programs</li>
</ul>
<p>The term latency in this context refers to the time between receiving some event
and the time when the event was processed. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>The time between a network packet was received by a NIC until an application
finished processing the packet.</li>
<li>The time between a request was submitted to a queue and the worker thread
finished processing the request.</li>
</ul>
<p>To achieve low latency this guide describes how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maximize per core performance by maximizing CPU frequency and disabling
power saving features.</li>
<li>Minimize jitter caused by interrupts, timers and other applications
interfering with your workload.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can measure the reduced system jitter using my tool
<a href="https://github.com/rigtorp/hiccups">hiccups</a>. In this example it shows how core
3 was isolated and experienced a maximum jitter of 18 us:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">$ hiccups | column -t -R 1,2,3,4,5,6

<p>The systems UEFI or BIOS usually have a setting for energy profile that adjusts

equivalent.</p>
<h3 id="disable-hyper-threading">Disable hyper-threading</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper-threading">Hyper-threading (HT)</a> or

Since HT/SMT increases contention on processor resources it’s recommended to
turn it off if you want to reduce jitter introduced by contention on processor
resources. Disabling HT/SMT has the additional benefit of doubling (in case of
2-way SMT) the effective L1 and L2 cache available to a thread.</p>
<p>HT/SMT can be turned off in your system’s UEFI or BIOS firmware settings.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Turbo_Boost">Intel Turbo Boost</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD_Turbo_Core">AMD Turbo Core</a> technologies
allows the processor to automatically overclock itself as long as it stays
within some power and thermal envelope. If you have good cooling (set fan speed
to max in BIOS), disable unused cores in BIOS or using the CPU hotplug
functionality it’s possible to run your application cores continuously at the
higher boost frequency.</p>
<p>Check if turbo boost is enabled:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/no_turbo
</code></pre><p>Output should be 0 if turbo boost is enabled.</p>
<p>Alternatively you can use <code>cpupower</code> to check the status of turbo boost:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">cpupower frequency-info
</code></pre><p>Use the <code>turbostat</code> tool to verify the clock frequency of each core. Note that
<code>turbostat</code> will cause scheduling jitter and should not be used during
production.</p>

<h3 id="isolate-cores">Isolate cores</h3>
<p>By default the kernel scheduler will load balance all threads across all
available cores. To stop system threads from interfering with your application
threads from you can use the kernel command line option <code>isolcpus</code>. It disables
scheduler load balancing for the isolated cores and causes threads to be
restricted to the non-isolated cores by default. Note that your critical
application threads needs to be specifically pinned to the isolated cores in
order to run there.</p>
<p>For example to isolate cores 1 through 7 add <code>isolcpus=1-7</code> to your kernel
command line.</p>
<p>When using isolcpus the kernel will still create several kernel threads on the
isolated cores. Some of these kernel threads can be moved to the non-isolated
cores.</p>
<p>Try to move all kernel threads to core 0:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console"># pgrep -P 2 | xargs -i taskset -p -c 0 {}
</code></pre><p>Alternatively use <code>tuna</code> move all kernel threads away from cores 1-7:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console"># tuna --cpus=1-7 --isolate
</code></pre><p>Verify by using the <code>tuna</code> command to show CPU affinities for all threads:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">tuna -P
</code></pre><p>Additionally kernel workqueues needs to be moved away from isolated cores. To
move all work queues to core 0 (cpumask 0x1):</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console"># find /sys/devices/virtual/workqueue -name cpumask  -exec sh -c 'echo 1 &gt; {}' ';'
</code></pre><p>Verify by listing current workqueue affinities:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">find /sys/devices/virtual/workqueue -name cpumask -print -exec cat '{}' ';'
</code></pre><p>Finally verify if cores were successfully isolated by checking how many thread
context switches are occurring per core:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console"># perf stat -e 'sched:sched_switch' -a -A --timeout 10000
</code></pre><p>The isolated cores should show a very low context switch count.</p>
<p>There is a work in progress patch set to improve task isolation even further,
see
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/816298/">A full task-isolation mode for the kernel</a>.</p>

<h3 id="reducing-timer-tick-interrupts">Reducing timer tick interrupts</h3>
<p>The scheduler runs regularly on each core in order to switch between runnable
threads. This will introduce jitter for latency critical applications. If you
have isolated your application cores and are running a single application thread
per isolated core you can use the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.html?highlight=nohz_full"><code>nohz_full</code></a> kernel command line option
in order to suppress the timer interrupts.</p>
<p>For example to enable <code>nohz_full</code> on cores 1-7 add <code>nohz_full=1-7 rcu_nocbs=1-7</code>
to your kernel command line.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that the timer tick is only disabled on a core when there
is only a single runnable thread scheduled on that core. You can see the number
of runnable threads per core in <em>/proc/sched_debug</em>.</p>
<p>The virtual memory subsystem runs a per core statistics update task every 1
second by default. You can reduce this interval by setting <code>vm.stat_interval</code> to
a higher value, for example 120 seconds:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console"># sysctl vm.stat_interval=120
</code></pre><p>Finally you can verify that the timer interrupt frequency is reduced by
inspecting <em>/proc/interrupts</em> or using <a href="https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page"><em>perf</em></a> to monitor timer
interrupts:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console"># perf stat -e 'irq_vectors:local_timer_entry' -a -A --timeout 30000

 Performance counter stats for 'system wide':

CPU0                   31,204      irq_vectors:local_timer_entry
CPU1                    3,771      irq_vectors:local_timer_entry
CPU2                        3      irq_vectors:local_timer_entry
CPU3                        4      irq_vectors:local_timer_entry

      30.001671482 seconds time elapsed
</code></pre><p>In the above example cores 2 and 3 has a reduced timer interrupt frequency.
Expect <code>isolcpus</code> + <code>nohz_full</code> cores to show a timer interrupt every other
second or so. Unfortunately the timer tick cannot be completely eliminated.</p>

<h3 id="interrupt-affinity">Interrupt affinity</h3>
<p>Reduce jitter from interrupt processing by changing the CPU affinity of the
interrupts. This can easily be done by running
<a href="https://github.com/Irqbalance/irqbalance"><em>irqbalance</em></a>. By default
<em>irqbalance</em> will automatically isolate the cores specified by the kernel
command line parameter <code>isolcpus</code>. You can also specify cores to isolate using
the <code>IRQBALANCE_BANNED_CPUS</code> environment variable.</p>
<p>To isolate cores specified in <code>isolcpus</code>:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">irqbalance --foreground --oneshot
</code></pre><p>To isolate core 3 (hexadecimal bitmask 0x8):</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">IRQBALANCE_BANNED_CPUS=8 irqbalance --foreground --oneshot
</code></pre><p>List CPU affinity for all IRQs:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">find /proc/irq/ -name smp_affinity_list -print -exec cat '{}' ';'
</code></pre><p>Finally verify that isolated cores are not receiving interrupts by monitoring
<em>/proc/interrupts</em>:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">watch cat /proc/interrupts
</code></pre><p>References:</p>

<h3 id="network-stack-tuning">Network stack tuning</h3>
<p>For low latency networking I don’t recommend using the Linux kernel networking
stack. Instead I recommend using kernel bypass technologies such as
<a href="https://www.dpdk.org/">DPDK</a>, <a href="https://www.openonload.org/">OpenOnload</a>,
<a href="https://www.mellanox.com/products/software/accelerator-software/vma?mtag=vma">Mellanox VMA</a>
or <a href="https://exablaze.com/">Exablaze</a>. If you are using the kernel networking
stack there are several options you can use to tune it for low latency. I
suggest reading the
<a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/performance_tuning_guide/sect-red_hat_enterprise_linux-performance_tuning_guide-networking-configuration_tools">Red Hat Enterprise Linux Performance Tuning Guide</a>
and the blog post
<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-to-achieve-low-latency/">“How to achieve low latency with 10Gbps Ethernet”</a>
to learn about these options.</p>
<h3 id="disable-swap">Disable swap</h3>
<p>Accessing anonymous memory that has been swapped out to disk will incur a major
page fault. You can prevent this by disabling swap:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">swapoff -a
</code></pre><p>Your application will still incur major page faults when accessing <em>file backed
memory mappings</em> …</p></div></div>

No exaggeration.</p><p>I was having a casual meal and conversation with an old high-school friend, when he said something I could never forget:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Everyone knows HTML.</strong></p></blockquote><p>To this shocking statement, I said, "What do you mean?"</p><p>"You know," he said, "Everyone was on MySpace at some point."</p><p>I know what you're thinking: why didn't I flip the table right then at that outrageous statement? Truth be told, it is a very heavy table and I would look stupid trying.</p><p>But then it occurred to me: maybe he had a point.</p><p>Before I picked up an HTML and CSS book, I was clueless too. As someone who, like many of us, was first exposed to HTML quite young, I just <em>took it for granted</em> and <strong>had no idea I was using it poorly.</strong></p><p>If you are a seasoned front-end developer, you know that there are many people — working people — putting bad HTML into the world, and they <em>need </em>a book on HTML and CSS book desperately to explain not just the <em>how</em> but the <em>why.</em></p><p><strong>We are missing conceptual information.</strong></p><p>There was a time I thought I knew HTML. I thought I was an expert. This was before reading the absolute best book on HTML and CSS for beginners. This was before I was <em>schooled</em> and learned just how complex and important HTML and CSS is — and how writing HTML and CSS <em>well</em> is actually difficult.</p><p>So let’s talk about it.

Why would a teenager read cover-to-cover a book about HTML, whens she absolutely didn’t have to?</p><p>Simple: <strong>the book was fun to read. </strong></p><p>The sheer accessibility of the book changed my life, which is why it is the best book on HTML and CSS.</p><p>Being a high schooler, this HTML and CSS book spoke to me differently than any other book. The sections at the end had cross-word puzzles, conversations happened between personified technical concepts, and there were games — <em>goofy</em> games. It was like returning to grade school, but the concepts were interesting and practical, and they said to me “You can actually get a job doing this.”</p><p>Before I started reading&nbsp;<em>Head First: HTML and CSS</em>, I thought I was overqualified for it. I already knew HTML, after, all. What was it going to teach me? If anything, I planned for the book to be a fun review.</p><p>But obviously I was wrong. The book flooded me with day dreams of becoming a web developer, and when I finally embarked on that career path, with my little checkered knapsack on a broom, I discovered that I would find people — over and over — who were convinced they knew HTML but didn’t.</p><p>Whether it be by using &lt;<code>i&gt;</code>s, <code>&lt;b&gt;</code>s, and <code>&lt;u&gt;</code>s the old-fashioned way, or by nesting blocks within inlines, or by nesting unsemantic <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s endlessly, or by failing to tab correctly, I found these errors made by (it felt like) just about everyone.</p><p>HTML seemed to be an essential skill for any job, and yet the simple basics were owned by nobody.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1578547879475_10379"><p><h2>Reflections on the Dunning-Kruger Effect a Good HTML and CSS Book</h2></p></div><div data-aspect-ratio="65.0381679389313" data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1596349615357_26090"><div>

I have built dozens of websites, and for large companies.

There is always a better way to convey meaning to the browser, so that the browser can effectively deliver it to the reader. I can’t claim I am an ‘expert’ when my focus is scattered to other areas of front-end development, when I know I can reach far greater levels of mastery.</p><p><strong>And that’s just what the Dunning-Kruger effect is: the more we learn, the more we can see of the climb ahead of us.</strong></p><p>It’s like the fog ahead of us lifts the higher we climb.</p><p>But because of all that we have learned, we are shortsighted and we underestimate our abilities.

<p>What this function does is to give you a <em>lumninance-correct</em> grayscale version of any matplotlib colormap.
I've found this useful for quickly checking how my plots might appear if printed in black and white, but I think it's probably even more useful for stoking the flame of the internet's general rant against <em>jet</em>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>If you want to take a step toward joining the in-crowd of chromatically-sensitive data viz geeks, your best bet is to start by bashing <em>jet</em>. Even if you don't know it by name, I can guarantee that if you've read many scientific papers, you've seen jet before. For example, here's a snapshot of a plot from neuroscience journal which is skewered by an <a href="https://abandonmatlab.wordpress.com/2011/05/07/lets-talk-colormaps/">appropriately ranty blogpost</a> on the subject:</p>
<p><img src="http://jakevdp.github.io/figures/jet.png"></p>
<p>Jet is the default colorbar originally used by matlab, and this default was inherited in the early days of Python's <code>matplotlib</code> package. The reasons not to use jet are numerous, and you can find good arguments against it across the web. For some more subdued and nuanced arguments, I'd start with the paper <a href="http://www.jwave.vt.edu/~rkriz/Projects/create_color_table/color_07.pdf">Rainbow Color Map (Still) Considered Harmful</a> and, for more general visualization tips, <a href="http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1003833">Ten Simple Rules for Better Figures</a>.</p>
<p>So what do I have to add to this discussion that hasn't been already said? Well, nothing really, except the code snippet I shared above. Let me show you what it does.</p>

<h2 id="Taking-the-Color-Out-of-Jet">Taking the Color Out of Jet<a href="#Taking-the-Color-Out-of-Jet">¶</a></h2><p>Let's start by defining some data and seeing how it looks with the default <code>jet</code> colormap:</p>

<p>We'll use matplotlib's <code>imshow</code> command to visualize this.
By default, it will use the <code>"jet"</code> colormap:</p>

<p>At first glance this might look OK. But upon closer examination, you might notice that jet's <em>Luminance profile</em> is incredibly complicated.
Because your eye has different levels of sensitivity to light of different color, the luminance is not simply the sum of the RGB values as you might naively expect, but some weighted Euclidean sum of the individual values. You can find more information than you'd ever need to know on <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/color_mods/#grayscale">imagemagick's website</a>.</p>

<p>It's a mess! The greyscale-only version of this colormap has strange luminance spikes in the middle, and makes it incredibly difficult to figure out what's going on in a plot with a modicum of complexity. Much better is to use a colormap with a uniform luminance gradient, such as the built-in grayscale colormap. Let's plot this beside the previous two:</p>

<p>There are some colormaps in here that have very nice, linear luminance gradients, and this is something you should keep in mind when choosing your color map.</p>
<p>Much more could be written about choosing an appropriate color map for any given data; for a more in-depth discussion of matplotlib's maps (and some interesting luminance illustrations), you can refer to matplotlib's <a href="http://matplotlib.org/users/colormaps.html">choosing a colormap</a> documentation.</p>
<p>If you're interested in streamlined statistical plotting in Python with well thought-out default color choices, I'd suggest taking a look at Michael Waskom's <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/">seaborn</a> project, and especially the associated <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/tutorial/color_palettes.html">Color Palette Tutorial</a>.</p>
<p>I hope you find this <code>grayify_cmap</code> snippet helpful, and thanks for reading!</p>

<p>Attention is scarce. And attention is valuable.</p>

<p>Attention is scarce because there is limited time in the day but an unlimited number of things to potentially care about. As an example, consider YouTube. How much of YouTube’s videos do you think you’d get through if you devoted the rest of your life to watching them? Ready for the answer? It turns out you’d die of old age before getting through a single day of uploads.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> In the same way that it’s impossible to pay attention to anything more than a tiny slice of YouTube, it’s impossible to pay attention to anything more than a tiny slice of reality. As a result, we only ever pay attention to a few things. This is why attention is necessarily scarce.</p>

<p>By itself, the scarcity of attention does not give it value. For example, toxic nuclear waste is scarce, but it is not valuable.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>The reason attention is valuable is that it’s almost always a prerequisite for impact. A researcher whose papers get no attention will not lead others to new discoveries. A founder whose startup gets no attention will find no investors and no customers. A journalist whose articles get no attention will inform and entertain no one. Ultimately, it’s difficult to impact people without first earning their attention.</p>

<p>Earning attention is easy if you’ve already had large impact. This is one reason why success begets success. But before your success, how can you get attention?</p>

<p>Here is a simple strategy. Are you researching nuclear fusion? Then talk about the Moore’s law of fusion! Are you founding a battery startup? Talk about the Moore’s law of batteries! Are you writing an article about how paint dries? Talk about the Moore’s law of drying paint!</p>

<p>Comparing your work to Moore’s law is an instant recipe for getting your audience to imagine how you’ll spawn entire industries and transform the world. And the best part about exponential growth is that it starts small. If anyone ever questions whether your work is truly world-changing, you can rebut that while your first steps are admittedly small on an absolute scale, that is how all exponential curves start. Only after growing exponentially for decades will they then become huge.</p>

<p>Riding coattails is a time-tested strategy, and in the world of technology, there are no coattails bigger than those of Moore’s law. So it is hardly a surprise to see more and more people coining their progress as the “Moore’s law of <strong>__</strong>.” In the past few years, I have heard people reference the Moore’s law of solar power, the Moore’s law of mass spectroscopy, and the Moore’s law of aircraft, to name just a few.</p>

<p>Seeing this explosion of references to Moore’s law got me thinking along the same lines as Gordon Moore 50 years ago. How fast are these pseudo-Moore’s laws being invented? Are they following any sort of regular trend that would allow us to cautiously extrapolate? And is this merely a short-term fad or the beginning of a tectonic shift in technological marketing?</p>

<p>To answer these questions, I scoured the web for every reference I could find to the “Moore’s law of <strong>__</strong>” and then traced each back to its earliest mention. In doing so (and with surprisingly little researcher bias) I made a stunning discovery:</p>

<p>There is a Moore’s law of Moore’s laws.</p>

<p>For the past four decades, the number of Moore’s laws coined has been doubling every five years. Early Moore’s laws were technical in nature (e.g., the Moore’s law of software or the Moore’s law of bandwidth), but as time passed, Moore’s laws were invented for topics far afield of computers (e.g., the Moore’s law of corn or the Moore’s law for NFL field goals).</p>

<p>Let’s extrapolate this forward. If the number of Moore’s laws continues to double every five years, then by the year 2080, there will exist a Moore’s law for every single word in the English language.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> We may have a Moore’s law of zebras, a Moore’s law of love, and perhaps even a Moore’s law of absquatulating.</p>

<p>So if you want to use this technique to harness your audience’s scarce and valuable attention, do it soon, before this land grab ends and the entire English dictionary has been claimed.</p>

<p>That’s what I’ve done just now, with the Moore’s Law of Moore’s Laws.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Protocol Buffer, also known as Protobuf, is Google’s language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data. It has been widely used in many applications, such as TensorFlow and <a href="https://grpc.io/">gRPC</a>. We have actually been using it without being aware, thus it has become a black box to most of the users.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I am going to give a short tutorial on how to use Protocol Buffer in C++.</p>

<h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>

<p>Protobuf compiler and libraries could be installed via <code>apt</code> on Ubuntu. However, to use the latest version of protobuf, we install from source code.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>cd</span> /tmp
<span>$ </span>wget https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/download/v3.8.0/protobuf-all-3.8.0.tar.gz
<span>$ </span><span>tar</span> <span>-xf</span> protobuf-all-3.8.0.tar.gz
<span>$ </span><span>cd </span>protobuf-3.8.0
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I chose to install the <code>all</code> version so it would be a little bit slow. To accelerate the installation process., we take advantage of multi-threads.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>./configure
<span>$ </span>make <span>-j16</span>
<span>$ </span>make check <span>-j16</span> <span># Make sure the installation would not have problems</span>
<span>$ </span><span>sudo </span>make <span>install</span>
<span>$ </span><span>sudo </span>ldconfig <span># Refresh shared library cache.</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Protocol Buffer libraries would be installed to <code>/usr/local/lib</code> by default.</p>



<p>To verify protobuf has been installed successfully.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>protoc <span>--version</span>
libprotoc 3.8.0
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="tutorial">Tutorial</h3>

<p>To learn Protocol Buffer, the most intuitive way is to go to the Google Protocol Buffer official website and start its official tutorial. However, the official <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/cpptutorial">tutorials</a> on the Google protobuf website are still using programming standard Proto2 while the latest programming standard is Proto3 which was released in 2016. The official <a href="https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/tree/master/examples">samples</a> are using Proto3 and CMake, however, its CMake is not standard and many of its macros were not documented on the official CMake website. Therefore, I re-implemented Google’s official Protobuf C++ example using Proto3 and CMake with the best practice in a way that users are most likely to run into.</p>



<p>The source code could be found on my GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/leimao/Protocol_Buffer_Examples">Protocol Buffer Examples</a>.</p>



<p>The protobuf <code>proto</code> file, C++ <code>cc</code> file, and CMake <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> files should be self-explanatory since I have put a lot of comments in the code to make it human-readable and easy to understand.</p>

<h3 id="basic-protocol">Basic Protocol</h3>

<p>To summarize the basic protocol of programming using protobuf:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Define the structure of the data in a <code>proto</code> file.</li>
  <li>Implement the C++ programs which serialize/de-serialize the structured data. The programs will use the header and source code files of the structured data generated by the protobuf compiler. Alternatively, the program will use the header file generated by the protobuf compiler and the static library of the structured data generated by the C++ compiler.</li>
  <li>Write CMake compile system to generate the header and source code files of the structured data, static library of the structured data, and the executable files.</li>
</ol>

A big target, but we were confident–as we had the two core ingredients to growth:</p><ol><li>A clear product pitch:"yet another habit app... but free AND with group functionality" </li><li>Growth expertise<sup>1</sup> (endnote noted)</li></ol><p>But after 4 months of burning the midnight oil, we missed our target of 1000 daily users...<strong> by &gt; 5X</strong>.</p><p>Some users do use &amp; promote the app because it's free and has "cool group linking". And our App Store rating is a 4.8, with over 130 combined ratings. But altogether that love amounts to ...<strong> ~5 new user signups/daily</strong>... and &lt; 200 people using (if you are one of them, we really do appreciate it!).</p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Famous growth successes (AirBnB + Craigslist, Dropbox referrals) are well documented, but the stories of the failed experiments along the way are not. Here's a short list we've tried of things <strong>that have not driven any meaningful growth:</strong></p><ul><li>Launching our users' most requested feature </li><li>"Successful" Product Hunt launch (240 upvotes)</li><li>Making the UI ~2X better</li><li>.. and fixing many broken buttons</li></ul><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="whatuserswanted">What users wanted...</h2>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>As any diligent PM would, I reached out to our users for interviews (note: if getting users to interview is <a href="https://snaphabit.app/blog/3-steps-to-product-decisions/#user-feedback">hard</a>, maybe that's a bad sign). Across 15 interviews, the problem most consistently mentioned was the inability to set weekly goals eg. &nbsp;"Work out 4X per week". Other habit apps had the feature, and it aligned with our intuition. So we built it 🎉.</p><figure><img src="https://snaphabit.app/blog/content/images/2020/08/IMG_BE540AC0130B-1-1.png"><figcaption>Ah, problem solved. Success is imminent!</figcaption></figure><h2 id="the-results-">The results...</h2><ul><li>Practically no one uses it. Less than 4% of habits created use our "most requested feature"</li><li>Retention did not change, and in fact, got worse, after launching this</li></ul><!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<!--kg-card-end: html--><p>So in summary, we asked a set of users about their biggest problems — built an MVP of that feature — and <strong>saw no usage change according to any meaningful metric.</strong></p><h2 id="why-did-it-have-no-impact">Why did it have no impact?</h2><p>Even if our users "wanted" the per week feature... I don't believe that was stopping them from evangelizing the product. &nbsp;<strong>Like all things, I suspect it just goes back to the fact we are not <a href="http://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html">solving a real user problem</a>. &nbsp; </strong>At the core, habits are hard to build. There are <em>a lot</em> of habit apps in the app store... and for most people, habit tracking + doing habits with friends is not a natural behavior.</p><p>There are some people we are solving a problem for (we have a few families and friend groups who use religiously), but<strong> </strong>we don't how many of these people even exist, and how to best reach them.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="whatsnexttwopaths">What's next? Two paths...</h2>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><ol><li>Solve a more immediate problem for people</li><li>Learn more about the users we are solving a problem for, and develop a scalable growth strategy to target them.</li></ol><p>For 1, we are actively running experiments. We are partnering with creators to add "challenges" with content to the product. &nbsp;This solves two different user problems - <strong>I want to do X</strong> ("I want to improve my back", "I want to learn about social justice") as well as<strong> I want to engage with this creator. </strong>Second, we are testing public habits, to see if people want random accountability buddies (I'm very skeptical). For 2, we are interviewing existing users to inform specific strategies.</p><p>It is too easy to go heads-down and convince yourself that simply one more feature will change the outcome. To mitigate that, we should have had regular check-ins to step back and question our core hypothesis. The fact that our first 20 users only added .5 friends should have raised a red flag that we had not found a real problem–or at least a set of users that had that problem. Wish us luck as we keep exploring, and let me know if you have any questions (<a href="https://snaphabit.app/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="711b101a1431021f100119101318055f100101">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>).</p><hr><p><em>You can download the app on iOS <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/snaphabit-ai-healthy-habits/id1494552185" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> and Android <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.gravitech.habit.staging" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</em></p><p><sup>1</sup> &nbsp;I thought I understood how growth worked as a former growth PM at a large tech co. <strong>False.</strong> Growth at "large tech co" is very different from growth at small consumer startup.</p>

</div><div><p>If you have a program that wants to do something periodically, say
once every ten seconds, the obvious and simplest way is to just
sleep for ten seconds after each time you do the thing. For example:</p>

  publish_device_stats()
  time.sleep(10)
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Some languages and libraries also offer an API that I've seen called
a 'ticker'; Go, for example, has <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Ticker"><code>time.Ticker</code></a>. A ticker signals or invokes
you somehow every time interval, such as every ten seconds. With
a ticker, you could write the above (in Go) as something like:</p>

<blockquote><pre>ticker := time.NewTicker(10*time.Second)
for {
  t := &lt;- ticker.C
  collect_device_stats(t)
  publish_device_stats(t)
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The big difference between the two is that <strong>a ticker is indifferent
to how long it took you to do your work</strong>. If collecting and
publishing device stats takes two seconds, the sleep approach means
that you will do this once every twelve seconds (two seconds for
the work followed by ten seconds of sleeping). The ticker approach
will collect and publish once every ten seconds, because it signals
you every ten seconds even if it took you two seconds to collect
and publish device stats.</p>

<p>While this may make tickers sound great, this behavior has potential
downsides. Which one you want depends partly on what your reasons are
for sleeping or delaying. In particular, if you're sleeping to limit
the load your actions create, then a ticker may not be what you want,
precisely because it's indifferent to how long your work took. If your
work takes nine seconds and you sleep afterward for ten, you're keeping
things less than 50% busy. If your work takes nine seconds and you have
a ten second ticker, you're keeping things 90% busy; one second after
you finish your work the ticker will go off again and start it all over.</p>

<p>Tickers are great for things you want to happen every N seconds,
even if they take a bunch of time (or a variable amount of time).
Sleeping is great for things you want to happen no more often than
once every N seconds. However, the difference between the two only
matters if what you're doing does (or may) take an appreciable
amount of time compared to the tick (or sleep) interval; if it isn't
going to, you might as well use whichever API is more idiomatic and
convenient, although tickers will probably make things more regular
and precise.</p>

<p>(This set of thoughts was sparked by poking around in <a href="https://gitlab.com/shouptech/cyberpower_exporter">some Python
code</a> that used
the <code>sleep()</code> idiom and then thinking about how it would probably
use a ticker in Go. (Well, in Go it would have a better API for what
it's doing, but apart from that.))</p>

</p><p><strong>TLDR: I built an (open source) app that automatically scolds anyone not wearing their COVID-19 mask. I’d love your help figuring out how to actually make it impactful in your local area.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<figure><p>

<p>I wish I could yell at each a**hole that isn’t <a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2020/06/417906/still-confused-about-masks-heres-science-behind-how-face-masks-prevent">wearing a mask</a> around me. The burden gets even bigger for small business owners, teachers, office workers, bus drivers, and so on.</p>



<p>Then I saw this in an NYT newsletter:&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img src="http://www.talraviv.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IMG_7383.jpg" alt="" width="391" height="435" srcset="http://www.talraviv.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IMG_7383.jpg 828w, http://www.talraviv.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IMG_7383-270x300.jpg 270w, http://www.talraviv.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IMG_7383-768x854.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 391px) 100vw, 391px"></figure></div>



<p>Yeesh. So I thought… when else in history has humanity had issues adopting a simple, low-effort habit to save lives?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Seat belts!</strong></p>



<p>And you know what worked better to increase seat belt usage than any education or law enforcement?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Annoying, automated&nbsp;<a href="https://www.iee-sensing.com/en/blog/details/2019/09/the-seat-belt-reminder-what-s-that-noise-all-about">ding ding ding</a>&nbsp;sounds in cars.</strong></p>



<p>Introducing the <a href="https://wear-a-mask.glitch.me/">😷📸🤖FaceMaskScolder3000</a>! <em>Let the machine do the scolding for you.</em></p>



<p><strong>How to use:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://wear-a-mask.glitch.me/">Load the site</a>&nbsp;on a laptop or tablet* and point the webcam at the entrance to your space. The alarm will go off whenever someone walks in without a mask fully covering their mouth and nose.</p>



<p><em>You may optionally add your own&nbsp;judgmental stare.</em></p>



<p>There’s plenty of companies that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/7/21250357/france-masks-public-transport-mandatory-ai-surveillance-camera-software">provide this</a>&nbsp;commercially. This is the weekend-warrior open-source version that can run on any device with a browser and a webcam.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>[Ok, maker hat off, pragmatic hat on]</em>&nbsp;Now the real bottlenecks here include: awareness, cost, distribution,&nbsp;implementation, maintenance, support, etc. This hack was the easy/sexy part.&nbsp;<strong>If you’ve read this far, perhaps you see a way to solve those challenges in your local neighborhood.</strong></p>



<p><strong>☝️☝️ I’d love to be in touch about this.&nbsp;☝️☝️</strong></p>



<p>*Most people don’t have an extra laptop/tablet laying around. (And if you do, you should donate it to families who could really use it for remote learning.)&nbsp;A friend suggested making a raspberry pi version to bring down costs… open to more cost reducing ideas!</p>

<p><em>Nerdy details:</em></p>



<p>This&nbsp;<a href="https://wear-a-mask.glitch.me/">face detection web app</a>&nbsp;runs&nbsp;<strong>entirely on the frontend</strong>, and does not store any videos or images, neither on your device nor on any servers.</p>



<p>You can&nbsp;<a href="https://glitch.com/edit/?utm_content=project_wear-a-mask&amp;utm_source=view_source&amp;utm_medium=button&amp;utm_campaign=glitchButton#!/wear-a-mask">view source code&nbsp;</a>or&nbsp;<a href="https://glitch.com/edit/?utm_content=project_wear-a-mask&amp;utm_source=remix_this&amp;utm_medium=button&amp;utm_campaign=glitchButton#!/remix/wear-a-mask">fork your own&nbsp;</a>using Glitch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I originally forked off of a tutorial by&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_Dj_gVXao4" target="_blank">CodeSTACKr</a>&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/codeSTACKr/Face-Detection" target="_blank">(Github)</a>&nbsp;which makes use of the incredible&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://justadudewhohacks.github.io/face-api.js/" target="_blank">face-api.js</a>.

I also found a&nbsp;<a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/how-i-built-a-face-mask-detector-for-covid-19-using-pytorch-lightning-67eb3752fd61">way more data-sciency how-to</a>&nbsp;using pytorch.</p>



<p>Learn about the wonders of masks from the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/health/coronavirus-hair-salon-masks.html">NYTimes</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2020/06/417906/still-confused-about-masks-heres-science-behind-how-face-masks-prevent?fbclid=IwAR3qhv694T59BgD9GaW7fdzVC5anYS0vfh2ztRA1CtpAD4Hc-VfHWUZKgpo">UCSF</a>.</p>



<p>The app, code, etc. are all free to use non-commercially (I mean, like a business can use it but not sell it, you get the spirit – maybe this isn’t the right license? Would love advice.)</p>

<p>After I published my post pointing out the <a href="https://oonwoye.com/2020/07/06/diversity-and-big-tech-media/?swcfpc=1">hypocrisy of Big Tech Media in the diversity in tech debate</a>, I got a few grunts of acknowledgement from a couple of the publications covered. Afterwards, these journalists sat on what was surely a newsworthy story. Why? I don’t know.</p>



<p><a href="https://oonwoye.com/2020/07/15/big-tech-media-colluding/">Outside of journalists banding together in silence</a>, the post was well-received, but deep inside, I sensed people wanted a data size larger than just five Big Tech Media publications which I had used. So here is a more comprehensive data bank of 982 individuals across 14 publications. It’s a collaboration between myself and<a href="https://twitter.com/balajis"> Balaji</a>. It includes an estimated race and gender breakdown of those that determine what we read about tech, along with the code snippets used in collating the data as well as the raw data itself.</p>



<p><a href="https://tech-journalism-diversity-report.github.io/code/">Read the study, it includes code samples.</a></p>



<p>Since Big Tech Media hasn’t published an official diversity report of their organizations, the study was done using publicly available information on Twitter and cross-checked with Twitter lists of tech journalists. It uses a few different methods for data collection, and a few different methods to determine race and gender, and gets similar results each time. The data set is open source, so if there are any errors please submit a correction. <strong>However, the best bet would be for each tech media corporation to follow the lead of tech companies and release a public diversity report.</strong></p>



<p>Highlight of the results:</p>



<ul><li>Big Tech Media is ~ 80% White</li><li>Big Tech is ~51% White </li></ul>



<p>Again, you should take a moment and read it: <a href="https://techjournalismislessdiversethantech.com/">https://techjournalismislessdiversethantech.com</a>.</p>







<p><strong>Big Tech Media corporations should do the right thing and release the demographic breakdown of their employee base. There is even a federal requirement to file the </strong><a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/employers/eeo-1-survey"><strong>form EEO-1 Survey</strong></a><strong> which breaks this data down.</strong></p>



<p><strong><em>Acknowledgements.</em></strong><em> I’ve been writing on this topic for </em><a href="https://oonwoye.com/2010/04/05/black-founders/?swcfpc=1"><em>ten years</em></a><em>, and wrote about it </em><a href="https://oonwoye.com/2020/07/06/diversity-and-big-tech-media/"><em>again</em></a><em> in early July on my own accord. After 22 major tech publications refused to publish my analysis (<a href="https://oonwoye.com/2020/07/15/big-tech-media-colluding/">I posit collusion</a>), @balajis graciously RT’d the post <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1280261091302375424">and put up a Bitcoin prize</a> for people to follow up on my work.

I happened to get injured playing basketball and in my free time applied for a job at a local pharmacy store. I have a really terrible interview process where the person interviewing me took very little interest in me and I thought to myself that I wanted to make money on my own terms. </span></p>
<p><span>Although my family has no entrepreneurs, nor did I know any, I got an idea for my first potential income stream. I had always followed themed accounts (nice cars, luxury houses, travel) on Instagram and figured I could build a big page to make money with eventually (and show off to my friends). Short story, I ended up growing a network of Instagram accounts to over 1,000,000 followers within a year and sold the network and used that money to fund my other ventures (of which most failed).</span></p>
<p><span>During that time period I had the advantage of having two great loving parents who provided all I needed, so I could put all my money I wanted into business, for this, I am really grateful. During that time I also worked some jobs, including working for a library, elementary school, and a rehab center.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Out of all the businesses I started with that money, the one that consistently did the best was my agency, Nomads with Solutions. Since then I have started 20+ businesses, and have had most fail, some do ok and a few do good, but Nomads with Solutions has always been the leader</span></p></div>

					<div><p>1) Don’t underestimate the power of small improvement. One of my favorite sayings is “1% better every day”. It’s easy day to day, to look at yourself and your business and feel like you have not gotten better or improved, and then put less effort in as a result. I believe this is the death of most entrepreneurs. Taking action (even if it’s a small action on a day you don’t feel motivated) is key. Most people who are “overnight successes” have been preparing for years. Try to go through every day getting slightly better as a person and a business owner.</p><p>2) Calculate the cost of your ideal lifestyle. Many people think that being an entrepreneur means making $100,000s of dollars and living a luxury playboy lifestyle. While that certainly can be the case, I think it’s important to understand that someone who makes $50,000 a year with their own business but uses their time freedom to be a better father is just as successful as the person who makes $500,000 a year and drives a Lamborghini. Consider the life you want, figure out how much you actually need to live that life, and use this figure to set your goals. For myself, if I made $1,000,000 a year I genuinely would not know what to do with the money, I am a very low maintenance person, who values freedom over anything else, so I base my cost estimate and goals around this.</p><p>3) Be obsessive about learning. Learning is free, you have books, podcasts, YouTube, and many more forms of content that can be used for learning free and at your fingertips. There is no excuse to not learn, you don’t need to go to a fancy private business school to learn the cutting edge strategies, you just need to do a YouTube search.</p></div>

August 1, 2020 | https://eek.ro/why-bpg-will-replace-gifs-and-not-only/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://eek.ro/why-bpg-will-replace-gifs-and-not-only/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Let’s start with some history.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>BPG (Better Portable Graphics) is a new image format with the purpose to replace JPEG image format when quality or file size is an issue.</p>
<ul>
<li>By Fabrice Bellard</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This means that BPG not only is way smaller than JPEG but also delivers a better quality. And that’s not all! It also supports animations!</p>
<p>And when I say animation, I actually say GIF-like movies with MP4 quality that are actually smaller than the mp4 it was built from.</p>
<p>Let’s see an example (I have not included a GIF example because the same quality size and frame rate means that the GIF will have exactly 33.8MB)</p>
<p>So let’s go:</p>
<p>
<video id="ambition-mp4" loop="">
<source src="https://eek.ro/assets/bpg/preview-ambition-no-audio.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<br>mp4, 25fps, 927kb
</p>

<p>
<img id="ambition-bpg" alt="Ambition BPG" src="https://eek.ro/assets/bpg/ambition.bpg">
<br>bpg, 25fps, 518kb
</p>


<p>The movie is called <a href="https://fnd.ie/vid/BJ3B">Ambition</a> and you can view it on <a href="https://fnd.ie/vid/BJ3B">Findie</a>.</p>
<h3 id="spot-the-differences-">Spot the differences? :)</h3>
<ul>
<li>There’s none (the mp4 doesn’t include audio, and neither does the BPG.)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="advantages">Advantages?</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Animation support.</strong> You can have a GIF half the size of an MP4.</li>
<li><strong>Video inline play</strong> (but without sound). One of the biggest problems is that on Mobile Safari no video can be played inline. GIFs solve, and when we have GIFs that are 5% the size of the original, that’s epic!</li>
<li><strong>High compression ratio.</strong> Smaller than a JPG and even smaller than Google’s <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/">WebP</a> with similar quality if not better.</li>
<li><strong>You can start using today</strong> with a Javascript decoder (gzipped size: 56 KB).</li>
<li><strong>And plenty other</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>GIFs today are not even GIFs anymore. With the release of Imgur’s <a href="https://imgur.com/blog/2014/10/09/introducing-gifv/">gifv</a> the internet went nuts for nothing more than a mp4 that has autoplay, and if mp4’s are not supported, or autoplay is disabled (mobiles), they’re replaced with very low quality GIFs.</p>
<h3 id="downsides">Downsides?</h3>
<p>We got just a few…</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Decompiling time!</strong> - Current example is around 8-10s (the bigger the file, the slower the decompiling)… This would be easily solved if browsers would add native support.</li>
<li><strong>Main thread blocking</strong> while decompiling large files.</li>
<li><strong>No sound support</strong> (but who cares, this is image encoding, we’re not talking better video formats).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="so-what-can-we-do">So what can we do?</h3>
<p>Why not go ahead and promote it so that browsers actually support it. Or you can start using it today, it requires some CPU processing, but hey! We’re saving bandwidth! :D</p>
<p>For example there’s a feature request on the Bugzilla Tracker of Firefox - <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1111277">here</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>It was a rollercoaster of a week. It began when <a href="https://bbirnbaum.com/two-lessons-on-reducing-sign-up-friction/">an article</a> I wrote about my side project, which I’d been quietly building for seven months, unexpectedly made it to the number two spot on Hacker News. It ended with me considering whether I should give up on the project completely.</p><p>The side project is called <a href="https://cortadomail.com/">Cortado</a>. It’s a website that gives users control over their information intake by letting them create a customized daily email from sources like Twitter, Reddit, RSS feeds, Hacker News, and more.</p><p>Over the course of 24 hours, ten thousand people read my article. About one hundred of them clicked through to Cortado’s landing page and signed up. My user base grew from a handful of family and friends to more than a hundred strangers from across the world. These new users were giving me great feedback, saying nice things about the service, and sharing helpful criticism.</p><p>I was thrilled that something that I made for myself, something that I wasn’t sure anyone else would want, seemed to be solving a real problem for other people. I couldn’t wait to improve the product and grow my user base more.</p><p>But my excitement didn’t last long. The next day I noticed an email from a service called Mailbrew in my inbox. I didn’t give it much thought because I didn’t remember signing up for a something of that name. I assumed the email was spam and archived it. But the following day I got another email from Mailbrew, and this time I opened it.</p><p>It was a digest of sources from Twitter, Reddit, and RSS feeds about entrepreneurship. It felt familiar.</p><p>I clicked through to mailbrew.com and found a product just like Cortado. Even the copy on the landing page was similar. The term “information diet” was prominently displayed, and the two projects shared a coffee-inspired name.</p><p>But Mailbrew was much further along. It had more features, better-formatted emails, and wider visibility. I was really impressed by what the creators had accomplished.</p><p>My first thought, however irrational, was that Mailbrew must have been inspired by Cortado. Of course that was impossible -- it couldn’t have been so far along if that were the case -- but the idea was just so similar. Soon, however, I realized that the creators had launched their product quite visibly months earlier. In fact, the reason their email showed up in my inbox in the first place was that I had previously subscribed to a product built by them called Unreadit, which had morphed into Mailbrew after the launch.</p><p>I had already been working on Cortado for months before Mailbrew launched, but my progress had been slow (I have a full-time job and two small kids), and I hadn’t yet gotten any users apart from family and friends.</p><p>So it looked like I was the copycat.</p><p>I was bummed. Here I was, poised to double down on my side project and turn it into something bigger, fresh off of an unanticipated burst of validation, when I found out that not only did I have a formidable competitor, but also that I was the unwitting imitator.</p><p>Of course, there’s nothing wrong with seeing a good product and trying to improve on it, but it’s nice to at least know what you’re getting into up front. If I had known about Mailbrew before I started, I might have just signed up for it instead of investing hundreds of hours building my own product.</p><p>I considered my options: I could stop working on Cortado completely, I could find a way to pivot the product to distinguish it from Mailbrew, or I could simply press on, continuing to improve Cortado and grow its user base.</p><p>My first instinct was to stop. I wasn’t that interested in competition, especially when I was second to market. I couldn’t see how I could ever catch up to Mailbrew given my time constraints. But after some thought, I realized I wasn’t ready to stop. I couldn’t give it up just days after I had gotten my first real users, many of whom were telling me how much they liked it.</p><p>Next, I thought more about pivoting. But I was already building the product that I wanted, the one that was solving my own problem and that was apparently also solving a problem experienced by others. A pivot immediately after this positive feedback didn’t feel right.</p><p>So finally I decided to continue with Cortado, focusing on building the best product that I could for my users. Cortado would of course continue to evolve as I got more feedback, but any pivots would be based on what users were telling me instead of on what another product was doing.</p><p>That was two months ago. Since then, I’ve talked to a number of users and worked to address their feedback. Some people I've talked to have also used Mailbrew, and I've learned that one of Cortado's main selling points is simply that it’s free. So that’s at least one concrete difference between Cortado and Mailbrew. We’ll see what others develop.</p><p>The truth is I don’t yet have full clarity on what distinguishes Cortado from Mailbrew. I do know that I don’t want to stop building and growing Cortado, that there’s plenty that I can still learn from this project, and that it can’t hurt for users to have more choice.</p><p>Six months from now, I expect it will be more clear what makes Cortado unique. But the way I will get there will not be by focusing on a competitor. It will be from talking to users, responding to their feedback, and building the best product that I can.</p><hr><p><em>Thanks to Yaw Anokwa, Josh Haimson, and Jenny Klein for providing feedback on drafts of this post.</em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>For a beginner, it is not an easy task to understand Docker. I will admit that I have struggled with using and understanding containers for a long time and I still have a lot to work on. There is a ton of subtleties that goes into solidly grasping the concepts behind Docker, why it is so revolutionary, and why even a budding programmer might benefit from learning it and using it.</p>
<p><img src="https://media2.giphy.com/media/f9Rrghj6TDckb5nZZR/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47kyxuoduhgc2jfofwhix1gvnhxbp4spk29x3p5r0g&amp;rid=giphy.gif" alt="It is amazing"></p>
<p>This is my humble attempt to channel hours and hours of headaches, despair, and a-ha! moments into a beginner-friendly, digestible format. This is the first in a series of articles, and I hope it will give you a headstart in your Docker journey!</p>
<h2 id="some-history">Some history</h2>
<p>The typical way of writing software was simple. A developer works on his local machine, installing a bunch of packages, setting up the environment, etc. Once the necessary code was in good shape, our dev friend shares the code to the ops folks, and... it doesn't work.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ops:</strong> Your code doesn't work.</p>
<p><strong>Dev:</strong> Hey it worked on my machine!</p>
<p><strong>Ops:</strong> What version of <code>XXX</code> do you run?</p>
<p><strong>Dev:</strong> I have no idea, man...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can imagine, a very long time was spent troubleshooting dev environments instead of shipping features and improvements.</p>
<p>The solution found was in <strong>hypervisors </strong>and <strong>Virtual Machines (VMs)</strong>. With VMs, you can package and ship a fully configured operating system along with your code, and spin up as many development and test environments as you see fit with it. Coding becomes just booting up a VM, configuring the environments as you need them, develop software, test it, and your job is done! But how does all of this work? What are VMs? Let's look at the architecture of a computer running VMs.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596313897133/V0-9594IP.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Types of VM"></p>
<p>There are a lot of terms that you might not know, so let's go through them. The <strong>infrastructure</strong> is the computer hardware, meaning CPU, RAM, SSDs and hard disks, motherboards, and anything else is part of the physical components of the host machine. The <strong>Host OS</strong> is the operating system that is installed on the infrastructure. As an example, if you were to purchase a MacBook, the aluminum shell and all the components are part of the infrastructure, while MacOS is the Host Os.</p>
<p>The <strong>hypervisor</strong> is a piece of software that handles the creation of Virtual Machines. Each of these VMs can run their independent process, as they believe they are using the hardware resources from the infrastructure. In reality, the hypervisor allocates hardware from the pool of resources that the infrastructure makes available. In simplest terms, it creates a virtual representation of portions of the Host Machine hardware and lets Virtual Machine run on those, managing the resources.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596306270830/a10Buy6vP.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;gif-q=60" alt="How does a hypervisor work?"></p>
<p>As you can see from the diagram, are two types of hypervisors, depending on where they sit in the system architecture. </p>
<h4 id="bare-metal-hypervisors-type-1-">Bare-Metal Hypervisors (Type 1):</h4>
<p>The hypervisor software is installed directly on the hardware and embedded in its components. In this case, there is no Host OS on these infrastructures. These are the most common type of hypervisors used in production environments, as they are more secure and have a higher performance by being so close to the machine level.</p>
<h4 id="hosted-hypervisors-type-2-">Hosted Hypervisors (Type 2):</h4>
<p>The hypervisor software is installed on an operating system. If you have played with VMs, this is most likely the type of hypervisor that you have used. Simply think of Oracle VirtualBox, Parallels Desktop, VMWare Fusion, or any of the major VM providers.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596309047453/pww4mOHmh.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Bare-metal vs Hosted Hypervisors"></p>
<p>The important point to note here is that, while a hypervisor provides all the resources and virtualized hardware, it does not provide an operating system. This is where the <strong>Guest OS</strong> plays its part, as the OS that is running on the VM. These are fully-fledged OS, including all the additional pieces of software needed to make the system run. This introduces a ton of additional bloat to the process and reduces the number of VMs that a single host can run.</p>
<p>Think about installing any OS. A fresh installation of Windows, for example, also comes with all the usual additional applications and supporting software. I doubt that our production-grade Nginx server will make plenty of use of a shiny copy of Paint 3D. </p>
<h2 id="enter-docker">Enter Docker</h2>
<p>A container solves the timeless problem of "IDK, man. It works on my machine" and the performance overheads of VMs by providing you a portable, replicable image of your development environment that can run on any OS. When an application is containerized, it is bundled with all of its dependencies. In this way, if I want to run the application on a different machine, I don't need to install anything else other than Docker, as all that makes my application tick comes embedded with the Docker Image.</p>
<p>The reason why this works is that Docker runs its containers directly on our machine's <strong>kernel</strong>. The kernel is the very low-level program that has complete control over both software and hardware in your computer, allowing the two to communicate.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596317886484/oQnh3758L.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Where kernel sits in a computer"></p>
<p>All of the Docker container's processes run along with the main operating system's processes, albeit in a logically isolated fashion. This isolation is made possible by utilities in the Linux kernel, specifically <strong>LXC</strong> (LinuX Containers), <strong>cgroups</strong> (control group), and <strong>namespaces</strong>. The specifics of how these work are a little tricky, but we will explore them in a future tutorial. </p>
<p>Docker is built off of these utilities, extending them and making them easy to use with a high-level API, called the Docker Engine. The Docker Engine is a REST API that can be accessed via HTTP or, most commonly, through a command-line interface. It sends instructions to the Docker Daemon, a constantly running background process that manages every interaction between Docker containers and the machine's kernel.</p>

<h4 id="comparing-docker-with-vms">Comparing Docker with VMs</h4>
<p>Let's look again at the VM architectural diagram and let's compare it to how Docker does its things.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596298477648/alMXfcmFx.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="VM vs containers"></p>
<p>This is where Docker has an advantage over VMs. Given that, as we explained before, the containers use the kernel of the host to run their processes, there is no overhead to run a container. A container has no kernel booting to do, it uses only the processes that are necessary to run the containerized application, it stops whenever my application stops and does not occupy hardware resources while not in use.</p>
<h4 id="tl-dr">TL;DR</h4>
<p>Docker is a quick way to package applications in the environment that they were developed in, making sure that they can run no matter the underlying infrastructure, configuration, or OS.</p>
<h4 id="even-more-tl-dr">Even more TL;DR</h4>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596235460123/5sSjCOnwM.jpeg?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="How Docker was born"></p>
<h2 id="some-docker-jargon">Some Docker jargon</h2>
<p>We explained what Docker is why it is great, but you surely have heard of Dockerfiles, Docker images, Docker containers, and maybe others. Let's clarify what those things mean.</p>
<h4 id="docker-image">Docker Image</h4>
<p>Docker images are read-only files that are to build containers. They include everything that the containerized process needs to run, such as source code, dependencies, runtimes, and objects. Most crucially, it provides a private filesystem to the container. Images are lightweight, portable, and can be used to deploy applications quickly and at scale. Every image is built from a Docker-specific script called a Dockerfile. </p>
<h4 id="dockerfile">Dockerfile</h4>
<p>A Dockerfile is a recipe that provides <em>mostly</em> clear and sequential instructions on how to build an image. A Dockerfile is composed of a series of <code>[action]</code> <code>[target]</code> commands, each of which creates a new layer. We will cover layers in a later installment of this series, but for now, we can think of these as building blocks that can be individually cached (i.e. saved to memory) for future builds.</p>
<h4 id="docker-container">Docker Container</h4>
<p>Once we build an image from a Dockerfile, we can finally deploy it as a container. Containers are nothing more than instances of Docker images. Multiple containers can run at the same time on the same machine and multiple containers can be instantiated from the same Docker image. Containers live for the time it takes for their processes to run or until they fail. </p>
<p>Combined with an extremely fast start time, we can see why they are valuable in environments that need to scale quickly. We can start as many containers as our underlying infrastructure can handle or as much as our manually allocated resources allow and we can get rid of them just as quickly.</p>
<h4 id="docker-registry">Docker Registry</h4>
<p>If we want to control every detail of our services on our own, we can write a Dockerfile that specifies every single step of the way to get there. But in most use cases we might be interested in running pre-built images of services that we use daily. For that reason, we can browse  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://hub.docker.com/">Docker Hub</a>, an online registry of pre-built images of various software, from commonly used applications like databases (MySQL, Redis, Postgres, etc...), web servers (Nginx, Apache), or CMS (WordPress) to development environments in most languages (Python, Node.js, Java, etc...).</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1596243680676/_m6HenMF4.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Explore-Docker-Hub.png"></p>
<p>The images that you build through your Dockerfiles can be pushed to the various registries, either to DockerHub if we want to make them publicly available or registries like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/">AWS Elastic Container Registry</a>,  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-registry/">Azure Container Registry</a>, or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://cloud.google.com/container-registry">GCP Container Registry</a> if we want to keep them private. If we want our images to be uber-private, we can also host our private registry by running a local instance of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://hub.docker.com/_/registry">Docker Registry</a>, which is available as a Docker image on Docker Hub.</p>
<p>We have now a better idea of the basic building blocks of Docker. We can also identify the cycle of Docker containers, from creation to instantiation.

<h2 id="next-steps-">Next steps?</h2>
<p>Whew! That was already a lot of information to digest! Make sure you understand the underlying concepts of Docker and why so many developers love the fact that it is in this world. In Part 2 of this series, we will start getting our feet wet with the Docker CLI, pull a few images from Docker Hub, and get experience with properly running containers in various use cases.</p>

        <p>I think CASIO during the 80's exemplified peak design, engineering and quality control (with what they had at their disposal in the 80's). FX-880P is the flagship calculator model with a built in scientific library. Unfortunately, the one I have does not work anymore, but that should not prevent us from taking it apart.</p><figure><img src="https://neil.computer/content/images/2020/04/casio-fx-880p-teardown---1.jpeg" alt="Classic 80's flair - checkout the Neon tube aesthetic in the background."><figcaption>Classic 80's flair - checkout the Neon tube aesthetic in the background.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://neil.computer/content/images/2020/04/casio-fx-880p-teardown---2.jpeg" alt="Manual also in French. 429 pages."><figcaption>Manual also in French. 429 pages.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://neil.computer/content/images/2020/04/casio-fx-880p-teardown---3.jpeg" alt="The FX-880P encased with a sliding cover."><figcaption>The FX-880P encased with a sliding cover.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://neil.computer/content/images/2020/04/casio-fx-880p-teardown---4.jpeg" alt="Made in Japan."><figcaption>Made in Japan.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://neil.computer/content/images/2020/04/casio-fx-880p-teardown---5.jpeg" alt="This was one of the last models to use aluminium case - both front and back with a plastic core.

The exterior construction quality is absolutely top notch. Insides are pretty rough, but that's to be expected for 80's manufacturing capabilities. They didn't have access to specialized tapes (Nitto) and a whole bunch of industries that cater to small electronics manufacturing. If you ever open an iPhone, there is a tremendous amount of systems engineering and DFM/DFA that has lead to a boom in making parts that aid assembly.</p><p>What I admire about CASIO is that they have a consistent design language and I don't mean just the aesthetics. The way they construct their products, the way they make them usable and understandable to the user, the way they communicate the state of the system, the operability, etc. This design language changed over time as the company evolved. The family of products that released in 1983 were different than 1993 in terms of design.</p><p>If somone designed a calculator today, they would most likely be made from ABS plastic, in a clamshell case. An ARM microcontroller that replaces essentially 70% of the chips, and it would be impossible to repair. LCD would be glued in, self tapping screws, and no extra-mile attemps to increase the quality. Infact, the opposite. Modern electronics just feel like everyone is trying to race to the bottom, cut costs at all costs!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p><h3><span>An Overview of the Journey</span></h3></p> <p><span>This is a write-up of the 6-month journey of running e-commerce stores that started in Feb 2017. Within two months of iterations, we were making mid-4-figure revenue per month. We eventually stopped when the paid traffic got more costly, and the experimentation became too time-consuming. </span></p> <p><span>While it was not a big success by any means, I hope other entrepreneurs and hustlers out there have something to gain from this case study. </span></p> <p><span>In the spirit of transparency, I will share all the details about the experience, including the day-by-day payout. If there are parts you would like to see more details on, </span> <a href="https://twitter.com/jhlyeung" target="_blank"><span>tweet at me</span></a> <span>. </span></p> <p><span>Here are some numbers for one of the dropshipping stores we had. We will dive into more details in the sections below. </span></p>  <p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/rumin-gcs-bucket/static/post1.png"></p>  <p><h3><span>The Beginning - Excitement and big goals</span></h3></p> <p><span>Like many internet entrepreneurs, we started looking into e-commerce for "side hustle" ideas, to get us closer to financial freedom and all that good stuff.</span></p> <p><span>We started brainstorming ideas of things we could sell, and attempted to build a brand that would reflect our own desires: minimalist but stylish fashion for men. </span></p> <p><span>We quickly put together a Shopify site, picked a few products to dropship, and launched our first brand </span> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/norwoodlane" target="_blank"><span>Norwood Lane</span></a> <span>.</span></p> <p><span>On paper, dropshipping sounded so appealing: </span> <em>no risk, no need for inventory, high profit margin</em> <span>. All we had to do is pick the right products and find buyers!  It would be profitable as long as customer acquisition cost (CAC) + cost of buying the product from a Chinese supplier is lower than what we sell the item for. Simple unit economics!</span></p> <p><span>We had high hopes, and started dreaming about where the brand can go: which countries to expand to next, how many designers we were going to hire for our own branded products, where we will have our physical locations, which influencers we should reach out to first to promote our products, when I should decide to turn down the job offer from Microsoft...</span></p> <p><span>Very quickly though, reality just hit us in the face...</span></p> <p><span>We were running Facebook and Instagram ads at the time, but </span> <em>the few sales that we made were at a loss</em> <span>.</span></p> <p><strong>Things we tried:</strong> <span> ﻿</span></p> <p><li><span>Targeting different audiences with the ads</span></li></p> <p><li><span>Different ad copies</span></li></p> <p><li><span>Different product offerings: different types of wallets, watches, and other accessories</span></li></p> <p><li><span>Different price points</span></li></p> <p><em>None of that worked.</em></p> <p><span>A few weeks in, it was time for Plan B! The products we were selling at that price point weren't working. We needed to iterate.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Systematically testing product ideas</span></h3></p> <p><span>We decided to launch two more dropshipping stores in parallel - one to test ideas, another to double down on the winning ones:</span></p> <div><li><span>﻿</span> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/theooustore/" target="_blank"><span>The Oou Store</span></a> <span>: selling fun/cute gimmicky gifts. A general gift shop, where we would very quickly test product ideas (along with ad copies).</span></li></div> <p><li><span>A more specialty shop branded around the winning products. We would rebrand it depending on what products seemed to show promise.</span></li></p> <p><span>Each day, we would try an average of 3-5 new products, following this process:</span></p>  <p><li><span>Pick a few that we think could sell, add them to our catalog</span></li></p> <p><li><span>Run 2-3 Facebook ad copies in parallel for each product</span></li></p> <p><li><span>Check responses to the ads a day or two later </span></li></p> <p><span>This was an ongoing process. And after a few weeks of trying many ideas, </span> <em>we finally found a few winners.</em> <span> We found product-ad combos that we could repeatedly profit from.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Examples of products we tried</span></h3></p> <p><span>We tried a variety of products targeted at different niches. Here are some of the more popular items:</span></p> <p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/rumin-gcs-bucket/static/post4.png"></p>  <p><span>...and some less successful ones: </span></p> <p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/rumin-gcs-bucket/static/post3.png"></p>  <p><span>In general, it seemed that the more niche the audience, the better the product performed. But finding a winning product is part art, part science. There were many products that we thought would be winners that flopped, and vice versa.</span></p>  <p><h3><span>Doubling down on the winning products</span></h3></p> <p><span>One of the items that started picking up in sales was a flamboyant rash guard featuring a oriental-esque mythical creature:</span></p> <p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/rumin-gcs-bucket/static/post2.png"></p>  <p><span>First there was order, then another on the same day. Then there was another. We knew something was working.</span></p> <p><span>We moved fast to create a specialty store front to brand around this - </span> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Precision-Fightwear-246986475709277/" target="_blank"><span>Precision Fightwear</span></a> <span>, selling MMA/BJJ training gear. </span></p> <p><span>With the more focused brand, we expanded the product catalog, and replicated the ad campaigns that worked by reallocating our ad spends to the winning products. We curated a few more similar designs from various suppliers, and build our best-selling </span> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=249898468751411&amp;id=246986475709277" target="_blank"><span>Mythical Creatures Collection</span></a> <span>. </span></p> <p><span>We were pricing each product at $40-50 a piece. And we would purchase them from our suppliers for $10-20 each. Our shipping time to the US would be around two weeks, which was an issue for some customers. To address this, we simply had a dedicated email address for shipping inquiries, and manually answered them as soon as we received them. </span></p>  <p><h3><span>Distribution channels stop working at some point</span></h3></p> <p><span>Our main marketing channel was paid ads. Facebook ads in particular. We had tried other ad platforms, such as Instagram and Google / Bing ads. But it was with Facebook ads that we were able to consistently make a profit, thanks partly to the great targeting capabilities.</span></p> <p><span>As Charlie Munger would say: repeat what works. We happily did that.</span></p> <p><span>It worked, but only it didn't.</span></p> <p><span>By July, we were starting to see losses on some days, though sales where still coming in. The cost of running ads and buying the products from our suppliers exceeded what we were making from our customers. </span></p> <p><span>Apparently this is common pattern for internal marketing channels in general. So much so that Andrew Chen termed it the </span> <a href="https://andrewchen.co/the-law-of-shitty-clickthroughs/" target="_blank"><span>Law of Shitty Click-throughs</span></a> <span>, and described it as a "strong gravitational pull".</span></p> <p><span>We tried a few more things to fight this gravity. Tweaked the ad copy. Changed the ad audience. We created new product lines, selling Muay Thai gears, and even started selling our own branded rashguard (custom designed, not dropshipped). </span></p> <p><span>A lot of time spent, not much results. A few more months later, we finally decided to wind down the store and put our energy on other projects.</span></p> <p><span>It could have been that we exhausted the niche within MMA enthusiasts. Or that ads were getting more competitive. Or that competitors popped up (a particularly severe issue with dropshipping businesses). There were many factors at play, and we would never know exactly why it stopped working.</span></p>  <p><span>Looking back, it was a good run. Going in with zero prior experience forced us to learn on the fly. And when there were customers banging on our doors, we had no choice but to get our acts together.</span></p> <p><span>Going forward, I don't think dropshipping is for me. It requires a constant effort to keep testing and promoting product ideas. And the process can get exhausting. The flip side of the low-touch model is that it comes with a low level of control. Too many things can eventually go wrong that would be hard to fix, for it to be a sustainable business model.</span></p>

  <h2 id="outline">Outline</h2>

<p>In the past few posts we’ve gone over how to interpret matrices, basis vectors, and eigenvectors. Today, we’ll put all that together towards a really fun goal - building a toy quantum computer at home!  We’ll even solve a real problem on this “computer” that we couldn’t solve as efficiently on a standard computer.</p>

<p>All this will continue our understanding of the diverse and exciting applications of Linear Algebra.</p>

<h3 id="project-overview">Project Overview</h3>

<p>We are going to build a toy “quantum computer” just using a display, and a few polarizing filters.</p>

<p><strong>Cost:</strong> $20</p>

<p><strong>Materials</strong></p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/materials.jpg">
These are all the materials we will use. A cell phone, and a linear polarizer filter sheet.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Your cell phone (or any display/light).</li>
  <li>
    <p>A polarization sheet such as the one in the link below.</p>

  </li>
  <li>Cut the polarizer sheet into squares. Apply a yellow post it flag so we can track the orientation of the square.</li>

<h3 id="using-light-to-harness-quantum-properties">Using Light to Harness Quantum Properties</h3>

<p>To begin our process of building a computer we need to understand one of the foundational concepts in physics - light! Physicists in the 20th century developed quantum mechanics by studying some of the incredible properties of light. A few of these examples are shown below:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelectric_effect">Photoelectric Effect (the discovery that Einstein won his Nobel Prize for)</a>.
    <ul>
      <li>Showed light is composed of discrete units called photons.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iuv6hY6zsd0">Double-Slit Experiment</a>
    <ul>
      <li>One of the seminal experiments in proving light can behave as both a wave and a particle.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXfrncRey-4">Black Body Radiation problem</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Studied by Max Planck and led to the discovery of Planck’s constant - a fundamental number in Quantum Mechanics.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In this project, we will use the quantum properties of light to create something like a computer. Specifically, we will use a property of light known as polarization to carry out computations in our computer.</p>

<p>Let’s now dive into what exactly light polarization is and how we can leverage it.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="polarization-overview">Polarization Overview</h2>

<p>In the 1800s, Maxwell <a href="https://www.space.com/speed-of-light-properties-explained.html">famously discovered</a> that light is a direct consequence of electricity and magnetism (in fact, the movement of electrons in space generates light!). He found that light is an <strong>electromagnetic</strong> wave (an electric and magnetic field that travels through space).</p>

<p>In this electromagnetic wave, there are two parts: the electric field wave and the magnetic field wave. We call direction of orientation of the electric field the <strong>polarization</strong> of light.</p>

<p>

    Image source: https://socratic.org/questions/58f0fd7e7c0149308e221579
</p>

<hr>

<p>You may be surprised at just how often we use polarization everyday. For instance, any time you put on a pair of polarized sunglasses on a sunny day, you are harnessing light polarization! The black lenses on polarized sunglasses block certain types of light to reduce the glare that we see. The lenses do so by only letting in light of a certain polarization angle and blocking all other light.</p>

<p>

    A sunglass lens is a specific example of a polarization filter - a barrier that only lets in light of a specific polarization angle.
</p>
<p>This may seem fairly straight forward but as we study polarization more, we notice some really counterintuitive properties that are in fact deeply rooted in quantum mechanics. Namely, light can seemingly be polarized in multiple states at once!</p>

<h2 id="photons-can-be-polarized-in-multiple-directions-at-once">Photons Can Be Polarized in Multiple Directions at Once</h2>

<p>Let us now dig into what makes light polarization so useful in building a quantum computer.</p>

<p>Through experiments, we  will see that a single photon of light can be polarized <strong>in multiple directions at once</strong>. This is an idea rooted in quantum physics known as <strong>superposition.</strong>.</p>

    <br>
    In the thought experiment, Schrodinger's Cat is somehow both **dead and alive** at the same time. In the same way, a photon of light can be polarized **in multiple directions** at the same time.
</p>

<p>You may have seen superposition in the famous Schrodinger’s Cat paradox where the cat is somehow both   “dead” and “alive” at the same time. This is exactly what we’ll see is going on with the state of a photon’s polarization!</p>

<h3 id="experiments">Experiments</h3>

<p>Let us now see this ourselves! We will run a set of experiments to in fact ourselves verify that <strong>light can be polarized in multiple angles at once.</strong>. Note with a large set of photons we can explain these effects using classical physics but when we get down to single photons, we need to use the quantum interpretation we will soon discuss.</p>

<p>Here are the experiments we will run:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Experiment 1 -</strong> Shows how polarizers work to help us develop an intuition.</li>
  <li><strong>Experiment 2 -</strong> Shows that if light is vertically polarized it cannot be horizontally polarized.</li>
  <li><strong>Experiment 3 -</strong> Shows that introducing a 45º&nbsp;polarizer allows light to be superposed in multiple polarizations at once.</li>
</ul>

<p>These experiments are heavily based on the following video from Minute Physics and 3Blue1Brown.</p>

<h3 id="experiment-1---effect-of-vertical-polarizer">Experiment 1 - Effect of Vertical polarizer</h3>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>

<p>Our first experiment is going to simply show what a vertical polarizer does. We’ll be able to see that it blocks out some amount of light and only lets vertically polarized light through.</p>

<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Take your cell phone. Turn the display on.</li>
  <li>Place a vertical filter on a section of the phone.</li>
  <li>Only vertically polarized light comes out of that section.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Seeing it in Action</strong></p>

<p>Below is my phone with a small vertical polarizer on the top left corner.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/phone_vertical.jpg">
    A vertical polarizer is present on the top-left corner of the screen.
</p>

<hr>

<p>Conceptually, the polarizer in the top-left corner is blocking everything but vertically polarized light as shown below.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_1.png" alt="Phone Blocked"></p>

<p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>

<p>A vertically polarized filter only lets vertically polarized light out.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="experiment-2---effect-of-vertical--horizontal-polarizer">Experiment 2 - Effect of Vertical + Horizontal Polarizer</h3>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>

<p>Our next experiment will show that vertically polarized light is entirely blocked by a horizontal polarizer. We will place a horizontal polarizer on top of a vertical polarizer and see that little to no light comes through.</p>

<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Take your cell phone. Turn the display on.</li>
  <li>Place a vertical filter on a section of the phone.</li>
  <li>Place a horizontal filter on the same section of the phone.</li>
  <li>Notice how little to no light now appears.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Seeing it In Action</strong></p>

<p>Below is my phone with a both a vertical and horizontal polarizer in sequence (the yellow tab shows the orientation of the polarizer). Notice how we can no longer read the screen.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/phone_blocked.png" alt="Phone Blocked"></p>

<hr>

<p>With the addition of the horizontal polarizer, all light is effectively blocked in the top-left corner of the screen as seen below:</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_2.png">
    A vertical polarizer followed by a horizontal polarizer will block all light.
</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Vertically polarized light cannot go through a horizontal filter.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="experiment-3---effect-of-vertical--45º--horizontal-polarizer">Experiment 3 - Effect of Vertical + 45º + Horizontal polarizer</h3>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>

<p>This is the fun part! We now get to see what happens when you place a 45º&nbsp;filter in between a vertical and horizontal polarizing filter. What we’d expect is the same as in experiment 2 - no light gets through. If polarizers just block light, surely adding a third polarizer will only block more light.</p>

<p>However,  what we end up seeing is quite unexpected!</p>

<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Take your cell phone. Turn the display on.</li>
  <li>Place a vertical filter on a section of the phone.</li>
  <li>Place a horizontal filter on top of it.</li>
  <li>Place a 45º&nbsp;filter in between the vertical and horizontal filter.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Seeing it in Action</strong></p>

<p>Adding the diagonal polarizer really does let some light through (about 50% of it)! You can see this below as I move a diagonally oriented polarizer between the vertical and horizontal polarizer.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/diagonal_polarizer.gif" alt="Diagonal Polarizer"></p>

<hr>

<p>Adding the diagonal polarizer somehow leads to <strong>more light</strong> against all expectations! We can see what’s happening in the diagram below. We will explain this more in the following section so don’t worry too much if you don’t understand it.</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_3.png">
    A vertical filter followed by a 45º filter and then a horizontal filter will let some light through.
</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Light that is seemingly vertically polarized can somehow become horizontally polarized.</li>
  <li>The 45º filter is needed for this change to happen. Without it we see no light can come out.
    <ul>
      <li>Without 45º filter</li>
    </ul>

    <p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_2.png" alt="Experiment 2"></p>

    <ul>
      <li>With 45º&nbsp;filter</li>
    </ul>

  </li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2 id="understanding-experiment-3">Understanding Experiment 3</h2>

<p>So what is going on in Experiment 3? How does vertically polarized light go through the 45º&nbsp;filter?</p>

<h3 id="thinking-of-photons-as-combinations">Thinking of Photons as Combinations</h3>

<p>We can think of a vertical line/vector (black) as the sum of a 135º (blue) vector&nbsp;and 45º (purple) vector. This is shown below:</p>

<div>
    <p>
        <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/vectors.png">
        A vertical line can be seen as a sum of diagonal line 1 and diagonal line 2.
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/vectors_expanded.png">
            The horizontal components of 1 and 2 cancel out when added, leading to a vertical line.
    </p>        
</div>

<p>So in that sense, we can think of a vertically filtered photon as the <strong>combination</strong> of a 135º filtered photon and a 45º filtered photon. Or in other words, the vertically filtered photon can be seen as filtered in <strong>both these angles at once</strong> (Note that it’s a very <strong>specific amount</strong> (<span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mfrac><mrow><msqrt><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></msqrt></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></mfrac></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">  \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} </annotation></semantics></math></span></span>) of each of these options. But we are going to postpone that discussion for now).</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/photon_sum.png">
    A vertically filtered photon can be seen as a combination of a 45º polarized photon and a 135º polarized photon.
</p>

<p>Equipped with this idea, let’s now revisit experiment 4’s setup. We are going to break it up into <strong>Step 1, Step 2, and Step 3.</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_3_broken_up.png" alt="Experiment 3 Broken Up"></p>

<p>We will break up Experiment 3 into three steps.</p>

<h3 id="step-1---vertical-filter">Step 1 - Vertical Filter</h3>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_3_step_1.png">
</p>

<p>Step 1 is fairly straightforward - The vertical polarizer only lets vertically polarized  photons through. The horizontally polarized photons get blocked.</p>

<h3 id="step-2---45ºfilter">Step 2 - 45º&nbsp;Filter</h3>

<p>
    <img src="https://www.dhruvonmath.com/public/images/quantum_computer/exp_3_step_2.png">
</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When Jack Rhysider started <a href="https://darknetdiaries.com/"><i>Darknet Diaries</i></a>, he had a blog that got a few thousand hits per day, 3,000 Twitter followers, and a full-time job as a network security engineer. Now, nearly three years and over 70 episodes later, the podcast has been downloaded over 8 million times. The show, which tells “true stories of the dark side of the internet”—including disturbing tales of hacking, data breaches, and cybercrime— is now a full-time job&nbsp; and pays for a production team.</p><blockquote><p>“I threw up my hands and was like, ‘well forget this. I guess people are already doing this.’”</p></blockquote><p>Rhysider is not only humble about his incredible success—he says you can grow a successful show, too. How? He breaks it down into three steps: Make an excellent show, grow your audience, and monetize it—in that order.</p><hr><p><b>Make an Amazing Show</b></p><p><span>Rhysider quickly realized that part of what made his show stand out was not just the stories he was telling, but the way he told them. “We all have different ways that we’ve grown up and the way we look at the world,” he explains. Owning that singularity was one key to Rhysider’s success.</span></p><p><span>When he launched the first four episodes in the fall of 2017, he didn’t see any other podcasters in the high-drama cybersecurity stories space. As soon as he launched, however, he recalls, “I found four shows that were doing the same thing,” which made him “furious” and nearly caused him to quit. “I threw up my hands and was like, ‘well forget this. I guess people are already doing this.’”</span></p><p><span>But he quickly realized he was giving his listeners an experience no one else was offering. any cybersecurity stories were either being told “in very dry and technical ways” or they came out in discrete chunks as the stories unfolded in real time. In contrast, he waited “until the chips had fallen” to let listeners hear the entire story from start to finish in one compelling episode.</span></p><figure id="attachment_359" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-359"><img src="https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/darknetdiaries-throwing-300x147.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="295" srcset="https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/darknetdiaries-throwing-300x147.jpg 300w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/darknetdiaries-throwing-1024x503.jpg 1024w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/darknetdiaries-throwing-768x377.jpg 768w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/darknetdiaries-throwing-1536x755.jpg 1536w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/darknetdiaries-throwing.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20600%20295'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/darknetdiaries-throwing-300x147.jpg 300w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/darknetdiaries-throwing-1024x503.jpg 1024w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/darknetdiaries-throwing-768x377.jpg 768w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/darknetdiaries-throwing-1536x755.jpg 1536w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/darknetdiaries-throwing.jpg 2000w" data-lazy-src="https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/darknetdiaries-throwing-300x147.jpg"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-359">Image provided by Rhysider</figcaption></figure><p><span>Not only was he creating stories with a distinct, compelling arc, he was also very deliberate in his delivery, leaning heavily on other creators for inspiration. As the saying goes, “good artists borrow, great artists steal.”</span></p><p><span>“When I started podcasting I was stealing everything I could,” Rhysider says. He listened carefully to podcasters including Ira Glass, Malcolm Gladwell, and Aaron Mehnke. One of his signature sounds—making it sound like two people are talking, when there is only one—came directly from the true-crime podcast </span><a href="https://wondery.com/shows/dirty-john/"><i><span>Dirty John</span></i></a><span>. “They pan to the left and talked with a little filter, and then they pan to the right and talk with a different filter and it was the same narrator.” He remembers thinking, ‘Oh my gosh, that’s so cool. I’m gonna try that.’</span></p><p><span>Podcasters weren’t his only creative influences. At one point, Rhysider sought to emulate the </span><i><span>Fight Club</span></i><span> narrator. “I realized he’s got insomnia, so I need to stay up till 3 am and then try to record the episode at 3 am,” he recalled.</span></p><p><span>Rhysider is adamant that a quality show depends on excellent storytelling—and that you can cultivate that skill. He recommends buying books on podcasting, taking courses, and focusing not just on the technology but the content itself. He says it’s not just “what mic to use, but how to tell a great story and how to be entertaining.”</span></p><p><span>With practice and plenty of study, Rhysider found his own groove: “By Episode 30 or so I had my own voice and my own style.” Clearly, it’s working. The show, which saw 800 downloads per episode in the first week, was rated among the</span> <a href="https://lists.pocketcasts.com/top-podcasts-2019"><span>top 25</span></a><span> podcasts of 2019 by Pocketcasts.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>According to Rhysider, “if you don’t make something great, you’re gonna lose your listeners, which means you have to get new listeners faster than you’re losing the listeners. And that’s difficult.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>When you create a great show, you naturally gain what Rhysider calls “superfans,” people who are so excited about it, who want to share it with their friends and family. “They go into the office and they say, ‘You have to listen to this,’ or they tell their friend, ‘You have to listen to this,’ that’s number one,” he explains.</span></p><hr><p><b>Show Promotion to Grow Your Audience</b></p><p><span>Having spent four months toiling over the first four episodes, Rhysider knew he had something special and began promoting the show right away. He relied on traditional social media marketing strategies, creativity, and, when it came to Facebook, luck.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><figure id="attachment_369" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-369"><img src="https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-4.35.06-PM-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1332" srcset="https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-4.35.06-PM-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-4.35.06-PM-300x156.jpg 300w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-4.35.06-PM-1024x533.jpg 1024w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-4.35.06-PM-768x400.jpg 768w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-4.35.06-PM-1536x799.jpg 1536w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-4.35.06-PM-2048x1065.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%202560%201332'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-4.35.06-PM-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-4.35.06-PM-300x156.jpg 300w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-4.35.06-PM-1024x533.jpg 1024w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-4.35.06-PM-768x400.jpg 768w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-4.35.06-PM-1536x799.jpg 1536w, https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-4.35.06-PM-2048x1065.jpg 2048w" data-lazy-src="https://timber.fm/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-27-at-4.35.06-PM-scaled.jpg"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-369">Who is the real Jack Rhysider? Looks like he’s doing something to protect his identity from Google Images.</figcaption></figure><p><span>It turned out, Rhysider had a friend at Facebook “who had a budget to play with.” His friend ended up gifting him $4,000 worth of Facebook ads. In return, his friend experimented with running different types of ad campaigns and had access to the analytics data.</span></p><p><span>Despite not being a huge fan of social media, Rhysider felt his show couldn’t have experienced turbo-charged growth without it. He referred to it as “a magic megaphone that you should not squander.”</span></p><p><span>Rhysider, in fact, only joined Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn after launching </span><i><span>Darknet Diaries</span></i><span>, in order to promote the show. Early on, he invested $500 on paid promotions with Instagram influencers, which he said helped him reach the 5,000 follower mark. From there, he focused on more organic growth on Instagram, continuing to post regularly and interacting with other accounts that were similar to his. He also used Reddit to help grow his audience.</span></p><p><span>Additionally, Rhysider has increased the show’s visibility by taking advantage of other types of networking opportunities. He’s given out </span><i><span>Darknet Diaries</span></i><span> stickers at the many conferences he’s spoken at, has been a guest on about 20 podcasts, and has successfully pitched his show to journalists who mentioned it in publications including </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/18/arts/podcasts-tech-science.html"><i><span>The New York Times</span></i></a><span>, Vulture, and </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/17/grenfell-dust-on-our-lips-darknet-diaries-tip-off-observer-radio-reviews"><i><span>The Guardian</span></i></a><i><span>.</span></i></p><hr><p><b>Monetize</b></p><p><span>With a top-notch show, a huge following, and a strategic approach to monetization, Rhysider has nailed the financial aspect of podcasting. Burnt out on his full-time job, he quit work six months after launching and was able to earn a full-time living six months after that, at the end of 2018. By the beginning of 2019, he had the means to hire additional producers, artists, sound designers, an editor, and a writer.</span></p><p><span>According to one of Rhysider’s </span><a href="https://lime.link/blog/4-methods-for-finding-sponsors-for-your-podcast/"><span>recent blog posts</span></a><span> on Lime Link, he has monetized through ads for the past two years and he’s been very intentional in his approach. Rather than using networks, which wanted to put more ads in his show than he was comfortable with, he uses AdvertiseCast, Megaphone MTM, and Affiliate Ads. “AdvertiseCast does fairly well filling up my ad slots, but because I’m hosted on Megaphone it’s just a matter of enabling MTM and if I have any unfilled ad slots, ads get automatically added in.” Although he said MTM “doesn’t pay very well,” he feels its simple set-up and low-maintenance make it worthwhile. “And if I want to throw in the occasional affiliate deal, then hey why not?” he says, adding,&nbsp; “I typically go for affiliate deals when the sponsor has one but isn’t interested in paying for ads, they just want to pay for results.”</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Regarding Rhysider’s three-pronged approach to building a successful podcast, he’s clear about one thing: No amount of social media promotion or attempts to monetize will work if you don’t have the foundation of a fantastic show that retains listeners. Beyond that, he hesitates to attribute </span><i><span>Darknet Diaries</span></i><span>’ exponential growth to any one strategy. Rather, he likens his success to the effort it takes to complete a cross-country bicycle trip. “It’s like a flywheel that you keep pushing.”&nbsp;</span></p> </div></div>]]>

</a></p><p>By John Lekberg on August 01, 2020.
</p><hr>
<p>This week's blog post is about solving the "Task Ordering" problem in Python.
You will learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to solve the problem using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_search">brute force</a>.</li>
<li>How to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting#Kahn's_algorithm">Khan's Algorithm</a> to solve the problem more efficiently.</li>
</ul>

<p>You have a list of tasks that you need to complete. E.g.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Task A</strong> - do the dishes.</li>
<li><strong>Task B</strong> - wash your clothes.</li>
<li><strong>Task C</strong> - dry your clothes.</li>
<li><strong>Task D</strong> - go for a run.</li>
<li><strong>Task E</strong> - have dinner.</li>
</ul>
<p>But you can't complete the tasks randomly.
You have some constraints. E.g.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Task E</strong> must be done before <strong>Task A</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Task D</strong> must be done before <strong>Task B</strong> and <strong>Task C</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Task B</strong> must be done before <strong>Task C</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Task D</strong> must be done before <strong>Task E</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your goal is to find a way to complete the tasks in order and not violate the constraints.
E.g. one solution is</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Task D</strong></li>
<li><strong>Task E</strong></li>
<li><strong>Task B</strong></li>
<li><strong>Task C</strong></li>
<li><strong>Task A</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>I represent the list of tasks as a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#set-types-set-frozenset">set</a>. E.g.</p>
<pre><code>{ "A", "B", "C", "D", "E" }
</code></pre>
<p>I represent the constraints as a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#mapping-types-dict">dictionary</a> that maps each task to the set
of tasks that must come <strong>after</strong>. E.g. this constraint dictionary</p>
<pre><code>{
    "E": {"A"},
    "D": {"B", "C"},
    "B": {"C"},
    "D": {"E"},
}
</code></pre>
<p>represents these constraints:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Task E</strong> must be done before <strong>Task A</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Task D</strong> must be done before <strong>Task B</strong> and <strong>Task C</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Task B</strong> must be done before <strong>Task C</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Task D</strong> must be done before <strong>Task E</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I represent the solution as a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-list-tuple-range">sequence</a> of tasks. E.g.</p>
<pre><code>("D", "E", "B", "C", "A")
</code></pre>

<p>A simple way to use brute force to solve this problem is to generate every
permutation of tasks and check if it satisfies the constraints.
Here's a Python function, <code>task_order_bf</code>, that does this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>from itertools import permutations, combinations


def task_order_bf(*, tasks, constraints):
    """Solve the 'Task Ordering' problem using brute force.
    
    tasks -- a set of tasks.
    constraints -- a dictionary that maps each task to
        all the tasks that must come after.
    """
    for candidate in permutations(tasks):
        good = all(
            before not in constraints[after]
            for before, after in combinations(candidate, 2)
            if after in constraints
        )
        if good:
            return candidate


tasks = {"A", "B", "C", "D", "E"}
constraints = {
    "E": {"A"},
    "D": {"B", "C"},
    "B": {"C"},
    "D": {"E"},
}

task_order_bf(tasks=tasks, constraints=constraints)
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>('D', 'E', 'A', 'B', 'C')
</code></pre>
<p>This code generates all possible orders of the tasks (ignoring constraints)
using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.permutations">itertools.permutations</a>.</p>
<p>This code checks each candidate by using the built-in function <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#all">all</a> and
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.combinations">itertools.combinations</a> to make sure that for every pair of elements</p>
<blockquote>
<p>( ... <var>before</var> ... <var>after</var> ... )</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That <strong>Task <var>before</var></strong> is allowed to be before <strong>Task
<var>after</var></strong>.</p>
<p>What's the time complexity of this solution? For <var>n</var> tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are <var>n</var><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial">!</a> permutations of the <var>n</var> tasks.</li>
<li>Checking that a permutation satisfies the constraints takes

<p>This problem of "Task Ordering" is also known also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting">"Topological Sorting"</a>.
The concepts of "tasks" and "constraints" map to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_(graph_theory)">vertices</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_graph_theory_terms#edge">edges</a> of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph">directed graph</a>.</p>
<p>For a directed graph with vertices <var>V</var> and edges <var>E</var>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting#Kahn's_algorithm">Khan's
Algorithm</a> performs a topological sort in</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality">|<var>V</var>|</a> + |<var>E</var>|) steps</p>

<p>Here's a Python function, <code>task_order_fast</code>, that solves the "Task Ordering"
problem using Khan's Algorithm:</p>

<p>In this week's post, you learned how to solve the "Task Ordering" problem using
brute force. Then you learned how to recast the problem in terms of topological
sorting. This allowed you to use Khan's algorithm to create a faster solution
to the "Task Ordering" problem.</p>
<p>Topological sorting is useful for dependency resolution in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Build_automation">build systems</a>
(like <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/">GNU Make</a>) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager">package managers</a> (like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Npm_(software)">npm</a>).</p>
<p>In a mathematical sense, topological sorting is like creating a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_extension">linear
extension</a> from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_ordered_set#Formal_definition">partial order</a> to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_order">total order</a>.</p>
<p>My challenge to you:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A solution can't exist if the task constraints form a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_(graph_theory)">cycle</a>. E.g.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Task A</strong> comes before <strong>Task D</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Task D</strong> comes before <strong>Task E</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Task E</strong> comes before <strong>Task A</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>As it is, the functions return <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#the-standard-type-hierarchy">None</a> when a solution is not found.</p>
<p>Your goal is to modify the code to, instead of returning None, raise an
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html">Exception</a> that describes that constraints that are in conflict. E.g.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ERROR: Unable to order tasks. Tasks "A", "D", "E" form a cycle.</p>
</blockquote>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
        <p>Before reading, you can try out my <a href="https://jinay.dev/backprop-vis">interactive visualization
tool</a> for a primer on what I’ll discuss
below.</p>
<p>At their core, neural networks are functions. They take some input, perform a
series of computations, and produce an output. Though most networks operate
in the realm of vectors and matrices, it can be a useful exercise to see them
without the extra barrier of linear algebra. For this purposes of this
explanation, we will only cover single variable functions, but the principles
we will see can be extended into any number of dimensions.</p>

<p>Before we reach the backwards propagation of gradients, we will observe the
forward propagation of values. The forward pass provides a reasonable basis
for understanding how functions can be represented as the result of other
functions combined. Finally, we can represent these functions as a
computation graph—an idea which will be useful when we arrive at the
backward pass of the function.</p>
<h2>Function Composition</h2>
<p>We begin with the most basic function, mapping the entire range of inputs to a single number.</p>
<p><span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">f(x) = 1 
</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p>
<p>Simple, right? Let’s try to incorporate <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> into the mix by creating the identity function—any <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> in will be the same <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> out.</p>
<p><span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>g</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>=</mo><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">g(x) = x 
</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p>
<p>The power comes when we can compose the functions using different operations,
building a new function from the existing ones. By composing functions
together, we can evaluate the individual functions before we evaluate the
parent.</p>
<p><span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>h</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>=</mo><mi>f</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>+</mo><mi>g</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">h(x) = f(x) + g(x) = 1 + x 
</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p>
<p>Likewise, we can feed the output of one function as the input of another,
increasing the complexity of the overall function while retaining its
individual parts.</p>
<p><span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>=</mo><mn>7</mn><mi>x</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>3</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">f(x) = 7x + 3 
</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>g</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>=</mo><msup><mi>x</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">g(x) = x^2 
</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>h</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>=</mo><mi>g</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>f</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>)</mo><mo>=</mo><mo>(</mo><mn>7</mn><mi>x</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>3</mn><msup><mo>)</mo><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">h(x) = g(f(x)) = (7x + 3)^2 
</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p>
<p>Intuitively, a human would first calculate the value of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mn>7</mn><mi>x</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>3</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">7x+3</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> before
squaring the result. This staged ordering creates a hierarchy of functions
that our algorithms can harness.</p>
<p>We see this type of hierarchy building when we build models in any machine learning library. What TensorFlow calls a “model” is just a series of computations composed into a single function.</p>
<pre><code>model = tf.keras.Sequential()

model.add(Dense(<span>512</span>))
model.add(Dense(<span>512</span>))
...
model.add(Dense(<span>32</span>))
model.add(Dense(<span>10</span>))


y = model.predict(X)
</code></pre>
<p>Every time we call <code>model.add()</code>, we are adding to the hierarchy that defines
our neural network. In machine learning, composed functions <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>h</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">h(x)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> defined
earlier are less like <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>+</mo><mi>g</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">f(x)+g(x)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and more like</p>
<p><span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>h</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>=</mo><msub><mi>f</mi><mn>5</mn></msub><mo>(</mo><msub><mi>f</mi><mn>4</mn></msub><mo>(</mo><msub><mi>f</mi><mn>3</mn></msub><mo>(</mo><msub><mi>f</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>(</mo><msub><mi>f</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>)</mo><mo>)</mo><mo>)</mo><mo>)</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">h(x) = f_5(f_4(f_3(f_2(f_1(x))))). 
</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p>
<p>Each <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>f</mi><mi>n</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">f_n</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is a layer in the network which produces an output by using the previous layer as input.</p>
<h2>Building a Computation Graph</h2>
<p>We can visualize a composed function’s structure as a tree, each layer
representing a different stage of the operation. In fact, most programming
languages use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parse_tree">parse tree</a> to
store and evaluate expressions in code. This representation gives us the
ability to view a function in terms of its component parts, recursing
down the levels until we find the constants and variables at the
very bottom.</p>
<p>For example, take the function <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">f(x)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> given below.</p>
<p><span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><msup><mi>e</mi><mrow><mo>−</mo><mi>x</mi></mrow></msup></mrow></mfrac></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">f(x) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}
</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p>
<p>In machine learning, this is a function called the <em>sigmoid</em>, often written
as <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>σ</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\sigma(x)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. Let’s see how we could break the sigmoid into a computation
tree.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.jinay.dev/images/sigmoid1.svg" alt="sigmoid"></p>
<p>Notice how all four leaf nodes are either a constant or a variable. These
are the most elementary parts of any composite function. We can even give the
intermediate functions letter names to highlight how each node is built from its children.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.jinay.dev/images/sigmoid2.svg" alt="sigmoid with labels"></p>
<p>The equations for our new tree would be</p>
<p><span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>a</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>e</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>b</mi><mo>=</mo><mo>−</mo><mi>x</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>f</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>d</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">a=e, b=-x,f=1,d=1
</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>c</mi><mo>=</mo><msup><mi>a</mi><mi>b</mi></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">c = a^b
</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>e</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>c</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>d</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">e = c+d
</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>g</mi><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>f</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>e</mi></mrow></mfrac></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">g = \frac{f}{e}
</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p>

<p>Up until this point, viewing functions as hierarchies seems to add
unnecessary abstractions on a relatively simple topic. However, now that we have
observed how to compute the “forward pass” of a computation graph, we
can compute the reverse using an algorithm called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation">backpropagation</a>.</p>
<h2>Gradient Descent</h2>
<p>In machine learning, the end goal is to <strong>minimize error on a loss
function</strong>, and modern software achieves this goal through an algorithm called
<em>gradient descent</em>. Though I will not attempt to explain the entirety of
gradient descent here, a basic understanding of how it works is essential for
understanding backpropagation.</p>
<p>Loss functions measure how much the outputs of a model, the neural network,
deviate from the labels in a dataset. Tuning the parameters of the model will
either increase or decrease that loss, and the goal is to find the set of
parameters that will give us the minimum loss. Through gradient descent, we
try to estimate which direction we should tune our model in order to achieve
the optimal settings.</p>
<p>Imagine we have a loss function <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>L</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">L</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> that measures the performance of a model with only one parameter, <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">p</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. The graph of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>L</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">L</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> could look something like this graph:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.jinay.dev/images/graph1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>From this zoomed out perspective, the valley in the curve (where loss is the
lowest) is obvious. However, when we train a model, this view is
significantly smaller, giving us only information about how the loss curve looks
near the current value of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">p</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.jinay.dev/images/graph2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Intuitively, we should follow the direction that has the steepest slope downwards to find the minimum. In mathematical terms, we want to look at the gradient of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>L</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">L</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and take a small step in the direction down that gradient.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.jinay.dev/images/graph3.png" alt=""></p>
<p><em>Backpropagation</em> is the tool that helps a model find that gradient estimate so that we know which direction to move in.</p>
<h2>Backpropagation</h2>
<p>The gradient is a collection of slope calculations called the partial
derivatives. Both partial derivatives and gradients answer a question that is
fundamental to our purpose: how does a small change in a variable <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>
respectively change the output function <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">f(x)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. In machine learning, we want
to observe how changing <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> will change the loss.</p>
<p>Before we begin, let us revisit some of the basic rules of calculus that are
crucial to understanding backpropagation. When computing partial derivatves,
we consider other variables of the functions constants, so <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>c</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">c</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> represents any constant or variable other than <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</p>

<p><span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mo>…</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\ldots 
</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p>
<p>There are many more rules, but these basics encompass a large portion of what
functions you might see in machine learning applications. However,
using only these rules, our function vocabulary is significantly
limited. We can only take partial derivatives for simple functions like <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mn>5</mn><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">5x</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>

complex functions is a rule most calculus classes group with the rest.</p>

<p>The chain rule enables us to unravel the composed functions we discussed
earlier—giving us the ability to compute arbitrarily complex partial
derivatives and gradients. Using the computation graph we constructed
earlier, we can move backwards from the final result to find individual
derivatives for variables. This backwards computation of the derivative using
the chain rule is what gives backpropagation its name. We use the

backwards into the children of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>g</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">g</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> .</p>
<p>As a simple example, consider the following function and its corresponding computation graph.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.jinay.dev/images/backprop1.svg" alt="simple example"></p>
<p>As earlier, we assign the intermediate computations letter names to use in
calculation. Let’s find <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∂</mi><mi>g</mi></mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∂</mi><mi>x</mi></mrow></mfrac></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\frac{\partial g}{\partial x}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, the slope of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>g</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">g(x)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>,
when <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x=1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. First, let’s compute the forward pass of the function, labelling
the intermediate values of each node until we reach <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>g</mi><mo>(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>)</mo><mo>=</mo><mn>2</mn><mn>5</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">g(1)=25</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</p>
<p>Starting from the top, let us find the partial derivatives of the
tree on the path down to <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. As we traverse down the tree, it only makes sense to take the partial derivatives with respect to the branches that <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is a part of.</p>

<p>Since <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>e</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">e</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is a direct child of g, the chain rule is not necessary here. Knowing the values of <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">f</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>e</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">e</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> from the forward pass, we can find a numerical value for the partial derivative.</p>

<p>The next node in the path is <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>c</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">c</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, a direct child of the previous node <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>e</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">e</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. To

<p>Finally, we arrive at node <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>b</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">b</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, the node containing <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.

<p>I encourage you to revisit my <a href="https://jinay.dev/backprop-vis/">visualization
tool</a> and play around with various
functions, tracing the path of the gradients down to your original variables.
You might even want to try <code>(4*x+1)^2</code> and see how the gradients change as
<span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> changes.</p>
<p>This simple algorithm for calculating partial derivatives on a computation
graph is very similar to the way neural networks are trained in libraries
like Tensorflow. A firm understanding on how the libraries work allows you to
expand your capabilities beyond the prepackaged layers they provide. More
importantly, it allows you to gain insight on the algorithms used every day to train
computers on any amount of data.</p>
<p>The task remains constant—minimize error on a loss function.</p>
