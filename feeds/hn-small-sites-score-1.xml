<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>C++17 introduced <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/new/operator_new">an alignment argument</a> to <code>::operator new()</code>. It's important to note that if you allocate something using aligned new, you <strong>absolutely must</strong> deallocate it <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/delete">using aligned delete</a>, or the behavior is undefined. LLVM 10.x takes advantage of this alignment parameter, if the compiler supports it. That means if you are compiling on Windows with MSVC set to C++14, <code>__cpp_aligned_new</code> is not defined and the extra argument isn't passed. Otherwise, if it's compiled with MSVC set to C++17, <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/User:D41D8CD98F/feature_testing_macros"><code>__cpp_aligned_new</code> is defined</a> and the extra argument is passed.</p><p>There's just one teeny tiny little problem - <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/6d2f73f821ed5ea584869924b150ac2e6e65c12e/llvm/include/llvm/Support/Compiler.h#L568">the check was in a header file</a>.</p><p>Now, if this header file were completely internal and LLVM itself only ever called <code>::operator new()</code> from inside it's libraries, this wouldn't be a problem. As you might have guessed, this was not the case. LLVM was calling <code>allocate_buffer()</code> from inside header files. The corresponding <code>deallocate_buffer</code> call <em>was</em> inside the same header file, but sadly, it was called from a destructor, and <em>that</em> destructor had been called from inside one of LLVM's libraries, which meant it didn't know about aligned allocations… <strong>Oops!</strong></p><p>This means, if your program uses C++17, but LLVM was compiled with C++14, your program will happily pass LLVM <strong>aligned memory</strong>, which LLVM will then pass into <strong>the wrong delete operator</strong>, because it's calling the unaligned delete function from C++14 instead of the aligned delete function from C++17. This results in strange and bizarre heap corruption errors because of the mismatched <code>::operator new</code> and <code>::operator delete</code>. Arguably, the real bug here is LLVM calling any allocation function from a header file in the first place, as this is just begging for ABI problems.</p><p>Of course, one might ask why a C++17 application would be linking against LLVM compiled with C++14. Well, you see, the <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/tag/llvmorg-10.0.0">prebuilt LLVM binaries</a> were compiled against C++14… <strong>OOPS!</strong> Suddenly if you wanted to avoid compiling LLVM yourself, you couldn't use C++17 anymore!</p><p>Luckily <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/7aaff8fd2da2812a2b3cbc8a41af29774b10a7d6"><strong>this has now been fixed</strong></a> after a bunch of people complained about the extremely unintuitive errors resulting from this mismatch. Unfortunately, as of this writing, <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/">LLVM still hasn't provided a new release</a>, which means you will still encounter this problem using the latest precompiled binaries of LLVM. Personally, I recompile LLVM using C++17 for my own projects, just to be safe, since LLVM does not gaurantee ABI compatibility in these situations.</p><p>Still, this is a particularly nasty case of an unintentional ABI break between C++ versions, which is easy to miss because most people assume C++ versions are backwards compatible. Be careful, and stop allocating memory in header files that might be deallocated inside your library!</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-6c08b430531381f46d95"><div><p>In startups, being defensibile means competitors can’t catch you once you’re ahead. It’s an important characteristic of successful tech companies, so investors often ask about it when you try to raise money.</p><p>Defensibility questions sound like <em>‘once you’re big, how will you stay big?’</em>, <em>‘once you’re&nbsp;winning, how will you keep winning?’</em>, or the slightly misleading <em>‘what stops other people doing this?’</em>.</p><p>Founders tend to think a good answer might be <em>‘what we do is hard to do’</em>. They mix hard with defensible. But hard is not defensible.</p><p>Why? There are two kinds of hardness: Math hard – the hardness of working something out; and Bodybuilding hard – the intrinsic hardness of doing certain things. Both can buy you time, but are never enough.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-70effda3d90febe5484b"><div><p>Working new things out is hard, but that doesn’t mean once something has been worked out it’s hard to do. Things that are hard to come up with but easy to copy are ‘Math hard'.</p><p>Many mathematics problems take a long time to figure out how to solve. But, once you have a method, often the answer can be verified quickly and the method can be learned easily. Pythagoras needed to be smart to invent his theorem, but now children learn it in school. Other Math Hard things include recipes, designs, and new ideas.</p><p>Unless Pythagoras could have kept his method a secret, which is difficult to do, his theorem wouldn’t have helped him build a defensible company. Even school kids can copy it.</p><p>This is like startup ideas for a new kind of user experience or interface – they’re hard to figure out, hard to keep secret (especially if your users experience the secret), and easy to copy.</p><p>But what if you could keep the secret? After all, ‘trade secrets’ can be kept for a while if you’re careful.</p><p>The problem is, the more success you have with your secret, the more effort other people will put in to discover it. You might be really smart, and have worked really hard, but there are lots of smart people who will work hard to be successful. It’s unrealistic to think that you’ll ever have a totally unique insight, let alone one other people couldn’t come up with if they really wanted to.</p><p>If this kind of insight were the defensibility criterion necessary for starting a successful company, by definition almost no-one would ever start one. No matter the ingenuity of your invention, you’re going to end up competing on some other dimension.</p><p>Math Hardness, the hardness of working stuff out, at best buys you time. How much time? Sadly, some amount of time that’s inversely proportional to how much success you’re having. The more valuable your secret turns out to be, the less time you have left.</p><p>The other kind of hardness is the intrinsic hardness of doing certain things. Some things are difficult to do, even if everyone knows how to do them. This is Bodybuilding Hard.</p><p>Achieving a bodybuilder’s physique isn’t complicated, no matter what the endless range of supplements suggests. You need to: exercise frequently with heavy weights; and consistently eat a protein rich diet. Neither is a secret or complicated to understand. Most people, in shape or not, know this stuff. The problem is that doing these things is intrinsically hard. It requires strenuous activity that’s much less fun than seeing friends over beers and burgers.</p><p>Most valuable achievements are Bodybuilding Hard. Learning a new skill, becoming wealthy, being a good partner – all require effort. Practically everyone knows more or less how to achieve these things, but few actually do. That’s why there is a supplement shortcut for every industry: pointy guitars; self help books; and magazines with fancy bedroom techniques.</p><p>Bodybuilding Hard startups are everywhere. On demand services, marketplaces, ecommerce – they’re the backbone of Rocket Internet’s portfolio. They don’t have Pythagorean secrets. These businesses are a pain to run, requiring the coordination of thousands of people and complex operations.</p><p>Without a secret, beating everyone else is hard. But bodybuilding isn’t economically self-sustaining&nbsp;if&nbsp;you’re&nbsp;just&nbsp;good: you need to be the best. Despite small differences, the winner still takes it all.</p><p>Hence, bodybuilding is riddled with steroids and techniques to eek out tiny advantages. Bodybuilding startups are no different — only their steroids are cash, experience, and thousands of traumatised former bankers and consultants.</p><p>The more success you have through doing something Bodybuilding Hard, the more people are going to be incentivised to try to do the same thing. If it’s a startup worth starting, eventually the payoff must outweigh the hardness. And once it’s clear it does, your competition will bring steroids.</p><p>Bodybuilding Hardness, like Math Hardness, buys you time. How much time? Once again, some amount of time inversely proportional to how much success you’re having. The better it’s going, the less time you have left.</p><p>Both types of hardness are good ways to get started. Doing something hard buys you a window of opportunity to succeed. But, once you’re big, something else has to keep you there.</p><p>Defensibility doesn’t imply hardness in the long run, even if hardness is useful in the beginning. For the best companies, things get easier after the hard part.</p><p>Their long term advantage doesn’t require new insights or ongoing effort: it’s too hard to compete like this once the stakes are high enough. Their advantage is unique resource accumulation – like Google’s datasets or Apple’s brand, or scale-enabled product differentiation – like Uber’s liquidity or Amazon’s delivery infrastructure. You need to snowball.</p><p>Doing something hard can put you ahead of your competition, but it isn’t the hardness that will keep you there.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1553598693305_327084"><div><p>Thanks to the EF team for reading drafts of this. If you want to do something hard, and ideally defensible, start&nbsp;<a href="http://www.joinef.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p>PS. My colleague Zefi Hennessy Holland raised an insightful point about hard to find market secrets that&nbsp;I&nbsp;can’t&nbsp;phrase better&nbsp;myself.</p><p>He said&nbsp;<em>‘If Math Hard is finding the solution to a problem many people know about, Market Hard means finding an industry problem that few people know about through a lot of hard work… Your competition can copy your moves but not the underlying insights that made you make them.’</em></p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>The importance of testing in modern software development is really hard to overstate. Delivering a successful product is not something you do once and forget about but is rather a continuous recurring process. With every line of code that changes, software must remain in a functional state, which implies the need for rigorous testing.</p>
<p>Over time, as the software industry evolved, testing practices have matured as well. Gradually moving towards automation, testing approaches have also influenced software design itself, spawning mantras like test-driven development, emphasizing patterns such as dependency inversion, and popularizing high-level architectures that are built around it.</p>
<p>Nowadays, automated testing is embedded so deeply within our perception of software development, it’s hard to imagine one without the other. And since that ultimately enables us to produce software quickly without sacrificing quality, it’s hard to argue that it’s not a good thing.</p>
<p>However, despite there being many different approaches, modern “best practices” primarily push developers specifically towards <em>unit testing</em>. Tests, whose scope lies higher on <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid.html#TheTestPyramid">Mike Cohn’s pyramid</a> are either written as part of a wider suite (often by completely different people) or even disregarded entirely.</p>
<p>The benefit of this approach is often supported by the argument that unit tests provide the most value during development because they’re able to catch errors quickly and help enforce design patterns that facilitate modularity. This idea has become so widely accepted that the term “unit testing” is now somewhat conflated with automated testing in general, losing part of its meaning and contributing to confusion.</p>
<p>When I was a less experienced developer, I believed in following these “best practices” to the letter, as I thought that would make my code better. I didn’t particularly enjoy writing unit tests because of all the ceremony involved with abstractions and mocking, but it was the recommended approach after all, so who am I to know better.</p>
<p>It was only later, as I’ve experimented more and built more projects, that I started to realize that there are much better ways to approach testing and that <strong>focusing on unit tests is</strong>, in most cases, <strong>a complete waste of time</strong>.</p>
<p>Aggressively popularized “best practices” often have a tendency of manifesting cargo cults around them, enticing developers to apply design patterns or use specific approaches without giving them a much needed second thought. In the context of automated testing, I find this prevalent when it comes to our industry’s unhealthy obsession with unit testing.</p>
<p>In this article I will share my observations about this testing technique and go over why I believe it to be inefficient. I’ll also explain which approaches I’m currently using instead to test my code, both in open source projects and day-to-day work.</p>
<p><em>Note: this article contains code examples which are written in C#, but the language itself is not (too) important to the points I’m making.</em></p>
<p><em>Note 2: I’ve come to realize that programming terms are completely useless at conveying meanings because everyone seems to understand them differently. In this article I will be relying on the “standard” definitions, where unit testing targets smallest separable parts of code, end-to-end testing targets software’s outermost entry points, while integration testing is for everything in-between.</em></p>
<p><em>Note 3: if you don’t feel like reading the entirety of the article, you can skip to the end for the summary.</em></p>
<h2>Fallacies of unit testing</h2>
<p>Unit tests, as evident by the name, revolve around the concept of a “unit”, which denotes a very small isolated part of a larger system. There is no formal definition of what a unit is or how small it should be, but it’s mostly accepted that it corresponds to an individual function of a module (or method of an object).</p>
<p>Normally, when the code isn’t written with unit tests in mind, it may be impossible to test some functions in complete isolation because they can have external dependencies. In order to <em>work around</em> this issue, we can apply the dependency inversion principle and replace concrete dependencies with abstractions. These abstractions can then be substituted with real or fake implementations, depending on whether the code is executing normally or as part of a test.</p>
<p>Besides that, unit tests are expected to be pure. For example, if a function contains code that writes data to the file system, that part needs to be abstracted away as well, otherwise the test that verifies such behavior will be considered an integration test instead, since its coverage extends to the unit’s integration with the file system.</p>
<p>Considering the factors mentioned above, we can reason that <strong>unit tests are only useful to verify pure business logic inside of a given function</strong>. Their scope does not extend to testing side-effects or other integrations because that belongs to the domain of integration testing.</p>
<p>To illustrate how these nuances affect design, let’s take a look at an example of a simple system that we want to test. Imagine we’re working on an application that calculates local sunrise and sunset times, which it does through the help of the following two classes:</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>LocationProvider</span> <span>:</span> <span>IDisposable</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>private</span> <span>readonly</span> <span>HttpClient</span> _httpClient <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>HttpClient</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

    
    <span>public</span> <span>async</span> Task<span>&lt;</span>Location<span>&gt;</span> <span>GetLocationAsync</span><span>(</span><span>string</span> locationQuery<span>)</span> <span>{</span>  <span>}</span>

    
    <span>public</span> <span>async</span> Task<span>&lt;</span>Location<span>&gt;</span> <span>GetLocationAsync</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>  <span>}</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>Dispose</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> _httpClient<span>.</span><span>Dispose</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>SolarCalculator</span> <span>:</span> <span>IDiposable</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>private</span> <span>readonly</span> <span>LocationProvider</span> _locationProvider <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>LocationProvider</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

    
    <span>public</span> <span>async</span> Task<span>&lt;</span>SolarTimes<span>&gt;</span> <span>GetSolarTimesAsync</span><span>(</span><span>DateTimeOffset</span> date<span>)</span> <span>{</span>  <span>}</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>Dispose</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> _locationProvider<span>.</span><span>Dispose</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Although the design above is perfectly valid in terms of OOP, neither of these classes are actually unit-testable. Because <code>LocationProvider</code> depends on its own instance of <code>HttpClient</code> and <code>SolarCalculator</code> in turn depends on <code>LocationProvider</code>, it’s impossible to isolate the business logic that may be contained within methods of these classes.</p>
<p>Let’s iterate on that code and replace concrete implementations with abstractions:</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>interface</span> <span>ILocationProvider</span>
<span>{</span>
    Task<span>&lt;</span>Location<span>&gt;</span> <span>GetLocationAsync</span><span>(</span><span>string</span> locationQuery<span>)</span><span>;</span>

    Task<span>&lt;</span>Location<span>&gt;</span> <span>GetLocationAsync</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>LocationProvider</span> <span>:</span> <span>ILocationProvider</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>private</span> <span>readonly</span> <span>HttpClient</span> _httpClient<span>;</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>LocationProvider</span><span>(</span><span>HttpClient</span> httpClient<span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
        _httpClient <span>=</span> httpClient<span>;</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>async</span> Task<span>&lt;</span>Location<span>&gt;</span> <span>GetLocationAsync</span><span>(</span><span>string</span> locationQuery<span>)</span> <span>{</span>  <span>}</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>async</span> Task<span>&lt;</span>Location<span>&gt;</span> <span>GetLocationAsync</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>public</span> <span>interface</span> <span>ISolarCalculator</span>
<span>{</span>
    Task<span>&lt;</span>SolarTimes<span>&gt;</span> <span>GetSolarTimesAsync</span><span>(</span><span>DateTimeOffset</span> date<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>SolarCalculator</span> <span>:</span> <span>ISolarCalculator</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>private</span> <span>readonly</span> <span>ILocationProvider</span> _locationProvider<span>;</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>SolarCalculator</span><span>(</span><span>ILocationProvider</span> locationProvider<span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
        _locationProvider <span>=</span> locationProvider<span>;</span>

    <span>public</span> <span>async</span> Task<span>&lt;</span>SolarTimes<span>&gt;</span> <span>GetSolarTimesAsync</span><span>(</span><span>DateTimeOffset</span> date<span>)</span> <span>{</span>  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>By doing so we were able to decouple <code>LocationProvider</code> from <code>SolarCalculator</code>, but in exchange our code nearly doubled in size. Also note that we had to drop <code>IDisposable</code> from both classes because they <strong>no longer own their dependencies</strong> and thus have no business taking responsibility for their lifecycle.</p>
<p>While these changes may seem as an improvement to some, it’s important to point out that the interfaces we’ve defined serve <strong>no practical purpose other than making unit testing possible</strong>. There’s no need for actual polymorphism in our design, so, as far as our code is concerned, these abstractions are <em>autotelic</em> (i.e. abstractions for the sake of abstractions).</p>
<p>Let’s try to reap the benefits of all that work and write a unit test for <code>SolarCalculator.GetSolarTimesAsync</code>:</p>
<div data-language="csharp"><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>SolarCalculatorTests</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>[</span><span>Fact</span><span>]</span>

<p>Here we have a basic test that verifies that <code>SolarCalculator</code> works correctly for a known location. Since unit tests and their units are tightly coupled, we’re following the recommended naming convention, where the test class is named after the class under test, and the name of the test method follows the <code>Method_Precondition_Result</code> pattern.</p>
<p>In order to simulate the desired precondition in the arrange phase, we have to inject corresponding behavior into the unit’s dependency, <code>ILocationProvider</code>. In this case we do that by substituting the return value of <code>GetLocationAsync()</code> with a location for which the correct solar times are already known ahead of time.</p>
<p>Note that although <code>ILocationProvider</code> exposes two different methods, from the contract perspective <strong>we have no way of knowing which one actually gets called</strong>. This means that by choosing to mock a specific one of these methods, we are making an <strong>assumption about the underlying implementation</strong> of the method we’re testing (which was deliberately hidden in the previous snippets).</p>
<p>All in all, the test does correctly verify that the business logic inside <code>GetSolarTimesAsync</code> works as expected. However, let’s expand on some of the observations we’ve made in the process.</p>

						<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>REST is one of the most important concepts in today's web-centric development circles. You've probably heard about it even if your main focus isn't web development. Despite its popularity, there's a lot of confusion about what it really is. Let's take a look at some concepts to better understand what it means to be RESTful.</p>
<h2 id="itallstartswithaguynamedroy">It all starts with a guy named Roy</h2>
<p>The term REST originates from Roy Fielding's&nbsp;doctoral dissertation, &nbsp;<a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/fielding_dissertation.pdf">Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures</a>. It is, in essence, an architectural style for distributed hypermedia systems whose main goal is interoperability between web services.</p>
<p>A group of <strong>constraints</strong> define the architecture and dictates guidelines on how web services should interact with each other. A system is RESTful as long as it abides by all these constraints. The most important aspect of REST is that it doesn't tell you how to implement your components or which protocol to use. All the principles are about the interaction between components and the interpretation of data exchanged.</p>
<h2 id="inresttheresourceisthemaininformationabstraction">In REST, the&nbsp;Resource&nbsp;is the main information abstraction</h2>
<p>Resources represent things like people, buildings, the value of stocks at a given time, and also collections of these things.&nbsp;In other words, resources are anything you can put a name on.</p>
<p>Because you need a way to identify a particular resource (often for retrieval), they have&nbsp;<strong>resource identifiers</strong>.&nbsp;Most modern implementations use URLs for this task. For example, a way of getting a specific apple resource could be&nbsp;<a href="http://myapiexample/apples/%7Bapple-resource-id%7D">http://myapiexample/apples/{apple-resource-id}</a>.</p>
<p>A resource's <strong>representation</strong>&nbsp;is another important concept. Representations consist of the data for describing a resource plus its associated metadata. These representations can take the form of images or HTML documents, or also JSON or XML. Do not to confuse a resource with its representation: you can represent the same resource as either HTML or JSON. This decoupling between a resource and its representation enables you to access them in a huge variety of formats.</p>
<h2 id="the6architecturalconstraints">The 6 architectural constraints</h2>
<p>There are six architectural constraints that define what a REST system should look like.&nbsp;Their goal is to provide a consistent way to&nbsp;structure&nbsp;a system and at the same time protecting developer creativity. Because of this, the constraints are&nbsp;<strong>guiding principles</strong> that leave implementation details up to the engineer.</p>
<h4 id="1clientserver">1. Client-server</h4>
<p>In the first place, the system must adhere to a <a href="http://toolsqa.com/client-server/client-server-architecture-and-http-protocol/">server-client architecture</a>. The main benefit is the separation of concerns, letting user interface and data storage evolve independently of each other. Furthermore, the user interface becomes more portable as clients only need to know a resource's URI in order to use it.</p>
<p>On modern systems, the server is usually a backend application running on a physical server or in the cloud. The client, on the other hand, is an application running on a web browser or a mobile device. Most web and mobile apps in use nowadays adhere to this principle, communicating with a server using the internet.</p>
<h4 id="2stateless">2. Stateless</h4>
<p>Communication between server and client must be stateless. In other words, all information required to understand a request must be bundled with it. As a result, communication with the backend doesn't need to make use of any context stored on the server. According to Fielding, this approach provides the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Visibility</strong>, because monitoring systems only need to look at a request to understand it.</li>
<li><strong>Reliability</strong>, because it's easier to recover from partial failures when there is no volatile state on the server.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability</strong>,&nbsp;because the server doesn't need to manage/store data across requests, making it easier to release resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>When state is required, the client keeps it (usually as a <a href="http://www.whatarecookies.com/">cookie</a>)&nbsp;and sends it on each subsequent request.</p>
<p>Although this approach provides important benefits, it's important to also consider its drawbacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sending repetitive data on each request increases network usage.</li>
<li>The server loses some control over consistent application behaviour, as correct client implementation becomes more important.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="3cacheable">3. Cacheable</h4>
<p>This means, in essence, that you must label data within a response as cacheable or non-cacheable. The main benefit is a better overall performance by sending fewer requests to the server thanks to the cached values. The cache must manage data properly, otherwise, it will become stale and outdated.</p>
<h4 id="4uniforminterface">4. Uniform Interface</h4>
<p>Probably the most important constraint of the REST architectural style. It requires the system to present a uniform interface between components. Due to the regularity offered by keeping a uniform interface, the architecture of the whole system becomes much simpler. On the other hand, all data must fit a standardized form, something that can degrade efficiency. There are 4 principles that ensure uniformity:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Identification of resources</strong>:&nbsp;resources need to have a unique identifier, enabling you to retrieve and operate on any of them.</li>
<li><strong>Manipulation of resources through representation</strong>:&nbsp;resources can be sent to the client in different formats, such as JSON, XML, PNG, which are&nbsp;<strong>representations</strong>&nbsp;of such resource. Because REST apps can support several representations for the same resource, clients can indicate which one they wish to receive. Afterwards, you can add and update resources by sending representations of the chosen from the client to the server. For example, a service can let you create a 'Person' by accepting any of the following representations:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>{
  "Person":{
    "name": "Person Example",
    "occupation": "Test subject",
    "age": 23,
    "interests": ["be useful", "serve as example"]
  }
}
</code></pre>
<pre><code>&lt;Person&gt;
  &lt;Name&gt;Person Example&lt;/Name&gt;
  &lt;Occupation&gt;Test subject&lt;/Occupation&gt;
  &lt;Age&gt;23&lt;/Age&gt;
  &lt;Interests&gt;
    &lt;Interest&gt;be useful&lt;/Interest&gt;
    &lt;Interest&gt;serve as example&lt;/Interest&gt;
  &lt;/Interests&gt;
&lt;/Person&gt;
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><strong>Self-descriptive messages</strong>:&nbsp;client requests and the server responses are called messages.&nbsp;Having self-descriptive messages means they include all the information needed to make sense of them. Most implementations of REST accomplish this by providing standard methods (like HTTP's actions) and using media types to indicate semantics.</li>
<li><strong>Hypermedia as the engine of application state</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;the term&nbsp;<strong>hypermedia</strong>&nbsp;refers to any content that has links to other content or media. In REST, server responses usually include hypermedia links, enabling clients to traverse resources through them. Furthermore, requests for a resource usually include links to alter its state. For example, implementations using HTTP routinely include links to send POST and PUT requests to alter or create a resource. In essence, REST provides you with a way to alter the application state by making use of hypermedia.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="5layeredsystem">5. Layered system</h4>
<p>This is the classical approach of <a href="https://herbertograca.com/2017/08/03/layered-architecture/">designing the system in layers</a>. The system is a hierarchy where every layer's components have specific goals and behaviour. Equally important, any component can't see beyond the immediate layer with which they interact.</p>
<h4 id="6codeondemandoptional">6. Code on demand (optional)</h4>
<p>This means RESTful services can return executable code if there's a need to do so.&nbsp;The main goal is to reduce the number of functionality clients need to implement by letting them download it afterwards.&nbsp;In modern web development, you can consider downloading and executing javascript as a form of code-on-demand. Fielding considers this an optional constraint, your service can be REST even if it doesn't provide code-on-demand features.</p>
<h2 id="goodbutwhataboutgetpostandallthat">Good, but what about GET, POST and all that?</h2>
<p>REST and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview">HTTP</a> are not the same things; the former is an architectural style while the later is a protocol.&nbsp;There is a common misconception that all RESTful APIs should use HTTP verbs like GET, PUT and POST. In truth, you can use any stateless protocol and call your API RESTful as long as it abides&nbsp;by the constraints.</p>
<p>Fielding never mentioned any specific protocol to implement RESTful services. However, the usage of HTTP in the transport layer&nbsp;is widely supported by software libraries and server infrastructure. As a result, most, if not all, RESTful services nowadays use HTTP instead of other protocols.</p>
<h2 id="itsusefultoknowthebasics">It's useful to know the basics</h2>
<p>Because of its huge popularity, REST is a term you will hear over and over if you work on web development. Knowing that REST is more than just receiving and responding to HTTP verbs is already more than most people know about the topic. So, to recap what we have just learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>REST is an architectural style for building hypermedia systems</li>
<li>The resource is the main information abstraction in RESTful systems</li>
<li>Resources and their representations are decoupled entities</li>
<li>The goal of REST is to achieve a scalable, fault-tolerant and extensible system by enforcing a special set of constraints</li>
<li>A system is RESTful if it abides by the guiding constraints established by Fielding</li>
<li>REST and HTTP are different things, the latter is a protocol</li>
<li>A system can use stateless protocols other than HTTP and still be RESTful</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope that reading this will be as useful for you as writing it was for me.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wow!</p>
<p>I’m literally floored by the response to the previous article in this series, <a href="https://able.bio/kerrishotts/building-a-basic-interpreter-80s-style--79a9d703" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">Building a BASIC Interpreter, ‘80s Style</a>. Not only did it get a lot of views on Able.bio, but it got onto Reddit and Hacker News with some great discussion points as well. I never expected so many people to be interested in this kind of thing. So very cool!</p>
<p>Anyway, a few interesting points were brought up that I quickly wanted to touch on here before continuing on with the series proper.</p>
<h2 id="syntax-highlighted-list">Syntax Highlighted LIST</h2>
<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23731482" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">rbanffy suggested</a> that it’d be really pretty cool to have <code>LIST</code> render the output with syntax highlighting. Most BASICs of the era could have done something fairly simple — they already knew if they were printing a keyword or something else, but Retroputer should be able to go one step further, since it also has quick access to variable type information, inline integers, and strings. This sounds like a cool addition to add, and, it turns out, is relatively trivial to do so.</p>

<p>The colors are <em>technically</em> configurable, but I’ve not got any syntax around that just yet. I’ll probably add a <code>LISTO</code> or <code>LIST OPTIONS</code> command that lets you set them (or disable them) from BASIC.</p>
<h2 id="indented-list">Indented LIST</h2>
<p>Speaking of <code>LISTO</code>, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23734051" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">pmiller laments</a> that the output of <code>LIST</code> typically wasn’t very pretty at all — for example, most BASICs didn’t try to add any extra indentation, which would be very useful when dealing with loops and blocks.</p>
<p>It turns out that BBC Basic had a way to turn this on via <code>LISTO 2</code>, and this also seems like a good addition to add. Retroputer BASIC will support a reasonable number of block-based statements, including (eventually) a block <code>IF</code>-<code>THEN</code>-<code>ELSE</code>-<code>ENDIF</code>, various looping constructs and the like. So having indentation would be nice. I took a stab at that just this afternoon.</p>

<p>It turns out there’s a lot of edge cases that my implementation doesn’t currently handle. For example, how do you easily detect if <code>THEN</code> should start a new block or not? What about terminating two blocks at once with <code>NEXT Y, X</code>? This isn’t impossible to add, but it certainly involves a little more parsing than <code>LIST</code> currently has.</p>
<p>Oh, and if you <code>LIST 40,70</code>, for example, you’ll be incorrectly indented from the very start, since <code>LIST</code> doesn’t try to calculate the indentation for any lines not printed.</p>
<p>Even so, I think with a <code>LIST OPTION</code>, it could still be useful.</p>
<h2 id="optimizations">Optimizations</h2>
<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23733745" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">wizzwizz4</a> and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23739954" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">tjalfi</a> both provided some optimization hints. Retroputer BASIC is very far from being optimized, and so this is very welcome help! wizzwizz4 indicates that it should be easier to just use another loop when a string is detected rather than using a flag. That’s a great suggestion, and I’ll look at adding it. Tjalfi also pointed out the x86 <code>ja</code> instruction, which can also be used to optimize the comparison of the character to the “a”…”z” ASCII range. Retroputer’s ISA doesn’t have an exact analog, but it should still be possible to mimic.</p>
<h2 id="tweaks-from-the-last-post">Tweaks from the last post</h2>
<p>As I’ve been playing around with some ideas for syntax for supporting Retroputer’s graphics capabilities (it supports multiple graphics layers, sprites, and fast memory moves and swaps), I realized that the current method for storing the token vectors was just too unmaintainable.</p>
<p>And so I added a <a href="https://github.com/kerrishotts/retroputer/blob/master/asm/kernel/basic/tokens.js" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">simple JavaScript file</a> that creates <a href="https://github.com/kerrishotts/retroputer/blob/master/asm/kernel/basic/tokens.asm" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">all</a> <a href="https://github.com/kerrishotts/retroputer/blob/master/asm/kernel/basic/stmt-tokens.asm" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">the</a> <a href="https://github.com/kerrishotts/retroputer/blob/master/asm/kernel/basic/expr-tokens.asm" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">tables</a> from a master list. This lets me quickly add new features, but also ensure that tokens are always ordered neatly and, (most important) ensures I don’t accidentally get the various jump tables out-of-sync by a line or two. Once BASIC reaches 1.0, the tokens will probably be frozen, but until then, it needs to be easy to continue adding functionality.</p>
<p>I also updated the last post’s links to point into the correct files above.</p>
<h2 id="useful-resources">Useful Resources</h2>
<p><a href="https://able.bio/kerrishotts/building-a-basic-interpreter-80s-style--79a9d703#comment-ac17e55f-a25a-4db2-aaf4-2ccf5615d42d" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">Carl Gundel suggested</a> “The Elements of Computing Systems” as a useful book for learning how to build a modern computer from first principles. I’d not heard of this, but I’m definitely taking a look now! It’s on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Computing-Systems-Building-Principles/dp/0262640686" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">Amazon</a>. Also known as <a href="https://www.nand2tetris.org/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">NAND To Tetris</a> (which I had heard about). Now I’m doubly excited to try it.</p>
<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23739954" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">Tjafi suggested</a> “Hacker’s Delight” which deals with writing optimized and performant code. It’s also on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hackers-Delight-Henry-S-Warren-ebook/dp/B009GMUMTM" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">Amazon</a>.</p>
<p>I also want to point out some resources which I’ve found very useful when it comes to understanding computer hardware, programming concepts, and the like:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://eater.net/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">Ben Eater</a> has amazing content on his website and on YouTube, including a series on building a 6502 machine on a breadboard, and building a CPU from scratch. Must watch!</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWqBmmPQP40" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">Reverse Engineering the MOS 6502</a> is a really great YouTube video that covers the 6502 chip in extreme depth. Really great stuff.</li>
<li>“Computer Architecture and Organization” (John P. Hayes, Third Edition) was the textbook used for in the Computer Architecture course when I was in college. This was 20 years ago, but I remember the book being a really good primer, and may prove useful.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.pagetable.com/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">pagetable.com</a> has proven invaluable in understanding how various features of my beloved Commodore 64c work — including BASIC and the KERNAL. When I’ve been curious about how a feature of BASIC was implemented, I look here, because they have a fully commented listing of the BASIC interpreter. I don’t always go the same direction, but it can be super handy to see how it was done in the past, if I’m on the right path, and if it even makes sense. It also can yield some surprising insights, which I’ll endeavor to write a post about.</li>
<li>“But How Do It Know?” (J Clark Scott) is a short read that goes into some of the basics of how computers work. I found it engaging, and you may as well. It’s on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/But-How-Know-Principles-Computers-ebook/dp/B00F25LEVC" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">Amazon</a>.</li>

   <p><!--<img align="left" src="../pics/motherboard-and-hands-320.jpg" alt="Motherboard and Hands" style="max-width:100%;height:auto; padding:15px;">-->I think Covid-19 has re-emphasized the value of self-reliance
      to many of us.  During this pandemic, we have been through
      periods when we couldn't simply pick up a phone and call someone 
      to come to our home to make repairs.  We may also have been 
      unable to go to a local shop to get help.  Since so much of our 
      personal business must now be conducted on line, finding inexpensive 
      computers and making basic repairs to our own computers 
      are becoming important life skills.  Without them, we may be unable 
      to stay connected to the world, to attend school, to work, or even to 
      buy food without risking exposure to a potentially deadly disease.</p>

   <p>Fortunately, repairing a computer or buying a cheap used one is not as 
      difficult as many people seem to believe.  All that is needed is the 
      will to learn to do these things in a hands-on way.  Individuals must 
      be willing to take the risks associated with trying to repair 
      their own computers or buying used computers on line.  For most people, 
      I think this is the stumbling block that they never overcome.  
      What separates the people who can do these things from those who 
      cannot is not intelligence.  It is nothing more than need and 
      interest sufficient to get them past the stumbling block.  
      If you are willing to learn, you will win the battle for 
      computer self-reliance.  I will not tell you that you will not be 
      frustrated at times.  I will only say that, if you keep trying, you 
      will learn these skills.</p>

   <p>In this article, I will outline the knowledge and skills that are 
      necessary to solve most basic computer repair problems.  But first, I 
      will explain one simple step that you can take right now to have a 
      working computer in your home at all times.</p>

   <p>Have a working backup computer in your home to use in the event of 
      the death or loss of your primary 
      computer.  A backup computer need not be expensive.  In fact, you can 
      buy a useful, used computer on Ebay for around $50.  The role of this 
      computer is only to get you on line to do research or to buy parts or 
      other necessities until you can get your primary computer working 
      again, or until you can buy another computer.  A rather 
      <a href="https://cheapskatesguide.org/articles/surf-internet.html">old computer</a> is capable of meeting 
      these needs.  Some of you may want to use a cellphone for this, and 
      that will work if your cellphone service includes a data plan.  However, 
      for reasons that will become clear later, a fully-functioning computer 
      would be better.  I have written several articles on 
      cheapskatesguide.org that explain how to buy a cheap computer on 
      line.  For suggestions about multiple approaches to getting a cheap 
      laptop, read <a href="https://cheapskatesguide.org/articles/how-to-get-a-cheap-laptop.html">this 
      article</a>.  For recommendations regarding the best used laptops to 
      buy for less than $100 in the year 2020, read 
      <a href="https://cheapskatesguide.org/articles/best-laptops-in-2020.html">this</a>.  To obtain a more 
      in-depth understanding of the art of buying a computer that meets your
      needs, go to the <a href="https://cheapskatesguide.org/helper/core-page.html">Core 
      Articles</a> page and read the articles there in chronological order.</p>

   <p>Now, let me talk about what you need to know to make basic computer 
      repairs.  If you take good care of your computer, the only computer 
      repair that you are likely to need that is not basic is the 
      replacement of your motherboard.  So, if your computer is completely 
      dead or stops booting at the BIOS screen (both symptoms of a bad 
      motherboard), it is most likely time to buy another computer.  If any 
      life at all remains in your computer--if you hear beep codes (beeping 
      sounds when you turn on your computer), see a repeating 
      pattern of flashing 
      lights, or see an error message on the monitor--you may be looking at 
      a computer that you can repair with basic skills.  Below, are the 
      skills that everyone can learn and then use to make basic computer 
      repairs.  Everyone should be able to:</p>
   <br>

   <div>
   <center><h2>Basic Computer Repair Skills Everyone should have</h2></center>
   <ul>
      <li>Diagnose basic computer problems</li>
      <li>Identify compatible parts for a computer</li>
      <li>Research repair methods on line</li>
      <li>Make basic changes to a computer's BIOS settings</li>
      <li>Create a bootable Linux USB drive</li>
      <li>Re-install software</li>
      <li>Replace a hard drive or solid state drive</li>
   </ul>
   </div>
   <p>When you think about it, that is a rather short list.  I think that a
      simple lack 
      of desire is the only thing that prevents most people from obtaining 
      these skills.  In this article, I will not teach you these skills.  I 
      will tell you what you need to know and a little about how to find 
      that knowledge.  I will tell you how to develop the skills.  And, in 
      some cases, I will outline basic repair procedures and tell you how 
      to fill in the details yourself.</p>
   <h2>Diagnosing Basic Computer Problems</h2>
   <p>Most symptoms of computer problems are pretty obvious.  Your keyboard 
      stops working.  A USB connector stops working.  Your computer's monitor 
      doesn't light up.  A message appears on your monitor saying that no 
      operating system was found.  Your computer's sound stops working.  
      The question is not whether a problem exists but whether it is 
      a software problem or a hardware problem.</p><p>The easiest way to rule out a hardware problem is to boot your 
      computer from a reliable, bootable Linux USB flash drive.  If the 
      problem does not go away, then you most likely have a hardware 
      problem.  One obvious exception is that the problem will go away if 
      your hard drive is bad.  I recommend creating a bootable Linux Mint 
      USB flash drive, making sure it works with every piece of hardware on 
      your computer, and setting it aside for when you need it.  Another
      benefit of having a Linux USB flash drive is that if your hard
      drive dies, you will still be able to use your computer to get online.</p>

   <p>If the problem is caused by software, an online search will give you 
      possible sources and procedures to follow to narrow down the problem 
      to one source.  If an error message appears, use an online search 
      engine to search for that exact error message with quotes around it.  
      If you have no error message, you may have more difficulty finding 
      information about the exact source of your problem.  This process can 
      sometimes take several hours, but you are likely to eventually find 
      hints that will lead you to solutions for most computer software 
      problems, especially if the software is common.</p><h2>Identifying Compatible Parts for Your Computer</h2>
   <p>On a modern laptop computer, the battery and hard drive are the only 
      parts that are likely to fail that you can replace with basic 
      skills.  In over 30 years of owning computers, I have never had a 
      single stick of RAM fail.  I have had RAM sticks that have become 
      unseated from their connectors and needed to be pushed back into 
      place.  Beep codes or flashing lights can give you a hint that RAM 
      has become unseated.  Search on line for "computer beep codes" to find 
      the specific beep codes for your computer.</p> 

   <p>You generally only need to know three things to locate a 
      hard drive or Solid State Drive (SSD) that is compatible with your 
      computer: the hard drive's width, its thickness, and the type of 
      connector to which it connects.  You need to buy a replacement hard 
      drive that will physically fit into the space in your computer, and  
      the connector of the hard drive must connect to the connector on your 
      computer's motherboard.  These days, all spinning hard drives are 
      either 2.5 or 3.5 inches wide with SATA connectors.  Most 
      regular-sized desktop computers have 3.5 inch hard drives, but a 
      laptop will never have a 3.5 inch hard drive.  Laptops have either 2.5 
      inch spinning hard drives or some kind of SSD.  If your computer has 
      an SSD, you will have to open up your computer and look at the SSD's
      connector.  Unfortunately, these days, there are a small number of 
      solid state drive connector types that have the same physical 
      connections but are different electrically.  In my opinion, this was 
      a very poor design decision.  Luckily, these SSD's are the only 
      example in the computer industry of which I am aware of this being 
      allowed to occur.  Find a picture of your SSD's connector online and see 
      what type of connector the online source says it is.  Wikipedia is 
      a good place to look for this type of information.  Once you have 
      identified the type of connector on your SSD, see what Wikipedia says 
      about its electrical arrangement.  Do not try to use an SSD with a 
      different type of electrical arrangement, because this is likely to 
      damage the replacement SSD and your computer.</p>
   <h2>Researching Computer Repair Methods on Line</h2>
   <p>When your computer develops a problem, you can almost always find a 
      procedure on line for solving it.  First, you need to know <i>what</i> to 
      do to repair a generic computer with the specific problem you are 
      seeing.  You can read on line about <i>what</i> to do to repair the 
      problem on a generic Windows, Mac, or Linux computer.  Then, if the 
      problem is a hardware problem, you need to know <i>how</i> to 
      physically accomplish the repair of your specific model of computer.  
      A Youtube video can be beneficial for this.  An example of 
      what I mean by "<i>how</i> to physically repair" is the following.  When 
      you open the back of your laptop, what screws do you have to unscrew 
      to release the hard drive?  Do you pull the hard drive straight out 
      perpendicularly from the back of the laptop?  Or, do you slide it 
      parallel to the back of the laptop …</p></div></div>

                 <p>Cinema Saturdays: The Disaster Artist</p>
<p>If you're a fan of "Movies so bad they're actually good", then you might have heard of "The Room". It's a 2003 romantic drama (?) widely considered one of the worst movies ever made. A few years' back, one of the leads wrote a book about it, and James Franco decided to take the book and turn it into a movie.</p>
<p>So this is a movie about "How did this junk ever get made?"</p>
<p>I haven't seen The Room, so I can't say if I'd like it or not. Romantic/Drama movies are tough to do realistically for new filmmakers, and the producer/writer/director/star of The Room, Tommy Wiseau,  was completely new and inept at all of that. The Room got made, basically, because some random guy who couldn't act decided he was going to make his own movie, because why not?</p>
<p>The Disaster Artist follows Wiseau and one of the actors from The Room as they meet and become friends. Who is this Wiseau dude? We never really know. He has an awful speech impediment, but when asked, ...</p>            </div>

                 <p>Cinema Saturdays: Independence Day</p>
<p>Today's July 4th, and around this house that means we re-watch the movie "Independence Day" I'm not sure why we do this. It's not that great of a movie, although it was good enough to watch a couple of times. I think it's the rousing speech by the President at the end of the movie, played by Bill Pullman.</p>
<p>As a hacker (I mean that in a good sense), Independence Day was great. Who knew? When the aliens show up, we can hack into their computer system! I sure hope those guys aren't using something outdated, like CICS or VAX/VMS. I'm not up to speed on my Big Endian assembly skills.</p>
<p>So let's quickly review our success with fictional aliens.</p>
<p>H.G. Wells in War Of The Worlds  had tripods that showed up and zapped everything, only to be killed by bugs, microbes. Flash forward to The Day The Earth Stood Still, and our neighbors get pissed and send Klaatu to tell us to stop being such assholes. We generally agree, so he leaves,  but only after making...</p>            </div>

<h2 id="details">Details</h2>
<p>Each feed is <a href="https://validator.w3.org/feed/check.cgi?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhnrss.org%2Fnewest">valid RSS</a> served over <a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=hnrss.org">HTTPS</a>.</p>
<h3 id="firehose-feeds">Firehose Feeds</h3>
<p>The “firehose” feeds contain all new posts and comments as they appear on Hacker News:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/newest
https://hnrss.org/newcomments
</pre>
<p>For just the posts that have appeared on the front page:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/frontpage
</pre>
<p>If the firehose feeds are a bit too noisy for you, <a href="#activity-parameters">read below</a> on filtering them with the <code>points</code> and/or <code>comments</code> parameters.</p>
<h3 id="search-feeds">Search Feeds</h3>
<p>You can get a feed of new posts and/or comments containing keywords by using the <code>q=KEYWORD</code> parameter. For example:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/newest?q=Django
https://hnrss.org/newcomments?q=WordPress
</pre>
<p>If you want a single search feed but multiple keywords, separate the keywords with " OR ":</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/newest?q=git+OR+linux
</pre>
<h3 id="reply-feeds">Reply Feeds <sup>new</sup></h3>
<p>Keep an eye on replies to your comments:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/replies?id=jerf
</pre>
<p>Use a comment ID to follow replies to a particular comment:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/replies?id=17752464
</pre>
<h3 id="self-post-feeds">Self Post Feeds</h3>
<p>Ask HN, Show HN, and polls are available:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/ask
https://hnrss.org/show
https://hnrss.org/polls
</pre>
<h3 id="job-feeds">Job Feeds</h3>
<p>Job opportunities from YC funded startups:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/jobs
</pre>
<p>Top level comments in threads created by the whoishiring bot:</p>
<pre># Comments from "Who is hiring?" threads
https://hnrss.org/whoishiring/jobs

# Comments from "Who wants to be hired?" threads
https://hnrss.org/whoishiring/hired

# Comments from "Freelancer? Seeking freelancer?" threads
https://hnrss.org/whoishiring/freelance

# All of the above
https://hnrss.org/whoishiring
</pre>
<p><span>new</span> If you’re interested in something in particular, you can apply a <code>q=KEYWORD</code> parameter to only return relevant comments. For example, filter the top-level “Who is hiring?” comments to only those containing “React Native”:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/whoishiring/jobs?q=React+Native
</pre>
<h3 id="user-feeds">User Feeds</h3>
<p>If you don’t want to miss a post or comment by a given user, you can subscribe to that user’s feed:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/submitted?id=USERNAME # posts
https://hnrss.org/threads?id=USERNAME   # comments
https://hnrss.org/user?id=USERNAME      # everything
</pre>
<h3 id="thread-feeds">Thread Feeds</h3>
<p>A feed of new comments on a particular post can be found at:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/item?id=THREAD_ID
</pre>
<p>With <code>THREAD_ID</code> the numerical ID found in the URL when viewing the comments page.</p>
<h3 id="feed-options">Feed Options</h3>
<p>You can modify any feed’s output using URL parameters. Multiple parameters can be applied at the same time by joining them with an ampersand.</p>
<h4 id="activity-parameters">Activity Parameters</h4>
<p>You can apply a <code>points=N</code> or <code>comments=N</code> parameter to any feed to filter the results so only entries with more than N points or comments are shown:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/newest?points=100
https://hnrss.org/ask?comments=25
</pre>
<p>You can also combine both parameters:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/show?points=100&amp;comments=25
</pre>
<p>Unfortunately, <code>/newcomments</code> <a href="https://github.com/algolia/hn-search/issues/55#issuecomment-73599729">does not work</a> with a <code>points=N</code> parameter.</p>
<h4 id="search-parameter">Search Parameter</h4>
<p>By default, searches on posts only look at titles. If you want to search against the submitted URLs themselves, use the <code>search_attrs</code> parameter.</p>
<p>Here are some examples:</p>
<pre># Search for posts with "WordPress" in the title only
https://hnrss.org/newest?q=WordPress

# Search for posts with 'WordPress' in the URL only
https://hnrss.org/newest?q=WordPress&amp;search_attrs=url

# Search for posts with 'WordPress' in the title or URL
https://hnrss.org/newest?q=WordPress&amp;search_attrs=title,url

# Don't restrict search attributes at all. This searches for posts
# containing 'WordPress' in all attributes indexed by Algolia. This was
# the behavior of searches prior to June 3, 2015
https://hnrss.org/newest?q=WordPress&amp;search_attrs=default
</pre>
<h4 id="link-parameter">Link Parameter</h4>
<p>By default, the RSS <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element points to the submitted article’s URL. The <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element can be changed to point to the Hacker News comment page by appending <code>link=comments</code> to the end of the URL. For example:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/newest?link=comments</pre>
<h4 id="description-parameter">Description Parameter</h4>
<p>You can disable the <code>&lt;description&gt;</code> element entirely by passing the <code>description=0</code> parameter:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/newest?description=0</pre>
<h4 id="count-parameter">Count Parameter</h4>
<p>By default, feeds return 20 RSS items. This can be increased via the <code>count=N</code> parameter:</p>
<pre>https://hnrss.org/newest?count=50</pre>
<p>There is a hardcoded limit of 100 entries, so keep that in mind.</p>
<h4 id="feed-formats">Feed Formats <sup>new</sup></h4>
<p>By default, feeds come back as RSS. But if you add “.atom” or “.jsonfeed” to any endpoint you’ll receive the contents in <a href="https://validator.w3.org/feed/docs/atom.html">Atom</a> or <a href="https://jsonfeed.org/">JSON Feed</a>, respectively.</p>
<pre># The front page as Atom
https://hnrss.org/frontpage.atom

# "Ask HN" with 10 or more comments as JSON Feed
https://hnrss.org/ask.jsonfeed?comments=10
</pre>
<p>Note: These formats are a lot less battle-tested than the RSS format. If you see any wonkiness or they don’t play nicely with your feed reader, please <a href="https://github.com/edavis/hnrss/issues/new">open an issue</a> with as much information as possible. Thanks!</p>

<h2 id="colophon">Colophon</h2>
<p>hnrss.org is served by nginx on DigitalOcean. HTTPS is provided by Let’s Encrypt. DNS is provided by Namecheap.</p>
<p>As of September 2018, the feeds are generated using the <a href="https://gin-gonic.github.io/gin/">Gin</a> web framework. From May 2014 to August 2018, the feeds were generated using the <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a> web framework.</p>
<h2 id="repositories">Repositories</h2>
<p>A brief primer on the various repositories that make up hnrss.org:</p>
<p>When hnrss.org was created in May 2014, code and documentation lived inside the <a href="https://github.com/edavis/hnrss">edavis/hnrss</a> repository.</p>
<p>In April 2017, the documentation was revamped, migrated into Hugo, and was given its own repository at <a href="https://github.com/edavis/hnrss-docs">edavis/hnrss-docs</a>. The built assets were copied into the <code>docs/</code> folder on <a href="https://github.com/edavis/hnrss">edavis/hnrss</a> and published at <a href="https://edavis.github.io/hnrss/">https://edavis.github.io/hnrss/</a>.</p>
<p>In August/September 2018, hnrss.org underwent a rewrite from Flask to Gin. This new code lives at <a href="https://github.com/edavis/go-hnrss">edavis/go-hnrss</a>.</p>
<p>So, as of September 2018, that’s the state of play. The documentation source lives at <a href="https://github.com/edavis/hnrss-docs">edavis/hnrss-docs</a>. The Gin source that powers hnrss.org lives at <a href="https://github.com/edavis/go-hnrss">edavis/go-hnrss</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/edavis/hnrss">edavis/hnrss</a> contains the Flask code that powered the site from May 2014 to August 2018 as well as the <code>docs/</code> folder that contains the built HTML copied from <a href="https://github.com/edavis/hnrss-docs">edavis/hnrss-docs</a>.</p>
<p>At some point I’d like to simplify all of this and run everything out of one repository, but it’ll do for now.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Reading time: 4 minutes</p><p><strong>Retain subscribers, increase revenue, and scale your Product-as-a-Service (PaaS) business.&nbsp;</strong><br></p><p>Increasing and retaining your subscriber base is fundamental to your PaaS subscription business; after all, they provide you the growth you need to scale your PaaS business. Payment issues are one of the leading causes for involuntary churn.<br></p><p>Yet, the number one reason for losing customers in the checkout process is due to a failure in the card network infrastructure. Cards weren't designed for recurring payments; typically, credit cards expire every three years, but they can also get canceled, lost, stolen, or hit card limits.&nbsp;<br></p><p><a href="https://www.firmhouse.com/blog/7-marketing-tips-to-grow-your-product-as-a-service-paas-subscription-business">Keeping existing subscribers </a>on board is crucial to increase your customer average lifetime value (CLTV). However, even if you try hard to offer a seamless experience, you can still lose customers due to payment issues or because your customer card details it's out of date.<br></p><p><strong><em>Preventing failing payments allows you to decrease churn and increase subscribers' retention.&nbsp;</em></strong><br></p><p>Within a subscription business, customer churn is the number of customers who stop paying for their subscription or unsubscribe during a given period. Addressing your customer churn challenges becomes more and more critical for your subscription business to succeed.<br></p><p><strong>There are two types of churn: voluntary and involuntary churn.&nbsp;</strong><br></p><p>In a voluntary churn, the customer decides to consciously unsubscribe when they feel they aren't getting the full value of your product or can't continue with the subscription. Voluntary churn is often based on customer experience rather than the operational aspects, and regardless of what you do, they might be already convinced to unsubscribe.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Now, involuntary churn is not so related to your customer experience. Rather is more related to operational issues that could happen due to payment issues, expired credit cards, insufficient funds or card number has been updated.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Involuntary churn isn't limited to the least engaged customers; it affects all of your subscribers, even the happiest customers (remember they can be as forgetful as your lowest-value customers). By tackling involuntary churn, you can prevent customers from leaving while continuing offering a seamless subscriber experience.<br></p><p>Involuntary churn harms your customer lifetime value (CLTV). Let's say your monthly recurring revenue (MRR) is $60, and the expected contract time is 18 months. If you have 100 customers and half of them are lost due to involuntary churn, that's 50% of subscribers leaving you, which is not useful when you are looking to optimize your customer lifetime value.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Involuntary churn is somehow easier to prevent than voluntary churn. You can avoid these involuntary challenges without changing your proposition or business model. Involuntary and voluntary churn can be prevented by taking the right measurements and having the proper process at hand.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>Implement solutions to reduce churn and prevent customers from leaving you again in the future with these 5 strategies:&nbsp;</strong><br></p><p><strong>1. Understand the root cause</strong></p><p>Billing systems or credit cards don't work perfectly. Understand what happens when a payment fails; try to get the why does this keep happening. You can use data for this or ask your customers directly.<br></p><p>If you still have some payment issues this could be due to:&nbsp;<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Insufficient funds from your customer</li><li>Customer bank account was closed</li><li>Credits over the limit to make payments</li><li>The card has expired or is no longer valid&nbsp;</li><li>Other payments issues (like temporary down-time)<br></li></ul><p>These are crucial questions to determine how to prevent failed payments and to retarget customers that are about to leave. If you set your payment schedule around your customer's lifestyle, you can ensure that the funds are ready and available for the payment.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>2. Ensure member data is up to date</strong></p><p>Expired cards are the most significant contributors to involuntary churn. Most credit cards expire after three years, meaning customers need to update their card number or expiration date (probably during the same time they are your subscribers). The longer the <a href="https://www.firmhouse.com/blog/the-product-as-a-service-business-case-calculator">lifetime value (LTV)</a>, the more involuntary churn there will be.<br></p><p><strong><em>Run automated updates, so customer data stays up to date.</em></strong> Communicate with your customers if any changes are done to the billing systems.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Also, keep customers up to date if there's any change in your pricing or logistics. Besides, understand if they are having problems receiving the products, or not enough customer experience and address these issues with a seamless payment process with a proactive customer-oriented billing and payment service.<br></p><p><strong>3. Keep customers that don't want to leave from leaving with a seamless experience</strong><br></p><p><a href="https://www.firmhouse.com/blog/what-is-product-as-a-service-paas">Product-as-a-Service (PaaS)</a> subscription services often lack reminders that communicate with their customers about changing their payment options. Friendly reminders are always a great way to include a link that enables customers to update their billing information with an urgent tone.&nbsp;</p><p>Avoid the spam folder. Regularly engage with subscribers, ask them in a non-spammy way what they think about the product, if they are happy or dissatisfied with your product, and why. Make sure to send your emails from return email so customers can get in touch with you if needed. By educating customers about special offers, price increases, and product updates, you stay connected with subscribers and increase your customer experience (CX). Make sure to have constant contact with customers to re-engage with them in the future.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>4. Subscriber management&nbsp;</strong><br></p><p>Provide a seamless branded personalized billing and payment experience across all channels—update subscribers' information with a software that can update information more easily. Use a single solution that manages your subscribers through their life cycle, including payment updates and add-ons.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>Offer customers flexible and customized payment schedules with constant support. Accept payments through various channels with integration with secure payment gateways that accept multiple currencies and safeguard your customer data.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Subscriber management is also essential once your company starts scaling, and extra support is needed, especially with your customized promotions, customer satisfaction, inventory management, and logistics.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>5. Built-in dunning management</strong></p><p>Know when subscribers' credit card expires and take further steps to prevent this from happening. One way to remind your subscribers when their payment method needs to be updated is by sending a series of email (app) messages encouraging customers to update their payment method soon.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Pre-dunning messages come in handy when you don't have another payment system to catch card updates.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Keep in mind that it is crucial to dedicate most of your efforts while they are still actively using your product (considering that it would be harder to capture them once they are gone).&nbsp;<br></p><p>Irregular billing can happen throughout your customer lifecycle, so having subscribers engaged can severely impact your customer subscription status. Prompt users to update their billing information while you make sure to have all the systems in place to prevent involuntary churn. In Firmhouse, we try at least 3 times to collect the payment from the customer. If this is not successful, the customer gets flagged and customer support will take over. Having a well trained customer support team can help you with this.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>‍<br>What to learn how to automate your payment process? You can use a single platform to run your Product-as-a-Service (PaaS) subscription from end-to-end instead of having different systems. <a href="https://www.firmhouse.com/contact">Contact us</a> Firmhouse to get started with your PaaS subscription today.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>AWS SDK maintains and publishes SDK for over 110+ services with simultaneous and multiple updates on all SDKs each day. They have achieved what interestingly all big companies strive for, launching new APIs seamlessly and effortlessly. During AWS’s flagship entertainment packed conference <strong>“Re</strong><strong>:Invent</strong><strong>,</strong> the SDKs are updated with new APIs that were just announced in less than 2 hours for the world to use.</p><p>To interact with any of AWS services you need to use a AWS SDK in either python, JAVA or any other language your software is in.</p><p>I have been an engineer in the PHP SDK for AWS which is open-sourced on Github and anyone can look at the code published by the AWS teams. AWS manages over 8 SDKs including SDK for <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java">JAVA</a>, <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-ruby">ruby</a>, <a href="https://github.com/boto/boto3">python</a>, <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js">javascript</a>, <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-php">PHP</a>, <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go">go</a>, <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-cpp">C++</a> and few other languages.</p><p>Generally, it requires a significant number of engineers to manage just one SDK. To make sure all APIs and features are available across all SDKs is a big feat. In this post, we are going to talk about how to scale the SDK and how AWS is able to achieve perfect synchronicity across all SDKs without sloshing the SDKs team with manually updating each SDK.</p><h2>How does the AWS SDK works?</h2><p>All of the SDKs have two parts one is the core and another one has all the service-specific code. The core of the SDK handles various features such as “Signing each request using AWS’s Sigv4 protocol”, security features, SSL handling, multi-threading, asynchronous requests, waiters, paginators, and a ton more features.</p><p>The other part of each SDK is based on “model” files specific to each service. All model files are exactly similar across each SDK.</p><p>The difference is very evident in AWS’s python SDK which is divided into two different repositories “boto” and “botocore”.</p><p>All the model files are built on <a href="https://www.openapis.org/">OpenApi</a> protocol to some extent and are compatible with <a href="https://swagger.io/">Swagger</a> API Protocols.</p><p>Here is a JSON definition for DynamoDB in AWS PHP SDK with name “<a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-php/blob/master/src/data/dynamodb/2012-08-10/api-2.json">api-2.json</a>” and &nbsp;the exact same file also exists in Boto SDK as well with name “<a href="https://github.com/boto/botocore/blob/develop/botocore/data/dynamodb/2012-08-10/service-2.json">service-2.json</a>“</p><p>At AWS each service will release these JSON model files which specify all information related to each API &amp; service. Each SDK handles these files a bit differently as compared to other SDKs. PHP SDK loads these JSON files dynamically in each client to allow various APIs while JAVA SDK will pre-build each of these methods into concrete classes.</p><p>Each AWS team maintains and releases these service-specific model file, which are then consumed by each SDK team in the way they would like.</p><h2>Show Me The Code!</h2><p>I am sure these look like magic to you like it looked to me when I first saw it. So let’s dig into the code. We will look at PHP SDK example as that is team I was part of for over a year and know in and out of the SDK.</p><p>We will look at the AWS Lambda’s invoke method.</p><pre><code>"Invoke":{
      "name":"Invoke",
      "http":{
        "method":"POST",
        "requestUri":"/2015-03-31/functions/{FunctionName}/invocations"
      },
      "input":{"shape":"InvocationRequest"},
      "output":{"shape":"InvocationResponse"},
      "errors":[
        {"shape":"ServiceException"},
        {"shape":"ResourceNotFoundException"},
        {"shape":"InvalidRequestContentException"},
        {"shape":"RequestTooLargeException"},
        {"shape":"UnsupportedMediaTypeException"},
        {"shape":"TooManyRequestsException"},
        {"shape":"InvalidParameterValueException"},
        {"shape":"EC2UnexpectedException"},
        {"shape":"SubnetIPAddressLimitReachedException"},
        {"shape":"ENILimitReachedException"},
        {"shape":"EC2ThrottledException"},
        {"shape":"EC2AccessDeniedException"},
        {"shape":"InvalidSubnetIDException"},
        {"shape":"InvalidSecurityGroupIDException"},
        {"shape":"InvalidZipFileException"},
        {"shape":"KMSDisabledException"},
        {"shape":"KMSInvalidStateException"},
        {"shape":"KMSAccessDeniedException"},
        {"shape":"KMSNotFoundException"},
        {"shape":"InvalidRuntimeException"}
      ]
    }</code></pre><p>The above API is expecting an “InvocationRequest” object and returns a “InvocationResponse” object.</p><p>This is how the “InvocationRequest” is defined.</p><pre><code>"InvocationRequest":{
      "type":"structure",
      "required":["FunctionName"],
      "members":{
        "FunctionName":{
          "shape":"NamespacedFunctionName",
          "location":"uri",
          "locationName":"FunctionName"
        },
        "InvocationType":{
          "shape":"InvocationType",
          "location":"header",
          "locationName":"X-Amz-Invocation-Type"
        },
        "LogType":{
          "shape":"LogType",
          "location":"header",
          "locationName":"X-Amz-Log-Type"
        },
        "ClientContext":{
          "shape":"String",
          "location":"header",
          "locationName":"X-Amz-Client-Context"
        },
        "Payload":{"shape":"Blob"},
        "Qualifier":{
          "shape":"Qualifier",
          "location":"querystring",
          "locationName":"Qualifier"
        }
      },
      "payload":"Payload"
    }</code></pre><p>This is the response object.</p><pre><code> "InvocationResponse":{
      "type":"structure",
      "members":{
        "StatusCode":{
          "shape":"Integer",
          "location":"statusCode"
        },
        "FunctionError":{
          "shape":"String",
          "location":"header",
          "locationName":"X-Amz-Function-Error"
        },
        "LogResult":{
          "shape":"String",
          "location":"header",
          "locationName":"X-Amz-Log-Result"
        },
        "Payload":{"shape":"Blob"},
        "ExecutedVersion":{
          "shape":"Version",
          "location":"header",
          "locationName":"X-Amz-Executed-Version"
        }
      },
      "payload":"Payload"
    },</code></pre><p>The PHP SDK auto-generates code for each of these request and response object and here how the code would look:</p><pre><code>$result = $client-&gt;invoke(array(
    // FunctionName is required
    'FunctionName' =&gt; 'string',
    'InvocationType' =&gt; 'string',
    'LogType' =&gt; 'string',
    'ClientContext' =&gt; 'string',
    'Payload' =&gt; 'mixed type: string|resource|\Guzzle\Http\EntityBodyInterface',
    'Qualifier' =&gt; 'string',
));</code></pre><p>Even the docs are automatically generated from the model files.</p><p>So the various SDK team will not need to write any code “manually” at all for any of these service updates. The service teams,( in this case, AWS Lambda) just needs to make sure that the model file they are creating is error free. The SDK will be able to auto-generate any updates to existing clients as well as auto-generating code for new APIs and services.</p><p>The best part of the SDK team is that is is completely open-sources and is directly integrated into various AWS services.</p><p>API Gateway allows you to deploy Swagger (also knows as OpenAPI Standards) models and then use the APIs to directly generate SDKs with all the features that are already inbuilt into the AWS SDKs.</p><p>I hope this will prove helpful in designing your SDKs for your services. In any SDK the focus should be on creating a model file that is compliant with “OpenApi” standards. By having a standard model for APIs, it will get super easy and fast to launch various SDKs in various languages with very little development time.</p><div><div><div><p><a href="https://dailyjag.com/profile/admin/" rel="author"> <img alt="" src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/33563973b6f338002e574f30a3f94788?s=80&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g" srcset="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/33563973b6f338002e574f30a3f94788?s=160&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g 2x" height="80" width="80"> </a></p><div> <p><span>  </span> <span> <span>Member since</span> <time datetime="2019-02-25 10:02"> August 16, 2011 </time> </span></p></div></div><p><span>I am an android developer, hacker, web developer, professional blogger and a complete tech freak.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h3>February 2015</h3><p>I was working for a startup based in Jerusalem called Curiyo. Back then I had a nice routine: I wake up around 6 am, go to the gym with my buddy, come back to my room to take a shower, eat a bowl of salad and then leave for work. I get to work around 9 am, leave around 5 to meet friends, hang out, or do whatever activity I was planning for that evening.</p><p>In September of the same year, I went on my first trip abroad. I went with my best friend from high school on a 2-week trip to Italy. And as they say, I caught the travel bug. After that trip, all I could think about was planning the next ones and when I could fly again. And since then, I started traveling literally every month.</p><p>One day, I found a blog post about digital nomads and remote work. "This is it, this is what I want!", I said to myself, and the race began to figure out how I could make that happen. A couple of months later, I landed my first remote job with Toptal and signed up for a 3-month trip around southeast Asia (SEA). And in September 2016 -a year after my first trip- I was in Thailand working remotely, enjoying the beach, drinking fresh coconut water, and calling myself a digital nomad.</p><p>"Work hard, play harder": that is the digital nomad slogan. Each day’s schedule looked different from the day before, depending on what I felt like doing or what the group I’m with is planning. In other words, it’s impossible to have a fixed routine, you have to be flexible and dynamic. Otherwise, you will either have to choose between FOMO or doing a shitty job at your work so you don’t miss whatever fun others are having.</p><h3>February 2017</h3><p>After my 3-month trip to SEA, it was time to go back to Jerusalem to see my family and plan the next move. I wasn’t excited to go back, I grew up in Jerusalem and till that point, it’s where I spent all my life. It was so hard and boring after what I’ve experienced, I just came back after spending 3 months in heaven.</p><p>Suddenly there were no more beaches, no more parties, or random strangers to hang out with. There was a lot of free time thatI had no idea what to do with. All I was doing every day was leaving my parents’ house, go to the university campus where I spent five years getting my computer engineering degree, and work till it’s so hard to keep my eyes open.</p><p>I filled all the free time I had with work. I created an outsource web development company with a friend and worked 14h a day 7 days a week, I became a workaholic. I was hoping that by creating a successful business I will have the means to escape my city and move elsewhere to go back to the heavenly life I had for a short period.</p><p>After 3 months of long days and restless nights mishmash, I realized that wasn’t what I wanted. Of course, I still wanted to build my own business, but I didn’t like the path I was taking. And one day I found myself writing this:</p><p>I woke up late, as usual, tried to open my exhausted eyelids. I had skipped the usual question “What’s the plan for today?” and left my bed. It has been almost 3 months since the last time I answered that question, after the first week of going back to Jerusalem it was the same day repeating itself over and over again. Wake up, go to the university campus, meet the same people, and work for 12-14 hours.</p><p>Everything was the same that day except one thing, one thought. When suddenly I found myself shouting out loud to myself “Oh shit, I’m not happy, FUCK!” after a voice inside my head asked: “Are you happy?”. The answer was obviously no. I just realized I was on auto-pilot and forgot to ask myself such a trivial question. “If you are not happy, what is the point?” I kept asking myself for the rest of the day.</p><p>Work was just my way to escape reality and fill my free time. All that made me wonder: do I have to bury myself in work and live miserably now so that my future self can be happy?&nbsp;</p><p>Probably many of you will say “yes”, or maybe you will hesitate a bit before saying “no”. But that doesn’t change the fact that it is actually what we all do somehow. All of us work hard today hoping that tomorrow, next week, next month, or a year from now we will be happy, satisfied, and fulfilled.</p><p>This led me to another question that has changed everything: <strong>what is the point of chasing big dreams and goals if I'm not enjoying the way to get there?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I didn’t have a clear answer to this question so, in a way or another, my answer was <strong>procrastination</strong>. On one side, I wanted to build a business and create great things. On the other side, I didn’t want to work (hard) on anything as long as I don’t know how to be happy while doing it!</p><h3>June 2017</h3><p>After several months and hustling paperwork, I moved to Germany, and my digital nomad life was on again. Since then, I’ve spent the last 3+ years, traveling around the world, exploring, having fun, and creating memories. I was living the dream that many people dream of. A was living a life with no routine whatsoever, wake up whenever I want, work whenever I want, and tomorrow is always an unplanned adventure.</p><p>You can say everything was perfect, but still, the old dream was bugging me, I want to build and create a successful business, my own business. I never liked the idea of working for someone and trading my time for money. And between fun and procrastination, I was trying to build stuff and bootstrap ideas, but things were always falling between the cracks. With a lifestyle like that, it’s really hard to say no to the sunny beach outside and go work 10 hours on a side project. So as a result, procrastination became my new lifestyle.</p><h3>March 2020</h3><p>I left Mexico for a 2-week trip to San Francisco, I had a lot of traveling planned for this year. Things would have stayed on the same path as before for at least another couple of years if it wasn’t for COVID-19.<br></p><p>Two weeks into the pandemic, I found myself without work and without anything else to do. No travel, no friends around, nothing. This time, I didn’t only have a lot of free time, but all my time became free time. History got a chance to repeat itself, and I had a decision to make. Do I want to re-live 2017 all over again? Do I want to keep myself busy with side projects and endless work?&nbsp;<br></p><p>The feeling from 3 years ago was still fresh in my memory that I didn’t want to fall into that trap again. That was an opportunity I had to take advantage of. I was living alone with no distraction of any kind, It was a chance to rediscover myself and what I really want.</p><p>My goal was to bootstrap a business while having a work life balance. I didn’t want to spend 14 hours on my laptop and feel like it was sucking the life out of me. I believed it was possible to bootstrap without falling into the workaholism swamp.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eed2ff36d85f3277043492b/5f06d0eb03257a01af20a5e4_iZLNJNTTrlnhbqu6GYvnavIObyReSuyqU1-_DJxGfOeSpFmF8hzwy3AryXXXt0pxgt7dn0EkcqU2AAEDMG8i5AS7HAfEUP0GlsyIOdpqtN07TOSJopLFwNzxQ3HwUjMJw5YSN36s.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Earlier this year I was somewhere on the bottom left side. To shift toward the right I had to deal with my procrastination problem. Since nothing I’ve tried before worked for me, I decided to learn everything I can about the subject and challenge myself to write a book about it, this book! I’m trying to prove to myself (and others) that it’s possible to live in the middle, a place where you can be productive and happy.</p><p><strong>“A bird in the hand is worth t̶w̶o̶ ten in the bush”</strong></p><p>My best friend, who is running an online business with ~$300k ARR, is on the opposite side of the curve. He is the most dedicated hard working person I know, but he’s not happy. When I asked him about it, he said he doesn’t believe it’s possible to have that balance. For him, you can’t be productive (grow fast enough) and happy at the same time. His goal is to have a big stable business by age 40 so he can relax and enjoy life then.</p><p>I don’t want that, I don't want to build a business if my happiness is the price. I don't want to live on 30% happiness for the promise that my future self will be 100% in five or ten years. It's not only that 100% happiness is not realistic, but I also believe my future self will still be stuck on the same hamster wheel convincing himself that he needs another 5 years to get to the imaginary perfect happiness.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eed2ff36d85f3277043492b/5f06d0edf9a94c0bc0e6cd9f_Ngrb7PW6OqzpCoN3VZ8zAT8vHN_BKz_ZRkF_1Ze-89S6gTlwS6qyz89AWZIy-r5M6aleCzSf5xq-qp0OG1qkgdq14HcQdSlY1F6TkBny8CtjNETh2sdP4f0dgcuKCAnqFIVf3wiu.gif" alt=""></p></figure><p>Workaholism will blind you, you no longer see the big picture, you have no time to think and re-think, and you work for the sake of the work itself. And without a proper system and regular stops where you pause to double-check where you are heading, the wheel will just spin faster and faster until it eventually spits you out and throws you against the wall.</p><p>I know, sometimes you have something you are so excited about and it doesn’t feel like work. But pure excitement doesn’t last forever. Eventually, you will have to work on other boring and less exciting parts of your project. And once that initial excitement fades away, you either quit or close your eyes and hit the gas pedal to become a workaholic zombie.</p><p>However, life is not easy and you can’t always accomplish things while relaxing and taking it easy. Sometimes you have no other option but to push so hard, for days, weeks, or even months. The problem starts when you have no idea when you are going to lift your foot off the gas pedal to look around and see where you are going and check if you should make a turn and change directions.</p><p>So let’s glue all pieces together. A Procrastinator has this <strong>Instant Gratification Monkey (1)</strong> who wants immediate rewards, to have fun, and enjoy the moment without giving a shit about the future. A workaholic has a <strong>Panic Monster (2)</strong> who wants to work so hard and sacrifice everything today so you can be happy tomorrow.</p><p>The answer to the question: “How do you chase big dreams and without depriving yourself happiness?” is the same answer to the question: “Where could your instant gratification monkey meet your panic monster?” You need both.The monkey is as important as the monster, we’ll see that in the chapter “The Productive Procrastinator”. While in other chapters, we try to find that meeting point, as the sole purpose of this book is not to help you just be a productive person but a <strong>happy</strong> productive person.</p><p>1,2:&nbsp;originally presented in Tim Urban's <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html">blog post</a></p><p>‍<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eed2ff36d85f3277043492b/5ef900053c15adf3558a9fb8_1*Bx1xIfh3q-_hY0LzmbLePg.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>📕 This chapter is …</p></div></div>

                        <p><span><img title="WhatsApp" src="https://noticiaswebs.com/uploads/2020/07/1593875189-da9b5913-1e38-4d9c-bf6c-5a5758644d11.jpeg" alt="" width="375" height="210"></span></p>
<p><span>Una oferta tentadora, una llamada de un número desconocido o incluso un amigo muy cercano pidiéndole que pague un boleto. También puede ser un miembro de la familia que solicita un depósito bancario para ayudarlo en una situación difícil. Estas son algunas de las situaciones más comunes que implican piratear cuentas de WhatsApp. La popularidad de la aplicación de mensajería más utilizada en el mundo atrae la atención de hackers y estafadores. 'Ya no me siento seguro': la víctima del hacker de WhatsApp cuenta cómo la misteriosa llamada comenzó a atacar Cómo protegerse del error de WhatsApp que podría dejar el teléfono Android vulnerable a los piratas informáticos BBC News Brasil escuchó a expertos en ciberseguridad y oficiales de policía que trabajan en el área para comprender cómo se aplican algunas de las estafas más comunes a través de la aplicación en Brasil. Los expertos y WhatsApp en sí dieron consejos para evitarlos. 1) <strong>chip robado</strong> Uno de los golpes más difíciles de identificar por las víctimas es el del chip perdido. Esto se debe a que el estafador roba el número de teléfono de una persona, bloquea la línea original y se hace pasar por la víctima para extorsionar a sus contactos. Pero, ¿cómo se hace?</span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://noticiaswebs.com/uploads/2020/07/1593875319-38b3462b-c003-4be6-a5e3-43b2c4495503.jpeg" alt="" width="375" height="210"></span></p>
<p>Primero, el estafador compra un nuevo chip y llama al operador haciéndose pasar por el propietario del chip original. &nbsp;Dice que perdió su celular o que le robaron el dispositivo. &nbsp;Así que el interruptor reactiva el número antiguo en el nuevo chip. &nbsp;Esto le da al estafador acceso a los grupos y a la lista de contactos de la persona en WhatsApp.</p>
<p>Cuando se activa la nueva tarjeta SIM, la tarjeta SIM original se bloquea. &nbsp;Los criminales hacen esto sin tener que hackear ningún dispositivo y con poco riesgo.</p>
<p>Con el control de números, los malos contactan con amigos y familiares de la víctima para extorsionarlos. &nbsp;La mayoría de las veces, el soplón dice que necesita dinero urgentemente. &nbsp;Entre los argumentos, dicen que necesitan pagar el tratamiento médico o pagar las deudas, por ejemplo.</p>
<p>Como la foto y el número de teléfono son de una persona de confianza, muchos caen en esta estafa antes de que la víctima pueda identificarla y advertir a sus conocidos. &nbsp;A veces, el autor sigue extorsionando al dueño del chip para que le devuelva el número.</p>
<p>¿Cómo evitar esta estafa?</p>
<p>El experto en seguridad de datos de Mandic Cloud y director de innovación Bruno Almeida explica que la solución consiste en permitir una verificación en dos etapas (véase más abajo). &nbsp;Con esto, la persona que active un nuevo chip necesitará una segunda confirmación, por correo electrónico o SMS, si intenta acceder a la aplicación de mensajería.</p>
<p>El experto señala que esta estafa sólo es posible cuando los malos han tenido acceso a los datos personales de la víctima de alguna manera. &nbsp;Para evitar que esto suceda, indica precaución al pasar esta información en línea.</p>
<p>"Los empleados del transportista piden un conjunto de datos personales antes de activar un nuevo chip. &nbsp;Lo ideal sería que sólo se registraran en sitios conocidos para evitar que sus datos cayeran en manos equivocadas. &nbsp;Información como el nombre, la dirección, el número de teléfono y el CPF es suficiente para cometer varios fraudes", dijo.</p>
<p>Al mismo tiempo, el presidente de SaferNet Brasil, Thiago Tavares, dice que esta información puede ser obtenida de otras maneras por los criminales.</p>
<p>"Utilizan los datos filtrados que se encuentran en Internet. &nbsp;Hay varias bases de datos donde se puede encontrar el nombre, CPF y la fecha de nacimiento de millones de personas. &nbsp;El propio gobierno ya ha sido el objetivo de esto. &nbsp;Una fuga de datos del Departamento Estatal de Tráfico de Rio Grande do Norte (Detran) expuso la información personal de 92 millones de brasileños en octubre de 2019", dijo.</p>
<p>Tavares también dice que este golpe también puede ser facilitado por los empleados de las compañías telefónicas involucradas en el esquema criminal.</p>
<p>LíneaDirecta de imágenesImágenes de la Gente</p>
<p>Autenticación de dos factores</p>
<p>La autenticación de dos factores es una buena manera de mantener sus datos más protegidos. &nbsp;Es una capa extra de seguridad que asegura que las personas que intentan acceder a una cuenta online son quienes realmente dicen ser.</p>
<p>Está disponible no sólo en WhatsApp, sino en muchas otras aplicaciones.</p>
<p>En WhatsApp, la opción se llama "escaneo en dos pasos". &nbsp;Para acceder a ella, ve a la configuración de la aplicación, entra en la opción "cuenta" y luego en "escaneo en dos pasos", tanto en Android como en iOS.</p>
<p>La aplicación te pedirá que elijas una contraseña de seis dígitos, que se te pedirá de vez en cuando.</p>
<p>Para activarlo, primero debes introducir tu nombre de usuario. &nbsp;Entonces, en lugar de obtener acceso inmediato a la cuenta, es necesario proporcionar una segunda autenticación: una digital, un comando de voz, una contraseña o un código enviado por SMS a su teléfono.</p>
<p>"El presidente de SaferNet, Thiago Tavares, advierte que lo mejor es evitar el SMS como factor de autenticación porque hoy en día puede ser fácilmente hackeado. "El SMS es vulnerable a los ataques porque está en una capa de una red creada en los años 70. &nbsp;Hay varios tutoriales que enseñan cómo romper esta protección. &nbsp;Para él, la gente debería usar la protección extra como un hábito en todas las plataformas que la hacen disponible, como Gmail, Facebook, Instagram y Twitter.</p>
<p>2) Recarga ilimitada</p>
<p>Más común en los grupos públicos, este fraude ocurre cuando también se quiere sacar algún tipo de ventaja.</p>
<p>El fraude se produce cuando los estelionatários ofrecen un servicio de recarga de móviles ilimitado a un precio hasta diez veces inferior al del mercado. &nbsp;Algunas ofertas prometen planes telefónicos ilimitados durante un año por una cantidad fija. &nbsp;También hay estafadores que ofrecen servicios de IPTV - un programa capaz de liberar hasta 18.000 canales de televisión abiertos y cerrados de todo el mundo</p>

					<div><p><strong>Mark’s journey into online marketing&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p><span>Mark had been an internet marketer of 10 years. He was working with some local companies and helping them with SEO, paid advertising and email marketing. He had seen people launching various information products, softwares and plugins etc. on the Warrior Forum and making thousands of dollars in revenue. So, Mark decided to learn this part of internet marketing. He spent one year learning about the product launches and created various products which initially did not do well but after some time he started generating revenue.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>Need for a mentor</strong></p><p><span>Mark did not have any experience of product launches so he needed someone who could guide him about how to launch a product and introduce him to potential affiliates. The mentor introduced him to many affiliates who had big emails lists and also taught him how to create a sales funnel. With the help of a mentor, Mark managed to generate six figures in a week from one of his launches. After that launch, he became known in the launch space and since then each product he created over the course of seven years got better and better and he managed to pull off multiple 6-figure launches.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>First six-figure launch</strong></p><p><span>One day Mark was watching a video of Jeremy Schoemaker in which he was showing his referral marketing engine but it was not user friendly. Mark really liked the concept of referral marketing and decided to create a WordPress Plugin for it. He hired developers who had created a product Popup Domination and they created a plugin for Mark. Mark launched the product twice. At first, it was without any upsell through which he generated six-figures and over the course of one and a half year he launched again with an upsell and managed to generate 7-figures while getting around 3000 users.</span></p><p><strong>Mark’s most successful launch</strong></p><p><span>Mark created another product called EasyVSL which creates sales videos for its users. This product targeted a specific niche and it did not have many competitors which contributed to its success. Mark designed an offer which had three upsells and he also did a high ticket webinar after seven days of launching which generated a couple of hundred thousand dollars in revenue. At the end of the launch, Mark generated 7-figures in revenue and got 30,000 new users.&nbsp;</span></p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>I like to keep my devices for a long time — as long as possible, actually. I do not need (nor want) a new iPhone and MacBook every year, or even every other year. (Or more!) Putting Apple’s issues aside, the company is quite good at keeping old hardware running the latest software, and generally their hardware is very high quality (except for <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2018/06/23/apple-launches-keyboard-repair-program-for-macbook-and-macbook-pro/">the utter</a> <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2019/11/07/limits-to-apples-butterfly-keyboard-repair-program/">clusterfuck</a> that was <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/02/10/waititi-keyboards">“keyboard gate”</a>). I find it pretty easy to keep devices for 4-6 years, if they are taken care of.</p>

<!--excerpt-->

<p>Until a couple of weeks ago, I was using a 2014 13” MacBook Pro (with MagSafe, not USB-C). This was my only machine, for work and everything else. I decided to finally upgrade that 6-year-old machine with the latest model, which was <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/05/apple-updates-13-inch-macbook-pro-with-magic-keyboard-double-the-storage-and-faster-performance/">recently updated</a>. As I said, I like to keep hardware as long as possible in general. But in this case, there were a few other important reasons why I waited until now, as opposed to, say, upgrading a 5-year-old machine last year.</p>

<ol>
  <li>I was absolutely not going to buy one of those <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2019/11/01/tylenol-moment-for-apples-laptop-keyboards/">shitty</a> <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2019/11/08/falling-back-to-an-older-mbp/">keyboards</a>. (I had used them on company-owned work machines.)</li>
  <li>The 13” models remained maxed out at 16GB of RAM for a long time. My 2014 machine had 16GB of RAM, so it just didn’t feel worth it to upgrade — even if the RAM was faster, along with other spec improvements.</li>
  <li>I hated the Touch Bar and I was hoping for a model to be released without it.</li>
</ol>

<p>With the exception of the Touch Bar (which has massively improved with a physical <code>esc</code> key and separate Touch ID button), these issues have finally been addressed. The shitty keyboards are gone and the 13” models can have up to 32GB of RAM. This is my first personal MacBook with a Touch Bar and I still hate it as much as I did on my old work laptops. The keyboard, however, is delightful.</p>

<h4>* * *</h4>

<p>If you also miss and prefer the old function keys, consider this configuration for your Touch Bar.</p>

<div>
    
    <div>
        <figure>
            <img src="https://www.jessesquires.com/img/touchbar-screenshot.png" title="Touch Bar" alt="Touch Bar">
            <div>
                <div>
                
                    <figcaption>
                        <p><small>
                            My Touch Bar configuration 
                        </small></p>
                    </figcaption>
                
                </div>
            </div>
        </figure>
    </div>
    
</div>

<p>From left to right, the Touch Bar includes: a space, screen brightness buttons, keyboard brightness buttons, music controls, mute and volume buttons, a space, screen lock button. I also have this set to be static (or “Touch Bar shows: expanded control strip”), so it never changes to include app-specific buttons. You can configure these settings in System Preferences &gt; Keyboard.</p>

<p>Pro tip: you can take a screenshot of the Touch Bar with <code>cmd-shift-6</code>.</p>

<p>There are a few things to point out about this setup. First, the initial spacer in the Touch Bar is great for preventing accidental touches when reaching for the physical <code>esc</code> key. The other controls are almost identical to the old physical keyboard function keys (which I like), but without the “Mission Control” and “Launchpad” keys, which I think are actions better invoked via track pad gestures. Finally, I decided to add a screen lock button on the right end of the Touch Bar because it felt too empty otherwise, and the spacer to its left helps prevent accidental touches. Of all the options, screen lock felt the most useful, and it has been. It is actually very convenient to be able to lock your screen as quickly as you can unlock it with Touch ID.</p>

<p>This setup certainly makes me like the Touch Bar more, but I would still rather it be gone. As for the rest of this machine, it is a huge improvement over what I had and I do not have any complaints about it. It is incredibly fast and I love the new design. I hope I can keep this machine for as long as my others.</p>

                    <p>Once you start working with international clients you'll run into many issues you will never experience when contracting for clients in the same country.</p><p>Language barriers, time zone differences or different cultures which could lead to different styles of communicating or different expectations to name just a few. </p><p>But the biggest one might be accepting payments. Cross-border payments are usually costly (both in fees and unfavorable exchange rates), take a long time to be processed and are sometimes even just hard to make as it's not a very common use case for most business owners. There's also different laws, taxes and payment methods.</p><p>The pandemic has made remote work a lot more common and many freelancers now have to deal with this new set of problems.</p><p>I have been working remotely since 2016 and worked for clients all over the world, used dozens of payment methods and dealt with both major and smaller currencies and want to share what I've learned over this period in terms of accepting payments.</p><p>Before we start, it's important to know there's no single best option as each situation is different. Payment frequency, invoice size, where each party is incorporated and many other variables might play a role in which payment method is best for your situation.</p><p>That being said, in every situation we want the same things. Make it easy for the client to pay you, make it easy for yourself to receive the money and do both of these in a timely and inexpensive way.</p><h2 id="international-bank-transfers">International Bank Transfers</h2><p>By far the most common payment method for domestic payments is to use a wire transfer. This works well for domestic payments but is very expensive and slow for cross-border payments.</p><p>Most banks charge a flat fee for processing international transfers but will also convert the money from the client's currency to yours at an exchange rate that is more expensive for you than the actual current exchange rate. My post about <a href="https://blog.jurn.io/international-payments-freelancers/">international transfers</a> explains the hidden costs of these payments more in-depth.</p><p>So before you ask your clients to transfer the money to your account, check with your bank what fees and exchange rates they use for the transfer. Some banks also give you the option to open a foreign currency account, if you regularly take payments in the same currency this could save you a lot in currency exchange fees.</p><h3 id="transferwise">TransferWise</h3><p>One of the best alternatives I found is to use <a href="https://transferwise.com/invite/u/joernv2">TransferWise</a>. TransferWise allows you to hold and accept multiple currencies and have local bank details in many different countries. You can then transfer the money you received at the mid-market exchange rate into your own currency and pay it out to your own bank account with low fixed fees.</p><p>Your client can thus transfer the payment to a local bank account like they would normally do for domestic payments. You can exchange this at a much better rate than banks would offer you and withdraw it to your own bank account for a low and transparent fixed fee.</p><p>This method offers the advantages of bank transfers without the downsides and has in my experience been both the cheapest and best way to accept payments for most situations.</p><p>If you are your client are in a country that is not supported by TransferWise you can also use <a href="https://www.payoneer.com/">Payoneer</a> which works in a very similar way and supports more countries around the world, albeit with higher fees than TW offers.</p><h2 id="credit-cards">Credit Cards</h2><p>Another very common payment method and one that is incredibly easy to pay with for your clients, credit cards.</p><p>Using online payment processors like Stripe, you can easily create an invoice along with a payment link where you client can pay using their credit card. The fees are pretty high, 3.4%+$0.50 per successful card charge and an additional 2% fee is applied if currency conversion is required so you have to be willing to accept high fees for speed and convenience.</p><p>Accepting credit cards is usually only worth it if you sent lots of small invoices and want a convenient way for you clients to pay these. </p><h2 id="paypal">PayPal</h2><p>PayPal was one of the pioneers in the payments industry but I'd strongly recommend using another option whenever possible. </p><p>Accepting payments via PayPal is easy. You can quickly generate a payment link for the client to sent with your invoice and you can easily create a PayPal account, no matter what country you are located in.</p><p>Unfortunately, their fees are very high (both the fixed fees and the currency conversion cost) and they are known for arbitrarily holding funds without good reason. Which they are allowed to do under their own ToC for up to 6 months(!).</p><p>If some of the better payment methods aren't available to you, PayPal might be the best option you have available but for most people it's probably better to steer clear of them. Even banks usually offer a better exchange rate than PayPal does.</p><h2 id="checks">Checks</h2><p>Most people outside of the US probably have never used a check to receive or make a payment so this could be quite a shock when your US client offers you to pay you using one.</p><p>My advice is to avoid these at all costs and talk to your client about setting up an alternative payment method. </p><p>Most non-US banks do not even have the option to cash these out and if they do it's very expensive. Checks, especially international ones, take a long time to arrive after they are mailed to you, they might get lost in the mail or sent to the wrong address, you (likely) need to mail these to your bank once you receive the check to cash it out and you still have to pay the unfavorable exchange rate.</p><p>In my personal experience, it will take around 4-6 weeks in total before the money from the client arrives in your account and you'll pay a very high fee for it.</p><p>Luckily these are becoming less common and I've head the good fortune of not having to deal with one of these for 2 years already.</p><h2 id="escrow">Escrow</h2><p>Escrow transfers are usually only worth it for selling big-ticket items where you need to transfer digital assets such as a domain. The fees are very high but it removes a lot of the risk when you work with a client that you haven't built up any trust with. </p><p>You should view Escrow as taking out an insurance, you accept a higher fee for less risk.</p><h2 id="cryptocurrency">Cryptocurrency</h2><p>Last time I wrote an article about cross-border payments <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22854120">some people commented</a> that crypto was the obvious solution here as there is no currency conversion and the transfer fees are very low. </p><p>I'd figure it's best to address this head-on this time; Although I love the concept of cryptocurrency, it's just not practical to use it for most freelancers. </p><p>Unless you work for a very high-tech startup, it's extremely unlikely someone in the company knows how to use one of these cryptocurrencies or will get permission to buy crypto and transfer it.</p><p>They are also extremely volatile, even though the transfer fees or currency exchange fees of conventional payment methods will cost you more, I have also never lost 10% of my company's liquid assets in a few minutes.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>As remote freelancers we are spoiled for choice nowadays and we have many different options to use depending on what situation we find ourselves in.</p><p>I have used every single option I discussed in the article and they all have their own pros and cons. There is no "one size fits all" solution here and you'll need to do some research to see what works best for the type of business that you run.</p><p>I've found that for my situation I most often end up using TransferWise to accept payment, convert the currency and deposit it to the bank account where my company is incorporated. </p><p>Whether this works best for you is something you will need to research for yourself based on your company and location.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <p>Even co-located meetings can be a little messy and unorganized, but with remote workers and online clients involved, things can get out of hand quickly. It's a little harder to keep folks interested in front of their screens, and other than with most co-located meetings, there's often no natural end to them (like a coffee break, for example).</p>
<p>Plus, depending on your setup your remote employees might join from other timezones, where it's late at night or early in the morning. They might join in-between things, might for example plan to head out to dinner after the meeting. Things need to start and end on time.</p>
<p>Things get even more complicated once you have a mix of folks in the office and online. People can get overheard, internet latency favours folks in the office and it's hard to get a word in. Time to review meeting etiquette.</p>
<h2>When and how to schedule a remote meeting</h2>
<p>Timezones are a tricky thing. Once you have a few locations and timezones in a group together, you should probably use a <a href="https://nohq.co/tools/category/scheduling/">scheduling tool</a>, rather than trying to go back-and-forth with everyone. Folks in the space are even working on <a href="https://nohq.co/blog/xai-putting-scheduling-on-autopilot/">automatic scheduling bots</a> that review calendar availabilities, locations, timezones, working times and preferences of each participant. It might save you a ton of time.</p>
<p>Big meetings are a no-go in a remote setting. It's hard enough to get 2 or 3 timezones on the same page, once you start mixing in more timezones and schedules, it gets virtually impossible for everyone to join. One strategy is to keep things small, do important team meetings with a maximum of 6-8 people. Another strategy is to keep meetings as a way to exchange, discuss and create face-to-face time, but keeping it optional and announce major changes and action points over an async medium after the fact.</p>
<p>Finally, respect people's working times. Having recurring meetings during late nights or early mornings leads to unhappiness and a lack of work-life balance, which you would want to prevent.</p>
<h2>Preparing an agenda for a remote videoconference</h2>
<p>A meeting shouldn't start without a detailed agenda. <a href="https://nohq.co/blog/sid-sijbrandij-people-dont-want-to-commute-they-ju/">GitLab CEO Sid Sijbradij</a> recommends to shut down any meeting that doesn't have an agenda attached beforehand.</p>
<p>The benefit of a timed agenda is that folks can add their bullet points to the list before the meeting, and you might even be able to resolve certain points in an async manner before the meeting even starts. You can create the agenda on a medium where folks can contribute in real-time, such as <a href="https://nohq.co/tools/google-drive/">Google Docs</a> or <a href="https://nohq.co/tools/todoist/">Todoist</a>, to get the full benefit of that system.</p>
<p>Agendas work best when they are time scheduled. It helps to wrap up certain discussions at their given time and keep things on track. It also helps participants estimate the duration of a meeting – seeing for how long and how actively they are bound to the screen.</p>
<p>Without an agenda, you risk a meeting going off the rails and that employees will have to leave the meeting before the end, losing their insights and inputs.</p>
<h2>Establishing remote meeting etiquette</h2>
<p>Meeting etiquette is a set of ground rules that folks should follow during your meeting. For example, you can try and get everyone to join with their camera on. It makes the rare face-to-face time 100x more effective and is a great way to convey emotions when folks aren't in the same room. A must-do is to make sure that the standard is that people are muted – you don't want to have multiple distracting sounds during your meeting.</p>
<p>Secondly, it's recommended that people join with their own devices, rather than joining all together from a big meeting room if people are in the same place. Naturally, people in the same room will talk over folks that are joining online and will be able to leverage their added influence to get their point across better. It also leads to unrelated chatter and issues with understanding, that wouldn't be the case when doing a fully remote meeting. Everyone joining from their device, despite sitting near each other, can feel odd but is going to deliver the best results.</p>
<p>Keep your sentences short, and provide time for interjections or questions between sentences. There is nothing more infuriating than not being able to bring an argument across, especially with a few milliseconds of lag. Be clear in your words, don't mumble and prioritize directed requests over undirected requests (say: Hey Jen, what's the status on the next release, not: Hey guys, ....).</p>
<h2>Writing a follow-up to a remote meeting</h2>
<p>A meeting in the remote work is never fully concluded when the call ends. You might have had people drop connections at some point, might have been unclear in your pronunciation and people might not have been able to participate for any or some of the meeting.</p>
<p>After a call has concluded, it's a good manner to provide the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A recording of the meeting (especially if there was a lot of information)</li>
<li>A written summarization of discussion points and outcomes</li>
<li>A list of decisions and actions to act on</li>
</ul>
<p>Writing a summary is a tedious task. If you had a written agenda beforehand, that makes things easier and allows you to fill in the gaps during the meeting. It's also good practice for folks to add notes to the agenda if they plan to ask questions so that you can recall the flow of the meeting better.</p>

<p>The first thing I was trying to access Macro. By default it was disabled, to enable it go to Files &gt; Options &gt; Trust Center &gt; Macro Settings &gt; Select <strong>Enable all macros</strong>&nbsp;and select checkbox&nbsp;<strong>Trust access to the VBA project object mode</strong></p>

<p>Post enabling macro, I navigate to <strong>View</strong> &gt; <strong>Macros</strong> &gt; <strong>View Macros&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>There are macros in document.</p>

<p>To make it viewable, I downloaded tool <a href="https://github.com/outflanknl/EvilClippy/releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EvilClippy</a>. This tool create new copy of word document in same directory as your current document.</p>

<p>Now when I open document which is project viewable and open VBA Development tool by pressing F11 and tried to open macro code, I was getting Project Password prompt.</p>

<p>To remove/bypass this password, there is a VBA code, <a href="https://gist.github.com/ndthanh/65483efab3939ab3c78f0773af40333f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Git hub link</a></p>



<p>I am going to create a new module and paste this code there and run the macro <strong>unprotected</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>This is the second article in The JavaScript Snippet Series. In the  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://blog.everistus.xyz/three-methods-to-get-unique-values-from-arrays-in-es6-ck8dypcjd01a8xjs13gde9xmc">previous episode</a> we discussed three methods of getting unique values from JavaScript. In this article, we will discuss various ways of sorting arrays in JavaScript.</p>
<p>Sorting is a common task when working with arrays. It would be used, for instance, if you want to display the city or county names in alphabetical order.</p>
<p>The JavaScript Array object has a built-in method sort() for sorting array elements in alphabetical order. Okay, let's get a move on.</p>
<p>First of all, let us instantiate the variables will be sorted in this article.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> arrCharacters = [<span>"mary"</span>, <span>"had"</span>, <span>"a"</span>, <span>"little"</span>, <span>"lamb"</span>];
<span>const</span> arrInteger = [
  <span>1</span>,
  <span>2</span>,
  <span>3</span>,
  <span>4</span>,
  <span>5</span>,
  <span>6</span>,
  <span>100</span>,
  <span>10</span>,
  <span>200</span>,
  <span>1</span>,
  <span>11</span>,
  <span>30</span>,
  <span>1000</span>,
  <span>500</span>,
  <span>700</span>,
  <span>900</span>,
];
<span>const</span> arrObject = [
  { name: <span>"asemota"</span> },
  { name: <span>"unicodeveloper"</span> },
  { name: <span>"hacksultan"</span> },
  { name: <span>"developerayo"</span> },
  { name: <span>"wellpaiddeveloper"</span> },
  { name: <span>"sarah_edo"</span> },
  { name: <span>"techgirl1908"</span> },
];
</code></pre>
<p>The first variable <code>arrCharacters</code> is an array of strings, second variable <code>arrCharacters</code> is an array of numbers and the third variable <code>arrObject</code> is an array of objects with key-value pairs.</p>
<p>Now let's move on the sorting these variables. </p>
<h2 id="sorting-arrays-of-strings">Sorting arrays of strings</h2>
<p>We will start with the array of strings. Sorting arrays of strings in JavaScript is pretty straight-forward. All you need to do is call the builtin <code>sort</code> method on the array.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> sortChar = (arr) =&gt; {
  <span>return</span> arr.sort();
};

<span>const</span> result = sortChar(arrCharacters);

<span>console</span>.log(result);
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1594277109764/2yQRCo2sp.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="sort1.png"></p>
<p>As you can see in the image above, this simply sorts the array in ascending order with no fuss and no moss.</p>
<h2 id="sorting-arrays-of-numbers">Sorting arrays of numbers</h2>
<p>Sorting an array of numbers is not as straight forward as sorting an array of strings unfortunately although come to think of it, the extra steps you need to perform are not that difficult. </p>
<p>Let us see what happens when we sort an array of integers like we sort the array of strings above.</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> sortIntegerwrong = (arr) =&gt; {
  <span>return</span> arr.sort();
};
<span>const</span> result = sortIntegerwrong(arrInteger);

<span>console</span>.log(result);
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1594277611395/9TMsfy-r4.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="sort2.png"></p>
<p>As you can see, the result is different from what we've expected. It happens because the sort() method sorts the numeric array elements by converting them to strings (i.e. 30 becomes "30", 100 becomes "100", and so on), and since the first character of the string "30" (i.e. "3") comes after the first character of the string "100" (i.e. "1"), that's why the value 20 is sorted after the 100.</p>
<p>To fix this sorting problem with a numeric array, you can pass a compare callback, like this:</p>
<pre><code>
<span>const</span> sortInteger = (arr) =&gt; {
  <span>return</span> arr.sort((a, b) =&gt; {
    <span>if</span> (a &gt; b) {
      <span>return</span> <span>1</span>;
    } <span>else</span> <span>if</span> (b &gt; a) {
      <span>return</span> <span>-1</span>;
    } <span>else</span> {
      <span>return</span> <span>0</span>;
    }
  });
};
<span>const</span> result = sortInteger(arrInteger);

<span>console</span>.log(result);
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1594277846436/le9zqOGfp.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="sort3.png"></p>
<p>Now we finally have a well-sorted array. Let's see how it works.</p>
<p>When a callback function is specified, array elements are sorted according to the return value of the callback function. For example, when comparing a and b:</p>
<p>If the callback function returns a value less than 0, then a comes first.
If the callback function returns a value greater than 0, then b comes first.
If the callback function returns 0, a and b remain unchanged with respect to each other but sorted with respect to all other elements.</p>
<p>There are various ways to implement the callback function in JavaScript as demonstrated below:</p>
<pre><code>
<span>const</span> sortIntegerOptionA = (arr) =&gt; {
  arr.sort((a, b) =&gt; {
    <span>return</span> a - b;
  });
};

<span>const</span> result = sortIntegerOptionA(arrInteger);

<span>console</span>.log(result);
</code></pre>
<pre><code>
<span>const</span> sortIntegerOptionB = (arr) =&gt; {
  <span>return</span> arr.sort((a, b) =&gt; {
    <span>return</span> a &gt; b ? <span>1</span> : b &gt; a ? <span>-1</span> : <span>0</span>;
  });
};

<span>const</span> result = sortIntegerOptionB(arrInteger);

<span>console</span>.log(result);
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1594277846436/le9zqOGfp.png" alt="sort3.png">
They all produce the same result as above.</p>
<h2 id="sort-an-array-of-objects">Sort an array of objects</h2>
<p>An array of objects in JavaScript contains objects of key-value pairs. Sorting these arrays requires the use of a callback method with the built-in sort method. However, you would need to access specific keys to be able to properly sort the arrays based on the values in the object.</p>
<pre><code>
<span>const</span> sortArrObject = (arr) =&gt; {
  <span>return</span> arr.sort((a, b) =&gt; {
    <span>return</span> a.name &gt; b.name ? <span>1</span> : b.name &gt; a.name ? <span>-1</span> : <span>0</span>;
  });
};

<span>const</span> result = sortArrObject(arrObject);

<span>console</span>.log(result);
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1594279862649/9kD09Fokl.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="sort4.png"></p>
<p>What we did here was to use the callback function to check if the value of the name key of each object is greater, less, or equal to the subsequent object. The same logic we used when sorting integers also applies here. The difference is that we have to access the values of the object by the corresponding key.</p>
<p>In this article, we have examined some ways to sort arrays in JavaScript. We will be discussing in details <code>Array.prototype.reduce()</code> in the next episode of the JavaScript Snippet Series. Hope to see you back here soon.</p>

Consider, there is a session going on about “Everything about Demographics”; the presenter asked a question to the audience that “In which continent do you live?” Now, the people will raise hands based on the name mentioned by the presenter one-by-one. A person will not be able to know how many people in the audience belong to continent Asia. The Questionnaire will show the answers in real-time on the presenter screen. It helps to make the session more engaging.</p><p>In the Questionnaire, there are two screens - Presenter and Participant. The Presenter screen is where the presenter is showing the slides, and the presenter will show the question there. And, it can be answered from the Participant screen. The audience can access the Participant Screen from their smartphones, basically in a Browser.</p><p>The backend of the Questionnaire is in Rust. It exposes web services. The frontend - a React application consumes those services.</p><h2 id="where-websocket-comes-into-the-picture">Where WebSocket comes into the picture</h2><p>I needed a mechanism so that:</p><ol><li>The audience sees the options of the same question that the presenter has asked - they are in sync</li><li>Show answers real-time on the presenter screen (this feature is still in progress)</li></ol><p>Please note that I will be using the “presenter + audience sync” feature to demonstrate the implementation of WebSocket in this article.</p><h2 id="implementing-the-websocket">Implementing the WebSocket</h2><p>The application uses <a href="https://crates.io/crates/actix-web"><code>actix-web</code></a> for the WebServices.

<p>“Come back to Recurse Center!” they told me. “You’ll get to write all sorts of cool code!” they said. Well I just spent two weeks writing exactly zero lines of code. It’s a great feeling, seeing everyone around you create beautiful 3D graphical masterpieces or fully complete web applications while you spend twelve hours a day struggling to read technical papers that you don’t even understand. This is what happens when you attempt to do things with CRDTs.</p>
<p>CRDT stands for “conflict-free replicated data type”. Do not ask me why they aren’t called CFRDTs, that is just yet another ineffable mystery that you can add to the pile. A CRDT is kinda like a normal data structure, like a string or a map. However, unlike normal strings and maps, a CRDT is designed to be shared between multiple computers in a mesh network. Any computer can make changes to the CRDT locally, and the concurrent changes from multiple computers will be seamlessly merged together. This property makes CRDTs useful for building Google Docs-style collaborative editors! It also makes a simple-sounding operation like “insert character in string” require a ten page technical document to describe correctly! Alexei Baboulevitch’s <a href="http://archagon.net/blog/2018/03/24/data-laced-with-history/">fantastic blog post</a> on collaborative document editing is <em>20 thousand words long</em>. Four of these blog posts would be longer than the first Harry Potter novel. I hope he wrote the blog post using his own collaborative editor, since it would prove its performance for editing immense documents.</p>
<p>Anyway, the operation that have been attempting to implement is string splicing. If I have a string <code>foobar</code>, and I cut the <code>foo</code> out and paste it at the end, I get <code>barfoo</code>. That’s a splice. If there was only one user, this would be equivalent to just deleting the characters <code>foo</code> and reinserting them at a new location. However — since there are multiple users of this program, we’d like any concurrent changes inside of <code>foo</code> to be copied over to the new location as well. For instance, if I move <code>foo</code> to the end and you simultaneously replace <code>oo</code> with <code>aa</code>, we’d expect the result to be <code>barfaa</code>. All CRDTs that I’ve seen so far would instead merge those two edits into <code>aabarfoo</code>.</p>
<p>I don’t actually have a working splice operation yet, but these are my rough, in-progress notes on the problem and my thoughts so far.</p>
<h2>Splicing is important for structured hypertext</h2>
<p>Considering the difficulty of implementing a new CRDT operation, you’re probably thinking: do we really need a splice? If we already have insertion and deletion operations for sequences, that gets us most of the way, right? In fact, there’s even a CRDT that allows a single node of a tree — so a character or a struct — to be moved to another place in the tree. So why bother adding splice?</p>
<p>Let’s look at todo lists. Everybody likes todo lists, right? It seems like every CRDT and UI framework under the sun implements one, so let’s try to implement our own. Here’s one from Dropbox Paper:</p>
<p><img src="https://lord.io/images/2019/splicing_1.png" srcset="https://lord.io/images/2019/splicing_1.png 2x" alt="A todo list with two items, the cursor positioned halfway through the first item"></p>
<p>The CRDT schema I often see for this list looks somewhat like:</p>
<div><pre><code>[
    {checked: false, contents: "Hello World"},
    {checked: false, contents: "This is a todo item"},
]
</code></pre></div>
<p>Assuming the contents strings in this schema are actually a CRDT sequence of characters, this should work great, right? Well looking back at the example above, what happens when we press return? In many text editors, we get an image that looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://lord.io/images/2019/splicing_2.png" srcset="https://lord.io/images/2019/splicing_2.png 2x" alt="The same todo list as before, but the user has pressed return, splitting the first item in half to create a third item."></p>
<p>If you’ve read the CRDT literature, you may recognize that this presents a problem for how we’ve set up our schema. We can individually delete the characters in <code>World</code> and put them in our newly created item, but if another user concurrently inserted <code>!</code> after <code>World</code>, the <code>!</code> would remain in the first item instead of correctly moving to the second.</p>
<p>One solution to this is to treat the entire document as a single sequence of characters and objects. For instance, our initial schema for this list could instead look like</p>
<div><pre><code>"{inline object checkbox}Hello World\n{inline object checkbox}This is a todo item"
</code></pre></div>
<p>This certainly solves the return-problem, since we can just insert <code>\n{inline object checkbox}</code> when the user presses return. Our second user’s <code>!</code> will get inserted in the correct place. Problem solved? Well, we now have another issue. What do we do when users reorder items?</p>
<p><img src="https://lord.io/images/2019/splicing_3.png" srcset="https://lord.io/images/2019/splicing_3.png 2x" alt="The user is now dragging the second todo item to a different spot in the list"></p>
<p>As far as I can tell, the single continuous sequence is ~roughly what Dropbox Paper does (although I believe they use operational transform instead of CRDTs), since they tend to have sync errors when todo items are concurrently edited and moved around. In the above example, if one user inserts <code>!</code> at the end of <code>World</code> and another user moves <code>World</code> to a different spot in the list, there will be nothing associating the <code>!</code> with the <code>World</code>. In Dropbox Paper, this is what you get:</p>
<p><img src="https://lord.io/images/2019/splicing_4.png" srcset="https://lord.io/images/2019/splicing_4.png 2x" alt="Two todo items. In between them is a bare paragraph reading &quot;!this is a todo item&quot;"></p>
<p>I never deleted any checkboxes, but by some gimmick of the synchronization, one of our checkboxes has disappeared. If your list allows both splitting a text object in half and reordering objects, neither of these two solutions will work well. However, if we had a <em>splice</em> operation that moved both existing characters as well as <em>future inserts</em> within the range, suddenly both work! In the continuous sequence case, we can splice todo items from one part of the list to another. And in the structured case, we can splice the second half of one todo item into the string for a newly created todo item.</p>
<p>Splicing CRDTs could also be effectively used to better merge cut/paste operations with concurrent edits, and to track the original author of any particular character.</p>
<h2>Prior art</h2>
<p>Although I haven’t found any prior art that implements a splicing operation, there <em>are</em> multiple examples of trees that allow moving nodes around, which is at least a first step. We’ll look at two examples here.</p>
<p>Several months after Data Laced with History was written, in May 2018, some Cambridge researchers published a new CRDT called an <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.04263">OpSet</a>. This is the first CRDT that allows for node movement, where a single character or item in the tree can be moved to another spot in the tree. This isn’t quite the splice function we’re looking for, but it’s a great starting point. Let’s look at their implementation. The authors identify two major issues with moving a node:</p>
<ol>
<li>We must ensure the resulting structure is a tree, so we have to prevent cycles.</li>
<li>A node moved twice should not be duplicated in two locations.</li>
</ol>
<p>The OpSet CRDT takes a very different approach to concurrency than Causal Trees. Rather than use an add-only tree of operations, OpSet keeps its operations as a list, ordered by logical timestamp. To get the current state of the system, the client takes an initial state and applies each operation to the state one by one. This operation list <em>isn’t</em> append only — an edit coming in from another client will often have a timestamp prior to the most recent local one. In this case, the client state must be “rewound” back to that point in the operation list, the new operation must be added and applied, and then subsequent operations must be replayed to get the final current state of the document.</p>
<p>This does seem somewhat slower than Causal Trees, but allows us to support more complex editing operations. Persistent data structures also makes this rewinding faster than you might think.</p>
<p>OpSet defines an <code>Assign</code> operation to move nodes, which takes a number of arguments:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>id</code>: the node ID of a parent map or list</li>
<li><code>obj</code>: the ID of the node being moved</li>
<li><code>key</code>: for maps, this is the map key, some literal value; for lists, this is the ID of the node immediately prior to the insertion point, or in the case where the insert is at the beginning of the list, the node ID of the list itself repeated</li>
<li><code>val</code>: the IDs of the previous values assigned to that key, which are deleted</li>
</ul>
<p>So how does this prevent our two issues?</p>
<ol>
<li>To prevent cycles, any time the Assign operation would create a cycle, it instead becomes a no-op. This isn’t a commutative operation, but it works because OpSets linearizes the operations, so they don’t need to commute with each other. If we were using a Causal Tree, our operations would be applied in arbitrary order, and we wouldn’t be able to do this.</li>
<li>To prevent duplication, any time the Assign operation moves a node twice, the last Assign operation wins.</li>
</ol>
<p>My friend Kyle also sent me a <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/how-figmas-multiplayer-technology-works/#the-details-of-figma-s-multiplayer-system">recent blog post from Figma</a> that explains how their CRDTs resolve the cycle problem. Figma also linearizes edits according to timestamps, but their approach has a central server that determines the timestamp of each operation. They also use this central server to resolve cycles:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Figma’s solution is to temporarily parent these objects to each other and remove them from the tree until the server rejects the client’s change and the object is reparented where it belongs. This solution isn’t great because the object temporarily disappears, but it’s a simple solution to a very rare temporary problem so we didn’t feel the need to try something more complicated here such as breaking these temporary cycles on the client.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve been exploring more down the SpliceOp path, since I’d optimally like the resulting CRDTs to work in the absence of a central server, but it’s perhaps an approach worth looking into, especially considering how many people use Figma’s CRDTs every day. They also have some interesting notes on undo/redo, a topic I still have to research further.</p>
<h2>Splicing is harder than node reparenting</h2>
<p>Splicing presumably would be a valid operation on a JSON array as well as a string. This means all the node reparenting issues are issues for splicing as well: we have to prevent duplication and prevent cycles of parents. There are also some unique issues with splicing:</p>
<ul>
<li>How are the ends of the splice operation specified? by character ID?</li>
<li>How are concurrent edits in that range moved to the new location?</li>

    <p>Open source maintainers donâ€™t often spend time thinking about their projectâ€™s
trademarks, and with good reason: between code contribution, documentation,
crafting the technical direction, and creating a healthy contributor community,
thereâ€™s plenty to do without spending time considering how your projectâ€™s name
or logo will be used. But trademarks – whether a name, logo, or badge – are an
extension of a projectâ€™s decision to be open source. Just as your projectâ€™s open
source license demonstrates that your codebase is for free and fair use, an open
source project trademark policy in keeping with the <a href="https://opensource.org/osd">Open Source
Definition</a> gives everyone – upstream contributors
and downstream consumers – comfort that they are using your projectâ€™s marks in
a fair and accurate way.</p>
<p>We created the Open Usage Commons because free and fair open source trademark
use is critical to the long-term sustainability of open source. However,
understanding and managing trademarks takes more legal know-how than most
project maintainers can do themselves. The Open Usage Commons is therefore
dedicated to creating a model where everyone in the open source chain – from
project maintainers to downstream users to ecosystem companies – has peace of
mind around trademark usage and management. The projects in the Open Usage
Commons will receive support specific to trademark protection and management,
usage guidelines, and conformance testing.</p>
<p>The Open Usage Commons will also provide the community with education regarding
trademarks. Many people may not realize that the permission to use the projectâ€™s
trademark is distinct from the projectâ€™s license for its source code. If you
look at various open source licenses, you will likely find a line that says that
the license does not grant trademark use. These are separate, because while
anyone may use or distribute the source code, when someone sees a projectâ€™s name
or logo, they assume certain qualities about what they are consuming based on
their trust in the project. While a license is not actually required for
accurate references to a projectâ€™s name, a well-defined trademark policy removes
ambiguity and provides certainty about acceptable uses.</p>
<p>Accordingly, a trademark, while managed separately from the code, actually
<em>helps</em> project owners ensure their work is used in ways that follow the <a href="https://opensource.org/osd">Open
Source Definition</a> by being a clear signal to users
that, â€œThis is open source.â€�</p>
<p>To start, <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a>, a web application framework for
mobile, and desktop; <a href="https://www.gerritcodereview.com/">Gerrit</a>, web-based team
code collaboration tool; and <a href="https://istio.io/">Istio</a>, an open platform to
connect, manage, and secure microservices, will be joining the Open Usage
Commons, giving their trademarks a neutral, independent home that manages
trademarks in line with the <a href="https://opensource.org/osd">Open Source
Definition</a>. If you currently use one of these
trademarks, you can continue to use these marks, following any current guidance
from the project. If you think your project may benefit from joining the Open
Usage Commons, email <a href="mailto:info@openusage.org">info@openusage.org</a>.</p>
<p>The Open Usage Commons is something wildly new in open source, and in the spirit
of the transparency that propels open source, weâ€™ll be the first to tell you
that the Commons intends to start small and walk before it runs. There will be
plenty of questions we donâ€™t have answers to yet. Weâ€™re guided by our commitment
to open use, passion for open source, and dedication to being an organization
that is in service to open source projects.</p>

<p>Hello! 👋 My name is Jen and I’m the founder, engineer, designer and customer support at <a href="https://lunchmoney.app/">Lunch Money</a>, a personal finance and budgeting web app.</p>

<p>In short, I am a company of one. I answer the customer support emails and I code and deploy new features. I also manage the <a href="https://developers.lunchmoney.app/" target="_blank">API docs</a> and <a href="https://support.lunchmoney.app/" target="_blank">knowledge base</a>, poke around the logs when there are issues, write the <a href="https://lunchmoney.app/sample_newsletter" target="_blank">bi-monthly newsletters</a> and I designed the logo!</p>

<p>As the company scales, so too must all aspects of my work which I break down into 4 parts: customer support, engineering, product and marketing.</p>

<p><strong>Finding opportunities for process optimization is honestly one of the more fun parts of running a business</strong>. I greatly attribute these to how I’ve been able to stay both solo &amp; sane up until now, currently with 600+ users and $45,000 ARR. In this post, I’m excited to share some of my most successful strategies along with anecdotes from my experience working on Lunch Money.</p>



<p>In the last 14 days, here’s what I got done across all departments:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Product:</strong> Launched an internal beta testers program and two sets of new features to test</li>
<li><strong>Engineering:</strong> Wrapped up a 2-week long refactor of some core components on the client-side</li>
<li><strong>Engineering:</strong> Launched a major feature: advanced transaction filters</li>
<li><strong>Engineering:</strong> Closed 13 tickets related to feature improvements and bug fixes</li>
<li><strong>Marketing:</strong> Sent out a newsletter outlining the latest new features</li>
<li><strong>Marketing:</strong> This blog post</li>
<li><strong>Marketing:</strong> Added new pages to the marketing site (<a href="https://lunchmoney.app/features/rules">Rules</a> and <a href="https://lunchmoney.app/features/collaboration">Collaboration</a>) and updated the icons in <a href="https://lunchmoney.app/features">Features</a></li>
<li><strong>Support:</strong> Received 239 inbound support tickets and sent out 358 emails</li>
</ul>

<p>What makes all this work bearable for me is the fact that there is so much variety (which, of course, is the spice of life!). I love being able to switch between tasks to keep the job interesting and my mind refreshed while still being productive overall.</p>

<p><em>Case in point: I just finished a major refactor and pushed out 2 major features to beta, so writing this blog post right now feels like a vacation for my brain.</em></p>

<p>To state the obvious, I enjoy being hyper-efficient (without burning myself out, of course). Even though I am a single person, I can still automate, optimize and parallelize processes.</p>



<h2 id="implement-safeguards">Implement safeguards</h2>

<p><i>Ah, the blissful beginnings of Lunch Money when I’d push code directly to production several times a day.</i></p>

<p>At 500+ users now, those days are long gone and I’ve since needed to adopt the more boring but responsible approach of implementing safeguards to prevent shipping faulty code.</p>

<p>For one, <b>I’ve been thoroughly reviewing my own code before every change</b>. Every major feature, improvement and bug fix lives in a feature branch that I still, by habit from the corporate days, prepend with <code>jen/</code>. After verifying everything works great locally, I make sure to take a break first, whether that’s working on a completely unrelated task, going for a meal or going to bed. The point of this is to ensure that I’m code reviewing with a clear head.</p>

<p>While adhering to these standards of code reviewing myself may add extra time to my overall process, it potentially saves hours of bug-fixing, answering related support tickets and self-loathing (I’m half-kidding here) down the line if I accidentally ship bad code.</p>

<center><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">New phase of Lunch Money– no more pushing major features straight to production 🤯😂 <a href="https://t.co/RYsz7BnU3L">https://t.co/RYsz7BnU3L</a></p>— Jen (@lunchbag) <a href="https://twitter.com/lunchbag/status/1256987437600927744?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 3, 2020</a></blockquote> </center>

<p><b>I also recently implemented an internal beta-testing program open to Lunch Money subscribers.</b> With more users accessing my app on a regular basis, the stakes are higher to ship a version that’s as bug-free as possible.</p>

<p>As an engineering team of one, it’s nearly impossible to always get it right the first time, despite having tests (what if I missed an edge case?) or testing locally extensively (how I think my users will use a feature is not always so).</p>

<p>The beta-testing program has provided some additional benefits. It’s nice to have a cohort of users with whom I can have a more candid conversation about Lunch Money and it’s also a great way to show users that their feedback is valued!</p>

<h2 id="automate-later-than-you-need-to">Automate later than you need to</h2>

<p>While automating tasks can save a lot of time in the long-term, it doesn’t always make sense to automate right off the bat.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/is_it_worth_the_time.png"><span>Obligatory XKCD comic (<a href="https://xkcd.com/1205/" target="_blank">link</a>)</span></p>

<p>Automating too late is not a bad thing. I’ll have done the manual work enough times to understand how to eventually automate the task and what edge cases to look out for. I equate it to doing a job yourself before hiring someone– it’s always better to grok the requirements first to some degree so you can understand how to best utilize who you’ve brought on (and appreciate them more!).</p>

<p>I manually triggered the emails for bi-monthly account summaries for months because I wasn’t confident the sending cadence was reasonable. After observing open rates and collecting user feedback, these are now automated to go out on the 5th &amp; 25th of every month.</p>

<p>Something that I’m glad I didn’t spend the time to automate at all was the referral program. If an existing user refers a new user and the new user subscribes to a plan, then both users will receive credit for 1 month.</p>

<p>In the end, the referral program only brought on 11 extra users. It was not a pain at all to manually process rewards for those who did. If I had spent time conjuring up all the edge cases and automating this process, it would not have been worth the time investment.</p>

<h2 id="keep-low-hanging-fruits-in-the-back-pocket">Keep low-hanging fruits in the back pocket</h2>

<p>In my task management system, I use a tag (🍏) to denote which tasks are low-hanging fruits. For the uninitiated, low-hanging fruits are quick tasks that are easy to knock out, such as one-liners or 5-minute fixes.</p>

<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/YP1Jb0JNc7kqFDbdjm/giphy.gif"></p>

<p>I find that keeping these around and tackling them on days when you feel generally unmotivated can really help raise spirits. Still being able to get something completed and shipped is a great way to get out of a slump.</p>



<h2 id="timing-marketing-pushes">Timing marketing pushes</h2>

<p>At Lunch Money, a big part of the business is using the services of Plaid for bank syncing. Plaid charges on a monthly basis which means that if a user signs up on April 30, connects a bank account immediately and doesn’t end up subscribing at the end of their 14-day trial, they will charge me for this user in both April &amp; May’s invoices.</p>

<p>This realization coupled with my intense aversion to paying more than I need to has shaped a lot of practices at Lunch Money.</p>

<p>For one, the data retention policy used to be 30 days which means if your trial ends and you didn’t put in your billing information, your data will be deleted in 30 days. This certainly guarantees that I’ll be overpaying for churned users and is the reason why the data retention policy has since been revised to 5 days.</p>

<p>In total, a user who does not end up subscribing can spend up to 26 days in the Lunch Money system. This comprises of a 14-day trial, the potential for a 1 week trial extension and a 5 day grace period. Assuming enough users connect their bank accounts, the best way to minimize my costs for churned users is to ensure their lifetimes are within one calendar month.</p>

<p><img src="https://lunchbag.ca/uploads/calendar-1.png"></p>

<p>As a result, I always schedule marketing pushes such as blog posts and product launches in the first few days of the month. When I came to this realization, my next Plaid bill went down for the first time.</p>

<h2 id="merging-marketing-and-engineering-for-a-combo-win">Merging marketing and engineering for a combo win</h2>

<p>Taking this a step further, the perk of having a spike in new users is that their trial periods more-or-less overlap. Usually when a new user signs up, they will poke around the product and maybe send in a bug report, a feature request or another piece of feedback. If I reply and address their feedback by putting in a fix or shipping their requested feature within days, more often than not, they end up converting into a happy customer.</p>

<p>I’ve therefore identified the following cycle to maximize potential conversions from spikes in user signups:</p>

<p><img src="https://lunchbag.ca/uploads/gantt-2.png"></p>

<p>After a marketing push, let’s say a product launch, I will see an immediate increase in signups lasting about 3 days and then slowly trailing off.</p>

<p>Over the next few days, I’ll start hearing from these new users via support tickets. I prioritize responding to them and I get to work. Showing these users that I’m committed to improving Lunch Money based on their feedback is a great and honest sales tactic.</p>

<p>About 3 days before the initial wave of user trials ends, I wrap up my engineering sprint and send out a newsletter detailing the latest features and improvements. This re-enforces to new users that the product is under continuous development.</p>

<p>Finally, I have a drip campaign that automatically notifies users a few days before their trial expires and on the actual date of expiry. This period of time is when I typically see most users convert 🤞.</p>



<p>I used to think that if I were to hire someone, it would first be a customer support agent but I’ve since been moving away from that idea. Users are constantly surprised (in a good way!) when they realize the founder is responding to their bug reports or feature requests directly.</p>

<p><strong>Consistently providing great customer support is a long-term investment for Lunch Money</strong> as it is undoubtedly a great way to turn customers into champions. As I receive and respond to support tickets, I’m also able to identify and overhaul the common sources of trouble for users.</p>

<p>I’ve always believed that customer support would be the most important and the hardest part of the business to scale, especially if I have the goal of staying a company of one.</p>

<p>Corroborating data from <a href="https://emailmeter.com/">EmailMeter</a> and my database, it seems my changes are making a difference. Despite a growing user base, inbound support emails remain fairly steady!</p>

<p><img src="https://lunchbag.ca/uploads/screen-shot-2020-05-21-at-4-20-15-pm.png"><span>Handling support on my own should be sustainable at least for the foreseeable future!</span></p>

<h2 id="how-do-support-tickets-work-at-lunch-money">How do support tickets work at Lunch Money?</h2>

July 8, 2020 | https://francescodilorenzo.com/hey-feed-ses-lambda-react | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://francescodilorenzo.com/hey-feed-ses-lambda-react">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><p>Newsletters are great, but too much of a distraction if they end up straight in your inbox with no predictable schedule.</p>
<p><a href="https://hey.com/">Hey</a> — the email service by the Basecamp folks — solves this by creating a separate space for newsletters, "The Feed". Here newsletters are shown in a timeline UI without read states. You can casually scroll through newsletters whenever you feel like it, and you do not see them in your main inbox. For most newsletters, this is a great experience.</p>
<p>I liked this concept so much that I decided to integrate it in <a href="https://mailbrew.com/">Mailbrew</a>, my SaaS that lets people receive an email digest from their favorite sources (even DHH himself <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1214356945932435457?s=20">uses it</a>).</p>
<p>My implementation works like this: when signing up for Mailbrew, you get your own email address to receive newsletters: <code>&lt;username&gt;@inbox.mailbrew.com</code>. </p>
<p>All emails sent to that address end up in daily digest with the schedule you decided. We also created a Hey-style feed browsable at <code>app.mailbrew.com/inbox</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://frankdilo.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/blog/mailbrew-inbox.gif" alt="Mailbrew Inbox in action"></p>
<p>We built all of this in a couple of weeks and it was easier to setup than I originally predicted. The tooling around email is great these days.</p>
<h3>Backend</h3>
<p>Amazon SES handles our inbound emails with some help from Lambda.</p>
<p>Here's how it works:</p>
<ul>
<li>When an email arrives at an <code>@inbox.mailbrew.com</code> address, SES uploads the raw email message to S3 and launches a lambda function. Configuring this from the AWS console was 5-10 minutes work.</li>
<li>The lambda function calls Mailbrew's backend (a majestic Django monolith), webhook-style, with recipient address, sender address, and message id.</li>
<li>If we don't recognize the recipient address (no user with that username) we send a special response to the lambda that causes the email to bounce.</li>
<li>If the recipient address matches, then we use the message id to retrieve the raw message content from S3 and process it.</li>
<li>Processing the message consists in extracting the <code>text/html</code> version of the email, applying some basic CSS styles, uploading this processed version to S3 and saving the message metadata in Postgres for easy retrieval.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Frontend</h3>
<p>In the frontend, emails are presented in a CRA React app. We embed the content of each email in a dedicated <code>iframe</code>. </p>
<p>A cool trick that we used was to create the <code>iframe</code> in JavaScript and set its content programmatically instead of settings its <code>src</code> property. This granted us an higher degree of customization and allowed us to do things like having all links inside newsletters open in new tabs.</p>
<p>The HTML of the emails in the S3 bucket is private, so we generate signed urls backend-side to show them. </p>
<p>One last cool thing we wanted to do was to have a link that allowed to read a single newsletter without the hassle of authentication. When opening a newsletter from the links in the daily email digest that we send users, we didn't want them to have to authenticate each time (almost a certainty with multiple devices and the in-app browsers of email clients).</p>
<p>We achieved this by using JSON Web Tokens. Each linked newsletter email in the digest has a token in the URL allowing read-only access to just that message. These links don't look great, but they work, are sharable, and don't require me to keep any state in the backend.</p>
<hr>
<p>This update brings the product closer to my vision of <strong>the single email you read everyday</strong> to stay on top of your game without wasting time. </p>
<p>You can now create a daily digest with Newsletters, Hacker News posts, RSS feeds, Reddit links, <a href="http://dev.to/">Dev.to</a> posts, YouTube videos and much more. The best part is that you receive this just once per day, on your own schedule. </p>
<p>Mailbrew is how I have stayed informed for the past 6 months and here is my <a href="https://app.mailbrew.com/frankdilo/morning-brew-fsKPZhXeFabm">daily digest</a> if you want to check out what the product is capable of.</p>
<p>I am <a href="https://twitter.com/frankdilo">@frankdilo</a> on Twitter if you have any feedback about Mailbrew or this post.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Conjugate priors have been widely used in many Bayesian inference techniques. Therefore it is very important to understand its basic concepts. In this blog post, I will introduce the concept of conjugate priors and give a concrete example of proving conjugate priors.</p>

<h3 id="definition">Definition</h3>

<p>According to Bayes’ theorem, it is universally true that</p>



<p>In Bayesian probability theory, if the posterior distributions $p(\theta|x)$ are in the same probability distribution family as the prior probability distribution $p(\theta)$, the prior and posterior are then called conjugate distributions, and the prior is called a conjugate prior for the likelihood function $p(x|\theta)$.</p>

<h3 id="example">Example</h3>

<p>If we have random variable $\mu$ from normal distribution $\mathcal{N}(\mu_0, \sigma_0^2)$, i.e.,</p>



<p>We also have random variable $x$ from normal distribution $\mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)$, i.e.,</p>



<p>Note that $\mu_0, \sigma_0^2, \sigma^2$ are not random variable but prefixed parameters in this case.</p>



<p>We have $N$ data points $X=\{x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_N\}$ independently sampled from normal distribution $\mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)$.</p>





<p>We will show that $p(\mu|X)$ is also a normal distribution, thus the posterior $p(\mu|X)$ and the prior $p(\mu)$ are in the same normal distribution family and they are conjugate. $p(\mu)$ is a conjugate prior for the likelihood $p(X|\mu)$.</p>





<p>where</p>



<p>Here $\text{const}$ are terms irrelevant to random variable $\mu$. For simplicity, we define:</p>



<p>Therefore, $p(\mu|X)$ follows normal distribution $\mathcal{N}(\mu^{\prime}, \sigma^{\prime2})$. Since both the posterior $p(\mu|X)$ and the prior $p(\mu)$ are in the normal distribution family, we say that $p(\mu) \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_0, \sigma_0^2)$ is a conjugate prior for the likelihood $p(X|\mu)$. It turns out that $p(X|\mu)$ is a multivariate normal distribution by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_normal_distribution">definition</a>.</p>

<h3 id="caveats">Caveats</h3>

<p>By the way, the distribution of the mean of $X$, $p(\bar{X}|\mu)$, is an exact normal distribution. But the <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/Papers/bayesGauss.pdf">proof</a> I found was oversimplified.</p>



<p>Here is what they did. They first define random variables:</p>



<p>Then they transform the probability density expression for $p(X|\mu)$:</p>



<p>It is not hard to see that</p>



<p>Moreover,</p>



<p>Therefore,</p>



<p>This means</p>



<p>Is random variable $s$ related to $\bar{X}$? It has been proved that $s$ and $\bar{X}$ are independent, given the samples are normally distributed. One of the proofs could be found <a href="http://jekyll.math.byuh.edu/courses/m321/handouts/mean_var_indep.pdf">here</a>, which surprised me because I never thought it would be non-trivial. We may come back to this proof in the future.</p>



<p>Therefore, we could remove $\exp\{\frac{(N-1)s^2}{2\sigma^2}\}$ from the right side since $s$ and $\bar{X}$ are independent.</p>



<p>Therefore, $p(\bar{X}|\mu)$ strictly follows the exact normal distribution $\mathcal{N}(\bar{X} | \mu; \frac{\sigma^2}{N})$.</p>



<p>This has something related to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem">central limit theorem</a>. The central limit theorem states the distribution of sample means approximates to normal distribution, regardless of what distribution the samples come from. It approximates normal distribution, but it might not be the exact normal distribution. In our case, with our derivation, we showed that the distribution of sample means is an exact normal distribution if the samples come from a normal distribution.</p>



<p>Deriving and proving conjugate priors could be complex and tedious. Fortunately, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_prior">Wikipedia</a> has documented all the known conjugate prior for certain likelihoods so far.</p>



<p>One last important property, all members of the exponential family have conjugate priors. This property is very useful in variational inference. Normal distribution is one of the members of the exponential family. For example, as we have shown, in our case $p(x|\mu)$ (there is only one sample in $X$) does have a conjugate prior which follows normal distribution.</p>

<section>
    <main>
        <p>I’ve been interviewing for several months.</p>
<p>During this pandemic period, my job application strategy is applied as much as possible, since I’m not sure which company is really hiring.</p>
<p>I use Linkedin intensively, I used to think Linkedin is a nice tool before I realized Linkedin charged from company for every application I submitted.</p>
<p>That’s somehow reasonable, as long as there are really vacancies in those companies.</p>
<p>However, chance are I’m redirecting to other job-hub these days.</p>
<p>After pressing APPLY, the job application form didn’t show up as I expected, but another layer of job recommendations from some suspicious web.</p>
<p>I already forgot when and where I applied for this role, but this fake agent almost hijack my identity.</p>
<p><img src="https://kangbojk.github.io/img/collins/collins1.png" alt="Fake Collins Aerospace Agent"></p>
<p>Around June 29 I got an email from someone claimed <strong>Marc Duvall</strong>, I noticed his email ends with @gmail.com, but I didn’t think too much about it.</p>
<p>He adviced me to send my resume to their recruiter whose email also ends with @gmail.</p>
<p>I did send my resume to the provided email since I’m actively looking for software engineer positions.</p>
<p><img src="https://kangbojk.github.io/img/collins/collins2.png" alt="Fake Collins Aerospace Agent 2"></p>
<p>After back and forth with this (fake) Tanya Hooper, I was invited to complete <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/16mzeTzsOO5KH28OLHDac7bArEk-lPOy7/view?usp=sharing"><strong>a list of questions</strong></a> representing virtual interview.</p>
<p><img src="https://kangbojk.github.io/img/collins/collins4.png" alt="Fake Collins Aerospace Agent 4"></p>
<p>This interview process was too unconventional and triggered my caution.</p>
<p>After I finished the list of questions, fake recruiter mentioned HR department will decide the hiring status, and revealed a lucrative compensation.</p>
<p><img src="https://kangbojk.github.io/img/collins/collins5.png" alt="Fake Collins Aerospace Agent 5"></p>
<p>I thought I really got a good luck to receive this opportunity during COVID-19, and couldn’t fall asleep that night.</p>
<p><img src="https://kangbojk.github.io/img/collins/collins6.png" alt="Fake Collins Aerospace Agent 6"></p>
<p>Next day, I got some <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HOQgxIdpgdUGjkMBTLYRMYeBR2jfDiAL/view?usp=sharing"><strong>exciting announcement</strong></a> that I got the job, the company is going to send me some nice tools to set up a home office.</p>
<p><img src="https://kangbojk.github.io/img/collins/collins7.png" alt="Fake Collins Aerospace Agent 7"></p>
<p>I almost took the bait.</p>
<p>Were it not for those space consuming machines I couldn’t load in my suitcase, I’ll happily send them my identity.</p>
<p><img src="https://kangbojk.github.io/img/collins/collins8.png" alt="Fake Collins Aerospace Agent 8"></p>
<p>So I sent a message to check what exactly I’ll be doing for this position, but no one replied.</p>
<p>I didn’t realize until the last moment this whole process is phishing.</p>
<p>These fake agent exploit people’s desire for a job during COVID-19 depression, which is really wicked.</p>
<p>I don’t know who to blame for, since disguising as an authority from company you’re not familiar is so easy with the help of unsecured job application site.</p>
<p>We really need to reform the hiring system.</p>
<p>I’m sharing this experience hoping people won’t be deceived during the job hunting in these days.</p>
<p>Send me (<a href="mailto:joseph@carryou.dev">joseph@carryou.dev</a>) a message if your company is really hiring, thank you.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <p><em>This post is the second in a four-part blog series by Peter Zaitsev, Percona Chief Executive Officer.</em></p>
<p>In this series, we are talking about Linux performance measurement, how to measure it right. Linux performance is a very broad topic, so we’ll focus on the four primary resources which are typically going to drive your system performance – obviously CPU, memory, disk storage, and network.</p>
<p>Other parts in this series include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ma.ttias.be/how-to-measure-linux-performance-avoiding-most-typical-mistakes-cpu/">Measuring Linux Performance: CPU</a></li>
<li><a href="https://ma.ttias.be/how-to-measure-linux-performance-avoiding-most-typical-mistakes-disk-storage/">Measuring Linux Performance: Disk</a></li>
<li><a href="https://ma.ttias.be/how-to-measure-linux-performance-avoiding-most-typical-mistakes-memory/">Measuring Linux Performance: Memory</a></li>
<li><a href="https://ma.ttias.be/how-to-measure-linux-performance-avoiding-most-typical-mistakes-network/">Measuring Linux Performance: Network</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of the disk, there are actually two things you have to take care of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Disk space</strong> – simple, right? You don’t want to run out of disk space.</li>
<li>And disk as <strong>I/O performance</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="disk-space">Disk Space</h2>
<p>Starting from the simple tool – disk space.</p>
<p>I see a lot of people who do not understand the difference between size, the file length, and the disk usage. So, in this case, I created a test file of 16 gigabytes, but if you look at <code>du</code>, it only takes 4 kilobytes, because that is a sparse file, which is one giant 16-gigabyte hole.</p>
<p>
    <img src="https://ma.ttias.be/content/measuring-linux-performance/part-2/image1.jpg" alt="Example of disk size/filesize" loading="lazy">
</p>
<p>Of course, you’re not likely to see this kind of a difference in the real world but you can, because there are a number of systems using sparse files for different things.</p>
<p>For example, in MySQL, due to some of the table compression that is used there may be a big difference between disk space used vs. file length that may be substantially different.</p>
<h2 id="io-performance">I/O performance</h2>
<p>Now when you speak about the disk I/O performance standpoint, you need to consider a number of things here.</p>
<p>Obviously, there is <strong>IOPS</strong> - how much it can do in the bandwidth. They are not quite replaceable, both can be the bottleneck, especially when it comes to the network-attached storage or slower buses. For example, it can be noticed that all SATA SSDs exactly deliver 500 megabytes a second because the SSDs are so fast, but SATA buses are so slow in this case, so that is the limit out there.</p>
<p>You also need to understand <strong>the different types of loads the disk reads, writes, or fsyncs</strong> , because we do have different latency and load implication.</p>
<p>In addition, your load concurrency is often referred to as a <strong>Queue Depth</strong> when it comes to the disk because concurrency is how many requests the system can process in parallel when big throughput is achieved that it is actually typical.</p>
<p>So, from typical mistakes: <em>“My Iostat Disk Utilization number has reached 100%"</em>. I have seen so many times this kind of being so much scared about this 100% when <em>“there is no way to go! Oh my gosh!"</em></p>
<p>The reality is that your <code>iostat</code> utilization number <strong>means the percent of the time when at least one I/O request was outstanding</strong>. It may make sense again for a single spinning drive in the last decade or last millennia, but it doesn’t really make sense for common storage we use those days.</p>
<p>It does not make sense for SSDs, it doesn’t make sense for RAIDs, it doesn’t make sense for NAS, it doesn’t make sense for cloud storage because they are very good at processing multiple requests at a time.</p>
<p>Performance, the latency at least, would not be impacted.</p>
<p>The points that should be highlighted here:</p>
<h3 id="1-separating-read-and-write-latency">1. Separating read and write latency</h3>
<p>Depending on your system, the difference between read and write latency may be very significant. Some systems actually have varied read latency, some have better write latency. In this case, what I do is compare their current latency to their kind of average latency, which you’ve seen on this system over the last period of time, so I can understand relatively easily that it’s abnormal.</p>
<p>
    <img src="https://ma.ttias.be/content/measuring-linux-performance/part-2/image2.png" alt="Disk I/O latency" loading="lazy">
</p>
<p><em>Comparing Current Latency to Historic Latency can help to see when the latency is abnormal</em></p>
<h3 id="2-the-disk-load-that-also-can-be-the-average-disk-use">2. The disk load, that also can be the average disk use</h3>
<p>It means how many requests are going on at the same time. Because if you’re really saturating your disks, queuing happens, and when this thing typically becomes quite high you should know what exactly your storage is expected to be able to optimally handle.</p>
<p>The problem is of course if you think about cloud storage, you don’t really know what the optimal concurrency is. They don’t tell you and that’s going to be implementation-dependent, which can change at any point any time.</p>
<p>
    <img src="https://ma.ttias.be/content/measuring-linux-performance/part-2/image3.png" alt="Disk I/O load distribution" loading="lazy">
</p>
<p><em>Graph from Percona Monitoring and Management (</em><a href="https://www.percona.com/software/database-tools/percona-monitoring-and-management"><em>PMM</em></a><em>)</em></p>
<h3 id="3-biolatency-block-device-latency">3. Biolatency: Block Device Latency</h3>
<p>The next thing is a biolatency, which again you can get from eBPF. You do not need to look at just the average latency, you can look at the distribution which can be done on an I/O device.</p>
<p>
    <img src="https://ma.ttias.be/content/measuring-linux-performance/part-2/image4.png" alt="Block device latency distribution" loading="lazy">
</p>
<p>eBPF also has some tools where you can look at that on a file system level that is more interesting because that is where you can also see your cache efficiency as well as you can look at some more of the outliers.</p>
<p>So, this is the tool for ext4 and also one for XFS and some other common file systems.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
<h2>1. "Man is a naturally political animal." - Aristotle (<a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0058%3Abook%3D1%3Asection%3D1253a">Politics, Book 1</a>)</h2>

<h3>What people think it means</h3>

<p>1. People are drawn to "political associations to satisfy their social needs." (<a href="https://oll.libertyfund.org/quotes/164">source</a>), or...</p>
<p>2. People enjoy engaging in the ugly parts of politics, or...</p>
<p>3. People are meant to live in cities. (closest to the actual meaning)</p>

<h3>What it actually means</h3>

<p>To Aristotle, the words "natural" and "political" held special meanings that are not equivalent to what we mean today. The result is that this quote is closer in meaning to:</p>

<blockquote>"Human beings have an internal principle that necessarily leads us to collaboration rather than to independence, and as a result we are meant to live in cities."</blockquote>

<p>When we say "natural" today, we typically mean something that is not man-made. To Aristotle, "natural" refers to things that have a "nature":</p>

<blockquote>"within itself a principle of motion and stability in place, in growth and decay, or in alteration" (Aristotle 192b13)</blockquote>

<p>So when Aristotle says that something is "naturally" the case, through a modern lens he's saying something closer to it being the result of the laws of nature.</p>

<p>Second, by "a political animal," it's tempting to conclude that Aristotle simply means "suited for life in a polis" (city) or "conducive to starting a polis." But he goes on to say that "a human being is <span>more of a</span> political animal than is any bee or any gregarious animal [i.e., an animal that lives in a group]" (1253a8, emphasis mine). So Aristotle thinks that some gregarious animals are political animals, but not to the extent that human beings are. It seems unlikely that Aristotle would suggest that bees or gregarious animals are "suited for lives in a polis" to any degree. More likely, by "political," Aristotle means "working toward a common goal" or "collaborative."</p>

<p>Secular, modern readers would likely disagree with Aristotle's next passage. He argues that nature has "given us" the ability to speak and make moral judgments, and nature "does nothing pointlessly," so we are <span>meant</span> to collaborate on our moral judgments. With our modern understanding of evolution, nature doesn't "give us" features, and nature does sometimes do things "pointlessly." However, this is what Aristotle meant when he said we are "naturally political animals." So even if you agree with the actual meaning of the quote, you probably don't agree with Aristotle's reasoning.</p>

<h2>2. "If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?"</h2>

<h3>What people think it means</h3>

<p>When I hear this quote today, I find that people often use it to mean that even if no one observes a fact, it is still true. So it's used as a rhetorical question, with the answer being "of course it makes a sound!"</p>

<h3>What it actually means</h3>

<p>This quote is not directly from any philosophical text, but the question is derived from "A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge" by the Anglican bishop George Berkeley (namesake of UC Berkeley!). Here's the closest section, where Berkeley explains a counterargument and his response:</p>

<blockquote>"But say you, surely there is nothing easier than to imagine Trees, for instance, in a Park... and no Body by to perceive them. I answer, you may so, there is no difficulty in it: But what is all this, I beseech you, more than framing in your Mind certain Ideas which you call Books and Trees, and the same time omitting to frame the Idea of any one that may perceive them? But do not you your self perceive or think of them all the while?" (<a href="https://www.maths.tcd.ie/~dwilkins/Berkeley/HumanKnowledge/1734/HumKno.pdf">source</a>, pg. 18)</blockquote>

<p>I know that's confusing. Let's break it down. For context, Berkeley's famous phrase "esse est percipi" ("to be is to be perceived") is a summary of his philosophical position that objects as we know them cannot exist without the existence of minds to perceive them. (The gist is that everything we know about the object is known through our minds, so when you remove those characteristics, there's nothing left.)</p>

<p>In the first sentence, Berkeley is paraphrasing an objector who claims they are able to imagine trees that no one is perceiving. But Berkeley points out that the objector is simply thinking of the idea of trees ("certain Ideas which you call Books and Trees"), which only exist because the objector is thinking about them.</p>

<p>Since Berkeley believed in a Christian God, it's not clear whether he thought real objects could possibly exist without any perceiver at all, since God might always be watching. But to a secular reader of Berkeley's arguments, the consequence is that <span>the tree does not make a sound</span>, since sound is a perception, and the existence of a perception depends on the existence of a mind to perceive it.</p>

<h2>3. "God is Dead." (The Gay Science) - Nietzsche</h2>

<h3>What people think it means</h3>

<p>This quote might be interpreted as a proclamation of atheism.</p>

<h3>What it actually means</h3>

<p>Nietzsche presented this phrase to a group of atheists, claiming that it was new information for them. So it can't be a statement about atheism.</p>

<p>In this section of "The Gay Science", Nietzsche discusses how many of the underpinnings of Western society, particularly our moral philosophy, implicitly rely on the concept of God. With the rise of philosophical secularism that came with the Enlightenment, we can no longer rely on God to give life meaning and value, and everything that was built on the Christian faith is destined to "collapse" (GS 343). This is what it means for God to be "dead."</p>

July 8, 2020 | https://www.rezilion.com/blog/the-race-to-limit-ptrace/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.rezilion.com/blog/the-race-to-limit-ptrace/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<div>

					<p>
	As our R&amp;D team develops Rezilion, they occasionally see opportunities to improve and inform the status quo. In this post, our Team Lead, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yuri-shafet-87ab1285/">Yuri Shafet,</a> spends some time diving into <em>ptrace </em>— what it is, how to use it to inject arbitrary code into a running process, how to limit ptrace execution and different techniques to dynamically detect it.</p>


<p>
	<em>ptrace()</em>&nbsp; is a system call (in place since kernel 1.0) that provides a means by which one process (the “tracer”) may observe and control the execution of another process (the “tracee”).&nbsp;</p>


<p>
	<em>ptrace</em> is usually used for debugging. For example, GDB debugger uses <em>ptrace </em>to attach to the debugged process and if necessary change registers or other data. <em>ptrace </em>is also used for tracing purposes. For example, the <em>strace </em>utility uses <em>ptrace </em>to halt the program being traced each time it calls a system call. Using <em>strace </em>is one of the legitimate ways to use <em>ptrace </em>in production.</p>


<p>
	Because <em>ptrace </em>allows control over processes, it also has malicious uses and was used in several real-world attacks and exploitations. For example:</p>


<block-list>

<div slot="content">

	
	<ul><li><a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/40839">The DirtyCow bug exploitation</a>  </li><li>CVE-2011-4327, where ptrace allowed local users to obtain sensitive key information.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/n1nj4sec/pupy">Pupy</a> is a remote access trojan that uses ptrace. It was used in an <a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/europe-grid-pupy-rat/">attack</a> on European electricity organization’s email server.</li></ul>
	
</div>

</block-list>

<p>
	For a broader context, these findings are despite a 24% increase in annual spending on prevention, detection, and remediation of vulnerabilities from 2018 to 2019. With this in mind, it’s easy to understand why vulnerability management and patching have become board-level discussions.</p>


<p>
	To demonstrate ptrace injection in action, we perform dynamic injection of arbitrary code in the running process. To keep the code short and simple we do not check for all errors. When you write a production tool you most definitely should check for all errors. The shellcode that we are going to inject is a bind shell at port 4444. Source code of the shellcode can be found <a href="http://shell-storm.org/shellcode/files/shellcode-78.php">here</a>.</p>


<p>
	<img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/49v5tw0LjNDhgMia_O-XPGgNY-JLOUisiSbwDunDhrippPdqB_B0cXuG6fM_EOK7KYf068Wwe5MXXKA8CO1FQEs59stHHWAmKdpocbYG1Iqse0tvf_Kw0K7hfJzCjHsZyCFUGRSQ" width="624" height="849"></p>


<p>
	Let’s compile the program and execute the attack on the running process. We will inject our shellcode into the running sleep process.</p>


<p>
	Victim process:</p>


<p>
	<img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/lgiVozq6J36oBT5YnD0kEpnPx1Bcsc99fByjz_8nnRxQlstoXODTRSdwx0gEoKzi-ZqQ28ZYaT-vadzHCf24Z3j8Oz5KUoN-_frT2XY5HANE9ELLGKkiJqbEs3KFFX_UmiLKhWJe" width="262" height="124"></p>


<p>
	Attacker process:</p>


<p>
	<img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/zfIEKb_mX2BtTThB4Awxpjdhbagr6W-2zlv9t_vb8Grigfw4VRVIEPySPkQIiaU3f_6GMG-CkMaTmT9kfQkGvA7S3fHezeiEl1ib9QgYfqiqNqR7-GD_ipni6nRh5uV8AKmjEc8O" width="482" height="174"></p>


<p>
	Success. We’ve injected our shellcode into the target process.</p>




<p>
	<strong>Disabling ptrace in production</strong></p>


<p>
	Disabling or constraining ptrace system calls in production environments is considered good practice. In this section we present some ways to limit ptrace execution.</p>


<p>
	<strong>Prctl</strong></p>


<p>
	One of the ways to restrict ptrace is to use the prctl system call. We can set PR_SET_DUMPABLE (since Linux 2.3.20) flag to zero, making the process not dumpable.</p>


<p>
	Processes that are not dumpable can not be attached via ptrace PTRACE_ATTACH.</p>


<p>
	Consider the following program that sets PR_SET_DUMPABLE flag to zero and&nbsp; then sleeps for 60 seconds:</p>


<p>
	<img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/1Sp5_ja3uqhLlRgolAtOeLh53sBGcetV-DWD8GMNiH6_SJ62rTahFOfVWMBWi4uL_VePA6ACksysCCM9dqrBTjtnVhgV9sDOwv4MucylauKY1j6giXZjbheTd0UwCGt91dihrROa" width="538" height="458"></p>


<p>
	If we try to use ptrace to attach to the process, ptrace will fail:</p>


<p>
	<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d11l6Q_nCqF3ktTxxoiyd0191BYIn-Kv484RmTX-LtP8uv2Cqy5c6exNLHhpakFsj0lw1CpTSKdfvq2BsYWPVH9jYPMwLtNp_KEwj8eYgfE4Uy2l65nfOSyWo2v9Y1iD3XSenBBZ" width="624" height="95"></p>


<p>
	However, this flag will *not* prevent ptrace usage if it is executed by root.</p>


<p>
	<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/lW9LUMTUthmw2GPJtD34hqJRsinjCHPvQ7DYqZZcVKiiD1rWev1g88keCV_SNHbBmHf0ChZif_IW9wQIpgGQ19-SGtDW-BudwazwjpWsNzavRnz1Dm3vblnRW4D3cBeDlYpt6Nt4" width="622" height="242"></p>


<p>
	A real-world example of this technique used for constraining ptrace is openssh.</p>


<p>
	As can be seen in the source code of openssh, prctl is used to set PR_SET_DUMPABLE to zero.</p>


<p>
	<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ha9DJHY_k9c7NG5BzcWhdEeQFkciZtr7Z2XdLfY_ufgEx8IF5AFn0AosNxVNzlMkFuenJZF6hlyyZ36n4IvI5oTZr-ylubrKWc3BCG18QOnsyEztoDX60b3uStPz7G8lA5XB0I6Y" width="624" height="72"></p>


<p>
	<strong>ptrace_scope</strong></p>


<p>
	You can apply ptrace policy via yama configuration. Yama is a Linux Security Module that collects system-wide DAC security protections that are not handled by the core kernel itself. To see current ptrace scope in the system run following command:</p>


<block-quote>

<div slot="content">

	<blockquote><p>cat /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope</p></blockquote>

</div>

</block-quote>

<p>
	Possible values are:</p>


<p>
	0 – classic ptrace permissions: almost no restrictions.</p>


<p>
	1 – restricted ptrace: a process must have a predefined relationship with the inferior it wants to call PTRACE_ATTACH on. By default, this relationship is that of only its descendants when the above classic criteria is also met.&nbsp;</p>


<p>
	2 – admin-only attach: only processes with CAP_SYS_PTRACE may use ptrace with PTRACE_ATTACH, or through children calling PTRACE_TRACEME.</p>


<p>
	3 – no attach: no processes may use ptrace with PTRACE_ATTACH nor via PTRACE_TRACEME. Once set, this sysctl value cannot be changed.</p>


<p>
	The documentation of the configuration available <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/security/Yama.txt">here</a>.</p>


<p>
	For example, if ptrace scope is configured runningrunning injection without root permissions will fail, as seen in the screenshot below:</p>


<p>
	<img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/meOQ1bz28oIwmUjtlYmOOYWrJzEnKcjxNNhanwGla_YiGrRk-FNySS-M66XUBSJIm1ivcYYPRDhhWTZhbY3ejtCAZQYNGRacm7cJBNeUwk3a-0cwvJDybBqgq0yj-ohot1NiIWaJ" width="624" height="221"></p>


<p>
	However, if we change ptrace_scope (root is required to do that), we can execute ptrace injection without root privilege:</p>


<p>
	<img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/jkxxQ1p35r8dgji3DauY0IL7lblXBb4j4j1Cwly1UF09rQetg1NC2VboN1azvKxpxLnM46rb7k4wO4cAPwePIDfkFcNZssQM3qQErTSlT8-JjwKsPloaLS9xkV7btos0f-JywqRw" width="624" height="189"></p>


<p>
	<strong>Disabling ptrace in docker</strong></p>


<p>
	If you run docker version lower than 19.03 or have kernel version lower than 4.8, ptrace is disabled by default. You can enable it by adding –cap-add=SYS_PTRACE flag. For example {docker run –cap-add=SYS_PTRACE python}. Docker uses seccomp configuration to prevent ptrace from running. Seccomp is an efficient way to whitelist syscalls by application.</p>


<p>
	For example, when user run your docker without –cap-add=SYS_PTRACE, the injection will fail (I already have the injection program in the container):</p>


<p>
	<img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/XYSTUA5vKqjxYp-h1ckZSENKDZ0sTLfvGkRC-CL9I4-VwDKTKjnimfAqYV-Olqpg9OVmClSHxu_y_7jLwBW4zUBjnd9TU7jfkaDzHmGKXXs7tukv1zkM6ugNKB5iEVeByGkXRQa2" width="590" height="202"></p>


<p>
	However, when you allow ptrace in container…</p>


<p>
	<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/MyTKjaGW2OYuiwjTESPj6M2yhQd7xvkicsBQRAQPojucqbMoUihmkFRN9FJx8t9bE0ng3IdQKG5Z38nvyFwJNhs2KTI11UQFI4G4GMyA-dEtEHHnKWr4X1xwyb0rGjCSDo_03cxB" width="624" height="33"></p>


<p>
	Injection works as expected:</p>


<p>
	<img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/R9hyO-bCvwZxtym9Giwxf-XWERtFvJEVthcncz8R5rGmDv5hZKvE74wG-kVzZexdSc3GP7ChzgEj3yTYHUY3-kiBhP4PaqemOhpdZoPsMnhJxhTKlbkKq749w3pEQmSN_GyYuwjD" width="624" height="328"></p>


<p>
	You can find in detail how –cap-add=SYS_PTRACE flag in docker works <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2020/04/29/why-strace-doesnt-work-in-docker/">here</a></p>


<p>
	<strong>Tracing itself</strong></p>


<p>
	The process can trace itself with PTRACE_TRACEME to prevent other processes from tracing it. This technique works because at any given moment the process can have only one trace. It is used in some cases as an anti-debug technique by malware. To demonstrate, let’s write a small program that traces itself and sleeps for 60 seconds:</p>


<p>
	<img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/IxlZSMVTXPFqTnszRX7LibVXH8nekjvXW6aWHM9IGsMU0A0bvx76EBAJGkeVPjHJdx9fP7svP1WG3hazieBo5Qklra7DCFBfQXzEOJXF6b1JTMUL-HpTp43j4REBH9nNNhFunyzG" width="624" height="188"></p>


<p>
	Now let’s try to inject the shellcode with our injector.</p>


<p>
	Our program failed because the process is already traced. This technique is sometimes used by malware to prevent dynamic debugging.</p>


<p>
	<strong>Detecting ptrace</strong></p>


<p>
	Let’s review some ways in which ptrace system call execution can be dynamically detected in the system.</p>


<block-quote>



</block-quote>

<p>
	One of the ways to detect if a process is traced is to read /proc/[PID]/status. It provides much of the information in /proc/[pid]/stat and /proc/[pid]/statm in a format that’s easier for humans to parse. In particular, we are interested in the TracerPid field which shows us PID of process tracing this process (0 if not being traced).</p>


<p>
	For example when reading /proc/[PID]/status of an untraced process:</p>


<p>
	<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/6CseKjR3TiAHIEgx3rYXoki3_7xwT0uz_ixPrqObmusMvsrsarc7j1jFdWXcH4PvctoTtV2myd0_kzliEE9gpuGQZfbZDGY4N1pL7J5SGfXcyb-UmSmFfgDUDVrRKfZrScXbDy_E" width="474" height="256"></p>


<p>
	TracerPid is 0, meaning the process is not traced.</p>


<p>
	But when we read /proc/[PID]/status of the traced process:</p>


<p>
	<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/8iHcB-1W5pBC5wC-iA0-I4nd87nmYDDAQ2MjY2NHDZsYggddv28cNTwIDkqP8bXFkQLZtEDcRLJ77NT-_NMK5TT2n6QpN7VfhB-SyON5Umt2hziCAFItw78IVrZI0xKUBGlhGEgg" width="490" height="342"></p>


<p>
	Hmmm… TracerPid is still 0, because our injection is very fast and we detach from the process, before reading /proc/[PID]/status. Lets add sleep(10) before detaching part of our injection code and rerun the injection. We will also have to add #include &lt;unistd.h&gt; to import the sleep function:</p>


<p>
	<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/I5jBJmbuEiTmJE6prpbW0V37E--Xh7RyUzprjjkGf_zoLUYOflnWnFLTpOslFEH3w3adysHvGq3sxtv1e4bOIN80VgVaH1KOuo67VB41ffl9mByQrm1sAtQPrMT5iJq2C0ysGI6g" width="624" height="312"></p>


<p>
	And now TracerPid is the PID of the injector process. By running this example, we can conclude that if /proc/[PID]/status scanning has periodic nature, we may lose fast ptrace injections. To counter this we can use hook based approaches.</p>


<p>
	<strong>Process Events Connector</strong></p>


<p>
	Netlink is used to transfer information between the kernel and user-space/kernel processes. It consists of a standard sockets-based interface for user space processes and an internal kernel API for kernel modules. We use a process events connector protocol to detect ptrace system calls. Connector protocol can dynamically trace the following events:</p>


<block-list>

<div slot="content">

	
	<ul><li>Fork</li><li>Exec</li><li>Exit</li><li>Core dump</li><li>Proc comm field change</li><li>Clone</li><li>ptrace</li><li>UID change</li><li>SID change</li></ul>
	
</div>

</block-list>

<p>
	ptrace is what we need. <a href="https://github.com/ColinIanKing/forkstat">forkstat</a> is an existing tool that uses the netlink protocol for tracing. It also enriches the mined events from /proc and other sources. Let’s run forkstat with an option that allows the user to trace only ptrace events:</p>


<p>
	<img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ulha0zvO4Tx16k7dbf-8BxHTxPj0u-kywzxM2nHd7tNgKH71po67oTq_p92AM1EAsQzlx_fL2IOjIdqmgCyQgnVvWcE_3E0pPt-NuEdk5MJvUGTG7_NBYZ3BZ7CH6IA2BaSWBSbi" width="548" height="94"></p>


<p>
	Now let’s execute the injection:</p>


<p>
	<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/sKsDhqu7Gq8byv_tHS8vgpOHV6QC6EFcQOaH7MY_FikjBoe1B74cJbbwclTz18iBe1Q4mkzTTvLzTKPKIpC3pQlmb6hL-aipSS4mmVpuZlJOoSSiW-bzIXJGZEUlM-X319iHBJhh" width="442" height="138"></p>


<p>
	Forkstat output:</p>


<p>
	<img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/or4FPXhyqrgomyhvpIarmuBo6CucL6wfdj7D4_j7ZoDGbsVGu50ROsILCKbx1JUV7x4nyLRC21YgjIHFR0H0eGjdb8hi7deuM9Yg9v5fHgK6llgcpfouqMA9aaN-Sesk1IyrJjWQ" width="624" height="163"></p>


<p>
	We have here both ATTACH and DETACH ptrace events, however, POKE_TEXT and other types of ptrace are not mined. As can be seen in the source code of forkstat const bool attach = (proc_ev-&gt;event_data.ptrace.tracer_pid != 0);, detach event is generated when tracer pid is zero. We already saw that tracer pid is becoming zero after DETACH is called.</p>


<p>
	<strong>BPF</strong></p>


<p>
	BPF is an in-kernel virtual machine which can be used for system tracing. It is an extremely powerful linux feature that allows the user to trace kernel and user space. Linux started support for bpf system call from kernel 3.18. For tracing ptrace we will use <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bpftrace">bpftrace</a>. It is a high-level tracing language for BPF available in recent Linux kernels (4.x).</p>


<p>
	Let’s run a bpftrace tracer that detects all ptrace system calls:</p>


<p>
	<img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/QAPVIKkkBDS5m5p7LsBtIFmeW23bz1MSPyCB_bKiCezSBzYV5C05jJrMVT3TLnxryaFskYK709qB5IFRlA51IpVimY3fIlB34fbsRNBngDNbN8orNKQJgqtoWIKLaEkO0A0SG9FZ" width="624" height="48"></p>


<p>
	The program stops when the user presses ctrl+c. Our one-liner prints the process name for every ptrace system call that the process executes. This tracer instruments tracepoints to achieve the desired functionality. Alternatively, we could use kprobes, but while kprobes allow us to instrument arbitrary kernel functions it is less stable, so if possible, tracepoints are preferred. You can read <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2017/07/05/linux-tracing-systems/">here</a> more about different linux tracing systems.</p>

	Let’s run the injection and see what we get…</p>

<p>
	We see that ptrace syscall was executed many times which makes sense because our one-liner catches all types of ptrace, including PTRACE_ATTACH, PTRACE_GETREGS, PTRACE_POKETEXT (which happens many times in our injection) and PTRACE_DETACH. To resolve that issue, we can modify our tracer to detect only specific types of the ptrace syscalls. This time we write bpftrace code in a separate file:</p>

<p>
	This program will only print events when ptrace with&nbsp; PTRACE_ATTACH event is executed:</p>

<p>
	As you can see for a single attack, the program printed only a single line, because PTRACE_ATTACH was executed only once.</p>




<p>
	We hope you found this post useful, and that you learned about <em>ptrace </em>and some of its usages — including how to disable and dynamically detect it. We highly recommend disabling <em>ptrace </em>in production environments, because malicious actors can instrument …</p></div></div></div>

        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Running an engineering team is closer to art than science, even though the day-to-day work is based on engineering, which is rooted in science. If you agree with that statement, then the practices for running a team should be closer to art as well but isn’t usually the case. The practice I focus on in this post is hiring, but it holds true even for others like project planning, estimation, career planning, etc.</p>

<p>To explain my point, let’s consider making a movie or a tv show (overly simplified here, of course). Most of us agree that making a movie is an art. A movie needs a team of people with a diverse set of skills to make something that the audience enjoys watching and would pay for. Let’s start drawing some parallels with this team and a software engineering team. (This analogy works even when building a new company).</p>
<ul>
  <li>The producer is equivalent to the company or an investor in case of a new startup, i.e., the entity providing money and resources to run the show.</li>
  <li>The group consisting of the Screenwriter, Director, Production Designer, Director of Photography, Music Composer, and many others make up the crew, is equivalent to the roles of Engineering Manager, Product Manager, Product Designer, Customer Support, Sales, etc. in no particular order.</li>
  <li>The actors playing various roles make up the cast and are like the Software Engineers on the team. Just like the actors enact the scenes to make the final product, the software engineers implement the software used by the end user.</li>
</ul>

<p>The skills required of the crew (Engineering Manager, Product Manager, Product Designer, Customer Support, Sales, etc in the software world) are pretty specific to the role, and the way to test for them has less overlap.</p>

<p>The skills required for actors/software engineers however clearly have a lot more overlap. Surely an essential requirement for all actors hired for a movie is to enact something which involves a certain standard of expressions, emotions, delivering lines, etc. After this baseline of skills is tested, the crew would then have to look for additional specific skills that are presumably different for different roles. (Although good actors can play a variety of roles well in the same way as good software engineers can adapt to different roles). However, the process for the audition itself would be different based on the roles. It wouldn’t make sense for the crew to create a question bank from which they pick random hard/medium/easy questions to ask the candidates auditioning for various roles, would it? Then why do we do it when interviewing software engineers?</p>

<p>Developers need to satisfy a basic requirement of being able to translate a given business requirement into code that can produce an acceptable output for a given set of inputs under certain conditions. It’s also reasonable to require a candidate to have the familiarity of certain practices like considering edge cases, testing, writing maintainable code, etc. After this baseline is tested, the additional skills that need testing should involve coming up with a creative interview process for each role. But instead, most companies treat the interview process like a manufacturing activity instead of a design activity.</p>

<p>It’s a lot easier for companies to conduct interviews from a question bank consisting of commonly asked questions from Leetcode, Topcoder, etc than to tailor interviews for specific roles. I don’t blame them for sticking to such a strategy when the focus is on doubling the team at breakneck speed rather than being thoughtful about when and how to hire. Unfortunately, you are applying a mechanical process in hiring for roles that involve creativity. Such a process would make more sense for manufacturing companies where each employee would be following the exact same steps to get a job done, but in reality, software engineering is hardly that. The focus should be on the creativity of applying techniques to solve problems rather than pattern matching engineering concepts. So put some thought into designing your questions vs picking a textbook example. If pattern matching is all you need then why not just hire robots? It would be a lot cheaper to do so.</p>

<p>Based on the specific role a software engineer would be playing on the team some skills might be more important than others, just like an actor for different roles. For example, if the role requires them to work with cross-functional teams to identify problems, propose elegant solutions, write a design document, code it up, measure success metrics, etc then test for each of those skills.  It is in your team’s best interests to come up with an interview process tailored to that instead of relying on a generic company-wide process. Have the candidate spend a day doing all of the above instead of two medium and one hard Leetcode questions and asking the textbook scalability design question. As a side note, not every engineer needs to know about consistent hashing if that’s not important for the role you are hiring. It’s the ability to learn quickly is what matters. I almost laughed in a design interview recently where the interviewer asked me to explain this concept without tying it back to a specific scenario.</p>

<p>This kind of a creative interview process ensures that the company has engineers with a diverse set of skills versus the ones who could master the majority of textbook concepts. I will end with a quote from a book I have been recently reading (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Art-Doing-Science-Engineering-Learning/dp/1732265178/ref=pd_lpo_14_t_0/130-3275136-8575363?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=1732265178&amp;pd_rd_r=96058951-3793-4e73-8f55-c28f6581c4e0&amp;pd_rd_w=1C9qC&amp;pd_rd_wg=sKnSB&amp;pf_rd_p=7b36d496-f366-4631-94d3-61b87b52511b&amp;pf_rd_r=K2FD088Z7JBXWR5PT4XB&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=K2FD088Z7JBXWR5PT4XB">Richard Hamming’s The Art of Doing Science and Engineering: Learning to Learn</a>, originally published in 1996 and republished recently) which nicely sums up my thoughts,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is programming closer to novel writing than classical engineering? I suggest yes! Given the problem of getting a man into outer space, both the Russians and the Americans did it pretty much the same way, all things considered, and allowing for some espionage. They were both limited by the same firm laws of physics. But give two novelists the problem of writing on “the greatness and misery of man,” and you will probably get two very different novels. Give the same complex problem to two modern programmers and you will, I claim, get two rather different programs. Hence my belief that current programming practice is closer to novel writing than it is to engineering.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hence, running an engineering team is closer to art than science. Start by making your hiring process more creative and less mechanical.</p>

			<p><span>I discovered the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/no/book/show/38714658-the-order-of-time">The Order of Time by Carlo Rovelli</a> a few years ago and it reignited my interest in Quantum Physics. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/24/carlo-rovelli-the-order-of-time-review">This is the original review that reeled me in. </a>The title caught my attention initially because the focus was on the concept of time. Time is a mysterious topic. It changes in unexpected circumstances, it’s perceived in different ways and scientists still ponder what it actually is. It turns out that time and quantum physics go hand in hand. The book is in three sections; the understanding of time in modern physics, what happens without time and finally the latest theories on time including Rovelli’s own research into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_gravity#:~:text=Quantum%20gravity%20(QG)%20is%20a,effects%20of%20gravity%20are%20strong.">Quantum Gravity</a> which present some of the most recent theories in the field. </span></p>
<p><span>One of the intriguing things was the link between time and heat. As things heat up, thermal agitation increases, which leads to entropy and disorder. This can distinguish the past and the future. There are many surprising assertions about time (at least for me) that I won’t spoil for you.</span></p>
<p><span>The tone of this book is poetic. It’s always in awe of the amazing world we live in. The best part is that it simplifies very difficult concepts into something most people could understand, allowing for greater access. This can only be a good thing for technology research overall. </span></p>
<p><span>As much information as there is about the concept of time and the theories that exist, there are still many open questions. It leaves you feeling small, knowing there is so much we don’t know about our world. And finally, unlike most other science books, there’s only one equation mentioned (good news for some).</span></p>
<p><span>I’ll leave you with <a href="https://inews.co.uk/inews-lifestyle/wellbeing/carlo-rovelli-coronavirus-italy-life-death-psychology-419679">something recent by Carlo Rovelli talking about the pandemic reminding us we are only human and encouraging collaboration and science to overcome it.</a></span></p>

<p>Thread dump files tend to span for several hundreds of lines (sometimes a few thousands of lines). It is hard to conceive and assimilate all the information in the thread dump due to its verbosity. Flame Graph generated by <span><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://fastthread.io/" target="_blank">fastThread</a></span> tool condenses all the information into one single compact flame graph format. It facilitates you to identify hot code paths quickly. In this article, let us learn how to use flame graphs generated by fastThread tool for effective debugging/troubleshooting purposes.</p>



<pre>If you would like to learn how to generate flame graph from java thread dumps, you can refer <a href="https://blog.fastthread.io/2020/06/23/flame-graph-from-java-thread-dump/">to this article</a></pre>



<h2>fastThread Flame graph features</h2>

<p><span><iframe width="736" height="414" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lLVOzy3gERM?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></span></p>
</div></figure>



<p>Here are key features of the flame graph generated by fastThread application:</p>



<h3>1. Information on Mouse Hover:&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Stack traces are represented as a column of boxes, where each box represents a function (a stack frame). On mouse-over of boxes, a tooltip will be displayed. It will show the class name, method name, and line of the code that has been executed. More importantly, it will show the number of threads that are executing this line of code.</p>

<h3>2. Flame Graph Color</h3>



<p>The background color for each box is not significant and is picked at random to be a warm hue. This randomness helps the eye to differentiate boxes, especially for adjacent thin “towers”.</p>



<h3>3. Box width</h3>



<p>The width of each box depends on the thread count. If the width of the box is sufficient, it displays the full function name. If not, either a truncated function name with an ellipsis is shown, or nothing.</p>



<h3>4. Click to zoom</h3>



<p>When a box is clicked, the flame graph zooms horizontally. This reveals more detail and often function names for the child functions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The sum of matched stack traces is also shown at the left- bottom of the Flame Graph, as shown in the above image.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>The flame graph is a powerful yet simple way to visualize and analyze your thread dumps. We hope it will be useful to debug your production problems.</p>

          <p>Terraform is an infrastructure as a Code (IaaC) tool that helps you build your infrastructure using script (code). You don’t have to interact with the web console nor through the CLI commands provided by your cloud provider. You may define your infrastructures by following the structure provided by Terraform then manage them directly your workstation.</p>
<p>In this article, I will demonstrate how to create an EC2 instance on Amazon Web Service (AWS) using Terraform.</p>
<h2 id="1-your-aws-credentials">1. Your AWS Credentials</h2>
<p>Firstly, Terraform requires access and permissions to be able to provision resources on your AWS account on your behalf. Therefore, we will create an access key for Terraform on AWS IAM user by following these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Under AWS IAM on your AWS console, choose your user name from the list</li>
<li>Click on “Security Credentials” tab</li>
<li>Click on “Create access key” button to generate a new access key. A CSV file containing your credentials will be generated</li>
<li>Download and open the CSV file on your computer to extract the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key</li>
<li>Run the following command on your terminal / shell:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="&lt;access_key_id from aws administrator&gt;"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="&lt;secret_access_key from aws administrator&gt;"
</code></pre><h2 id="2-installing-terraform">2. Installing Terraform</h2>
<p>Depending on your operating system, you may choose one of the following methods to install Terraform on your computer:</p>
<p>Ubuntu &gt;= 18.04:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo snap install terraform 
</code></pre><p>Ubuntu &lt; 18.04:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo apt-get install terraform
</code></pre><p>OSX with Homebrew:</p>
<pre><code>$ brew install terraform
</code></pre><p>For Microsoft Windows users, you may use the Chocolatey package manager and use this command:</p>
<pre><code>$ choco install terraform
</code></pre><p>Once you have Terraform installed, you may validate the installation by using this command:</p>
<pre><code>$ terraform --version

Terraform v0.11.11

Your version of Terraform is out of date! The latest version
is 0.12.26. You can update by downloading from www.terraform.io/downloads.html

</code></pre><h2 id="3-writing-terraform-code">3. Writing Terraform Code</h2>
<p>To start with a Terraform project, create a new directory for this project that will contain all the Terraform code that we will be writing shortly. In this example, we will create a directory called <code>hello-terraform-aws-ec2</code> and change working directory to it.</p>
<p>In this directory, create a new file called <code>providers.tf</code> and type the following code into it:</p>
<pre><code>provider "aws" {
  region = "ap-southeast-1"
}
</code></pre><p>The code above specifies that Terraform will be provisioning resources on AWS (provider), specifically on <code>ap-southeast-1</code> region.</p>
<p>Next, we will create file called <code>main.tf</code>. As the name implies, this is our main file that will contain most of our implementation code. In this instance, write the following code into this file:</p>
<pre><code>resource "aws_instance" "myweb" {
  ami           = "ami-0e763a959ec839f5e"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "AkuDev"
  }
}
</code></pre><p>The code above specifies a set of instructions to Terraform to create a new EC2 instance <code>aws_instance</code>, using the Ubuntu 18.04 LTS machine image <code>ami-0e763a959ec839f5e</code> with the instance type of <code>t2.micro</code>. Finally, we are asking Terraform to name this new instance as <code>AkuDev</code></p>
<p>You may find the complete list of <code>ami-id</code> provided by Ubuntu on <a href="https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/locator/ec2/">Amazon EC2 AMI Locator</a>. You can see on the illustration below:</p>
<p><img src="https://aku.dev/images/post/create_aws_ec2_instance_with_terraform/img-1a.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Some versions might not be displayed due to the release cycle from Ubuntu itself. Another way to locate your preferred <code>ami-id</code> is by using AWS CLI. You may learn further on how to locate <code>ami-id</code> from <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/finding-an-ami.html">Finding a Linux AMI</a></p>
<p>To explore the full list of Terraform commands and what does each of them do, you may simply type <code>terraform help</code> on your terminal:</p>
<p><img src="https://aku.dev/images/post/create_aws_ec2_instance_with_terraform/img-2.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="4-running-terraform-code">4. Running Terraform Code</h2>
<p>Under the project directory, we have to initialize our Terraform task by using the following command:</p>
<pre><code>$ terraform init
</code></pre><p>The command above will perform necessary tasks such as downloading Terraform Plugin that your code will need to work with some cloud providers such as AWS.</p>
<p><img src="https://aku.dev/images/post/create_aws_ec2_instance_with_terraform/img-1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>After the initialization step is completed, we have to plan our Terraform tasks by using the following command:</p>
<pre><code>$ terraform plan
</code></pre><p><img src="https://aku.dev/images/post/create_aws_ec2_instance_with_terraform/img-4.png" alt=""></p>
<p>By planning Terraform tasks, you are able to verify the actions that will be performed by Terraform before the actual change is executed. For example, you will see the details of your EC2 instance even before the instance is created by Terraform on your infrastructure.</p>
<p>Once you have verified the changes about to take place, you may apply the task by using the following command:</p>
<pre><code>$ terraform apply
</code></pre><p>The <code>apply</code> command will execute the actual task, therefore it may take some time because it will need to communicate with AWS in order to provision the EC2 instance via HTTP connection.</p>
<p><img src="https://aku.dev/images/post/create_aws_ec2_instance_with_terraform/img-8.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="5-check-the-result">5. Check the Result</h2>
<p>Once Terraform tasks have been applied, you may verify if the EC2 instance is created correctly by logging on to AWS Console.</p>
<p><img src="https://aku.dev/images/post/create_aws_ec2_instance_with_terraform/img-9.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://aku.dev/images/post/create_aws_ec2_instance_with_terraform/img-10.png" alt=""></p>
<p>By default, if we don’t specify VPC for our EC2 instance, Terraform will provision your instance on the <code>Default VPC</code>. You may see that on this illustration:</p>
<p><img src="https://aku.dev/images/post/create_aws_ec2_instance_with_terraform/img-10a.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You may further verify that in VPC console and check the <code>vpc-id</code> with id of <code>Default VPC</code> there:</p>
<p><img src="https://aku.dev/images/post/create_aws_ec2_instance_with_terraform/img-10b.png" alt=""></p>
<p>To destroy the EC2 instance that you have just created, you can simply issue the following <code>destroy</code> command:</p>
<pre><code>$ terraform destroy
</code></pre><p><img src="https://aku.dev/images/post/create_aws_ec2_instance_with_terraform/img-11.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="6-other-terraform-powerful-features">6. Other Terraform Powerful Features</h2>
<p>In this section, we will explore other powerful features from Terraform that we can apply in our use case.</p>
<h3 id="a-create-multiple-ec2-instances-with-count-parameter">A. Create multiple EC2 instances with count parameter</h3>
<p>By using <code>count</code> keyword, we can create multiple EC2 instance of the same type. By adding <code>count</code> on our previous example, the script will create 3 instances of the same type:</p>
<pre><code>resource "aws_instance" "myweb" {
  ami           = "ami-0e763a959ec839f5e"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  count = 3

  tags = {
    Name = "AkuDev"
  }
}
</code></pre><p>This feature is particularly useful when creating identical instances such as Kubernetes nodes, MariaDB nodes, PostgreSQL nodes, etc.</p>
<p>As before, let’s plan the execution:</p>
<pre><code>$ terraform plan

Refreshing Terraform state in-memory prior to plan...
The refreshed state will be used to calculate this plan, but will not be
persisted to local or remote state storage.

aws_instance.myweb[0]: Refreshing state... (ID: i-0eb854f76e85be362)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

....

      tags.%:                       "1"
      tags.Name:                    "AkuDev"
      tenancy:                      &lt;computed&gt;
      volume_tags.%:                &lt;computed&gt;
      vpc_security_group_ids.#:     &lt;computed&gt;


Plan: 2 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

</code></pre><p>As you can see from the output above, since we already have one instance created earlier, Terraform will only provision another two instances from that script. Now let’s apply the script:</p>
<pre><code>$ terraform apply

....

      tags.Name:                    "AkuDev"
      tenancy:                      &lt;computed&gt;
      volume_tags.%:                &lt;computed&gt;
      vpc_security_group_ids.#:     &lt;computed&gt;


Plan: 2 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value: yes

....

aws_instance.myweb[1]: Creation complete after 25s (ID: i-01eb80188a8de15bd)
aws_instance.myweb[2]: Creation complete after 25s (ID: i-0fa3b893590d3f9bf)

Apply complete! Resources: 2 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

</code></pre><p>From the output above, we could see that another two instances are created under a minute as soon as we applied the script. You may verify this on your EC2 Dashboard. Pretty easy!</p>
<p><img src="https://aku.dev/images/post/create_aws_ec2_instance_with_terraform/img-12.png" alt=""></p>
<p>If you don’t need these instances anymore, you may delete those instances by using <code>terraform destroy</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ terraform destroy

An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  - destroy

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  - aws_instance.myweb[0]

  - aws_instance.myweb[1]

  - aws_instance.myweb[2]


Plan: 0 to add, 0 to change, 3 to destroy.

Do you really want to destroy all resources?
  Terraform will destroy all your managed infrastructure, as shown above.
  There is no undo. Only 'yes' will be accepted to confirm.

  Enter a value: yes

....

aws_instance.myweb[1]: Destruction complete after 32s
aws_instance.myweb[2]: Destruction complete after 32s
aws_instance.myweb[0]: Destruction complete after 32s

Destroy complete! Resources: 3 destroyed.

</code></pre><p>We are done with provisioning multiple instances, now let’s try another trick in the next section.</p>
<h3 id="b-accessing-the-instance-via-ssh">B. Accessing the instance via SSH</h3>
<p>In order to access the instance remotely, we typically use SSH to access it. So how do we achieve that using Terraform?
First, you need to create <code>key-pairs</code> to let the instance recognize you as an authorized user. First, go to EC2 dashboard. Then, find <code>Key Pairs</code> menu on the left sidebar.</p>
<p><img src="https://aku.dev/images/post/create_aws_ec2_instance_with_terraform/img-13a.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Create a <code>pem</code> file to use it over OpenSSH if your workstation is running OpenSSH instead of PuTTY.</p>
<p><img src="https://aku.dev/images/post/create_aws_ec2_instance_with_terraform/img-13b.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Your key pairs are ready, you can download it to your workstation.</p>
<p><img src="https://aku.dev/images/post/create_aws_ec2_instance_with_terraform/img-13c.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Once you have your key pairs, you have to attach it to your Terraform script within your instance resource. Under <code>aws_instance</code> resource, you could specify <code>key_name</code> to attach your key pair into your EC2 instance. As a best practice, you should limit CIDR blocks to your allowed IP addresses only, for example limiting the access to the machine only from your workstation or IP addresses from your office.</p>
<p>Here is the example of <code>main.tf</code> that contains the configuration to allow the EC2 instance to be accessed over SSH:</p>
<pre><code>resource "aws_security_group" "allow_ssh" {
  name        = "allow_ssh"
  description = "Allow ssh inbound traffic"
  vpc_id = "vpc-19efe07e"

  ingress {
    from_port   = 22
    to_port     = 22
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["203.210.84.220/32"]
  }
}

resource "aws_instance" "myweb" {
  ami           = "ami-0e763a959ec839f5e"
  instance_type …</code></pre></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I noticed that some Kubernetes admins/developers do not configure encrypted communication between Cloudflare and their Kubernetes cluster because they consider that as not necessary. But I wouldn’t take Cloudflare’s proxy for granted, it always better to secure as much as you can. So I have written this article to guide you to encrypt the communication between Cloudflare and your Kubernetes cluster and also make it simpler.</p>
<h2 id="Objective"><a href="#Objective" title="Objective"></a>Objective</h2><p>We are going to take the following setup, where traffic between the Cloudflare and the cluster is unencrypted.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.gokulakrishna.com/img/blog-2/image-1.png" alt="localhost"></p>
<p>And implement the following setup, where the traffic is encrypted between the Cloudflare and the cluster.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.gokulakrishna.com/img/blog-2/image-2.png" alt="localhost"></p>
<p>Steps to do it</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Login to your Cloudflare Dashboard. Select a domain; this domain name will be the primary domain to communicate between Cloudflare and your cluster. Click on SSL/TLS Icon and the select origin server. Choose the following parameters:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.gokulakrishna.com/img/blog-2/image-3.png" alt="localhost"></p>
</li>
<li><p>Once done click next; on the next page, you will see the private and public key. Save the origin-certificate with a name of your choice. I chose site.cert and Private key as site.key.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Create a TLS secret on your cluster using the following command.</p>
<p>kubectl create secret tls my-site-cert –key site.key –cert site.cert</p>
</li>
<li><p>Create config in traefik to use this cert.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="Extending-to-other-domain-names"><a href="#Extending-to-other-domain-names" title="Extending to other domain names"></a>Extending to other domain names</h2><p>Now with this setup, you can handle multiple domain names. Let’s say you now have a site with sample.com. You add it as a CNAME record to the above endpoint that you have set.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Switch to another domain on Cloudflare.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Add a record with target as the record that you have set previously. In my case (cluster-loadbalancer.gokulakrishna.com).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Make sure encryption mode is full.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.gokulakrishna.com/img/blog-2/image-4.png" alt="localhost"></p>
<p>Note that if any part of the communication is not encrypted the request might fail</p>
</li>

July 8, 2020 | https://nicolodavis.com/blog/typescript-to-rust/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://nicolodavis.com/blog/typescript-to-rust/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I recently decided to switch the engine of
<a href="https://boardgamelab.app/">Boardgame Lab</a> from TypeScript
to Rust. The application itself is an SPA written in Svelte.
I only switched the logic that updates the game state to Rust.
Here is a summary of my experience with the transition:</p><h2>Isomorphic Architecture</h2><p>One of the advantages of using JavaScript or TypeScript is
that you can run the same code on both client and server.
For <a href="https://boardgamelab.app/">Boardgame Lab</a>, this means
that the game state can be updated independently on both sides.
This results in a lag-free experience on the client
while still using the server as the authoritative source of
data.</p><p>With <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> taking off, you can get the same advantage
writing Rust. Instead of pushing client-side code to the server, we push server-side code to the client by compiling Rust
to WebAssembly.</p><p>This <a href="https://github.com/wasm-tool/rollup-plugin-rust">Rollup</a>
plugin allows you to import a <em>Cargo.toml</em> file into your
TypeScript codebase, allowing a seamless integration between
Rust and TypeScript code. The dev experience is almost as smooth
as writing TypeScript itself (for example, the browser refreshes
automatically when you change a line of Rust code).</p><p><a href="https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen">wasm-bindgen</a>
facilitates serialization of Rust structs into JSON objects
and vice-versa.</p><h2>Limitations of TypeScript</h2><p>Coding in TypeScript has been a largely pleasant experience,
but switching to Rust immediately brought to light some of the
limitations of TypeScript.</p><h4>Strict Typing</h4><p>TypeScript is more of a type-hinter than a type-checker.
It primarily ensures that you’re not accessing fields that
you aren’t declaring via the type system (which is quite expressive). It also enables nicer autocomplete for your IDE.</p><p>However, it does not actually ensure that the data you are
manipulating corresponds to the type that you have declared
to represent it. For example, the data might contain <strong>additional fields</strong> or
even <strong>incorrect</strong> values for declared types.</p><h4>Data Validation</h4><p>You have to write data validation code to ensure that you’re
operating on correct data in TypeScript. You get this for
free in Rust, which will throw an error if you parse data
that doesn’t line up with the struct that is to hold it in
memory.</p><h4>Error Handling</h4><p>Rust’s <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch06-02-match.html">pattern matching</a> and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch09-02-recoverable-errors-with-result.html">error handling</a> make it easy to
handle every code path that could result in an error, leading
to very robust code.</p><p>This leads to a great degree of confidence that if it compiles,
it’s probably not going to throw an error at runtime.</p><h2>Performance</h2><h4>WebAssembly is faster than JavaScript</h4><p>The initial rewrite without any performance optimizations
is already faster than the previous TypeScript codebase.
This doesn’t matter too much yet, but
<a href="https://boardgamelab.app/">Boardgame Lab</a> will eventually
ship with bots, so the performance will matter once
game trees need to be searched.</p><h4>The Rust server is leaner</h4><p>The multiplayer server receives updates from clients via
WebSockets and then:</p><ul><li>Updates its copy of the game state.</li><li>Broadcasts the client update to other clients.</li></ul><p>The previous server used <a href="https://github.com/websockets/ws">ws</a>, a popular library for NodeJS. The new version uses <a href="https://github.com/seanmonstar/warp">Warp</a> (Rust), which uses less memory
under the same load.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Overall, I’m pretty happy with the switch. I haven’t really
encountered much resistance from the borrow checker despite
being fairly new to Rust (I come from a C++ background, so
maybe that helps).</p></div></div>]]>

<p>In a palm-fringed, sunny bay in Panama, a revolution is taking place. This is the location of the first SeaPod manufacturing facility, where around 30 single family SeaPods are being pieced together from 3D-printed molds and lifted onto their foundations just over a kilometre from the shoreline.</p>
<p>The plan is that these will be self-sufficient homes that power themselves, produce their own hydroponic food and electricity, handle their own wastewater treatment, and even be fitted with an underwater coral nursery to support marine life. Air and water drones will courier trash, recycling, packages, food delivery and emergency medical support like defibrillators and medicine.</p>
<p>This is not science-fiction. If all goes ahead, by late Fall this year, Linton Bay Marina in Panama will house the first residential seasteading community in the world. </p>
<p>Seasteading, the concept of creating permanent dwellings at sea outside the territory claimed by any government, is not new, but some examples more credible than others. For instance, in the 1960's the founder of The Church of Scientology based much of the group's executive leadership on seasteads, before moving them back to land in the 1970's. In his 1992 book <em>The Millennial Project; Colonizing the Galaxy in Eight Easy Steps,</em> <a title="Marshall Savage" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Savage">Marshall Savage</a> discussed building tethered <a title="Artificial island" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_island">artificial islands.</a>  </p>
<p> <img height="501" width="890" src="https://www.bllnr.com/images/cache/86199cf33beb4e1e21cb4a752200ef37_w890.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Artisanopolis concept for the Seasteading Institute (c) Gabriel Scheare, Luke Lourdes Crowley and Patrick White</p>
<p>But recently the concept has gained traction with a more serious school of thought. In April 2019, the concept of floating cities as a way to cope with rising oceans was included in a presentation by the United Nations program UN-Habitat. In addition, a Dutch pro-choice non-profit named <a href="https://www.womenonwaves.org/en/">Women on Waves</a> uses seasteading as a way to circumnavigate abortion laws, using a commissioned ship that contains a specially constructed mobile clinic, the A-Portable. When WoW visits a country, women make appointments for an abortion or other reproductive health service, and are taken on board the ship. The ship then sails out approximately 12 miles to international waters where Dutch laws are in effect on board ships registered in the Netherlands.<sup id="cite_ref-5"></sup></p>
<p>This particular seastead in Panama is the brainchild of <a href="https://ocean.builders/about/">Ocean Builders</a>, a company co-founded by Silicon Valley bitcoin entrepreneur Chad Elwartowski, former Navy aeronautical engineer Rüdiger Koch and software developer Grant Romundt. This is not the first attempt at creating a long-term residential community. It came close, last year, when Elwartowski and his partner Supranee Thepdet moved into the first floating, octagonal seastead 12 miles off the coast of Phuket, Thailand.</p>
<p>They lived there for around two months, but after a video of them drinking champagne and inviting others to "join their ocean community" was published online, the Royal Thai Navy sent out a crew to remove their seastead as "a threat to Thai sovereignty". Elwartowski and his partner had already fled after a tip-off from a friend. </p>
<p>Two years prior, a floating island building company called <a href="https://www.blue-frontiers.com/en/">Blue Frontiers,</a> had signed a memorandum of understanding with French Polynesia to create the first semi-autonomous "seazone" for a prototype in 2017, not least on the grounds of fast-rising sea-levels as a potential life-line to hedge against global warming. But the project was later shelved indefinitely after local protests. </p>
<p><img height="593" width="890" src="https://www.bllnr.com/images/cache/decd3a2ab1d05af8f8461db5097bbe83_w890.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The seastead that was home to Chad Elwartowski and his partner Supranee Thepdet</p>
<p>This time, in Panama, they have the full support of the government, says Ocean Builders CEO Grant Romundt, over a Zoom call. "We will be working closely with Panama to identify any legal matters related to our floating homes. We wish to pursue a flagging system so that owners of the homes can hold a title and claim ownership of their new home fully backed by the legal system of Panama."</p>
<p>An advertisement on the Ocean Builders website is recruiting people to join the growing community, “entrepreneurs, aquapreneurs, technology enthusiasts, electronics hackers, marine biologists and other people that are passionate about developing new products and services that a city on the ocean would need.” </p>
<p>The 3D printer they are using to create the molds for the homes is huge, 20 feet by 16 feet, to build details down to the millimeter. The current pod design is engineered for 5 meter waves as the pods float about 2.5 meters above the waves, similar to an oil rig. The design for the SeaPods came from Dutch architect Koen Olthuis of Water Studio, an established designer of floating homes. </p>
<p>"We really don't feel waves like a normal boat would which is floating in the turbulent surface of the water, and when we go further out to sea we can scale our designs to withstand larger waves," says Romundt. Ocean Builders is working towards 3D printing the entire floating home which may take years of research and development. In the meantime, SeaPods are molded from 3D printed molds in a combination of plastic and foam and then covered with fiberglass. The Pods have an outer shell made of a white gel coat. On the interior, owners can choose between gel coat or a Corian artificial stone surface from Dupont.</p>
<p>During the first phase of sales, according to Romundt, the primary focus will be on tourism and businesses, through 'SeaBnBs', time shares and rentals. "We want as many people to experience our new homes as possible," he adds. </p>
<p><img height="501" width="890" src="https://www.bllnr.com/images/cache/86199cf33beb4e1e21cb4a752200ef37_w890.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Legalities</strong></p>
<p>Every land-based country has their own rules on how long they consider a person needs to be in their country to be deemed a resident of their country, either for legal, tax, health insurance or other purposes. But seasteading countries would be free of that obligation, said Romundt. "There is no requirement for how long someone would need to live on a seastead to be deemed a resident of that community." </p>
<p>To be considered as a country, a seasteading community would likely fly a maritime flag of a country similar to how boats are flagged under a country. This would give them some legal protections as they would theoretically be seen as a part of the country they are flagged under, explained Romundt. To be completely outside of a governments' jurisdiction a seasteading community would need to be 200 miles from land.</p>
<p>According to the non-profit think tank, the Seasteading Institute, many seasteading proponents are fed up with their country's outdated laws and welcome the idea to rewrite the rulebook for the 21st Century. </p>
<p>"The challenge with old governments is that obsolete laws don’t go away as fast as new laws are created. For instance, <a href="https://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2016/Bills/A9999/5169_I1.HTM" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">a law that all horses on the highway must wear sleigh bells was not repealed in New Jersey until 2017</a>," said President of the Seasteading Institute, Joe Quirk.</p>
<p>"We need legal systems to evolve as rapidly as the cultures and technologies they govern, and Seasteading is a technology to accelerate the process by which smart laws are developed and dumb laws are deleted. Special Economic Zones are areas within existing countries that are given unique regulatory systems to increase prosperity. Think of them as legal islands created on land. <a href="https://unctad.org/en/PublicationsLibrary/wir2019_en.pdf" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">There are more than 4000 around the world, including more than 250 in the US</a>," he added. </p>
<p>Tom W. Bell, a professor of law at Chapman University, wrote a book proposing a new kind of Special Economic Zone known as a SeaZone, which will take the lessons learned from land-based zones and apply them in a floating zone. He said in the book, "Governments across the globe have begun evolving from lumbering bureaucracies into smaller, more agile special jurisdictions - common-interest developments, special economic zones, and proprietary cites. Private providers increasingly deliver services that political authorities formerly monopolized, inspiring greater competition and efficiency, to the satisfaction of citizens-qua-consumers. These trends suggest that new networks of special jurisdictions will soon surpass nation states in the same way that networked computers replaced mainframes."</p>
<p>While this is all good in an ideal, libertarian world, argues Emma Lindsay, a New York-based partner at international law firm Withers, escaping the nation state is difficult, even on the high seas, and in fact the laws of several countries could apply.  </p>
<p>She adds: "<span lang="EN-US">Individuals are subject to the laws of their state(s) of nationality no matter where they are. While not all of a state’s laws apply outside its territory, many do. The laws of the flag state of the seastead also apply.  All seagoing vessels are registered or licensed in a flag state which is deemed the nationality of the vessel. Panama is the world’s largest flag state by far.  Seasteaders also could be subject to the laws of any state that is harmed by their activities at sea, such as by pollution of surrounding waters. The current negotiation of a new UN treaty on conservation and sustainable use of the high seas has increased attention globally on this issue."</span></p>
<p>Withers is advising High Seas Alliance in its advocacy with states and other stakeholders negotiating the new treaty in New York.</p>

<p> <strong>Life In A Tax Haven</strong></p>
<p>The homes in Panama will be located in an anchorage close to a marina in calm, protected waters, as part of a trial run for a community further away in future. This allows for getting accustomed to living on the water while still being able to travel on land having easy access to groceries, supplies and the airport. Each home will be fitted with solar panels, a water filtration system and hydroponic farming to aim for as much self-sufficiency as possible.</p>
<p>One reason for trialling the concept in Panama is that it is a pure tax haven, meaning that it imposes no income, corporate, …</p></div></div>

It doesn’t have a sharp blade, an open flame, or jagged shrapnel. And it’s not dangerous because a bright orange sign proclaimed it so; but precisely the opposite. <em>Invisible</em> goes under the radar and over our heads, engaging no defenses and no fight-or-flight moment.</p><p id="viewer-3emtj">Because <em>invisible</em> doesn’t invoke urgency, less visible matters naturally seem distant, even nonexistent. What’ll get first dibs on my attention — the Amazon rainforest burning for months on end, or the candle burning in my living room? Probably the candle; not because it’s more <em>important</em> than the rainforest, but because it’s more readily <em>visible</em>.</p><p id="viewer-8hggc"><span>Visibility almost never exists on a level playing field. Why is SkyMall staring you in the face on a long flight? And why is Starbucks conveniently placed on the morning-commute-heavy side of the road? Particularly in commercial spaces, what you </span><em>see </em><span>is rarely coincidence. At any given moment, more than a few brands bid fiercely for your eyes — whether via the “</span><a href="https://www.cstoreproductsonline.com/general-merchandise/hitting-consumer-strike-zone" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strike zone</a><span>” of convenience store shelves, the head of your search results, or slices of your Instagram timeline. So visibility becomes a point of leverage for those with capital —</span><strong>a differentiator between </strong><em><strong>winners </strong></em><strong>and </strong><em><strong>losers</strong></em><span>.</span></p><div id="viewer-vfg6"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.home.vujade.world/post/out-of-sight-out-of-mind" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6ec45c_907433be8cb24d2a96f9f8be149bdaaf~mv2.jpeg/v1/fit/w_400,h_353,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6ec45c_907433be8cb24d2a96f9f8be149bdaaf~mv2.jpeg/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.jpeg"></p><svg viewBox="0 0 19 19"><path d="M15.071 8.371V4.585l-4.355 4.356a.2.2 0 01-.283 0l-.374-.374a.2.2 0 010-.283l4.356-4.355h-3.786a.2.2 0 01-.2-.2V3.2c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2H16v5.371a.2.2 0 01-.2.2h-.529a.2.2 0 01-.2-.2zm-6.5 6.9v.529a.2.2 0 01-.2.2H3v-5.371c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2h.529c.11 0 .2.09.2.2v3.786l4.355-4.356a.2.2 0 01.283 0l.374.374a.2.2 0 010 .283L4.585 15.07h3.786c.11 0 .2.09.2.2z"></path></svg></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-ads28"><a href="http://www.joehollier.com/fiveonthat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a></p><p id="viewer-e7ps3">Let’s rewind back to the candle and the rainforest. Who’s the winner there? For starters, it’s the company that sold me the candle. And as winners, they’re inclined to preserve the conditions that let them win. So the immense supply chain that turned crude oil, glass, and paper into a delightful candle (probably clearcutting a rainforest along the way) is deliberately made opaque to regulators and consumers like me. In other words, the <em>box</em> is kept <em>black</em>. With diminished visibility, the loser — the rainforest — is subject to further disadvantage. Thus, <strong>the black box preserves the existing divide between winners and losers.</strong></p><p id="viewer-fq9n4">But if you look a little closer, the winner-loser divide isn’t so black and white. Obviously I, as the owner of the candle, benefit from its black-boxedness. I can fill my living room with citrus blossom fragrances, blissfully ignorant of the polluted air it sends into the lungs of people and animals closer to the candle’s production. And though I may claim to support ecological policy reform, thereby aligning with the loser, my consumption choices say otherwise.</p><div id="viewer-602v0"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.home.vujade.world/post/out-of-sight-out-of-mind" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6ec45c_83100eafdb1a4ead944746138bb13165~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_600,h_316,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6ec45c_83100eafdb1a4ead944746138bb13165~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.jpg"></p><svg viewBox="0 0 19 19"><path d="M15.071 8.371V4.585l-4.355 4.356a.2.2 0 01-.283 0l-.374-.374a.2.2 0 010-.283l4.356-4.355h-3.786a.2.2 0 01-.2-.2V3.2c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2H16v5.371a.2.2 0 01-.2.2h-.529a.2.2 0 01-.2-.2zm-6.5 6.9v.529a.2.2 0 01-.2.2H3v-5.371c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2h.529c.11 0 .2.09.2.2v3.786l4.355-4.356a.2.2 0 01.283 0l.374.374a.2.2 0 010 .283L4.585 15.07h3.786c.11 0 .2.09.2.2z"></path></svg></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-9pmb0"><a href="http://www.joehollier.com/fiveonthat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a></p><h2 id="viewer-amq0v">Defense mechanisms</h2><p id="viewer-blqmb">Cognitive dissonance is inescapable in a world of black boxes. While they’re often vital to societal functioning — like the black box of democracy, as discussed in <a href="https://vujadeworld.substack.com/p/tangled" target="_blank" rel="noopener">part two</a> — they’re not necessarily moral. Underneath their murky surfaces, we know, are plenty of things we don’t want to see. But since our very lifestyles have molded around them, exposing their inner workings would threaten the way we live. To ward off anxiety and guilt, we construct defense mechanisms (on individual <em>and</em> societal scales).</p><p id="viewer-4nhpg">Take, for example, the moment you dispose of a piece of trash. From the moment it hits the bottom of the bin, a massive system comes to life — of garbage trucks, dumpsters, street cleaners, sanitation centers, and landfills — to whisk it out of your life as quickly as it came in. Or, it just lands on the side of the road…</p><p id="viewer-7h8d">In any case, our products <em>come from</em> and <em>return to</em> a sort of <strong>mental nowhereland</strong>; a cavity for unspoken thoughts to fester: “<em>this doesn’t exist after I’m done with it</em>,” or taken further, “<em>the Earth is abundant</em>.” Of course, these aren’t explicit views in our minds; they occupy the <em>negative space</em> — like shadows, or lies.</p><div id="viewer-a3v8v"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.home.vujade.world/post/out-of-sight-out-of-mind" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6ec45c_ac3ced2b99534923a938a3d3c2c9b5e5~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1418,h_1418,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6ec45c_ac3ced2b99534923a938a3d3c2c9b5e5~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png"></p><svg viewBox="0 0 19 19"><path d="M15.071 8.371V4.585l-4.355 4.356a.2.2 0 01-.283 0l-.374-.374a.2.2 0 010-.283l4.356-4.355h-3.786a.2.2 0 01-.2-.2V3.2c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2H16v5.371a.2.2 0 01-.2.2h-.529a.2.2 0 01-.2-.2zm-6.5 6.9v.529a.2.2 0 01-.2.2H3v-5.371c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2h.529c.11 0 .2.09.2.2v3.786l4.355-4.356a.2.2 0 01.283 0l.374.374a.2.2 0 010 .283L4.585 15.07h3.786c.11 0 .2.09.2.2z"></path></svg></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-b0mtt"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BhA8Dhejk9l/?igshid=18a1vwb87761x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a></p><p id="viewer-eued3">And this is just for lifeless products.

Landfills become prisons. We thrust our pesky challenges as far as possible from the cozy suburbs, and guard them with barbed wire and strict visitation rules. Behind bars, we lock away the questions we don’t want to ask, as well as the societal shortcomings that made those bars necessary.</p><p id="viewer-aa1kn">And like the candle/rainforest scenario, these black boxes produce winners and losers. Those in charge would like you to think that <em>you</em> — Mr. or Mrs. Upstanding Citizen — are the only winner. You can drive by inmates picking up trash on the side of the road, permitted to think: “<em>those people belong there</em>.” But as they pick up the scraps put there by people like you, the more complicated truth remains deep in a black box.

They are institutional voids, which perpetuate the same invisibilities that produced them. In the process, they carve out a negative space of shadows, lies, and unasked questions. And as this negative space crystallizes, <em>power</em> is encoded into <em>narrative</em>. <strong>Stories, after all, are the strongest defense mechanisms we have</strong>.</p><h2 id="viewer-bd1j1">The glass slipper</h2><p id="viewer-dnank">If <em>defense mechanisms</em> work best when they’re <em>invisible</em>, and <em>invisible is dangerous</em>, then what does that say about <em>stories</em>? That they’re <em>dangerous</em>? Well, sort of. <strong>Stories are most dangerous when they’re</strong> <em><strong>invisible</strong></em>.</p><p id="viewer-dfbfb">In their refined, packaged-up formats, stories are relatively benign. The danger in Disney fairy tales, for instance, stems from the societal narratives surrounding them — which they subtly reinforce. <em>Cinderella</em>, the movie, isn’t the problem; it’s the broader story of femininity, and the impossible challenge of fitting into the “glass slipper” of male expectations.</p><p id="viewer-63p5o">The symbols and mythology of a story, while potential tools for relaying the real issues at hand, also run the risk of obscuring those same issues. As a result, a story itself can be a sort of glass slipper. Beautiful, yet rigid; prompting conformity under the guise of transparency.</p><div id="viewer-b3cqt"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.home.vujade.world/post/out-of-sight-out-of-mind" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6ec45c_2f350a6be9ea43bea2bed514c28e560a~mv2.gif/v1/fit/w_500,h_273,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6ec45c_2f350a6be9ea43bea2bed514c28e560a~mv2.gif"></p><svg viewBox="0 0 19 19"><path d="M15.071 8.371V4.585l-4.355 4.356a.2.2 0 01-.283 0l-.374-.374a.2.2 0 010-.283l4.356-4.355h-3.786a.2.2 0 01-.2-.2V3.2c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2H16v5.371a.2.2 0 01-.2.2h-.529a.2.2 0 01-.2-.2zm-6.5 6.9v.529a.2.2 0 01-.2.2H3v-5.371c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2h.529c.11 0 .2.09.2.2v3.786l4.355-4.356a.2.2 0 01.283 0l.374.374a.2.2 0 010 .283L4.585 15.07h3.786c.11 0 .2.09.2.2z"></path></svg></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-39jn9">Because they’re so easy to perpetuate, stories are the most manipulative of all black boxes. And the protective shell of narrative too often lets injustice off the hook. <strong>If the&nbsp;<em>content</em>&nbsp;of a story doesn’t adequately address its</strong> <strong><em>context</em>, a black box has been formed.</strong> These narrative black boxes, like the prison and the landfill, only reaffirm the conditions that produced them in the first place.</p><p id="viewer-9n9s0">Mark Zuckerberg famously <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Facebook_Effect" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>: “A squirrel dying in front of your house may be more relevant to your interests right now than people dying in Africa.” Albeit tone-deaf rhetorically (such as his default to <em>dying</em> and <em>Africa</em>), this is, in fact, a <em>story</em>. And it’s not actually about squirrels, nor people in Africa.</p><p id="viewer-9csne">On the surface-level, it seems reminiscent of the candle/rainforest analogy — illustrating how we naturally prioritize what’s <em>visible</em> over what’s <em>important</em>. But Zuckerberg’s subtext is covertly self-reflexive. Visibility, according to the story, sits outside his locus of control. By focusing on a narrowly-defined “relevance” to our “interests,” he implies that all Facebook does is reflect our own natural tendencies. In a sly erasure of context, the squirrel analogy obscures Facebook’s troll-under-the-bridge role: how levied allotment of visibility is their entire profit model.</p><p id="viewer-dg8pl">If history is written by the victors, then <strong>stories are told by the winners</strong>. So behind every story, and thus behind every black box, there’s a winner. And the BIG winners — like Facebook, Google, and Amazon — not only tell stories, but they run the bidding wars for visibility itself. Space, whether on a shelf or a timeline, is fought for exclusively by those on the <em>outside</em> of the black box.</p><div id="viewer-9pui"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.home.vujade.world/post/out-of-sight-out-of-mind" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6ec45c_ddef68de436249d8b3a7f9f9b4ab7580~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1382,h_1382,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6ec45c_ddef68de436249d8b3a7f9f9b4ab7580~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png"></p><svg viewBox="0 0 19 19"><path d="M15.071 8.371V4.585l-4.355 4.356a.2.2 0 01-.283 0l-.374-.374a.2.2 0 010-.283l4.356-4.355h-3.786a.2.2 0 01-.2-.2V3.2c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2H16v5.371a.2.2 0 01-.2.2h-.529a.2.2 0 01-.2-.2zm-6.5 6.9v.529a.2.2 0 01-.2.2H3v-5.371c0-.11.09-.2.2-.2h.529c.11 0 .2.09.2.2v3.786l4.355-4.356a.2.2 0 01.283 0l.374.374a.2.2 0 010 .283L4.585 15.07h3.786c.11 0 .2.09.2.2z"></path></svg></div></div></div></div><h6 id="viewer-9h5iv"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5n1R8XJr83/?igshid=uzunevirh3bo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image source</a></h6><p id="viewer-i4hr">But now, the black boxes that have cocooned us for so long are beginning to crack.

        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Online abuse of trust is one of the topics I’ve studied deeply, including significant work toward an unfinished <a href="https://levien.com/thesis/thesis.pdf">PhD</a>, and over two years working on a spam and abuse team at Google. These days my main work is on 2D graphics, but seeing patterns of misinformation about Covid-19 is bringing back interest and motivation to think about these topics.</p>

<p>As Covid-19 has been unfolding, I’ve spent significant time and energy trying to understand it, as I tend to do with threats in general. In so doing, I’ve developed some insight on how to tune media consumption patterns towards more truthful content and less misinformation.</p>

<h2 id="america-is-broken">America is broken</h2>

<p>The astonishingly poor national response to Covid-19 is heartbreaking. Given our incredible richness of resources, it is surprising that many of the failure modes resemble those from low-income countries: superstition, cult of personality, suppression of science, and straight up corruption. A common thread is misinformation and disinformation.</p>

<p>Our response to Covid-19 has been very much like driving a car with poorly-maintained brakes. We’ve done the equivalent of neglecting regular maintenance, ignoring the brake light on the dashboard, and choosing to not to pay attention to the squishy feeling of the brake pedal. It’s as if there’s a devil on our shoulder saying, “oh no, don’t get the brakes fixed, it might cost hundreds of dollars.”</p>

<p>I think it’s worth trying to understand <em>why</em> we’re in that position, but it’s beyond the scope of this blog post. Mass behavior of humans is pretty predictable, but individual choices can probably make some difference. I have no answers for those who <em>want</em> to listen to that devil (a big challenge in and of itself), but for those would prefer to listen to the angel instead, I have some tips.</p>

<h2 id="it-is-a-partisan-issue">It is a partisan issue</h2>

<p>I often see the plea “it is not a partisan issue” attached to factual arguments. I think this represents an aspiration: it <em>should</em> not be partisan. In 2020 America, the reality is that there is a powerful anti-science, anti-truth faction, and that faction makes up a large part of the composition of one of the political parties. It’s not 100% alignment, and I want to give credit where credit is due: for example, the moderate Republican governor of Massachusetts has embraced science and investment in public health, and the results in that state are one of the best in the country.</p>

<p>But in general, any factual argument that has bearing on a political question such as “should we invest in public health” or “should we restructure the economy away from carbon consumption” is now inherently partisan.</p>

<p>Much of the partisan content in media is around issues that are not very consequential, either pure entertainment, or (at least traditionally) between candidates or parties that have comparable ability to govern. I was hopeful that the life or death nature of Covid-19 would motivate the people who decide what appears in media to higher standards. But apparently, it’s just the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scorpion_and_the_Frog">nature of the scorpion</a>, they either can’t help themselves or just don’t care. Almost certainly, the media organization with the most blood on its hands is Fox News, which actively promotes an anti-health, pro-infection agenda. I don’t understand how they sleep at night.</p>

<p>Truth threatens a lot of existing power structures. If everybody woke up tomorrow and decided they were tired of being lied to, there would be seismic shifts of power. It’s worth thinking about who might be most affected by such a thing, and the kinds of things they do to keep it from happening.</p>

<h2 id="high-end-science-journalism">High-end science journalism</h2>

<p>I’m going to cover a range of information sources in this post, but there is a tl;dr: read up on actual science journalism by people who know what they’re talking about. Coverage by Science, Nature, and STAT News has been uniformly excellent. Good journalism is always teamwork, but I’ll also raise up the voices of particularly insightful individuals: <a href="https://twitter.com/sciencecohen">Jon Cohen</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/kakape">Kai Kupferschmidt</a> of Science, <a href="https://twitter.com/amymaxmen">Amy Maxmen</a> of Nature, <a href="https://twitter.com/HelenBranswell">Helen Branswell</a> of STAT News. These are science journalists who have invested years in honing their craft.</p>

<p>I’ve also been impressed by coverage in The Atlantic. Their science content is quite good (thanks to top-notch contributors such as <a href="https://twitter.com/edyong209">Ed Yong</a>), but they also put the science in the context of American culture and politics. It is for this reason, I believe, that our President has <a href="https://www.washingtonian.com/2020/05/27/the-atlantic-saw-subscriptions-surge-after-trump-tweet/">singled them out</a> for criticism.</p>

<p>It’s interesting that these sources tend to be publications that have been around for a while (STAT News is a brand of the Boston Globe media group). It’s not exactly rocket science how to do this, you just need to find experienced, capable writers and pay them to do journalism, with editorial and institutional support. But in today’s hyper-capitalist society, sustaining such efforts is a struggle. If you can, try to support publications that do good work by subscribing, or donating in the case of non-profits.</p>

<p>For someone with a limited budget of time and attention, good science journalism is absolutely the best bang for the buck. The other recommendations in this post are for people who want to spend a little more effort to gain, hopefully, a little more insight.</p>

<h2 id="twitter">Twitter</h2>

<p>By far the most interesting experience I’ve had has been Twitter. What makes Twitter unique is its extremely wide dynamic range of information quality: both the worst of the worst and the best of the best are well represented. (An example of an information source of low dynamic range is an encyclopedia: almost every article is pretty good, garbage and brilliance both being rare)</p>

<p>A well-curated Twitter feed is one of the best information sources available today, and following random people on Twitter is one of the worst.</p>

<p>Even though it has no formal structure such as subreddits, Twitter functions as a set of overlapping communities, often described as “X Twitter” or “Y Twitter” (incidentally, a good explanation of how communities work on Twitter can be had in Jeff Jarvis’ <a href="https://buzzmachine.com/2020/05/11/a-conversation-with-nathan-allebach-steak-umms-voice/">interview of the voice behind Steak-umm</a>). There are many experts who generously share their knowledge and thoughts with us, and I’ve found that with a modest investment of time, it’s possible to follow along.</p>

<p>In one of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCud8VIawWp17jKl2Lp0VvlQ">Jeff Jarvis interviews</a>, they jokingly referred to “idiot Twitter,” and, though it was a joke, the concept has stuck with me. Twitter, like all social media properties, works by engaging very large numbers of people with content that appeals emotionally. The expert communities are far too small a fraction of Twitter’s traffic to be profitable for them, but they support them as a way to maintain the prestige of the platform. The replies of any popular post are filled with all manner of conspiracy theory, miracle cure, denial, blame, and, I think at least sometimes, active disinformation by those who would do us harm (it’s hard to tell the difference and the outcome is the same). I think of all that as “idiot Twitter” and just do my best to avoid it. I also see it everywhere, of course, not just Twitter, and the quantity of it is a good measure of the value in a social media platform.</p>

<p>Twitter has a delicate balance to maintain, as there are many aspects of the site design that push you toward “idiot Twitter” even when you’re trying to curate your experience to avoid it. One example that consistently frustrates me is the trending panel, as that seems to be about half composed of idiot Twitter. It’s addictive, even so, because it tempts you with the thrill of discovering things early. I’ve also found that it’s easier to avoid junk on the desktop site than the mobile app. I’m worried the experience will degrade; Quora stands as a cautionary tale of what can happen to a relatively respectable site when they pursue clicks at the cost of all else.</p>

<p>Whether it would be viable to develop a social network designed for quality of discussion is another topic beyond this blog. I’m not especially hopeful on this front, as it’s hard to see how it would be profitable. In any case, there’s not much value in wishing for the possibly impossible, as somebody seeking quality information can find it even today.</p>

<h3 id="list-curation">List curation</h3>

<p>One of the interesting features of Twitter is that people will curate and share lists of people they feel are worth following. My <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1239639611694911489">covid-19 list</a> is one such, and a lot of thought went into it: I’ve intentionally included people with a wide range of expertise (including, for example, <a href="https://twitter.com/j_g_allen">Joseph Allen</a> for his insight into healthy buildings and <a href="https://twitter.com/uche_blackstock">Dr. Uché Blackstock</a> for expertise on health equity). I’ve also deliberately excluded people from this list who express strong political views or often use an emotional tone. Because of the latter criterion, it’s missing people I personally feel are worth listening to, especially <a href="https://twitter.com/gregggonsalves">Gregg Gonsalves</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/JeremyKonyndyk">Jeremy Konyndyk</a>. As always, your mileage may vary. The goal of this particular list is not to be comprehensive, it’s to select a set of voices that have excellent signal to noise ratio; for a much more comprehensive list, see <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1237834151694303234">this one curated by Jeff Jarvis</a>.</p>

<p>One phenomenon I’ve noticed is that people at the top of these lists tend to recommend each other. I wouldn’t be surprised if some automated evaluation (perhaps based on eigenvalues) could yield a good curated list. That said, in my past research, I’ve found that any automatic metric with an incentive will be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law">gamed</a>, and invariably will lift up self-promoters over quiet, thoughtful voices.</p>

<p>Speaking of self-promoters, two names do not belong on lists of top experts, but are often found there: Eric Feigl-Ding &amp; Laurie Garrett. Both are good communicators, but are also sloppy enough with their science to get called out regularly. Inclusion of these names is a sign that a list of experts is not especially carefully curated.</p>

<p>Another important warning sign is lack of inclusion of women and people of color; mainstream media is often guilty of this. Health equity is an especially important part of the …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<p><em><center>Neil Postman (March 27, 1998)</center></em></p><hr>
      <p>Good morning your Eminences and Excellencies, ladies, and gentlemen. 
      </p><p>The theme of this conference, "The New Technologies and the Human 
      Person: Communicating the Faith in the New Millennium," suggests, of 
      course, that you are concerned about what might happen to faith in the new 
      millennium, as well you should be. In addition to our computers, which are 
      close to having a nervous breakdown in anticipation of the year 2000, 
      there is a great deal of frantic talk about the 21st century and how it 
      will pose for us unique problems of which we know very little but for 
      which, nonetheless, we are supposed to carefully prepare. Everyone seems 
      to worry about this--business people, politicians, educators, as well as 
      theologians. 
      </p><p>At the risk of sounding patronizing, may I try to put everyone's mind 
      at ease? I doubt that the 21st century will pose for us problems that are 
      more stunning, disorienting or complex than those we faced in this 
      century, or the 19th, 18th, 17th, or for that matter, many of the 
      centuries before that. But for those who are excessively nervous about the 
      new millennium, I can provide, right at the start, some good advice about 
      how to confront it. The advice comes from people whom we can trust, and 
      whose thoughtfulness, it's safe to say, exceeds that of President Clinton, 
      Newt Gingrich, or even Bill Gates. Here is what Henry David Thoreau told 
      us: "All our inventions are but improved means to an unimproved end." Here 
      is what Goethe told us: "One should, each day, try to hear a little song, 
      read a good poem, see a fine picture, and, if possible, speak a few 
      reasonable words." Socrates told us: "The unexamined life is not worth 
      living." Rabbi Hillel told us: "What is hateful to thee, do not do to 
      another." And here is the prophet Micah: "What does the Lord require of 
      thee but to do justly, to love mercy and to walk humbly with thy God." And 
      I could say, if we had the time, (although you know it well enough) what 
      Jesus, Isaiah, Mohammad, Spinoza, and Shakespeare told us. It is all the 
      same: There is no escaping from ourselves. The human dilemma is as it has 
      always been, and it is a delusion to believe that the technological 
      changes of our era have rendered irrelevant the wisdom of the ages and the 
      sages. 
      </p><p>Nonetheless, having said this, I know perfectly well that because we do 
      live in a technological age, we have some special problems that Jesus, 
      Hillel, Socrates, and Micah did not and could not speak of. I do not have 
      the wisdom to say what we ought to do about such problems, and so my 
      contribution must confine itself to some things we need to know in order 
      to address the problems. I call my talk <i>Five Things We Need to Know 
      About Technological Change</i>. I base these ideas on my thirty years of 
      studying the history of technological change but I do not think these are 
      academic or esoteric ideas. They are to the sort of things everyone who is 
      concerned with cultural stability and balance should know and I offer them 
      to you in the hope that you will find them useful in thinking about the 
      effects of technology on religious faith. 
      </p><p><b>First Idea</b> 
      </p><p>The first idea is that all technological change is a trade-off. I like 
      to call it a Faustian bargain. Technology giveth and technology taketh 
      away. This means that for every advantage a new technology offers, there 
      is always a corresponding disadvantage. The disadvantage may exceed in 
      importance the advantage, or the advantage may well be worth the cost. 
      Now, this may seem to be a rather obvious idea, but you would be surprised 
      at how many people believe that new technologies are unmixed blessings. 
      You need only think of the enthusiasms with which most people approach 
      their understanding of computers. Ask anyone who knows something about 
      computers to talk about them, and you will find that they will, 
      unabashedly and relentlessly, extol the wonders of computers. You will 
      also find that in most cases they will completely neglect to mention any 
      of the liabilities of computers. This is a dangerous imbalance, since the 
      greater the wonders of a technology, the greater will be its negative 
      consequences. 
      </p><p>Think of the automobile, which for all of its obvious advantages, has 
      poisoned our air, choked our cities, and degraded the beauty of our 
      natural landscape. Or you might reflect on the paradox of medical 
      technology which brings wondrous cures but is, at the same time, a 
      demonstrable cause of certain diseases and disabilities, and has played a 
      significant role in reducing the diagnostic skills of physicians. It is 
      also well to recall that for all of the intellectual and social benefits 
      provided by the printing press, its costs were equally monumental. The 
      printing press gave the Western world prose, but it made poetry into an 
      exotic and elitist form of communication. It gave us inductive science, 
      but it reduced religious sensibility to a form of fanciful superstition. 
      Printing gave us the modern conception of nationhood, but in so doing 
      turned patriotism into a sordid if not lethal emotion. We might even say 
      that the printing of the Bible in vernacular languages introduced the 
      impression that God was an Englishman or a German or a Frenchman--that is 
      to say, printing reduced God to the dimensions of a local potentate. 
      </p><p>Perhaps the best way I can express this idea is to say that the 
      question, "What will a new technology do?" is no more important than the 
      question, "What will a new technology undo?" Indeed, the latter question 
      is more important, precisely because it is asked so infrequently. One 
      might say, then, that a sophisticated perspective on technological change 
      includes one's being skeptical of Utopian and Messianic visions drawn by 
      those who have no sense of history or of the precarious balances on which 
      culture depends. In fact, if it were up to me, I would forbid anyone from 
      talking about the new information technologies unless the person can 
      demonstrate that he or she knows something about the social and psychic 
      effects of the alphabet, the mechanical clock, the printing press, and 
      telegraphy. In other words, knows something about the costs of great 
      technologies. 
      </p><p>Idea Number One, then, is that culture always pays a price for 
      technology. 
      </p><p><b>Second Idea</b> 
      </p><p>This leads to the second idea, which is that the advantages and 
      disadvantages of new technologies are never distributed evenly among the 
      population. This means that every new technology benefits some and harms 
      others. There are even some who are not affected at all. Consider again 
      the case of the printing press in the 16th century, of which Martin Luther 
      said it was "God's highest and extremest act of grace, whereby the 
      business of the gospel is driven forward." By placing the word of God on 
      every Christian's kitchen table, the mass-produced book undermined the 
      authority of the church hierarchy, and hastened the breakup of the Holy 
      Roman See. The Protestants of that time cheered this development. The 
      Catholics were enraged and distraught. Since I am a Jew, had I lived at 
      that time, I probably wouldn't have given a damn one way or another, since 
      it would make no difference whether a pogrom was inspired by Martin Luther 
      or Pope Leo X. Some gain, some lose, a few remain as they were. 
      </p><p>Let us take as another example, television, although here I should add 
      at once that in the case of television there are very few indeed who are 
      not affected in one way or another. In America, where television has taken 
      hold more deeply than anywhere else, there are many people who find it a 
      blessing, not least those who have achieved high-paying, gratifying 
      careers in television as executives, technicians, directors, newscasters 
      and entertainers. On the other hand, and in the long run, television may 
      bring an end to the careers of school teachers since school was an 
      invention of the printing press and must stand or fall on the issue of how 
      much importance the printed word will have in the future. There is no 
      chance, of course, that television will go away but school teachers who 
      are enthusiastic about its presence always call to my mind an image of 
      some turn-of-the-century blacksmith who not only is singing the praises of 
      the automobile but who also believes that his business will be enhanced by 
      it. We know now that his business was not enhanced by it; it was rendered 
      obsolete by it, as perhaps an intelligent blacksmith would have known. 
      </p><p>The questions, then, that are never far from the mind of a person who 
      is knowledgeable about technological change are these: Who specifically 
      benefits from the development of a new technology? Which groups, what type 
      of person, what kind of industry will be favored? And, of course, which 
      groups of people will thereby be harmed? 
      </p><p>These questions should certainly be on our minds when we think about 
      computer technology. There is no doubt that the computer has been and will 
      continue to be advantageous to large-scale organizations like the military 
      or airline companies or banks or tax collecting institutions. And it is 
      equally clear that the computer is now indispensable to high-level </p></div></div>

		<p>A team led by Peter Weidenbach and Johannes vom Dorp in the Fraunhofer FKIE’s Cyber Analysis &amp; Defense department had downloaded the latest available firmware as of March 27, 2020. This is the same software that manufacturers offer to customers who have one of these 127 routers in service for private home use.</p> 
<p>The security flaws were detected and identified using the Fraunhofer FKIE's Firmware Analysis and Comparison Tool (FACT). <b>»</b>The evaluation showed that not a single router was free of flaws. Some of them were even affected by hundreds of known vulnerabilities. Of the routers tested, 46 had not received a security update in the preceding twelve months,« reports IT security expert and FKIE scientist Peter Weidenbach. The extreme case among the evaluated devices had not received a security update for more than 5 years.</p> 
<p>In preparing their report, the FKIE scientists focused on various security aspects including not only security updates but also which operating system versions are used and the extent to which critical security vulnerabilities influence these versions. More than 90 percent of the home routers tested use the Linux operating system, but very often the versions used are very old. On this point, vom Dorp reserves his strongest criticism of the manufacturers. <b>»</b>Linux works continuously to close security vulnerabilities in its operating system and to develop new functionalities. Really, all the manufacturers would have to do is install the latest software, but they do not integrate it to the extent that they could and should.«</p> 
<p>The FKIE scientists were also astonished by how passwords are handled. <b>»</b>Numerous routers have passwords that are either well known or simple to crack – or else they have hard-coded credentials that users cannot change.« The researchers also discovered numerous longstanding known security vulnerabilities which manufacturers should have eliminated long ago.</p> 
<p>Weidenbach finds it utterly incomprehensible that home router manufacturers are no longer clearly focusing on the security aspects he and his team deal with. <b>»</b>It is immediately clear that providers deal with existing security vulnerabilities and their elimination in completely different ways.« AVM, for instance, attaches more importance to security issues than the other providers, even though AVM routers are not without their own security flaws. He also said that in some respects ASUS and Netgear were more reliable than D-Link, Linksys, TP-Link and Zyxel.</p> 
<p><b>»</b>Our test has demonstrated that a large-scale automated security analysis of home routers is definitely possible,« says vom Dorp, adding, <b>»</b>And the large number of vulnerabilities identified in the report shows that manufacturers still have a long way to go in their efforts to make these devices far more secure.«</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-td-block-uid="tdi_28_5e5">

<div>
<p>It’s often said that you can tell a lot about a person by observing their living space. In a similar vein, I believe we can glean a lot about society by observing our own minds – where we store the individual thoughts, beliefs and values that form society’s collective structures. Unsurprisingly our headspace is often a product of our mind’s state, sitting somewhere along a spectrum of fulfilment to boredom at any one time. In this article I want to focus more on the latter, more specifically, how boredom as a pervasive state of mind has shaped our consumption habits. What we feed our minds for entertainment and why.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before I get into that though we have to clarify the relationship between boredom and consumption, or rather dispel a popular myth. Boredom isn’t resolved by quick, easy stimulation of the mind, instead boredom feeds off of it to grow even larger. You can think of it as drinking alcohol to quench thirst, in the immediate term you will feel hydrated only to realise it will leave you even more parched than before. Now that we’ve acknowledged this, bear in mind that today’s pace of life and technology has ensured that we do exactly that. Boredom is met with quick stimulus leaving an even larger craving in its wake, only to be met by quicker and easier stimulation, and so goes the cycle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today’s entertainment economy has adjusted to this fundamental transformation in our consumption habits – I call it a transformation because it has happened slowly but surely over several decades. And while the link isn’t obvious yet, it’s a large part of the reason you’ve been walking out of cinemas thinking “is it just me or were movies better a few years ago”. While I can’t surely say movies were better a few years ago, why, in an increasingly creative, technologically advanced society would viewers be left feeling this way post a movie experience?&nbsp;</p>



<p>The explanation for this lies in, you guessed it, boredom. Also to an extent, discovery and recommender systems but we won’t get into that now. To solve for boredom at scale, we have to appeal to the lowest threshold for stimulation. This objective to appeal to the lowest common denominator for stimulation quickly becomes a defining factor of our consumption habits. When Youtube launched in 2006 later to be acquired by Google, it signalled the start of a shift in consumable entertainment. User-generated entertainment was never before a comparable form of media for the masses. People didn’t watch vlogs and live streams while they ate dinner, they watched old school Tv shows and movies. But Youtube was successful because it was one of the first to address the quantity of entertainment required to “quench” boredom at scale.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Youtube and subsequent platforms like TikTok are naturally able to provide the lowest common denominator across the board – “there is something for everyone” – with the sheer quantity and diversity of user generated content (UGC) on these platforms. Hollywood movies though, don’t work on the function of quantity. Rather they work on high-quality production and creative output. Hollywood had to address the challenge of vying for eyeball time in an increasingly saturated ‘boredom market’. To do this, Hollywood had to begin considering what platforms like Youtube were doing, providing a quick dopamine hit whilst servicing the lowest common denominators that would attract the most people. Hollywood’s take on this has manifested into today’s mainstream film industry. This takes the form of ‘PG’ movies appealing to younger, broader audiences, through to the one-liners in marvel movies that seem to hit just right.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One other clear example of this is the influx of reboots over the last few years. Here, nostalgia is the common denominator these movies are targeting instead of focusing on the creation of new content. <em>Star Wars: The Force Awakens </em>is probably a good example of this, basically a play by play of <em>A New Hope</em> – the first movie in the Star Wars franchise to release in the 1970s.</p>



<h3>How Quibi failed to read the room</h3>



<p>Quibi, Hollywood’s poster child for short-form video content, has been created for a mobile-only audience. It claims it competes with “free” forms of video like Youtube and TikTok that target viewers with time and attention constraints. This offering rests upon the assumption that viewers on current UGC platforms would prefer higher quality production.</p>



<p>If I Imagine the pitch-room for Quibi seed round investment – the pitch would have gone something like this. “We’re time poor/attention-deficit and addicted to the drip-drip release of dopamine that our smart-phones deliver unto us. As our consumption patterns arc away from the past – we are ever in search of easier to consume, easier to enjoy doses that slot into the (apparently) smaller spaces of discretionary time in our lives or minds – Youtube/TikTok have shown how hungry the people are for these short bursts of escape – but user-generated content can’t fill that gap at the scale and quality we can”</p>



<p>What QuiBi failed to understand is that the transformation in our consumption pattern wasn’t about short-form content with high-quality production but about fulfilling the need for stimulus created by boredom. In actual fact, our consumption patterns had fragmented into two formats. The first is “Hollywood” style productions, high-quality story driven content that requires greater cognitive participation (immersion). The second is lower quality production or user-generated content that we equate with easy, effortless consumption.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anecdotally, you can abandon a YouTube video halfway and not feel dissatisfied for having wasted five minutes on it – a perk of non-immersive content. Comparatively, it would be difficult to abandon the type of high production content found on Quibi – where you’ve already committed to participating cognitively and are anticipating immersion – without feeling a little cheated of time and effort.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Immersion requires the cognitive expense of dedicating a set amount of time and a certain mindset to consume that content. This cognitive expense is at odds with the youtube or TikTok model, where spontaneous discovery and consumption also equate to spontaneous abandonment of that content without dissatisfaction. If Quibi wanted to replicate the spontaneous discovery and consumption, their focus should have been on scaling quantity that allows for spontaneity rather than spending 100,000 USD per minute of video. Imagine if there were 80,000 or 800,000 pieces of content rather than 8,000?&nbsp;</p>



<p>So then the absurdity of the following statement is apparent:</p>



<p>“We’re competing against free,” Jeffrey Katzenberg says referring to the likes of youtube and social media platforms like TikTok. “We have to offer something that is meaningfully, measurably, quantifiably, creatively different. They don’t know how to do what we do, with all due respect,…”</p>



<h3>Hollywood: Where tried and tested formulas often outweigh the cost of creative risks</h3>



<p>The lowest common denominator is easier to identify on YouTube where stimulus is dictated and served by ‘market’ forces, basically the consumption demands of users. On the other hand, Hollywood relies more heavily on a commercial push strategy informed by the smaller sample set of feedback available in audience scores. The cost of identifying the nature of demand is significantly larger in the latter compared to the throwaway cost of a YouTube production. Producers can easily move from one youtube video to the next without losing an arm and a leg.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The high cost of production in Hollywood doesn’t afford the same luxury, the same applies for Quibi’s production value. This then exacerbates a reliance on more obviously popular tropes, reboots are an easy out given that the particular world, plot or characters are already loved by audiences. This pushes production towards tried and tested formulas which are replicated year on year, where funny one-liners from marvel movies are a hallmark of Hollywood production now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Where optionality was limited in the 90s, early 2000s or any time before to the TV and Cinema, taking punts on new formats, stories or original productions seemed a less risky endeavour. In today’s world, there is far too much optionality and much slimmer margin for error.</p>

</a>Using kbpbot</h3>  <p><code>kbpbot</code> is a Keybase bot designed to help you publish your site using a custom domain.</p>  <p>For example, let’s say you’d like to publish your website at <code>myname.com</code>. To do so:</p>  <ol> <li>In your private Keybase folder, create a new folder with the name <code>yourusername,kbpbot</code>. Only you and <code>kbpbot</code> can access, read, and edit files in this folder.</li> <li>Within this folder, add another folder that will hold your site’s contents. Let’s name it <code>my-site</code>. The complete folder name would be <code>/keybase/private/person,kbpbot/my-site</code>.</li> <li>Drop any other files you’d like to publicly share on your website in this folder. You can use Markdown, HTML, CSS, and image files.</li>  </ol>  <h3><a href="#team-folders" name="team-folders"><svg fill="var(--color--content__compose-anchor)" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 20 10">

</svg>
</a>Team folders</h3>  <p>Any Keybase folder that <code>kbpbot</code> can read works, so you can also use a team folder (e.g., <code>/keybase/team/awesometeam/awesome-site</code>) and add <code>kbpbot</code> as a reader.</p>  <h3><a href="#dns-records" name="dns-records"><svg fill="var(--color--content__compose-anchor)" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 20 10">

</svg>
</a>DNS records</h3>  <p>In order for your domain/hostname to point at the Keybase servers, you need to set up a <code>CNAME</code> record (you could also use an <code>ALIAS</code> record to forward an <code>A</code>/<code>AAAA</code> record) that points at the hostname <code>kbp.keybaseapi.com</code>. So, you’d have something like:</p>  <pre><code>my-site.example.com. 300 IN CNAME kbp.keybaseapi.com.
</code></pre>  <p>Note that you can’t have <code>CNAME</code> on a root domain (e.g., <code>example.com</code>). Some DNS providers support it by making it a proxy for only <code>A</code>/<code>AAAA</code> records. This is sometimes called <code>ALIAS</code>. If you need to use a root domain with a Keybase Site, but your DNS provider doesn’t allow it, try switching to a different DNS provider.</p>  <p>In addition to the DNS record, <code>kbpbot</code> needs to know which shared folder you’d like to share on this hostname. You’ll need a <code>TXT</code> record for <code>_keybase_pages</code> as a subdomain of your hostname. In this case, that would be <code>_keybase_pages.my-site.example.com</code>. If the <code>_keybase_pages</code> prefix isn’t allowed, you may use <code>_keybasepages.my-site.example.com</code> as well.</p>  <p>The contents of this record are the prefix <code>kbp=</code>, and a full Keybase path to the folder you’d like to share, as created above. For this example setup, the record would look like this:</p>  <pre><code>_keybase_pages.my-site.example.com. 300 IN TXT "kbp=/keybase/private/person,kbpbot/my-site"
</code></pre>  <p>This record tells <code>kbpbot</code> to look in this folder to share your files.</p>  <h3><a href="#https-security" name="https-security"><svg fill="var(--color--content__compose-anchor)" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 20 10">

</a>HTTPS security</h3>  <p>Thanks to <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let’s Encrypt</a>, <code>kbpbot</code> is able to transparently request and install a HTTPS TLS/SSL certificate on your hosted domain name, for free.</p>  <p>If your configuration went smoothly, the contents of your folder are now shared over a secure HTTPS connection.</p>  <p>If you added a <code>/keybase/private/person,kbpbot/my-site/index.html</code>, that file will be made available at <code>https://my-site.example.com/</code> (and also <code>https://my-site.example.com/index.html</code>).</p>  <p>If you shared an image at <code>/keybase/private/person,kbpbot/my-site/puppy/gettingbig.jpg</code>, that would be available at <code>https://my-site.example.com/puppy/gettingbig.jpg</code>, etc.</p>  <h2><a href="#git-publishing" name="git-publishing"><svg fill="var(--color--content__compose-anchor)" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 20 10">

</a>Git publishing</h2>  <p>You can also publish your website through <a href="https://book.keybase.io/git">Git</a> instead of <a href="https://book.keybase.io/files">Files</a>.</p>  <p>Instead of sharing a folder with <a href="https://book.keybase.io/sites#using-kbpbot">kbpbot</a>, you can create a shared Keybase Git repository and publish that.</p>  <p>First, you need to be on a team with <code>kbpbot</code>:</p>  <ol> <li>In Teams, select <code>Create a team</code> and give it a name. (We’ll call this one <code>gitwithkbpbot</code>, but it can be anything.)</li> <li><code>Add members</code> and invite <code>kbpbot</code> as a Reader. You can also add <code>kbpbot</code> to an existing team.  Now you can create a Git repository to use for your new site.</li> <li>In Git, select <code>New repository</code> and <code>New team repository</code>. Choose the team you share with <code>kbpbot</code>, and give the repository a name. (We’ll call this one <code>git-site</code>.)</li> <li>Clone the repository and add some content to it. Push to <code>master</code>.</li>  </ol>  <p>The DNS configuration for Git is a little different. The main <code>CNAME</code>/<code>ALIAS</code> record is the same (points at <code>kbp.keybaseapi.com</code>). But the <code>TXT</code> record needs to tell <code>kbpbot</code> about the Git repository instead of the filesystem location like before. It looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>_keybase_pages.my-site.example.com. 300 IN TXT "kbp=git@keybase:team/gitwithkbpbot/git-site"
</code></pre>  <p>After the regular DNS propagation delays, the pushed contents of the <code>master</code> branch of your repository will be available at <code>https://my-site.example.com</code>.</p>  <h2><a href="#more-customizations" name="more-customizations"><svg fill="var(--color--content__compose-anchor)" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 20 10">

</svg>
</a>More customizations</h2>  <p>By default, directory listing is disabled when you host a custom domain with Keybase. You may enable listing by creating a <code>.kbp_config</code> file at the root of your site. This config file allows some simple customizations on different parts of the site, including enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).</p>  <p>Learn more about <a href="https://keybase.io/docs/kbp/kbp_config"><code>.kbp_config</code></a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>On May 21, Brittany Chavez had just about reached her limits.</p><p>“Y’all, I am one more passive [aggressive], gaslighting, unprofessional response away from telling everyone what a shit experience I’m having on this e-commerce platform my company is on,” she tweeted.</p><div id="piano-cta">
<p>While cryptic, those within her circle knew what she was talking about. Chavez had spent the last five months building her online marketplace, Shop Latinx, on the startup e-commerce platform Elliot. During those months, she hyped the company on multiple social media platforms. In turn, Shop Latinx was used in marketing materials about Elliot; Chavez said she had even been asked to speak about her experience with Elliot investors Torch Capital.</p>

<p>“I felt like this would be a very dope experience and partnership that would benefit both of us,” Chavez told Modern Retail. Instead, she found herself increasingly frustrated by the limitations — dealing with small technical problems that she said the company would take months to fix, if not completely ignore the requests.</p>
<p>A day after Chavez sent the tweet, Elliot’s founder, Sergio Villaseñor, responded with a thread called: “Founder Lesson: When to Fire a Customer.” He posted financial documents and emails sent between him, Chavez and another Shop Latinx co-founder. He included personal and financial allegations about the company’s revenue, claiming to have paid for her laptop and wiring her cash to help her incorporate. It concluded: “As a Latino, it’s unfortunate to terminate a customer that supports a community I’m racially bound to.”</p>
<p>It was a strange ordeal, made ugly by the online public setting. Even stranger was the fact that Elliot had not even gone to market yet, and Shop Latinx was one of its beta testers. Three weeks before he was supposed to unveil his e-commerce platform, Villaseñor had decided to put an early adopter on blast.</p>
<p>This was perhaps a harbinger of what was to come. Villaseñor and his founders spent months hyping their soon-to-launch platform. The launch, however, never happened, as the platform, according to sources, seemed largely untested despite much handwaving and claims made online, in industry groups and to the merchants already signed on. Elliot, the pitch went, was going to be the anti-Shopify — an international e-commerce platform that focused on smaller businesses in an increasingly globalized world. But the competitive landscape was already crowded with giants like BigCommerce, WooCommerce and Magento offering similar solutions.</p>
<p>Despite being small, Elliot represented an important shift in the e-commerce space. It was a back-end company trying to brand itself as hip, current and with the times. Where Magento was an agnostic platform that seemed invisible to everyone but the engineers and developers, Elliot was riding the direct to consumer wave of marketing coming first and product being second. The problem for Elliot, it seemed, was that product never quite got to where it said it should be.</p>

<p>But for at least a few months, the guerilla campaigning worked. Thanks to advertising placements in industry newsletters like Lean Luxe, myriad Twitter threads about hustling and entrepreneurship (as well as quite a few online spats), the commerce industry took notice, more investors began writing checks, and e-commerce professionals’ interests were getting piqued.</p>
<p>Elliot’s launch date was set for June 18. When the day came, due to what the company claimed was a denial of service attack on its infrastructure, the unveiling hit some snags. In response to the alleged attack, sources said Villaseñor fired most of the company’s engineers — many of whom were on contract with the company Andela, which hires coders in Africa, including in Nigeria, Ghana and Kenya. (Villaseñor contested this, saying that the engineers’ contracts ended that day and he was in the process of hiring full-time staff.) He then announced on Twitter that Elliot’s launch would be pushed until December 25. A few days later, he would announce that he was stepping down as CEO of the company. And 24 hours after that, his two other co-founders, Marco Marandiz and Clayton Chambers, announced that the company would shut down completely.</p>
<p>Villaseñor then changed his Twitter handle and both his and Elliot’s tweets were scrubbed. Marandiz and Chambers posted on Twitter that they are no longer associated with the company. Marandiz declined to comment for this article and Chambers did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Villaseñor has tried to keep a low profile. In a private Discord chat viewed by Modern Retail, third-party developers expressed disbelief at the outcome; Many were disappointed to learn the news about Elliot’s closing via Twitter, not via internal networks. “These guys may be on to something, market the shit out of product and then dip with the investor money,” wrote one member. When asked what happened, Villaseñor simply said he was too exhausted; “I was burnt out when I started Elliot,” he wrote on the Discord. “I just got tired.”</p>
<p>Now, a few days later, Villaseñor told Modern Retail the show isn’t over. “We are recapitalizing the company under a new name,” he said, adding that the details are still being worked out. He is the only member of the board. The company is now just him and a team of five engineers trying to pick back up the pieces, he said. Stepping down, he said, was part of the overall strategy. “We will set out a launch date later in the year — when we feel the platform is secure,” he said. “I will still be loosely involved.”</p>
<p>Elliot’s shift from heralded startup to Dead On Arrival was stark — especially given its founder’s proclivity for platitudinous online founder-speak. On June 9, Villaseñor tweeted:</p>

<p>He was the ultimate online operator and hype man. He and his most recent co-founders had spent months teasing the launch of their new company. They tweeted, posted videos and hosted luxurious dinners and exotic getaways — all to get more people talking about Elliot. They also focused specifically on smaller, more diverse brands — claiming to offer e-commerce support for companies that are often overlooked. This was what helped attract a slew of industry operators and entrepreneurs who have historically felt ignored; a back-end e-commerce platform suddenly had brand evangelists. The pitch focused on diversity and industry shortcomings. And it certainly resonated, at least for a while.</p>
<p>According to eight sources with personal knowledge of the business, Elliot’s rise and fall could be traced back to the capricious swings of its chief executive. Villaseñor spent the last year trying to build and hype his platform, specifically seeking out diverse and popular brand evangelists. But the platform was never finished, and not as international as it claimed to be; it facilitated payments through Stripe, for example, which is only supported in 33 countries. (Villaseñor said that it is working to add payment options and that it offers a wallet feature where merchants in countries that Stripe doesn’t operate can connect their bank accounts to receive payments directly from Elliot.)</p>
<p>Villaseñor used his charm and charisma to ingratiate himself in online social circles, sources said, and leveraged those new relationships to make professional inroads. Through this, he landed investment dollars and business partnerships, which helped propel his social media following and professional clout. “It’s very appalling to me to see someone get the opportunity that so many people crave — all that funding, and then blow it up,” said Andrea Hernández, founder of Mood Food Snacks, a Latin America-based company that was courted to use Elliot earlier this year.</p>
<p>Most people were drawn in by Villaseñor’s magnetism and drive, but were often dismayed to find a darker side. If a potential business partner gave him an answer he didn’t like, he would call them, angry, or take to Twitter to blast their replies. “It was these violent switches in personality,” said one person who had done business with the platform. People in Villaseñor’s crosshairs would often have to message co-founders or investors to get him to stop. “It’s scary,” the source said.</p>
<p>In Villaseñor’s eyes, the idea was to get people’s attention. “Our Twitter persona,” he said, “was very intentional.” There were a lot of competitors, and they all had serious marketshare. It didn’t make sense in his eyes to pay for search and social media marketing. “We were leading with bravado,” he said. “That would allow us to make some noise and get attention.”</p>
<p><strong>How did it get here?</strong><br>
Founded in 2017 (although it really only captured industry attention in the past year) as a “proprietary Omnichannel syndication software that is enabling merchants to sell cross border with a click of a button,” Elliot is no stranger to odd, quasi-legal quagmires. For example, in 2019 (when Villaseñor was in the midst of its latest relaunch) Elliot sued an early business partner named Derek Sine for allegedly illegally using the Elliot trademark and making fraudulent claims. In multiple legal back-and-forths, Sine claimed to be a co-founder.</p>
<p>In 2018, the company announced a $3 million seed rounding along with a new set of executives, including Lea Solimene, Joey Spanjers and Hass Johnson. (Today, none of these people list Elliot on their LinkedIn profiles and none responded to requests for comment for this article.) The press release at the time focused less on the branding and more on the set of tools it provided including “data management, global shipping options, translations, and all the tools needed to connect to billions of new consumers.”</p>
<p>Over a year went by, and Elliot never launched. Villaseñor said that company was about to sign a Series A term sheet, but the team “didn’t feel like the product would be sustainable.” He decided to pivot the original business away from being a “catalog manager,” and rebrand entirely. The team at the time “didn’t fit the …</p></div></div>

<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Question 1. What is Kubernetes?</span></strong></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform. It was developed by Google and was donated to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) in 2015.</span></p>
<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Question 2. How does Kubernetes relate to Docker?</span></strong></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Docker is a container runtime, which is a software that runs containerized applications. When Kubernetes schedules a pod to a node, the kubelet running on that node instructs Docker to launch the containers.</span></p>
<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Question 3. What is container orchestration?</span></strong></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Container orchestration is the automation of components and processes related to running containers. It includes things like configuring and scheduling containers, the availability of containers, allocation of resources between containers, and securing the interaction between containers, among other things.</span></p>
<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Question 4. What do you know about Kubernetes clusters?</span></strong></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A Kubernetes cluster is a set of nodes that containerized applications run on. These nodes can be physical machines or virtual machines.</span></p>
<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Question 5. What is kubectl?</span></strong></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Kubectl is the command-line configuration tool for Kubernetes that communicates with a Kubernetes API server. Using kubectl allows you to create, inspect, update, and delete Kubernetes objects.<br></span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"></span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">To learn all the stuff you can do with kubectl, check out our <a href="https://www.bluematador.com/learn/kubectl-cheatsheet" rel=" noopener">kubectl cheatsheet</a>.</span></p>
<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Question 6. What is a pod?</span></strong></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A pod is the most basic Kubernetes object. A pod consists of a group of containers running in your cluster. Most commonly, a pod runs a single primary container.</span></p>
<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Question 7. Can you explain the different components of Kubernetes architecture?</span></strong></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Kubernetes is composed of two layers: a&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">control plane</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;and a&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">data plane</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. The&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">control plane</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;is the container orchestration layer that includes 1. Kubernetes objects that control the cluster, and 2. the data about the cluster’s state and configuration. The&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">data plane&nbsp;</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">is the layer that processes the data requests and is managed by the control plane.</span></p>
<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Question 8. What is the difference between a daemonset, a deployment, and a replication controller?</span></strong></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A <a href="https://www.bluematador.com/blog/an-introduction-to-kubernetes-daemonsets" rel=" noopener">daemonset </a>ensures that all nodes you select are running exactly one copy of a pod.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><img src="https://www.bluematador.com/hs-fs/hubfs/blog/new/An%20Introduction%20to%20Kubernetes%20DaemonSets/DaemonSets.png?width=600&amp;name=DaemonSets.png" alt="Kubernetes daemonset diagram" width="600" srcset="https://www.bluematador.com/hs-fs/hubfs/blog/new/An%20Introduction%20to%20Kubernetes%20DaemonSets/DaemonSets.png?width=300&amp;name=DaemonSets.png 300w, https://www.bluematador.com/hs-fs/hubfs/blog/new/An%20Introduction%20to%20Kubernetes%20DaemonSets/DaemonSets.png?width=600&amp;name=DaemonSets.png 600w, https://www.bluematador.com/hs-fs/hubfs/blog/new/An%20Introduction%20to%20Kubernetes%20DaemonSets/DaemonSets.png?width=900&amp;name=DaemonSets.png 900w, https://www.bluematador.com/hs-fs/hubfs/blog/new/An%20Introduction%20to%20Kubernetes%20DaemonSets/DaemonSets.png?width=1200&amp;name=DaemonSets.png 1200w, https://www.bluematador.com/hs-fs/hubfs/blog/new/An%20Introduction%20to%20Kubernetes%20DaemonSets/DaemonSets.png?width=1500&amp;name=DaemonSets.png 1500w, https://www.bluematador.com/hs-fs/hubfs/blog/new/An%20Introduction%20to%20Kubernetes%20DaemonSets/DaemonSets.png?width=1800&amp;name=DaemonSets.png 1800w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A deployment is a resource object in Kubernetes that provides declarative updates to applications. It manages the scheduling and lifecycle of pods. It provides several key features for managing pods, including pod health checks, rolling updates of pods, the ability to roll back, and the ability to easily scale pods horizontally.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The replication controller specifies how many exact copies of a pod should be running in a cluster. It differs from a deployment in that it does not offer pod health checks, and the rolling update process is not as robust.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Question 9. Do all of the nodes have to be the same size in your cluster?</span></strong></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">No, they don’t. The Kubernetes components, like kubelet, will take up resources on your nodes, and you’ll still need more capacity for the node to do any work. In a larger cluster, it often makes sense to create a mix of different instance sizes. That way, pods that require a lot of memory with intensive compute workloads can be scheduled by Kubernetes on large nodes, and smaller nodes can handle smaller pods.</span></p>
<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Question 10. What is a sidecar container, and what would you use it for?</span></strong></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A sidecar container is a utility container that is used to extend support for a main container in a Pod. Sidecar containers can be paired with one or more main containers, and they enhance the functionality of those main containers. An example would be using a sidecar container specifically to process system logs or for monitoring.</span></p>
<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Question 11. How do logs work for pods?</span></strong></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">With a traditional server setup, application logs are written to a file and then viewed either on each server or collected by a logging agent and sent to a centralized location. In Kubernetes, however, writing logs to disk from a pod is discouraged since you would then have to manage log files for pods. The better way is to have your application output logs to&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">stdout&nbsp;</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">and&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">stderr.&nbsp;</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The kubelet on each node collects stdout and stderr on the running pods and then combines them into a log file managed by Kubernetes. Then you can use different&nbsp;</span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.bluematador.com/learn/kubectl-cheatsheet" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">kubectl commands</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;to view the logs.</span></p>
<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Question 12. How can you separate resources?</span></strong></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">You can separate resources by using namespaces. These can be created either using kubectl or applying a YAML file. After you have created the namespace you can then place resources, or create new resources, within that namespace. Some people think of namespaces in Kubernetes like a virtual cluster in your actual Kubernetes cluster.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p>If you study these questions and commit the answers to memory, you'll be well on your way to landing that sweet gig.&nbsp;</p>

Although they can be used to manufacture a number of useful materials, getting enough of the protein is difficult because only a small amount can be produced by each tiny spider.</p><p>In a new study published in <i><a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fdx.doi.org%2F10.1038%2Fs42003-020-1099-6&amp;t=MThkODg5YTM3Nzg1ZTM2YTI1OWM5OWQyODRjMWUwNzMxMDRmYWUyNyxhOFM3R3c4cg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F623113377168916480%2Fspider-silk-made-via-photosynthetic-bacteria&amp;m=0">Communications Biology</a></i>, a research team led by Keiji Numata at the RIKEN Center for Sustainable Resource Science (CSRS) reported that they succeeded in producing the spider silk using photosynthetic bacteria. This study could open a new era in which photosynthetic bio-factories stably output the bulk of spider silk.</p><p>In addition to being tough and lightweight, silks derived from arthropod species are biodegradable and biocompatible. In particular, spider silk is ultra-lightweight and is as tough as steel. “Spider silk has the potential to be used in the manufacture of high-performance and durable materials such as tear-resistant clothing, automobile parts, and aerospace components,” explains Choon Pin Foong, who conducted this study. “Its biocompatibility makes it safe for use in biomedical applications such as drug delivery systems, implant devices, and scaffolds for tissue engineering.” Because only a trace amount can be obtained from one spider, and because breeding large numbers of spiders is difficult, attempts have been made to produce artificial spider silk in a variety of species.</p><p>The CSRS team focused on the marine photosynthetic bacterium Rhodovulum sulfidophilum. This bacterium is ideal for establishing a sustainable bio-factory because it grows in seawater, requires carbon dioxide and nitrogen in the atmosphere, and uses solar energy, all of which are abundant and inexhaustible.</p><p>The researchers genetically engineered the bacterium to produce MaSp1 protein, the main component of the Nephila spider dragline which is thought to play an important role in the strength of the spider silk. Optimization of the gene sequence that they inserted into the bacterium’s genome was able to maximize the amount of silk that could be produced. They also found that a simple recipe – artificial seawater, bicarbonate salt, nitrogen gas, yeast extract, and irradiation with near-infrared light – allows R. sulfidophilum to grow well and produce the silk protein efficiently. Further observations confirmed that the surface and internal structures of the fibers produced in the bacteria were very similar to those produced naturally by spiders.</p><p>“Our current study shows the initial proof of concept for producing spider silk in photosynthetic bacteria. We are now working to mass produce spider-silk dragline proteins at higher molecular weights in our photosynthetic system,” Numata says. “The photosynthetic microbial cell factories, which produce bio-based and bio-degradable materials via a carbon neutral bioprocess, could help us in accomplishing some of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by the United Nations such as Goal #12 ‘Responsible Production and Consumption, and Goal #13 'Climate Action’. Our results will help provide feasible solutions for energy, water and food crises, solid waste problems, and global warming.”</p><p>–</p><p><b>Source: <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.riken.jp%2Fen%2Fnews_pubs%2Fresearch_news%2Fpr%2F2020%2F20200708_4%2Findex.html&amp;t=ZGU0NTBkZWQ4YjVlMWU4NTVlNjRhYmQzYWVhMGY5N2Q1ODBmNmQ4NyxhOFM3R3c4cg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F623113377168916480%2Fspider-silk-made-via-photosynthetic-bacteria&amp;m=0">RIKEN</a></b></p><p><b>Full study:</b>&nbsp;“A marine photosynthetic microbial cell factory as a platform for spider silk production”,&nbsp;<i>Communications Biology</i>.</p><p><a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fdx.doi.org%2F10.1038%2Fs42003-020-1099-6&amp;t=MThkODg5YTM3Nzg1ZTM2YTI1OWM5OWQyODRjMWUwNzMxMDRmYWUyNyxhOFM3R3c4cg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F623113377168916480%2Fspider-silk-made-via-photosynthetic-bacteria&amp;m=0">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s42003-020-1099-6</a><br></p><h2><b>Read Also</b></h2><p><a href="https://nuadox.com/post/165037092007/spider-silk-protein-for-artificial-heart">Potential of spider silk protein for engineering artificial heart</a></p>

its top source define poetry today as “literary work in which special intensity is given to the expression of feelings and ideas by the use of distinctive style and rhythm.”&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems reasonable that the ancients would have conveyed information in the form of poetry, since they likely ascended to the written form from a pre-historic oral tradition.&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of rhyme and meter is no doubt useful in the memorization of lines, and the tradition persisted into the works of early philosophers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><p>The notions of philosophy and science were essentially indistinguishable until the advent of experimental philosophy in the time of Newton.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even today, students of science are awarded a Doctorate of Philosophy when they attain the highest degree of institutional training— the infamous Ph.D.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this modern sense, philosophy appears to be a set of enlightenment tools for apprehending understanding.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is rather unanimously acknowledged that scientists must possess basic philosophical skills including logic, reason, and rationality.&nbsp;&nbsp;The application of these philosophical toolsets to the explanation of causation in nature is what we have come to understand as science proper.</p><p>In this sense, science is simply a special type of philosophy — one concerned with mechanistic explanations of cause.&nbsp;Philosophy, a term coined by Pythagoras around 500BC, pursued deep, general, and fundamental questions: what is existence?&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowledge?&nbsp;&nbsp;Reason?&nbsp;&nbsp;Justice?&nbsp;&nbsp;Aristotle broke off the first conception of science as distinct and still within the realm of philosophy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Aristotle’s science, called&nbsp;<em>natural</em>&nbsp;philosophy, sought causation in astronomy, medicine, and physics.&nbsp;&nbsp;With the rise of enlightenment culture in the 17th&nbsp;century, there seems to have been another transition:&nbsp;&nbsp;the departure of philosophy from poetry.&nbsp;&nbsp;That secession would not be complete until life became a separate subject of study, distinct from non-life, in the 18th&nbsp;century.</p></div><p>A curious example of poetic science is an initial attempt by the philosopher, Empedocles, to explain anatomical respiration.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.iep.utm.edu/empedocl/#H2"><span>Empedocles</span></a>, was a philosopher from pre-Socratic Greece, whose works only survive in fragmentation.&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, we find his hexameter piece,&nbsp;<em>On Nature,</em>&nbsp;recounted by Aristotle and others.&nbsp;&nbsp;While the rhythm of the passages will be lost in translation, we can easily recognize his application poetic devices — most notably, the simile.&nbsp;&nbsp;Empedocles, makes a first reference to a stream of breath in an out of the lungs, very astutely apprehending the material nature of air.&nbsp;&nbsp;The philosopher accomplishes an attempted mechanistic description of the anatomy by way of a comparison to the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_clock"><span>clepsydra</span></a>, a familiar time-keeping apparatus in those days.&nbsp;&nbsp;Below is the original passage as recounted by Aristotle:</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594079237193_5412"><div><p>The beauty of the passage is lost on those of us that cannot read Greek, but <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/629759?seq=1">O’Brian’s</a> translation is as follows:</p><p>“Water cannot enter the clepsydra when it is full of air and the of the clepsydra is closed.&nbsp;</p><p>In the same way, blood cannot enter the lungs when they are full of air.&nbsp;</p><p>When the girl's hand is taken from the top of the clepsydra, water enters.&nbsp;</p><p>In the same way, blood enters the lungs when we breathe out.</p><p>When water fills the clepsydra and the top of the clepsydra is closed, air cannot enter.&nbsp;</p><p>In the same way, air cannot enter the lungs when they are full of blood.&nbsp;</p><p>When the girl's hand is taken from the top of the clepsydra, air enters the clepsydra and water rushes out.&nbsp;</p><p>In the same way, blood rushes out of the lungs when we breathe in air.”</p><p>Now of course, we recognize that this mechanism is completely incorrect.&nbsp;&nbsp;Blood does not leave the lungs when we exhale.&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet the particular failures of the explanation given by Empedocles are not so important so much as the way in which he sets precedent for the delivery of complex knowledge.&nbsp;&nbsp;Today you will find the same poetic devices at play in even our modern science.&nbsp;&nbsp;How often have we heard the heart described as a pump?&nbsp;&nbsp;Or the cell as a tiny machine?&nbsp;&nbsp;Spacetime as a fabric?&nbsp;&nbsp;Each is an Empedoclean simile. It seems this poetic tradition is still alive and well in modern conception of natural philosophy.</p><p>Lucretius was another Greek poet-philosopher that used poetry to present scientific mechanism.&nbsp;&nbsp;In&nbsp;<a href="http://johnstoniatexts.x10host.com/lucretius/lucretius1html.html"><span>his seminal work</span></a><em>On the Nature of Things</em>, Lucretius all but advances the first law of thermodynamics, that no thing can arise from nothing:</p><p>“And so this terror, this darkness of mind,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>must be dispelled, not by rays from the sun<br>or bright shafts of daylight, but by reason&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>and the face of nature. And we will start<br>to weave her first principle as follows:<br>nothing is ever&nbsp;brought forth by the&nbsp;<br>from nothing. That is, of course, how, through fear,<br>all mortal men are held in check—they view<br>many things done on earth and in the sky,<br>effects whose causes they cannot see at all,<br>and so they assume that such things happen<br>because of gods. Hence,&nbsp;<strong>once we understand<br>that nothing can be produced from nothing,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>then we shall more accurately follow<br>what we are looking for</strong>, how everything<br>can be created and all work can be done<br>without any assistance from the gods.”</p><p>There is perhaps room to believe that Lucretius’ thermodynamic ideas come across more clearly to the average reader than the mathematics of Clausius and Lord Kelvin.&nbsp;&nbsp;Later in this same poem, Lucretius brings us close to the modern idea of the atom as a building block of macro-scale substances.&nbsp;&nbsp;He suggests that the diversity of substance results from</p><p>“different bondings,<br>weights, collisions, combinations,&nbsp;motions,<br>through which all actions happen.”</p><p>This is a serious leap because it challenged the previously held notion of a primordial fire as the foundational structure of material.&nbsp;&nbsp;This poem was also written in the same&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dactylic_hexameter"><span>dactylic hexameter</span></a>&nbsp;rhythm as Empedocles — a meter that has failed to achieve lasting utility in English or other modern languages.&nbsp;&nbsp;The rhythm is familiar to the traditions of epic poetry including Homer’s&nbsp;<em>Iliad</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Odyssey</em>, and Virgil’s&nbsp;<em>Aeneid</em>, and Ovid’s&nbsp;<em>Metamorphoses</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><p>Aristotle suggested that we poetry is simply written to bring pleasure to the reader.&nbsp;&nbsp;He also believed that learning something was the greatest pleasure, and so the combination is irresistibly potent.&nbsp;&nbsp;If this is so, why have we abandoned poetic expression for matters of science?&nbsp;&nbsp;Have we bled the pleasure from science for no good reason?&nbsp;&nbsp;Have we inadvertently cloistered scientific knowledge in some vain attempt to purify the discipline?</p><p>One simple motive for the secession of science from poetry is the modern scientific dedication to objectivity.&nbsp;&nbsp;Poetry bears feeling, and for this reason may prove an unparalleled means of communicating the human experience, or even understanding human activity. Yet on the other hand science is deeply rooted in atomics and physicality.&nbsp;&nbsp;Science is at heart focused on how inanimate objects interact to produce phenomena: mechanism.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a sense in this pursuit, that there is little room for bias, feeling.&nbsp;&nbsp;And at the same time, this obsession with objectivity does not hold universal in our modern scientific cathedrals:&nbsp;&nbsp;Observer-dependent explanations like relativity, certainly stretch this law of objectivity in science.&nbsp;&nbsp;Biological explanations dependent on behavior, like socialization, also stretch the law objectivity.</p><p>Another often-claimed purpose for the separation of science and poetry, is the quest of clarity.&nbsp;&nbsp;But this prospect is also dubious, contradicted by the contemporary reliance on metaphor and simile in scientific writing.&nbsp;&nbsp;How often are groups of animals treated by scientific analysis as a series of cogs and gears?&nbsp;&nbsp;Think of economics, neural networking, and ecology.&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond molecular actors like the ATPase, much of biology is only abstractly understood of by way of comparison to machinery, and while it is quite likely that this is a useable format for conveying knowledge, it is not really so far from poetry as we may wish to believe.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div><p>In the end, the best way to illustrate mechanism for science may well be just that:&nbsp;&nbsp;illustration.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is often claimed that mathematics is the language of science, and while there is no doubt that it is a powerful language of engineering, much of our canonical scientific mathematics simply served to animate a dynamic explanation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Animation, on the other hand, is much more transparent than mathematics and remains equivalently objective:&nbsp;&nbsp;it shows how the parts of the molecule interact to produce the chemical reaction or how the parts of the cell interact to produce locomotion for the bacterium.&nbsp;&nbsp;All of the great natural philosophers understood the value of illustration in provision of cause, and today the best journals like&nbsp;<em>Nature</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Science</em>&nbsp;lean heavily on visualization, and increasingly, on animation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><p>When it comes to appending knowledge to an illustration of natural cause, why not invoke meter?&nbsp;&nbsp;Fundamentally, the poetic traditions of simile and metaphor already widespread in scientific writing are much more dangerous than rhythm to objective analysis, since they sacrifice detail for fuzzy insinuation.&nbsp;&nbsp;If poetry is as Aristotle suggests, simply the treatment of writing such that it produces pleasure for the reader, then perhaps modern science could be invigorated by some form of poetry.&nbsp;&nbsp;Afterall, science can only progress when it engages the interest of thinkers far and wide.&nbsp;&nbsp;If meter and harmony, like animation, extend science’s accessibility, then why not?</p><p>___________<br>Addendum:  For a recent YouTube episode, Quinn &amp; Mickey sat down a scholar of romantic poetry, Dr. Ruoji Tang, to consider some of the subjects discussed above from another angle.

                <div>
                    <p>The other day I was listening to <a href="http://makeitthentelleverybody.com/2019/04/sarah-bowie/">Make It Then Tell Everybody</a> and there was a discussion about having a grid to hand for putting comic page layouts together. I'm starting to put pages together for a comic so I thought I'd put one together for myself. As a starting point, I've got a compound grid of 3x3 and 4x4 which gives two standard options.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.nocturnalmonkey.com/content/images/2019/04/core-grids.png"></figure><p>The great thing about combining these two simple grids is it provides a really flexible framework for putting together loads of different panel layouts. Here are a few I quickly smashed together.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.nocturnalmonkey.com/content/images/2019/04/Examples-2.png"></figure><p>On the left is using the 2-panel width of the 4x4 grid and the 3-panel height of the 3x3 to create a straight forward 2x3 but moving along, you can see how the grid can be broken up to create a wide range of page layouts and this really is only a tiny sample.</p><p>I've been using this on a comic I've just started working on and it's really helping me get things moving. In the past, I'd laid panels out pretty ad-hoc, spending lots of time adjusting dimensions and gutters. This grid has reduced that time a lot for me. I'm able to thumbnail, figure out the best panel sizes within the grid and the concentrate on what's going in the panels.</p><figure><div><div><p><img src="https://blog.nocturnalmonkey.com/content/images/2019/05/A29FA858-2D91-4023-94CE-BD3ED2C046CC-2.jpg" width="2960" height="2961"></p><p><img src="https://blog.nocturnalmonkey.com/content/images/2019/05/EB328595-49FC-4A9D-BADC-3386A3B85432.JPG" width="3024" height="3024"></p></div></div></figure><p>Most people probably already have their own grid or way of laying out pages but if you've been wanting something to help you out, I've put the grid on Dropbox to <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/i3sfq8f6tc395ij/comic-grid.png?dl=0">download for free</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>I know, I know, at this point you want "Just Ship It" to be an actual person so you could punch it in the face. As an Indie Maker, that sentence can be super frustrating because it's tired, it's cliche, and your response is always "HEY! You don't understand... it's not that easy".  </p>&nbsp;<p>I agree, it's not easy, but it's always the right thing to do. </p>&nbsp;<p>Here's why.  </p>&nbsp;<p>I started building an app on 01.01.2018. It was New Year's Eve and we just had the crappiest night ever. Yes, imagine a night <em>so bad</em> that at midnight you decide "you know what, fuck it, I'm gonna work on WEB DEVELOPMENT".<br>That bad.  </p>&nbsp;<p>The MVP was ready in a few days. I'm not that good of a coder, it's just a simple app. The 0.0.1 alpha version was more than ready. I could've released it, share it with a couple of people, and call it a day. I could've done that with every single version that I made, at any point from 2018 until now. I just wanted to add one more thing. One more feature. Just this one more thing and people will like it. One more screen and everything is gonna make sense. I swear, just this one last thing and it's ready.  </p>&nbsp;<p>BAM, last moment decision from the world's biggest dumbass:
"People wouldn't use this if it doesn't have a proper native mobile app for it. Time to learn React Native and spend a few months on that 🤦️"   </p>&nbsp;<p>God, if time machines were real, past-Kitze would be shoved in a toilet so hard right now. </p>&nbsp;<p>After 2 years of development, juggling between the fucking horror that's the web platform, React Native, Expo, GraphQL, bitching about how there's no ideal tech stack, the good old jQuery and Filezilla days, switching to other projects, releasing <a href="https://sizzy.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">other apps</a>, losing passion, finding passion, coming back to the app, etc. etc. etc...  </p>&nbsp;<p>I just dropped it.  </p>&nbsp;<p>I was still using it but I stopped developing it and just dropped the idea of releasing the app, ever.</p>&nbsp;<p>After a while, I was using it, but I realized that I'm missing a lot of features, so I'd either have to go back to developing it, or I'd have to find an alternative.   </p>&nbsp;<p>And boy did I find one.  </p>&nbsp;<p>I was scrolling their landing page and I was happy and furious at the same time. Someone solved the problem that I was solving. It was like someone literally read my mind and started coding. WHAT.  </p>&nbsp;<p>I have previously sent a video of my app to a couple of people (closest I came to shipping it) so I started getting suspicious if someone actually shared the video of my app with these people because they were solving literally the same problem, and they most of the features that I had.  </p>&nbsp;<p>I started getting this overwhelming happy, sad, and panicky feeling. I literally cannot explain how I felt while scrolling their page.</p>&nbsp;<p>One moment I am scrolling their list of features giggling like a little kid with a 48$ bill in a candy store (yea I know 48$ bills don't make sense, but JavaScript doesn't make sense and you're still using it), one moment I want to find these people and THROW THEM IN A PIT OF LIONS.   </p>&nbsp;<p>FUCK.    </p>&nbsp;<p>It's not their fault. I was just slow. I didn't ship on time. I'm gonna go ahead and tattoo "JUST SHIP IT" on my forehead. Nah I wouldn't be able to see it there. On my arm maybe. Nvm, let me go back to scrolling their landing page.  </p>&nbsp;<p>Fuck. They have solved everything that I wanted to solve, and WAY more. Hey, maybe I should be happy? I don't have to code anymore. Yay!? No more web platform? BLISS. Oh crap... the world is never gonna see my app though. But at least I don't have to see React Native anymore. NICE! Wait... BUT I WASTED SO MUCH TIME ON IT. FUCK.  A bunch of mixed feelings.  </p>&nbsp;<p>Here comes the saddest part, so grab a pack of tissues.   </p>&nbsp;<p>After a little bit of hesitation, I made an account. I watched the videos in their help center. Every time I caught myself smiling about a clever way they implemented something I slapped myself. NO. Bad Kitze. You shouldn't like this. THEY'RE COMPETITORS. <em>sigh</em> Sure buddy, whatever you tell yourself. Competitors to a shitty codebase sitting on your hard drive.  </p>&nbsp;<p>For 2 frickin' years, I thought it's too early to release my app because it's clunky, buggy, it's missing features, blah, blah, blah. No one would ever use it, right? I was so wrong.  </p>&nbsp;<p>I started using their app.  </p>&nbsp;<p>Even though they were working on it for the past few years it's still slow, buggy, and super unpolished, it doesn't matter, because they shipped.   </p>&nbsp;<p>Their mobile app is terrible and it needs 10 seconds to sync. It doesn't matter, they shipped. And I'm looking forward to every single update they release.</p>&nbsp;<p>Their backlog of things to do is huge, but it doesn't matter, they ship every single week, and the app is growing along with the community.  </p>&nbsp;<p>"But Kitze, even though tHeY sHiPpEd no one would pay for something unpolished and broken, right?"  </p>&nbsp;<p>Oh, Indie Hackers. So clever, yet so naive.  </p>&nbsp;<p>Today my 30-day trial has expired. A tear rolled down my cheek for every single digit of my credit card that I entered in their app. I am officially not only a subscriber, but also a fan. Every time I'll get a payment notification it's gonna feel like stepping on a lego ... glued to a knife. My bank might as well change the notification from "You have paid 5$ to ThatCompany" to "You never shipped, loser".   </p>&nbsp;<p>My app is officially dead.  </p>&nbsp;<p>99% of you are in the same boat right now, but hopefully just a few weeks into your project. Don't be a dumbass like me. Take a breath, roll your eyes at the cliche saying, but please...  </p>&nbsp;<p>Just Ship It.  </p>&nbsp;<p>P.S I would totally release and show you my app but ... it's not ready yet.  </p>&nbsp;<hr><p>Thanks for reading this! I wrote another article about <a href="https://kitze.io/posts/github-stars-wont-pay-your-rent" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my successful shipping story</a>, so I'd appreciate if you give it a read!</p>&nbsp;</div></div></div></div>]]>

This pop-up was appearing on all pages, even on pages with no audio or video. To find out, I did a bunch of source code analysis and found out.</p><p>Reddit’s source code uses bundling and minification, but I was able to infer that in <code>./src/reddit/index.tsx</code>, a script was conditionally loaded into the page. If the <code>show_white_ops</code> A/B test flag was set, then it loaded another script: <a href="https://s.udkcrj.com/ag/386183/clear.js">https://s.udkcrj.com/ag/386183/clear.js</a>. That script loads <a href="https://s.udkcrj.com/2/4.71.0/main.js">https://s.udkcrj.com/2/4.71.0/main.js</a> (although it appears to test for a browser bug involving running JSON.parse with null bytes, and sometimes loads <a href="https://s.udkcrj.com/2/4.71.0/JSON-main.js">https://s.udkcrj.com/2/4.71.0/JSON-main.js</a> instead, but I haven’t analyzed this file (it looks fairly similar though), and also does nothing if due to <em>another</em> browser bug, <code>!("a" == "a"[0])</code> evaluates to true).</p><p>The purpose of all of this appears to be both fingerprinting and preventing ad fraud. I’ve determined that <code>udkcrj.com</code> belongs to <a href="https://www.whiteops.com/">White Ops</a>. I have infered this from the name of Reddit’s feature flag, and mentions of White Ops which is a “global leader in bot mitigation, bot prevention, and fraud protection”. They appear to do this by collecting <strong>tons</strong> of data about the browser, and analyzing it. I must say, their system is quite impressive.</p><p>Back to the DRM issue, it appears that the script is checking what DRM solutions are available, but not actually using them. However, just checking is enough to trigger Firefox into displaying the DRM popup.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>A few years ago I wrote <a href="https://apenwarr.ca/log/20170810"><em>The World in Which IPv6 was a Good
Design</em></a>. I’m still
pretty proud of that article, but I thought I should update it a bit.</p>
<p>No, I’m not switching sides. IPv6 is just as far away from universal
adoption, or being a “good design” for our world, as it was three
years ago. But since then I co-founded a company that turned out to be
accidentally based on the principles I outlined in that article. Or
rather, from turning those principles upside-down.</p>
<p>In that article, I explored the overall history of networking and the
considerations that led to IPv6. I’m not going to cover that ground
again. Instead, I want to talk about attitude.</p>
<h3 id="internets-interoperability-and-postels-law">Internets, Interoperability, and Postel’s Law</h3>
<p>Did you ever wonder why “Internet” is capitalized?</p>
<p>When I first joined the Internet in the 1990s, I found some
now-long-lost introductory tutorial. It talked about the difference
between an internet (lowercase i) and the Internet (capital I). An
internet is “any network that connects smaller networks together.” The
Internet is… well… it turns out that you don’t need more than one
internet. If you have two internets, it is nearly unavoidable that
someone will soon figure out how to connect them together. All you need
is one person to build that one link, and your two internets become one.
By induction then, the Internet is the end result when you make it easy
enough for a single motivated individual to join one internet to
another, however badly.</p>
<p>Internets are fundamentally sloppy. No matter how many committees you
might form, ultimately connections are made by individuals plugging
things together. Those things might follow the specs, or not. They might
follow those specs well, or badly. They might violate the specs because
everybody else is also violating the specs and that’s the only way to
make anything work. The connections themselves might be fast or slow, or
flakey, or only functional for a few minutes each day, or subject to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMPRNet">amateur radio regulations</a>, or
worse. The endpoints might be high-powered servers, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/industries/little-known-story-first-iot-device/">vending machines</a>,
toasters, or satellites, running any imaginable operating system. Only
one thing’s for sure: they all have bugs.</p>
<p>Which brings us to Postel’s Law, which I always bring up when I write
about networks. When I do, invariably there’s a slew of responses
trying to debate whether Postel’s Law is “right,” or “a good idea,”
as if it were just an idea and not a force of nature.</p>
<p>Postel’s Law says simply this: be conservative in what you send, and
liberal in what you accept. Try your best to correctly handle the bugs
produced by the other end. The most successful network node is one that
plans for every “impossible” corruption there might be in the input
and does something sensible when it happens. (Sometimes, yes,
“something sensible” is to throw an error.)</p>
<p>[Side note: Postel’s Law doesn’t apply in every situation. You
probably don’t want your compiler to auto-fix your syntax errors,
unless your compiler is javascript or HTML, which, kidding aside,
actually were designed to do this sort of auto-correction for Postel’s
Law reasons. But the law does apply in virtually every complex situation
where you need to communicate effectively, including human
conversations. The way I like to say it is, “It takes two to
miscommunicate.” A great listener, <em>or</em> a skilled speaker, can resolve
a lot of conflicts.]</p>
<p>Postel’s Law is the principle the Internet is based on. Not because Jon
Postel was such a great salesperson and talked everyone into it, but
because that is the only winning evolutionary strategy when internets
are competing. Nature doesn’t care what you think about Postel’s Law,
because the only Internet that happens will be the one that follows
Postel’s Law. Every other internet will, without exception, eventually
be joined to The Internet by some goofball who does it wrong, but just
well enough that it adds value, so that eventually nobody will be
willing to break the connection. And then to maintain that connection
will require further application of Postel’s Law.</p>
<h3 id="ipv6-a-different-attitude">IPv6: a different attitude</h3>
<p>If you’ve followed my writing, you might have seen me refer to IPv6 as
“a second internet that not everyone is connected to.” There’s a lot
wrapped up in that claim. Let’s back up a bit.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://apenwarr.ca/log/20170810"><em>The World in Which IPv6 was a Good Design</em></a>,
I talked about the lofty design goals leading to IPv6: eliminate bus networks,
get rid of MAC addresses, no more switches and hubs, no NATs, and so on.
What I didn’t realize at the time, which I now think is essential, is that
these goals were a <em>fundamental attitude shift</em> compared to what went
into IPv4 (and the earlier protocols that led to v4).</p>
<p>IPv4 evolved as a pragmatic way to build <em>an internet</em> out of a bunch of
networks and machines that existed already. Postel’s Law says you’d
best deal with reality as it is, not as you wish it were, and so they
did. When something didn’t connect, someone hacked on it until it
worked. Sloppy. Fits and starts, twine and duct tape. But most
importantly, nobody really thought this whole mess would work as well as
it turned out to work, or last as long as it turned out to last. Nobody
knew, at the time, that whenever you start building internets, they
always lead inexorably to The Internet.</p>
<p>These (mostly) same people, when they started to realize the monster
they had created, got worried. They realized that 32-bit addresses,
which they had originally thought would easily last for the lifetime of
their little internet, were not even enough for one address per person
in the world. They found out, not really to anyone’s surprise, that
Postel’s Law, unyielding as it may be, is absolutely a maintenance
nightmare. They thought they’d better hurry up and fix it all, before
this very popular Internet they had created, which had become a
valuable, global, essential service, suddenly came crashing down and it
would all be their fault.</p>
<p>[Spoiler: it never did come crashing down. Well, not permanently. There
were and are still short-lived flare-ups every now and then, but a few
dedicated souls hack it back together, and so it goes.]</p>
<p>IPv6 was created in a new environment of fear, scalability concerns, and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-system_effect">Second System
Effect</a>.
As we covered last time, its goal was to replace The Internet with a New
Internet — one that wouldn’t make all the same mistakes. It would have
fewer hacks. And we’d upgrade to it incrementally over a few years,
just as we did when upgrading to newer versions of IP and TCP back in
the old days.</p>
<p>We can hardly blame people for believing this would work. Even the term
“Second System Effect” was only about 20 years old at the time, and
not universally known. Every previous Internet upgrade had gone fine.
Nobody had built such a big internet before, with so much Postel’s Law,
with such a variety of users, vendors, and systems, so nobody knew it
would be different.</p>
<p>Well, here we are 25 years later, and not much has changed. If we were
feeling snarky, we could perhaps describe IPv6 as “the String Theory of
networking”: a decades-long boondoggle that attracts True Believers,
gets you flamed intensely if you question the doctrine, and which is
notable mainly for how much progress it has held back.</p>
<p>Luckily we are not feeling snarky.</p>
<h3 id="two-internets">Two Internets?</h3>
<p>There are, of course, still no exceptions to the rule that if you build
any internet, it will inevitably (and usually quickly) become connected
to The Internet.</p>
<p>I wasn’t sitting there when it happened, but it’s likely the very
first IPv6 node ran on a machine that was also connected to IPv4, if
only so someone could telnet to it for debugging. Today, even “pure
IPv6” nodes are almost certainly connected to a network that, if
configured correctly, can find a way to any IPv4 node, and vice versa.
It might not be pretty, it might involve a lot of proxies, NATs,
bridges, and firewalls. But <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirk_Gently">it’s all
connected</a>.</p>
<p>In that sense, there is still just one Internet. It’s the big one.
Since day 1, The Internet has never spoken just one protocol; it has
always been a hairy mess of routers, bridges, and gateways, running many
protocols at many layers. IPv6 is one of them.</p>
<p>What makes IPv6 special is that its proponents are not content for it to
be <em>an internet</em> that connects to The Internet. No! It’s the chosen
one. Its destiny is to be The Internet. As a result, we don’t <em>only</em>
have bridges and gateways to join the IPv6 internets and the IPv4
internet (although we do).</p>
<p>Instead, IPv6 wants to eventually run directly on every node. End users
have been, uh, <em>rather unwilling</em> to give up IPv4, so for now, every
node has that too. As a result, machines are often joined directly to
what I call “two competing internets” — the IPv4 one and the IPv6
one.</p>
<p>Okay, at this point our terminology has become very confusing. Sorry.
But all this leads to the question I know you want me to answer: Which
internet is better!?</p>
<h3 id="combinatorics">Combinatorics</h3>
<p>I’ll get to that, but first we need to revisit what I bravely called
<a href="https://apenwarr.ca/log/20170704">Avery’s Laws of Wifi Reliability</a>, which are
not laws, were surely invented by someone else (since they’re mostly a
paraphrasing of a trivial subset of CAP theorem), and as it turns out,
apply to more than just wifi. Oops. I guess the name is wrong in almost
every possible way. Still, they’re pretty good guidelines.</p>
<p>Let’s refresh:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Rule #1: if you have two wifi router brands that work with 90% of client
devices, and your device has a problem with one of them, replacing the wifi
router brand will fix the problem 90% of the time. Thus, an ISP offering both
wifi routers has a [1 - (10% x 10%)] = 99% chance of eventual success.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rule #2: if you’re running two wifi routers at once (say, a primary router and
an extender), and both of them work “correctly” for about 90% of the time each
day, the chance that your network has no problems all day is 81%.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In Rule #1, which I call “a OR b”, success compounds and failure
rates drop.</p>
<p>In Rule #2, which I call “a AND b”, failure compounds and success
drops.</p>
<p>But wait, didn’t we add redundancy in both cases?</p>
<p>Depending …</p></div></div>

<p>When I decided to leave Windows Desktop App Development for Web Development, I opened up to a whole new world. First of all, learning Ruby, improving my HTML and CSS knowledge, but also working on Mac + Linux instead of Windows.</p>



<p>On Windows, I deployed applications to either a Network Share or an IIS (Internet Information Services, Microsoft’s Internet Web Server, competing with Apache and NGINX) instance. Both required either the Windows explorer or a Remote Desktop Connection. </p>



<p>In this new job, we deployed our Ruby applications to Linux Servers. I had used Linux before on my computer, but this was different. As it turned out, Linux servers don’t have any graphical user interface. The only available interface is the command line. To connect to a remote Linux server, we also wouldn’t use Remote Desktop but SSH (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell" target="_blank">Secure Socket Shell</a>). For me, SSH was a steep learning curve because it came with so many things all at once. </p>



<h2>General SSH Concepts</h2>



<p>SSH allows us to connect to a remote computer. Usually, that remote computer is a Linux machine, but it also works with macOS and even Windows. When we connect to that remote machine, we have terminal access to it, and can execute commands. It looks and feels like executing commands on our local machine.</p>



<p>One of the key features of SSH is that the entire connection is encrypted. If somebody was to listen in on the network traffic, they couldn’t see the commands you executed or any of the results that came back. Previous remote access protocols didn’t have this feature (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telnet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">telnet</a>).</p>



<p>To ensure this level of security, SSH uses Key Pairs. An SSH Key consists of two files, a public, and a private file. The private file stays on your computer, and the public part lives on the remote machine you want to connect to. <br>Why two files though? The reason for that is that SSH uses asymmetric encryption (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Read more here about asymmetric encryption</a>).</p>

<h2>Step 1: SSH Keys</h2>



<p>Before we can log in to any remote computer, we need to generate a new SSH key pair. Linux and macOS have tools preinstalled, for Windows you either need to install ssh manually or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10" target="_blank">use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) </a>as I do in these examples. </p>



<p>Open a new terminal and make sure that you’re in your home directory:</p>



<pre>$</pre>



<p>Now, we use a command to generate a new key pair: </p>



<pre>$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"</pre>



<p>Once you hit return, <code>ssh-keygen </code>will ask a few questions:</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="810" data-permalink="https://21-lessons.com/ssh_keygen_questions/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/21-lessons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ssh_keygen_questions.jpg?fit=1012%2C303&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1012,303" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="ssh_keygen_questions" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/21-lessons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ssh_keygen_questions.jpg?fit=300%2C90&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/21-lessons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ssh_keygen_questions.jpg?fit=980%2C293&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/21-lessons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ssh_keygen_questions.jpg?w=980&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/21-lessons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ssh_keygen_questions.jpg?w=980&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>Generating a new SSH Key</figcaption></figure>



<p>Let’s look at this a bit closer:</p>



<ul><li>At first, it’ll ask for the absolute filename. In this case, it suggests <code>/home/jan/.ssh/id_rsa</code>. If that looks good, press return, otherwise specify a new path.</li><li>An SSH Key can be protected by a passphrase. Then, whenever you want to use it, you need to type in the password first. It adds an additional layer of security on top and I highly recommend using a password.</li><li>That’s it! Now, your key is ready to use. </li></ul>



<p>Where does it live though? By default, all SSH Keys are stored in <code>.ssh</code>, which is located in your home directory:</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="812" data-permalink="https://21-lessons.com/ssh_keys/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/21-lessons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ssh_keys.jpg?fit=918%2C278&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="918,278" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="ssh_keys" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/21-lessons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ssh_keys.jpg?fit=300%2C91&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/21-lessons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ssh_keys.jpg?fit=918%2C278&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i2.wp.com/21-lessons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ssh_keys.jpg?w=980&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/21-lessons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ssh_keys.jpg?w=980&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>SSH Keys in ~/.ssh</figcaption></figure>



<p>Before we move on to the next step, let’s example the screenshot above a bit closer. You see, that both <code>id_rsa </code>and <code>id_rsa.pub</code> have very restrictive file permissions. Why is that? <br>These restrictive permissions protect the key from any unauthorized use. That means, the key can only be used by us and not anyone else who might be using this computer. Otherwise, another user on this computer could log in, copy the keys out of our home directory, and impersonate us. Therefore, SSH Keys by default are restricted to our own use only. In fact, the ssh command refuses to use these keys if the file permissions are too permissive.</p>



<h2>Connecting to a remote machine</h2>



<p>What do we need to connect to a remote server? </p>



<ul><li>Its address, which can be either an IP Address (e.g. <code>192.168.0.1</code>) or a host name (<code>myserver.example.com</code>)</li><li>A user on that machine</li><li>A key configured on the machine</li></ul>



<p>Let’s connect:</p>



<pre>$ ssh myuser@myserver.example.com -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa</pre>



<p>This will open a new connection to <code>myserver.example.com</code> and create a terminal session as <code>myuser</code>. We tell the ssh command which key to use via <code>-i ~/.ssh/id_rsa</code>.</p>



<p>From then on, we can run commands on that server.</p>



<h2>Associate an SSH Key with a User</h2>



<p>Before we can connect to a new server for the first time, we have to associate our key with a user on that machine. Otherwise, every connection attempt will result in a “<em>Permission Denied” error</em>.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="819" data-permalink="https://21-lessons.com/ssh_permission_denied/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/21-lessons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ssh_permission_denied.jpg?fit=707%2C157&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="707,157" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="ssh_permission_denied" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/21-lessons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ssh_permission_denied.jpg?fit=300%2C67&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/21-lessons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ssh_permission_denied.jpg?fit=707%2C157&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/21-lessons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ssh_permission_denied.jpg?w=980&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/21-lessons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ssh_permission_denied.jpg?w=980&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>SSH Permission Denied</figcaption></figure>



<p>The server rejects all connection attempts with keys it doesn’t recognize to prevent malicious activity. </p>



<p>How do we configure an SSH Key though? On the server, each user has a <code>.ssh</code> directory within their home directory. On our local machine, <code>.ssh</code> has all our SSH keys. On the server, we find a single file: <code>authorized_keys</code>.</p>



<p>This file contains a list of all public keys that are allowed to connect. Our key needs to be in this file as well.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="821" data-permalink="https://21-lessons.com/authorized_keys/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/21-lessons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/authorized_keys.jpg?fit=1200%2C256&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1200,256" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="authorized_keys" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/21-lessons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/authorized_keys.jpg?fit=300%2C64&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/21-lessons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/authorized_keys.jpg?fit=980%2C209&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/21-lessons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/authorized_keys.jpg?w=980&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/21-lessons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/authorized_keys.jpg?w=980&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>.ssh/authorized_keys</figcaption></figure>



<p>How do we get it in there though? On an existing server, we ask somebody who already has an account who then configures the public key for us. </p>



<p>If this is a brand-new server, you can add it through your hoster’s web interface (in my case, DigitalOcean). They then will take care of adding the key on the machine once it’s created. </p>







<p>I’m curious, did this guide help you? What other questions about do you have? Let me know down in the comments.</p>

<p>My Dad first gave me The Talk when I was 12 or 13. We were driving down the freeway, and he asked me if I’d ever been judged or harassed for being black. I remember this conversation vividly because my family doesn’t talk too much about their personal experiences with racial discrimination. For the most part, they tend to focus on their blessings and joys and triumphs. This way of remembering runs deep. Both my grandmother and her father before her engaged in a “long-standing practice of editing [their] memory, an artful forgetting for the sake of affirming the family’s self-worth” and moving forward with their heads held high.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>In my grandma’s time, families had more of a choice about what to pass onto their kids. They could leave certain things out and emphasize the good in the hope that doing so would create a better future. Today, digital media has taken that option off the table. The internet has flattened the vast archive of the past and made history unprecedentedly (and unrelentingly) immediate. No matter what my grandma chose to share with me about her upbringing, I can go online and find all kinds of information about the world she lived in, the hardships she might’ve endured. The distant past is brought back to life in the digital realm, as if no time has passed at all.</p>

<p>Digital databases are “<a href="https://theconvivialsociety.substack.com/p/narrative-collapse">unparalleled memory machines</a>” that have radically transformed how information and stories flow between grandparents and children, students and teachers, politicians and voters, journalists and citizens. What Marshall McLuhan called the “<a href="https://www.are.na/block/7828126">perfect memory</a>” of computers has, in our time, spawned a <a href="http://mycours.es/gamedesign2012/files/2012/08/The-Garden-of-Forking-Paths-Jorge-Luis-Borges-1941.pdf">garden</a> of competing narratives and conceptions of the past/present/future. Digital media serves up an inhumanly large corpus of data that becomes raw material for new subcultures, ideologies, and alternative histories. In today’s chaotic media environment, not even a global pandemic can restore a shared sense of Reality.</p>

<p>Like Louisa Banks in the 2016 film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrival_(film)"><em>Arrival</em></a>, we are all trying to figure out how the “alien language” of digital tech has transformed our psyches and warped our sense of time. How did the internet disrupt 20th century timekeeping systems and spark an insurgence of alternative historical narratives? How do old media institutions try (and fail) to keep up with the narratives of online subcultures? How does the immediate accessibility of so many alt histories undermine our ability to create shared futures? And how might a more ecological awareness of the internet help us adapt to our disorienting digital time machines?</p>

<p>How did digital media disrupt 20th century timekeeping systems and spark an insurgence of alternative historical narratives?</p>


<p><img src="https://aaronzlewis.com/images/forking-memes/cover-worlds-collide.png"></p>

<p>Arrival (2016)</p>


<p><span>In the 19th and 20th centuries</span>, innovations like the telegraph, time zones, radio, and television led to new patterns of mass connectivity and synchronization. Time was made visual and divided into smaller and smaller units that allowed us to achieve unprecedented levels of coordination. But in our own century, digital media is fracturing our collective experience of clock time. “By the 1930s,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSE8VdaZNuY&amp;t=1s">says Venkatesh Rao</a>, “we had grid-synchronized electric clock time, which was an important move because we went from producing time in clock towers and sun dials to producing time in a central location and distributing it via a grid, so that it was piped into your home like water or electricity. By the 1940s, we were distributing time over the oceans. By the 1980s, we had <span>GPS</span> … This trend has come to its logical conclusion because we all live inside a cage of time made up of 32 satellites orbiting Earth.”</p>

<p>In the digital age, everything from the evening news to the 9&nbsp;– 5 workday has been freed from the cage of industrial era timekeeping. As long as you have an internet connection, you can march to the beat of your own second hand.</p>

<p>This shift has been disorienting for the people who lived through it. My parents, for instance, still have a very hard time remembering that Netflix shows do not “come on” at a certain time. This seemingly trivial confusion points to deeper psychological differences between children of the television and children of the internet. Until the invention of “time shifting” and <span>DVR</span>, television viewers were beholden to a schedule that was designed by faraway producers/timekeepers. As a rule, twentieth century time was imposed on people from the top-down. Twenty-first century time is a <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronzlewis/status/1125481314310746112?s=20">bottom-up</a> choose your own adventure story that allows people to make their own <a href="https://www.ourmachine.net/writing/new-time-machines/">time machines</a> and live any<em>when</em>.</p>

<blockquote darkmode="" data-title="Narrative%20Collapse" data-author="L. M. Sacasas" cite="https://theconvivialsociety.substack.com/p/narrative-collapse">
Narrative is an unavoidably temporal technology; the Database is indifferent to time. The experience of Database-time is of an undifferentiated blob. Having trouble with the flow of time? Maybe it’s not just the pandemic. Maybe it’s because we live in the Database and in the Database ordinary time is irrelevant.

</blockquote>





<p>The de-centralization of timekeeping brought about by digital media harkens back to a much older style of measuring time. Before the invention of the telegraph, there was no way to instantaneously synchronize timekeeping devices across long distances. No time zones, no universal standard against which clock towers could be evaluated for accuracy. Timekeeping was more an art than a science —&nbsp;each village emitted its own “time zone”. Much like the townships of old, every internet community has its own “<a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/08/16/multitemporality-1/">subjective time zone</a>”.</p>

<p>The disruption of the old timekeeping regime created a void that’s being filled by new online communities, cliques, and cults. Whereas the industrial schedule provided a sense of structure and stability and continuity, <span>D.I.Y.</span> timekeeping often feels aimless and disorienting and uncertain. People are seeking out groups and ideologies that put them “back in time”, and many internet subcultures do exactly that.</p>

<p>Thanks to the “perfect memory” of digital media, internet subcultures are able to create their own visions of past, present, and future. The internet has freed them from the top-down schedules and narratives of mass media. With nearly all of recorded history at their fingertips, they can cherry-pick interesting scraps of information from the archives and construct new grand narratives with unprecedented ease. And so, digital media has enabled a wave of “deepwater drilling” for obscure texts and long-forgotten histories — fueling an explosion of new political coalitions that bear little resemblance to the party lines of the last century. In a 2019 <a href="https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/vox/the-ezra-klein-show/e/60651534">interview</a> with the popular philosophy YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNvsIonJdJ5E4EXMa65VYpA">Contrapoints</a>, Ezra Klein reflected on how digital media has re-shaped the ideological landscape over the last decade:</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>It’s amazing to me how much esoteric ideological and social theory is back operating within near-to-popular discourse now.</strong> As somebody who’s kind of a nerd for a lot of this stuff, I find it lovely, but also I’m really stunned to see people discussing tankies and neoliberalism and anarchism. It seems to me that, through the way Reddit and YouTube and social media work, there’s such an emphasis on creating distinctions and communities, and it’s just created <strong>an explosion of interest in ideological sub-groupings that had been completely forgotten</strong>. I started in politics in the early ‘00s, and it just didn’t have this flavor. If you were a kid looking to get into politics then, you couldn’t find these incredibly fine-grained sub-groupings to become part of and then start meme-ing yourself into a community with. It really feels different to me than when I was growing up in it.</p></blockquote>

<p>The explosion of subcultures and grand narratives that Ezra Klein describes can be seen in the surreal ideological memes that often show up on Twitter and Instagram. These memes are extremely dense cultural artifacts that accumulate layers and layers of meaning/allusion over time. Like the jargon of academia, memes look like nonsense to outsiders but facilitate deep communication between members of a subculture.</p>

<p><img src="https://aaronzlewis.com/images/forking-memes/post-left-memes.png"></p>

<p>A selection of ideology memes from Twitter and Joshua Citarella’s 2018 <a href="http://joshuacitarella.com/_pdf/Politigram_Post-left_2018_short.pdf">Instagram ethnography</a>. “Some of the teenagers who ran Pepe meme accounts in 2016 are now young Marxist scholars who spend their evenings gaming and chatting about Hegel in Discord servers with PhD students,” says Citarella. “I wouldn’t believe it myself if I hadn’t met them.”</p>


<p>Each subculture has an implicit understanding of its “ideological conversion funnel”. This phrase, borrowed from digital marketing, refers to the stages that people go through on the way to becoming a True Believer — from first contact with a mysterious meme to full-on understanding of a grand narrative. The conversion process is known to the in-group, but largely illegible to outsiders. Unlike offline communities, these subcultures aren’t always neatly labeled, and people don’t consciously <em>choose</em> to join them. The “gravity” or “current” of social media algorithms pulls people into orbit around ideological sub-groups. Algorithms are the riverbed, and users are the water.</p>

<p>In the early days of the internet, the Web’s surface was relatively smooth and its “gravitational force” was weak. You could random walk without getting sucked into any black holes. During the 2010s, social media platforms “dug into the Web surface, dragging activities down their slopes … As a result of this magnetic-like attraction, caused by the web slope, Internet users slowly slide down the slope in a digital drift,” <a href="https://louisedrulhe.fr/internet-atlas/">writes Louise Druhle</a>. The virus has likely accelerated this process because it’s pushed so much cultural activity online.</p>

<p>Sometimes you can sense the current pushing you this way or that. Other times, you’re totally in the dark. It’s certainly possible to swim against the current, but it takes a lot of effort and awareness. You usually end up in a digital …</p></article></section></div>

<p>I see Tailwind being used by a lot of people. I totally get why it’s so popular. It looks great, the design choices are sensible, and you have copy-pastable code that reliably renders in the same way.</p>



<p>It nets you results quickly which feels nice and rewarding. I think Tailwind is a perfect framework for two kinds of situations:</p>



<ol><li> people who don’t want to learn CSS</li><li>people who want a standardized look and want to copy paste from an external library (i.e. Tailwind UI)</li></ol>



<p>I mostly wanted to shut up about Tailwind, and I hoped that people would realize it should be avoided after a while. But that doesn’t seem to be happening. So I think I have to fight the fight and talk about why you should not use Tailwind.</p>



<p>I have had a lot of thoughts about Tailwind, and most of these thoughts come from a place of being the code maintainer of a large scale web application codebase. So mind you, when I am talking about regret in the title, I am talking about a <strong>big web app context</strong> where your code is <strong>going to be maintained for years to come</strong>.</p>



<p>I am not talking about your Sunday side project. I am talking about real, big work® projects here. I am talking about maintaining something that has a lot of complexity that many people will work on for years to come.</p>



<p>You might be tasked with choosing a CSS architecture for that. And you might have heard about this framework called Tailwind. It’s popular right now and it seems to be the 2020 choice.</p>



<p>You look at the website and you see this nice framework that promises you that things are going to be cool in Tailwind land. And you might be thinking: cool, let’s try that.</p>



<p>I urge you to reconsider your options. I would advise you <strong>to not use it.</strong></p>



<p>I really don’t know why Tailwind got so popular over the last year. I think it’s because it does a <strong>lot</strong> of things right. Surely if the authors can make $1.8M in preorders for Tailwind UI, something must be up. But at a fundamental level, I think its ideas are wrong and lead to problems, and I am going to explain why.</p>



<p>The main problem is that the kind of code you are creating with Tailwind, especially on large scale applications, is the kind of code that you’re going to have to swap out in a few years. Why? Because it’s unmaintainable at best. I will explain below.</p>



<h3>An API on top of an API</h3>



<p>Tailwind is a framework that heavily relies on utility classes. Utility classes are classes that typically do one single thing e.g. <code>.flex</code> makes a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> have <code>display: flex</code>. Utility classes create an API on top of what is already a declarative API (CSS itself).</p>



<p>This can lead to problems when</p>



<ol><li>the original API (CSS itself) might change in the process, so now you have a mapping problem</li><li>the mapping itself is not that great, and has bugs on its own</li></ol>



<p>To dive into situation 1, let’s think about how maybe CSS grid will have an evolution in its syntax. Now you don’t just have to update your code, but also the in-between framework (Tailwind).</p>



<p>To dive into an example of situation 2: I was on a project a while ago where somebody mapped Flexbox to utility classes <em>wrongly </em>(i.e. the mapping contained obvious mistakes) and that code had made into production, was versioned, and we couldn’t change it. I thought that was very painful.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Tailwind’s coding style creates its own problems, which you then have to solve</h3>



<p>There’s also a deeper problem: because you are essentially recreating the CSS API with utility classes, you end up with a huge file. The current Tailwind utilities.css file is 1.8 megabyte and contains 80 000 lines of code.</p>



<p>Tailwind proponents will tell you that you can remove unused CSS with Tailwind’s tooling. And this is exactly the problem that I want to talk about: now you have to solve a problem that’s inherent to the framework, adding complexity to your project.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://routify.dev/">Routify</a> and Svelte Discord channels I routinely see people struggling to get the toolchain around Tailwind working. So many people struggling with a toolchain that is totally unnecessary is a real problem. Removing code that shouldn’t be there in the first place should not be necessary.</p>



<h3>Sidenote: I’m not against utility classes</h3>



<p>Surely it feels nice to be able to quickly write flexbox things in a declarative way, and it has it’s uses. I’ve happily wrote declarative flexbox code in the past to quickly set up layouts. I am not against utility classes at all. It’s quite handy to set up layouts quickly with utility classes. I can also totally relate to the idea of designing in the browser with a set of utility classes.</p>



<p>When I do web app layouts we typically have a lot of different panes and panels going on in your app with varied logic about how they should resize. In a prototyping or an early app phase it’s super handy to not have to write a specific (BEM) component for everything and just build things out with utility classes.</p>



<p>But you have to be careful with utility classes. Because what you’re essentially doing is building a complication on top of CSS itself.</p>



<p>When you use a utility classes, for example declaring a flex utility on a div, you are doing it in HTML instead of declaring it in CSS this can quickly lead to unmaintainable code.</p>



<p>I use utility classes in one-off situations. Tailwind style code uses utility classes for <strong>everything</strong>. Tailwind lovers will now come back to me with arguments about <code>@apply</code> but this is just throwing more complexity on something that is already complex.</p>



<h3><strong>Adding complexity to complexity</strong></h3>



<p>Tailwind’s HTML code is fine for very simple projects (which will now have the drag of a whole toolchain to purge unused selectors but OK).</p>



<p>But let’s just imagine you have a bit of a bigger project, with a basic app layout that is working, with a few panels and a few buttons.</p>



<p>You now have to update the code for the next requirement – a bit of responsiveness. The UI has to change according to a breakpoint. So you add some Tailwind breakpoint classes to the thing you are making.</p>



<p>You realize your specific situation requires a very specific breakpoint. So you change your Tailwind config to add this breakpoint. You kind of realize it would be easier to just write the breakpoint directly in CSS, but you want to do things the Tailwind way.</p>



<p>If you would do things the regular CSS way, your media queries list basically lives in two worlds: the tailwind config and a local CSS file. And now you’ve lost your breakpoint structure. So you have to adhere to the Tailwind style.</p>



<p>And then let’s say you have a new situation: dark mode has to be supported. So suddenly your colors all have to change according to the dark mode logic. So now you add a bunch of classes to whatever you are creating again… you look at your button code and you see that the color of the button is directly in the HTML (<code>gray-100</code>). And the opposed color is actually called <code>gray-900</code> in your design system. So now you add a class to the button for the dark situations. And you now realize that there are 7 variants of your button in your codebase and they all have different class combinations.</p>



<p>Now, with the previous responsive example, and this dark thing piled on top of it, you have a sorry mess.</p>



<p>And then you realize that some aspects of what you’re doing would be way easier to handle directly in (S)CSS, using contextual media queries and proper use of the cascade.</p>



<p>Maybe your web app is never going to see the complexity I am talking about. Maybe your apps are not responsive or they don’t support dark mode. But most of my work supports some form of skinnability, is as responsive as possible and needs to be maintained over several yerars.</p>



<p>Putting values on the same class level in HTML is basically destroying the cascade for you. So don’t do it.</p>



<h3><strong>Complexity overload and no proper way to manage it</strong></h3>



<p>The problem with Tailwind is that you end up with an overload of classes in your HTML and no way to manage these.</p>



<p>Tailwind’s creator says it’s not a problem because your code can essentially lives in deep presentational components and it can be abstracted away. But this kind of coding strategy leads to its own problems (e.g. prop drilling)</p>



<p>I’m especially wary of this situation where you have one button that has 6 HTML classes, and then another button that has 5 HTML classes, and another one that has 7 HTML classes. And they’re all different combinations. Now you have to do some serious digging through the codebase to try and bring everything in line, and you’re going to be comparing which of the three buttons have class overlap. Nobody is waiting for that task. And frankly, it’s probably just nog going to happen.</p>



<p>It’s code rot that’s going to happen as soon as you have a few people working on a project with moderate complexity.</p>



<h3>I fear for a Tailwind future</h3>



<p>I already see Tailwind popping up all the time in Javascript articles that have nothing to do with CSS. The authors use it because it’s a quick way to style their tutorial. In the process they’re halving the shelf life of whatever they’re writing, and dirtying up their examples with a boatload of HTML classes.</p>



<p>I fear for the general codebases of web apps when too many people decide that Tailwind is the way to go. Now, on the other hand, this means I’ll have an infinite stream of work to refactor bad codebases to better ones. So I guess I’m not complaining.</p>



<p>Just do yourself a favor and stop using Tailwind.</p>

<p>Historically, US Presidents have entered the White House at a <a href="https://t.co/v8DD3uCI85?amp=1">median age of 55</a>. </p>



<p>Trump was the oldest ever to become president. If he is re-elected and serves a full second term, he would become the oldest sitting president of all-time (surpassing Reagan in his second term). If Biden is elected, he would become the oldest sitting president of all-time too, on his first day. </p>



<p>We are going the wrong way.</p>



<p>Bernie and Bloomberg were even older than Biden. Warren would have been older than Trump upon election. Of the 7 candidates who won at least 1 delegate in the Democratic Primary, 4 were in their 70s, 1 was in her 60s, and 2 were in their 30s. Isn’t it odd that none of them were in their 40s or 50s? It seems that the ages of our presidential candidate’s are becoming as polarized as their politics. There is no one in the middle! I want a middle candidate for president in terms of both age and politics.</p>



<p>In terms of approximating an appropriate age, 40s and 50s seem like a reasonable range. Cognitive function is certainly not all that makes a good president but it would seem to be a significant factor. According to a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797614567339?casa_token=L29u1CmuY6gAAAAA%3AHwbJVxHMdjeQxoe1A1UcjnE-sTEy1YhbSyhlQic62On1RpUMpAd0JKWh7H2IvB3tj5dmN8nw2g4x&amp;journalCode=pssa">study </a>in Psychological Science, it does not look like anything good happens after 55. Of course, there is something to be said for growing wiser with age and other good arguments of that nature which are totally valid. I should clarify that when I say that nothing good happens after 55, I am stricly speaking in scientific terms of cognitive function for the average person. No offense to my elders (and sorry for calling you elders).</p>

<p>There are other studies that suggest the best age for decision-making and leadership tends to be during a person’s 50s. Of course, there are many exceptions. This is not an exact science applicable to every person by any means. Still, it seems like reasonable enough support to justify a solid range in which being too young or too old should almost never be an issue.</p>



<p>Politics completely aside, the age range of recent candidates like Yang (45), O’Rourke (47), Cruz (49), Rubio (49), Booker (51), and Harris (55) seems to be an appropriate one. They are all between 45 and 55 which presents an even narrower ranger than what I previously defined as 40s and 50s. Again, I am not saying that this is a range that our president needs to be within by any means, but it seem like a good age range to be within nonetheless. I may have issues with any or all of these candidates listed above but in no case are any of my top concerns in any way related to their ages. Same goes for Kanye (43).</p>



<p>It is helpful also to think about the best leaders our world has to offer outside of politics. I think it is safe to assume that the most successful companies tend to have some of the most successful CEOs.</p>



<p>Here are the ages of the CEOs of the 7 largest companies in the world:</p>



<ul><li>Microsoft’s Satya Nadella (52) </li><li>Apple’s Tim Cook (59) </li><li>Amazon’s Jeff Bezos (56) </li><li>Alphabet’s Sundar Pichai (47) </li><li>Alibaba’s Daniel Zhang  (48) </li><li>Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg (36) </li><li>Tencent’s Ma Huateng (48) </li></ul>



<p>The median age of those world-leading CEOs is 48 and the average is 50. Let us add Elon Musk into the mix for good measure. The man who is revolutionizing the auto industry and sending Americans to space is 48. Coincidentally, I would argue the president should be leading bothing of those efforts.</p>



<p>The point I am making is that we should not be debating the mental fitness of our candidates based on age. That does not mean that I would never vote for someone in their 70s. I just wish I had an electable option not to. Candidates in their early 30s and late 60s generally seem a bit young and old to me for the role of president, respectively, but I would certainly vote for the right candidate at 35 or 65, and even someone in their 80s if that individual candidate seemed great to me. I do not want to be written off as an ageist for having written this and if that is not a term yet I am sure that it will be soon. Just because I would generally want my football team’s quarterback to be in his 20s or early 30s doesn’t mean I would not prefer Tom Brady in his 40’s to most of the other quarterbacks in the league. It seems to me that 40s and 50s are good years of age to be had by the person in the most powerful position in the world, The President of the United States of America. </p>

		<p>A study led by U of T Engineering alumna <strong>Kimberly Ren</strong> (EngSci 2T0) <a href="https://readylab.mie.utoronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/Ren-and-Olechowski-ASEE-2020.pdf">is the first to quantify predictors</a> that could lead women towards, or away from, pursuing careers in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI).</p>
<p><a href="https://reports.weforum.org/global-gender-gap-report-2018/assessing-gender-gaps-in-artificial-intelligence/">A 2018 report by the World Economic Forum</a> found that women make up 22 percent of global AI professionals, with that proportion oscillating between 21 and 23 percent over a four-year trend.</p>
<p>“The talent gap isn’t closing,” says Ren, whose fourth-year thesis project was awarded the Best Paper Award at the American Society for Engineering Education Conference, Women in Engineering Division. She led the study under the supervision of Professor <strong>Alison Olechowski</strong> (MIE, ISTEP).</p>
<p>“What I hope this research does is find some reasoning behind this gap, so that we can increase the persistence of women in the field going forward.”</p>
<p>Ren surveyed 279 undergraduate and graduate students at U of T Engineering who were studying ML/AI — 38 percent identified as female, 61 percent identified as male. She then measured how variables, such as professional-role confidence and discrimination experiences, positively or negatively impacted their persistence in pursuing ML/AI or general engineering careers. Their findings revealed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Expertise confidence — a self-assessment of whether one feels they’ve learned what they need to be successful — is a significant positive predictor for both women and men;</li>
<li>Career-fit confidence — when one feels they are a good fit for the career they are considering — is a significant positive predictor for women and men; and,</li>
<li>Gender discrimination, from peers or teaching staff, was a significant negative predictor for only women students.</li>
</ul>
<p>“These findings might sound quite logical, but it’s important to quantitatively show that biased experiences have a real impact on what careers women choose,” says Ren.</p>
<p>And although the project was designed to study the gender gap in students pursuing and persisting in AI/ML studies at U of T Engineering, their findings also revealed a severe lack of representation of Black and Indigenous students. “Of the 279 students surveyed, only 2 percent self-identified as Black, and 0 percent as Indigenous,” says Olechowski.</p>
<p>“This was shown to be the case in a sample size where 84 percent of students self-identified as a visible minority,” adds Ren. “So even when visible minorities are significantly represented, representation of Black and Indigenous students does not necessarily follow. There needs to be future work that focuses on the unique experiences and predictors of Black students that can elaborate further.”</p>
<p>Their work adds to an expanding list of research focused on biases within ML/AI. Fellow engineering science alumna <strong>Deborah Raji</strong> (EngSci 1T9) led a study last winter that revealed the <a href="https://news.engineering.utoronto.ca/this-u-of-t-engineering-student-is-holding-companies-accountable-for-biased-ai-facial-technology/">baked-in racial and gender biases</a> in facial-recognition services. Raji’s research, alongside that of computer scientist and digital activist Joy Buolamwini, <a href="https://news.engineering.utoronto.ca/u-of-t-engineering-alumna-inioluwa-deborah-raji-named-to-mits-technology-reviews-top-innovators-under-35/">has led to some accountability in the industry</a>.</p>
<p>“ML/AI has the potential to significantly shape future technologies, which only underscores the need to increase the diversity of workers within the field,” says Ren. “If we don’t see a change, then biased teaching, inputs, algorithms, applications and decisions will lead to further discriminatory and negative social consequences.”</p>
<p>The paper also provides recommendations to eliminate gender discrimination in engineering education, including mandatory anti-discrimination training modules, as well as accessible and transparent reporting of discriminatory behaviour that would affect faculty/teaching staff promotion and progress reporting.</p>
<p>Olechowski is using the findings to further inform her approach as an educator. As a researcher, she is keen to supervise future students to further the work in this area.</p>
<p>“It’s great that we’re seeing a higher proportion of women studying engineering, but seeing this study makes me realize that we need to ensure that we’re also matching students with mentors in industry — exposing them to people who look like them and make them feel like they belong. I want to be intentional with the role models that I present to my class.”</p>

            <p>PARIS -- 
	Potentially fatal COVID-19 complications in the brain including delirium, nerve damage and stroke may be more common than initially thought, a team of British-based doctors warned Wednesday.</p>
<p>
	Severe COVID-19 infections are known to put patients at risk of neurological complications, but <a href="https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/doi/10.1093/brain/awaa240/5868408" target="_blank">research led by University College London</a> suggests serious problems can occur even in individuals with mild cases of the virus.</p>
<p>
	The team looked at the neurological symptoms of 43 patients hospitalised with either confirmed or suspected COVID-19.</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong><a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/newsletters/the-covid19-brief-newsletter-signup" target="_blank">Newsletter sign-up: Get The COVID-19 Brief sent to your inbox</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>
	They found 10 cases of temporary brain dysfunction, 12 cases of brain inflammation, eight strokes and eight cases of nerve damage.</p>
<p>
	Most of those patients with inflammation were diagnosed with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) -- a rare condition typically seen in children after viral infections.</p>
<p>
	"We identified a higher than expected number of people with neurological conditions such as&nbsp;brain inflammation, which did not always correlate with the severity of respiratory symptoms," said Michael Zandi, of UCL's Queen Square Institute of Neurology and University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.</p>
<p>
	The research, <a href="https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/doi/10.1093/brain/awaa240/5868408" target="_blank">published in the journal Brain</a>, showed that none of patients diagnosed with neurological problems had COVID-19 in their cerebrospinal fluid, suggesting that the virus did not directly attack their brains.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Perhaps crucially, the team found that ADEM diagnoses "not related to the severity of the respiratory COVID-19 disease".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	"Given that the disease has only been around for a matter of months, we might not yet know what long-term damage COVID-19 can cause," said Ross Paterson from UCL's Queen Square Institute of Neurology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	"Doctors need to be aware of possible neurological effects, as early diagnosis can improve patient outcomes."</p>
<p>
	With more than 11 million confirmed infections worldwide, COVID-19 is known to cause a variety of health complications in addition to lung infection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	While the results of the study suggest that brain complications could be more common among virus patients than first thought, experts said it didn't mean that brain damage cases were widespread.</p>
<p>
	"The scrutiny that the pandemic attracts means it would be very unlikely that there is a large parallel pandemic of unusual brain damage linked to COVID-19," said Anthony David, director of UCL's Institute of Mental Health.</p>

<p>Shaders are one of the powerful features of OpenGL. I introduce them in this post and show how to color vertices using vertex and fragment shaders.</p>



<p><em>This post is part of the <a href="https://www.patternsgameprog.com/series/opengl-2d-facade/">OpenGL 2D Facade series</a></em></p>



<h2>The OpenGL rendering pipeline</h2>



<p>Rendering with OpenGL can be divided into the following steps:</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://www.patternsgameprog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/04_shaders-1024x906.png" alt="OpenGL Rendering Pipeline" width="304" height="268" srcset="https://www.patternsgameprog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/04_shaders-1024x906.png 1024w, https://www.patternsgameprog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/04_shaders-300x265.png 300w, https://www.patternsgameprog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/04_shaders-768x679.png 768w, https://www.patternsgameprog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/04_shaders.png 1535w" sizes="(max-width: 304px) 100vw, 304px"></figure></div>



<p>The input data, at the beginning of the pipeline, is data like the vertices, faces, and colors we created in the previous post.</p>



<p>The first processing transforms this data using programs called&nbsp;<em>Vertex Shaders</em>. For example, we can move and rotate objects during this step. In our 2D context, we scroll through the world map using these shaders.</p>



<p>The second processing assembles vertices to create primitives like triangles using programs called&nbsp;<em>Geometry Shaders</em>. With these shaders, you can generate more complex primitives, for instance, stars from points. In out 2D context, default primitives are rectangles (or quads).</p>



<p>The third processing rasterizes primitives. It is an automatic step; we can’t program it. It generates fragments, where each fragment is a set of pixel properties. The usual properties are color, depth, and UV coordinates. Note that OpenGL interpolates the value of these properties, depending on the location of the pixel on the primitive.</p>



<p>The last processing does the rendering and computes the color of each pixel using programs called&nbsp;<em>Fragment Shaders</em>. The most simple fragment shader is the one that returns the color computed during the rasterization. There is more exciting processing, like computing texture colors or modulate according to light intensity.</p>



<h2>Create a vertex shader</h2>



<p>Let’s now create a basic vertex shader:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="python" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">vertexShaderCode = '''#version 330
layout (location=0) in vec2 vertex;
layout (location=1) in vec3 inputColor;
                   out vec3 vertexColor;
void main() {
    gl_Position = vec4(vertex, 0.0, 1.0);
    vertexColor = inputColor;
}'''
vertexShaderId = glCreateShader(GL_VERTEX_SHADER)
glShaderSource(vertexShaderId, vertexShaderCode)
glCompileShader(vertexShaderId)</pre>



<p>The&nbsp;<code>vertexShaderCode</code>&nbsp;string contains the code of the vertex shader. We can’t write shader using Python, or any other usual language. We must use the shader language, as defined in OpenGL. This language is close to C; for instance, we must end each line with a semi-colon. The good news is that it is the same language, whatever the host language: if you want to translate these examples in Java or C#, you don’t have to update the shaders.</p>



<h3>Vertex shader code</h3>



<p>The first line of the shader defines the required version: in this tutorial, we need version 3.30 or higher.</p>



<p>Lines 2-4 define the inputs and outputs. In this example, we use the two vertex buffer objects (VBOs) in our vertex array object (VAO) with vertices and colors:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="c" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">layout (location=0) in vec2 vertex;
layout (location=1) in vec3 inputColor;</pre>



<p>The location indices are the ones we defined during the creation of the VBOs. Vertices have two values (<code>vec2</code>) because we are working we 2D coordinates. The colors have three values (<code>vec3</code>): red, green, and blue.</p>



<p>There is a single output, the color of the vertex:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="c" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">                   out vec3 vertexColor;</pre>



<p>Lines 5-8 contain the main function of the shader:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="c" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">void main() {
    gl_Position = vec4(vertex, 0.0, 1.0);
    vertexColor = inputColor;
}</pre>



<p>The first line of this function converts the 2D vertex into a 4D vertex because OpenGL expects this output format. We just set the z coordinate (the depth) with a zero value, and the w coordinate with 1.0. The w coordinate is hard to describe in a few sentences, and we won’t need it. We store the 4D vertex in&nbsp;<code>gl_Position</code>, the name of the main vertex output, as defined by OpenGL.</p>



<p>The second line of the main function copies the vertex colors. In practice, it does nothing but tells OpenGL we will need this value in the fragment shader.</p>



<h3>Compile the shader</h3>



<p>The three last lines compile the shader:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="python" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">vertexShaderId = glCreateShader(GL_VERTEX_SHADER)
glShaderSource(vertexShaderId, vertexShaderCode)
glCompileShader(vertexShaderId)</pre>



<p>The first line creates a vertex shader id with the&nbsp;<code>glCreateShader()</code>&nbsp;function.</p>



<p>The second line sends the vertex shader code using the&nbsp;<code>glShaderSource()</code>&nbsp;function.</p>



<p>The last line compiles the shader using the&nbsp;<code>glCompileShader()</code>&nbsp;function. Note that we won’t know if there is something wrong after this call. We’ll see that during the linking.</p>



<h2>Create a fragment shader</h2>



<p>This first fragment shader is also very simple:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="python" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">fragmentShaderCode = '''#version 330
in vec3 vertexColor;
out vec3 color;
void main() {
    color = vertexColor;
}'''
fragmentShaderId = glCreateShader(GL_FRAGMENT_SHADER)
glShaderSource(fragmentShaderId, fragmentShaderCode)
glCompileShader(fragmentShaderId)</pre>



<p>The first line of the shader also defines the version.</p>



<p>The two next lines define the inputs and outputs: in our case, the input and output color.</p>



<p>The main function copies the input color into the output color. It can’t be more basic!</p>



<h2>Link the shaders</h2>



<p>We can only use the shaders if they are linked:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="python" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">shaderProgramId = glCreateProgram()
glAttachShader(shaderProgramId, vertexShaderId)
glAttachShader(shaderProgramId, fragmentShaderId)
glLinkProgram(shaderProgramId)</pre>



<p>The operation is straightforward: create a shader program with&nbsp;<code>glCreateProgram()</code>, attach the two shaders with&nbsp;<code>glAttachShader()</code>&nbsp;and link with&nbsp;<code>glLinkProgram()</code>.</p>



<p>If something is wrong, you can get more help with the&nbsp;<code>glGetProgramInfoLog()</code>:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="python" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">print(glGetProgramInfoLog(shaderProgramId))</pre>



<h2>Enable the shaders</h2>



<p>Enable the shaders is very easy. Before rendering our VAO, enable the corresponding shader using&nbsp;<code>glUseProgram()</code>&nbsp;and disable it with a zero id after:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="python" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">glUseProgram(shaderProgramId)

glBindVertexArray(vaoId)
glEnableVertexAttribArray(0)
glEnableVertexAttribArray(1)
glDrawElements(GL_QUADS, 4 * faceCount, GL_UNSIGNED_INT, None)
glDisableVertexAttribArray(0)
glDisableVertexAttribArray(1)
glBindVertexArray(0)

glUseProgram(0)</pre>



<h2>Delete the shaders</h2>



<p>At the end of the program, we delete the shaders and the program. It is not mandatory, except if you want to change the shaders during the execution of your program:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="python" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">glDeleteShader(vertexShaderId)
glDeleteShader(fragmentShaderId)
glDeleteProgram(shaderProgramId)</pre>



<h2>Final program</h2>



<p>If you run this program, the rectangles are now colored:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="python" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">import os

<p>JavaScript programs started as simple scripts or apps with rather small codebases, but as it has been evolving and so its uses have been increasing the size of the codebases have increased drastically. To support this increase the language needed to support a mechanism under which was possible to separate or split the code into smaller, reusable units. Node.JS had that ability for a while before it was incorporated in JavaScript with a feature called modules. And thus eventually they made it to the language itself and the browsers.</p>
<p>By definition, a module is just a file which can be imported from other modules (or files) through the help of directives like <code>export</code> and <code>import</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>export</code>: keyword labels variables and functions that should be accessible from outside the current module.</li>
<li><code>import</code>: allows the import of functionality from other modules.</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ll come back to more of that later.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="introducing-an-example">Introducing an example</h2>
<p>To demonstrate the use of modules we will create a simple <code>user</code> module that will expose a <code>User</code> class. Let’s review the basic structure for the project:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">index.html
scripts/
    index.js
    modules/
        user.js
</code></pre></div><p>Our app will be very simple and it will just show the name of a user on the screen, but the interesting part is that the name will come from an object instance of the <code>User</code> class. Let’s see it in action with a live demo:</p>








<p>Let’s look in detail what’s going on there by parts</p>
<h3 id="exporting-module-user">Exporting module User</h3>
<p>The first thing we need to do to access the <code>User</code> class is to export it from the module. For that, we make use of the <code>export</code> statement.</p>
<p>The export statement is used when creating JavaScript modules to export live bindings to functions, objects, or primitive values from the module so they can be used by other programs with the import statement.</p>
<p>Let’s see that in our code:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// file: scripts/modules/user.js
</span><span></span><span>export</span> <span>class</span> <span>User</span> {
  <span>constructor</span>(<span>name</span>) {
    <span>this</span>.<span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>name</span>;
  }
}
</code></pre></div><p>Now that the module was exported we can use it in other modules by importing it.</p>
<h3 id="importing-module-user">Importing module User</h3>
<p>The static import statement is used to import read-only live bindings which are exported by another module. Imported modules are in strict mode whether you declare them as such or not. The import statement cannot be used in embedded scripts unless such a script has a type="module”. Bindings imported are called live bindings because they are updated by the module that exported the binding.</p>
<p>Let’s see it in our example</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>//file: scripts/index.js
</span><span></span><span>import</span> { <span>User</span> } <span>from</span> <span>'./modules/user.js'</span>

<span>const</span> <span>user</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>User</span>(<span>'Juan'</span>)

document.<span>getElementById</span>(<span>'user-name'</span>).<span>innerText</span> <span>=</span> <span>user</span>.<span>name</span>;
</code></pre></div><p>The <code>import</code> statement allows us to import specific bindings from a module. There are several different ways to specify what we are importing, and we will discuss them later in the post. For now, in our example, we are just importing <code>User</code> from the specified module (or file).</p>
<p>After importing we can use that object as it is part of the same file.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="default-exports-versus-named-exports">Default exports versus named exports</h2>
<p>So far we exported a class by its name, but there are 2 different way to export out of modules</p>
<ul>
<li>Named Exports (Zero or more exports per module)</li>
<li>Default Exports (Only one per module)</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some examples of named exports:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// export features declared earlier
</span><span></span><span>export</span> { <span>myFunction</span>, <span>myVariable</span> }; 

<span>// export individual features (can export var, let, const, function, class)
</span><span></span><span>export</span> <span>let</span> <span>myVariable</span> <span>=</span> Math.<span>sqrt</span>(<span>2</span>);
<span>export</span> <span>function</span> <span>myFunction</span>() { ... };
</code></pre></div><p>Default exports:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// export feature declared earlier as default
</span><span></span><span>export</span> { <span>myFunction</span> <span>as</span> <span>default</span> };

<span>// export individual features as default
</span><span></span><span>export</span> <span>default</span> <span>function</span> () { ... } 
<span>export</span> <span>default</span> <span>class</span> { .. }
</code></pre></div><p>Named exports are useful to export several values. During the import, it is mandatory to use the same name as the corresponding object. But a default export can be imported with any name for example:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// file: myk.js
</span><span></span><span>const</span> <span>k</span> <span>=</span> <span>12</span>
<span>export</span> <span>default</span> <span>k</span>
</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>// file: main.js
</span><span></span><span>import</span> <span>m</span> <span>from</span> <span>'./myk'</span>
<span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>m</span>)
</code></pre></div><p>When using named exports, it is also possible to assign a custom name to the exported value like in the following example:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span> <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>'value'</span>
<span>export</span> {
  <span>name</span> <span>as</span> <span>newName</span>
}
</code></pre></div><p>The value exported can now be imported as <code>newName</code> rather than <code>name</code>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="importing">Importing</h2>
<p>We already saw a few examples of how we can import either named or default exports from modules. But here are more options when it comes to importing.</p>
<h3 id="importing-a-default-export">Importing a default export</h3>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>import</span> <span>something</span> <span>from</span> <span>'mymodule'</span>

<span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>something</span>)
</code></pre></div><h3 id="importing-a-named-export">Importing a named export</h3>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>import</span> { <span>var1</span>, <span>var2</span> } <span>from</span> <span>'mymodule'</span>

<span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>var1</span>)
<span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>var2</span>)
</code></pre></div><h3 id="renaming-an-import">Renaming an import</h3>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>import</span> { <span>var1</span> <span>as</span> <span>myvar</span>, <span>var2</span> } <span>from</span> <span>'mymodule'</span>

<span>// Now myvar will be available instead of var1
</span><span></span><span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>myvar</span>)
<span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>var2</span>)
</code></pre></div><h3 id="importing-all-from-a-module">Importing all from a module</h3>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>import</span> <span>*</span> <span>as</span> <span>anyName</span> <span>from</span> <span>'mymodule'</span>

<span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>anyName</span>.<span>var1</span>)
<span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>anyName</span>.<span>var2</span>)
<span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>anyName</span>.<span>default</span>)
</code></pre></div><p>So far all the ways we described here are static imports, meaning that you place them on top of your file and the contents of the module are always imported. But it doesn’t have to be the case, you can also have dynamic imports.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="dynamic-imports">Dynamic imports</h2>
<p>This allows you to dynamically load modules only when they are needed, rather than having to load everything upfront. This has some obvious performance advantages; let’s read on and see how it works.</p>
<p>This new functionality allows you to call import() as a function, passing it the path to the module as a parameter. It returns a Promise, which fulfills with a module object giving you access to that object’s exports, e.g.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>import</span>(<span>'./modules/myModule.js'</span>)
  .<span>then</span>((<span>module</span>) =&gt; {
    <span>// Do something with the module.
</span><span></span>  });
</code></pre></div><hr>
<h2 id="combining-default-and-named-exports">Combining default and named exports</h2>
<p>You read it right! it is possible to combine default and named and as you may expect, you can import both of them. Let’s see an example:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>//file: mymodule.js
</span><span></span><span>export</span> <span>const</span> <span>named</span> <span>=</span> <span>'named export'</span>

<span>export</span> <span>function</span> <span>test</span>() {
  <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>'exported function'</span>)
}

<span>export</span> <span>default</span> <span>'default export'</span>;
</code></pre></div><p>And we can import them using either of the following scenarios:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>//another file:
</span><span></span><span>import</span> <span>anyName</span> <span>from</span> <span>'./mymodule'</span> <span>// where anyName is the default export
</span><span></span>
<span>// or both named exports
</span><span></span><span>import</span> { <span>named</span>, <span>test</span> } <span>from</span> <span>'./mymodule'</span>;

<span>// or just one
</span><span></span><span>import</span> { <span>named</span> } <span>from</span> <span>'./mymodule'</span>;

<span>// or all of them together
</span><span></span><span>import</span> <span>anyName</span>, { <span>named</span>, <span>test</span> } <span>from</span> <span>'./mymodule'</span>;
</code></pre></div><hr>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>JavaScript modules are a powerful feature that allows us to better organize our code, but it also allows us to share modules across projects. I hope you enjoyed and learned something new today.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I have been bootstrapping Hellonext to make it the best customer feedback software that people would love to use. More like what Intercom has done for website chat, we want to do for customer feedback.</p><p>For the past six months, the focus is purely on growing our customer base and generate revenue by providing value to them. Our starter plans are not as expensive as our competitors, but it starts at an affordable $25 per month.</p><p>Why just $25 for a feature request tool that has iOS, Android and Chrome apps? Well, this is the price I would be willing to pay to use a product like Hellonext for making my product the best in the industry.</p><p>As of today, the money that we invest in building Hellonext comes from the money I’ve been putting aside from <a href="https://www.skcript.com/">Skcript</a> (our consulting business), which is originally where we found the need for a tool like Hellonext in the first place. And the best part, Skcirpt is a bootstrapped company that we started back in 2013. This means, we have very limited funds to invest in a product like Hellonext, very limited development time and above all, very limited ad spend to promote Hellonext as well.</p><p>Today, I sat down to clean things up a bit and arrive at a clean financial statements for <a href="https://hellonext.co/">Hellonext</a>. Here’s how it looks.</p><p>As founders, we usually tend to ignore the hidden cost that comes up here and there when you have so much love for a product. This has happened to me so many times, and it has taken a hit on the company’s revenue as well. My mistake.</p><p>Here are some of the hidden costs that goes under the radar usually:</p><ol><li>Ad hoc costs like buying a book to learn about sales and marketing for SaaS.</li><li>Making an overseas call to a customer where they talk about 45 minutes (sometimes).</li><li>The travel that you do (did? Back in 2019) when you want to interview someone face-to-face or the time when you wanted to work from a cafe.</li><li>The money that you spend in buying coffee, drinks, socializing with others, cakes, small celebrations, mouse, mousepads, and so much more like that.</li><li>Other costs if you are living in a city where the cost is on the higher side. Luckily, I live in Dubai, where the costs are still manageable.</li></ol><p>This cost alone, on a high-level was about $500 in the past six months. Crazy? Yes. Did I think it was essential for the product growth? Maybe.</p><p><strong>Learning:</strong> Try to park the idea of NOT making any impulse purchase for your product. Nothing is a magic wand that gets you more sales.</p><h2 id="the-direct-costs-of-running-a-bootstrapped-saas-in-2020">The direct costs of running a bootstrapped SaaS in 2020<a href="#the-direct-costs-of-running-a-bootstrapped-saas-in-2020">#</a></h2><p>These are the costs that I must spend to keep the product alive and kicking. The costs are calculated for one year (as a SaaS product, they are constantly going to vary depending on your scale):</p><table><thead><tr><th>Utility</th><th>Duration</th><th>Cost ($)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cloud Server Cost</td><td>12 months</td><td>$700</td></tr><tr><td>CloudSQL Cost</td><td>12 months</td><td>$500</td></tr><tr><td>Amazon SES</td><td>12 months</td><td>$300</td></tr><tr><td>Apple Developer Account</td><td>12 months</td><td>$99</td></tr><tr><td>G Suite</td><td>12 months</td><td>$144</td></tr><tr><td>Domain name</td><td>12 months</td><td>$35</td></tr><tr><td>Intercom Startup Plan</td><td>12 months</td><td>$600</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td></td><td>$2,378</td></tr></tbody></table><p>There we have it. $2,378 per year to run Hellonext as of writing this article in the midst of a pandemic in July 2020. While these are just the running costs, it does not include the other fixed costs like the cost of design, development, improvements and so much more.</p><h3 id="what-about-other-aspects-of-a-saas-product">What about other aspects of a SaaS product?<a href="#what-about-other-aspects-of-a-saas-product">#</a></h3><p>You are right. There is more to a SaaS product than what I have listed above. For example, how do we manage logs, especially when we are producing over 16.8GB of logs per week. How are we managing them and analyzing them?</p><p>It is simple. We quickly built a tool where we analyze Ruby logs from archives, to visualize and take action on any anomaly. On the other hand, we also use Sumologic to tail our logs which comfortably fits in their free plan already.</p><h2 id="so-are-we-profitable-right-now">So are we profitable right now?<a href="#so-are-we-profitable-right-now">#</a></h2><p>The simple answer is no. Our goal is to reach at least 300 paying customers who can average around $35/month/customer. This will give us enough money to improve the product even more, and to help more customers along the way.</p><p>Thankfully, we are pushing hard to keep the costs low for Hellonext, and this runs as a mantra with our team as well.</p><p>Our intention is not to cut costs, but to write the best possible code, which can run on smallest possible infrastructure to achieve maximum performance to scale the product.</p><p>Right from the beginning, our intention was not to build this exorbitant product that would make it difficult for us to support our customers if we don’t breakeven quickly. I feel that this would have pushed us to do things that are against our selling value and be a bit inhuman to our customers by seeing them as numbers.</p><p>Making decisions like these early-on, to do things that fits Hellonext for the next four months, and taking things slow is enabling us to set sail for the long haul.</p><p>Our goal with Hellonext is to be the operating system for customer feedback. This cannot be done in a day or a year. This would happen over years together. And this video inspired me a lot when building products like Hellonext.</p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x5nAaxIkmFE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]>

		<div>

			
<p>If you see the letters GNU in a systems design, and that system intersects with cryptography, I can almost guarantee that it will be badly designed to an alarming degree.</p>



<p>This is as <a href="https://latacora.micro.blog/2019/07/16/the-pgp-problem.html">true of GnuPG (and PGP in general)</a> as it is of designs like the proposed <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-schanzen-gns-01.html">GNU Name System</a> (IETF draft) and cryptographic libraries like GnuTLS and libgcrypt. In fact, I cannot recall single GNU-branded cryptography project that isn’t a roaring dumpster fire.</p>



<p>I will elaborate.</p>



<h2>Problems with the GNU Name System’s Cryptography</h2>



<h3>Asymmetric Cryptography</h3>



<p>The GNS (GNU Name System) uses an unconventional construction for zones:</p>



<blockquote><p>A zone in GNS is defined by a public/private ECDSA key pair (d,zk), where d is the private key and zk the corresponding public key. GNS employs the curve parameters of the twisted edwards representation of Curve25519 [<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-schanzen-gns-01.html#RFC7748">RFC7748</a>] (a.k.a. edwards25519) with the ECDSA scheme ([<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-schanzen-gns-01.html#RFC6979">RFC6979</a>]).</p><cite><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-schanzen-gns-01.html#name-zones">GNU Name System IETF Draft, section 2</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>This is beyond weird: Going out of your way to use the edwards25519 curve from RFC 7748, but not use the Ed25519 signature algorithm, but still choosing to use deterministic ECDSA (RFC 6979).</p>



<p>(If you’re lost, I wrote about digital signature algorithms in <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/04/26/a-furrys-guide-to-digital-signature-algorithms/">a previous blog post</a>.)</p>



<p>The authors acknowledge the unconventional nature of their design choice in section 9.1 of the RFC draft:</p>



<blockquote><p>GNS uses ECDSA over Curve25519. This is an unconventional choice, as ECDSA is usually used with other curves. However, traditional ECDSA curves are problematic for a range of reasons described in the Curve25519 and EdDSA papers. <strong>Using EdDSA directly is also not possible, as a hash function is used on the private key which destroys the linearity that the GNU Name System depends upon.</strong> We are not aware of anyone suggesting that using Curve25519 instead of another common curve of similar size would lower the security of ECDSA. GNS uses 256-bit curves because that way the encoded (public) keys fit into a single DNS label, which is good for usability.</p><cite><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-schanzen-gns-01.html#name-cryptography">GNU Name System IETF Draft, section 9.1</a></cite></blockquote>



<p><s>The bold statement (my emphasis) is nonsense: In any design that uses digital signature algorithms, your system should map a private key (some opaque byte string) to a public key (some other opaque byte string) and signatures should also be opaque byte strings. The inclusion of a hash function under the hood of the signature algorithm is a moot point, especially since RFC 6979 also uses HMAC-SHA2 to generate deterministic nonces, thereby rendering their choice of RFC 6979 a contradiction of their stated goal.</s> Edit: <a href="#update-2020-07-09">see below</a>.</p>



<p>Using Ed25519 with a 32-byte private key (instead of a 64-byte private key) is also trivial. To wit: Libsodium offers <a href="https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/public-key_cryptography/public-key_signatures#key-pair-generation">crypto_sign_seed_keypair()</a> for this purpose.</p>



<p>But even worse: ECDSA is less secure and slower than EdDSA, even when you use the same curves, due to how the algorithms are implemented. The authors of the RFC do not defend this design choice beyond this hash function non sequitur.</p>

<h4 id="update-2020-07-09">(Update) “But They Need Hierarchical Keys”</h4>



<p>After I initially posted this, Redditor Steve132 informed me that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/hnlyp1/gnu_a_heuristic_for_bad_cryptography/fxdbez4/">I overlooked the reason they made this design decision</a>.</p>



<blockquote><p>Take a look at Section 6.1&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-schanzen-gns-01.html#name-recursion" target="_blank">https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-schanzen-gns-01.html#name-recursion</a></p><blockquote><p>From here, the following steps are recursively executed, in order: Extract the right-most label from the name to look up. Calculate q using the label and zk as defined in Section 4.1.</p></blockquote><p>So then if you go to section 4.1, they do h=H(&lt;address string&gt;), (r,R) is some root keypair, then they do C (a child public key), C=hR, then q=H(C).</p><p>the idea behind the calculation of q is to use the root public key to derive a child public key from ONLY the root public key, exploiting the linearity property that in elliptic curves, if bG=B, then (b+s)G=(sG+B)</p><p>This allows a third party to derive child public keys without any knowledge of the private keys for the root. This technique is also used in bitcoin’s bip32 (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0032" target="_blank">https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0032</a>) for ‘unhardened’ derivation scheme.</p><cite>Part of Steve132’s correction</cite></blockquote>



<p>I fully admit, I didn’t absorb this detail in my first pass of the RFC draft. It wasn’t clearly spelled out in Section 9 (which aims to justify their cryptography decisions), and I didn’t read the other sections as carefully. This was my mistake.</p>



<p>However, even with this explanation in mind, my original point that this design choice is both unconventional and unnecessary still stands, because <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7966967?section=abstract">BIP32-Ed25519</a> already exists (albeit, it still needs <a href="https://forum.web3.foundation/t/key-recovery-attack-on-bip32-ed25519/44">a carefully designed implementation</a> to be secure against active attackers). </p>



<p>Therefore, the GNU Name System developers didn’t need to roll their own design, they could have used one that’s already seen real-world deployment instead. Why take on unnecessary risk?</p>



<p>Furthermore, trying to push through an implementation of ECDSA over edwards25519 isn’t just unnecessary and weird, it’s also probably dangerous, as Thai Duong noted:</p>

<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">While I don't agree that ECDSA is worse than Ed25519 – both have pros and cons — it takes courage to implement ECDSA over Edward25519. Do you know if they published any code?  This unfortunate marriage may introduce fun and unique bugs</p>— thaidn (@XorNinja) <a href="https://twitter.com/XorNinja/status/1281041946538938368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 9, 2020</a></blockquote></div>

<p>Of course, all cryptography development can be said to be dangerous, but there are other problems fundamental to the GNU Name System design that makes any departure from a well-tread path very suspect.</p>



<h3>Symmetric Cryptography</h3>



<p>The GNU Name System project doesn’t stop there. It further throws <a href="https://tonyarcieri.com/all-the-crypto-code-youve-ever-written-is-probably-broken">IND-CCA2 security</a> out the window and specifies encrypting with AES and TwoFish in a cipher cascade, using Cipher Feedback (CFB) mode.</p>



<p>The authors do not even attempt to defend this decision. Typically this happens when the authors do not understand the risks involved. I sincerely doubt they’ve heard the words “adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack” in the course of their self-study.</p>



<p>(Because, y’know, attackers will surely never be able to replay UDP traffic if a runtime exception occurs because of corrupted data.)</p>



<h4>“Why Is This Bad?”</h4>



<p>Cipher cascades are usually the result of “we want to defend against a backdoored or broken cipher”. Bear in mind, the cipher itself is rarely the first part of a cryptosystem to be broken.</p>



<p>On that note, TwoFish isn’t <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2012/10/09/so-you-want-to-use-alternative-cipher/">the worst choice</a> of a cascade partner for AES, but I’d prefer a design that employed a different paradigm (since AES is a SPN permutation block cipher, an ARX-based stream cipher like Salsa20 or ChaCha seems reasonable).</p>



<p>AES is a boring choice, because it’s the industry standard. I’m not <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/05/13/why-aes-gcm-sucks/">particularly fond of AES</a> (due to it not being fast and constant-time in pure software implementations), but if you use it in an authenticated mode (AES-GCM, AES-CCM, AES-EAX, AES-OCB3, … I dunno, Poly1305-AES? Just use an AEAD mode!), it’s fine.</p>



<p><strong>Cipher Feedback (CFB) mode is not an authenticated mode.</strong></p>



<p>If you’re publishing a cryptography design in 2020 that fails the <a href="https://moxie.org/2011/12/13/the-cryptographic-doom-principle.html">Cryptographic Doom Principle</a>, you need to go back to the drawing board.</p>



<h4>“But They Use Digital Signatures”</h4>



<p><a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2016/03/21/attack-of-week-apple-imessage/">Cough.</a></p>







<h2>Other GNU Projects</h2>



<p>If you want to learn about why GnuPG (and the PGP ecosystem in general) is terrible, I recommend <a href="https://latacora.micro.blog/2019/07/16/the-pgp-problem.html">Latacora’s takedown</a>.</p>



<p>GnuTLS is an SSL/TLS library created by the same people who created (and then abandoned) libmcrypt, which was the scourge of <a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/293930/problematic-php-cryptography-advice-in-popular-questions">bad cryptography in the PHP ecosystem</a> for many years (until it was <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/mcrypt-viking-funeral">finally excised in PHP 7.2</a>). Consequently, the project’s <a href="https://www.gnutls.org/security-new.html">CVE history</a> should be no surprise.</p>



<p><strong>Quick story:</strong> Many years ago, a few timing attacks were discovered in libgcrypt by regular chatters in Freenode’s ##crypto channel. This led a lot of us <a href="https://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gcrypt-devel/2015-November/003618.html">to look at libgcrypt for more bugs</a>.</p>



<p>The general consensus of the ensuing IRC discussion was, roughly, “We probably shouldn’t try to fix them all, because a) that’s way too much effort because there’s too much badness and b) this library will be a ripe target for upcoming cryptanalysis researchers to get their first papers published for many years”. And, indeed, the attack papers that have come out over the years that affect libgcrypt <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/432">haven’t disappointed</a>.</p>



<p>To be clear, at the time this happened, I was garbage at writing C (and somehow even less confident than capable) and barely making ends meet, so “drop everything and volunteer to fix all the libgcrypt badness” wasn’t a tenable option for me. And since the world is largely moving away from GnuPG and libgcrypt, it honestly isn’t worth the effort trying to fix all the bad when an easier fix is “use something good instead”.</p>



<h2>Takeaway</h2>



<p>If you see the letters GNU anywhere in a project that intersects with cryptography–except for its public license–it’s almost certainly an error-prone cryptographic design.</p>



<p>Or, as my friend Kye calls it:</p>

<h2>What To Use Instead?</h2>



<p>To replace GPG, you want <a href="https://age-encryption.org/">age</a> and <a href="https://jedisct1.github.io/minisign/">minisign</a>.</p>



<p>To replace GnuTLS or libgcrypt, depending on what you’re using it for, you want one of the following: s2n, OpenSSL/LibreSSL, or Libsodium.</p>



<p>For embedded systems, BearSSL is a good options today and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/hdc4o6/new_results_on_gimli_fullpermutation/fvmpnym/">libhydrogen v2</a> will be an attractive choice when it’s released.</p>

	<p>Fourier transforms are a tool used in a whole bunch of different things. This is an explanation of what a Fourier transform does, and some different ways it can be useful. And how you can make pretty things with it, like this thing:</p>
<canvas id="self-draw" width="500" height="500"></canvas>
<p>I'm going to explain how that animation works, and along the way explain Fourier transforms!</p>
<p>By the end you should have a good idea about</p>
<ul>
<li>What a Fourier transform does</li>
<li>Some practical uses of Fourier transforms</li>
<li>Some pointless but cool uses of Fourier transforms</li>
</ul>
<p>We're going to leave the mathematics and equations out of it for now. There's a bunch of interesting maths behind it, but it's better to start with what it actually does, and why you'd want to use it first. If you want to know more about the how, there's some further reading suggestions below!</p>
<h2 id="sowhatisthisthing">So what is this thing?</h2>
<p>Put simply, the Fourier transform is a way of splitting something up into a bunch of sine waves. As usual, the name comes from some person who lived a long time ago called Fourier.</p>
<p>Let’s start with some simple examples and work our way up. First up we're going to look at waves - patterns that repeat over time.</p>
<p>Here’s an example wave:</p>
<canvas id="combo-sine-wave" width="500" height="300"></canvas>
<p>This wavy pattern here can be split up into sine waves. That is, when we add up the two sine waves we get back the original wave.</p>
<canvas id="combo-sine-wave-split" width="500" height="500"></canvas>
<p>The Fourier transform is a way for us to take the combined wave, and get each of the sine waves back out. In this example, you can almost do it in your head, just by looking at the original wave.</p>
<p>Why? Turns out a lot of things in the real world interact based on these sine waves. We usually call them the wave's frequencies.</p>
<p>The most obvious example is sound – when we hear a sound, we don’t hear that squiggly line, but we hear the different frequencies of the sine waves that make up the sound.</p>



<p>Being able to split them up on a computer can give us an understanding of what a person actually hears. We can understand how high or low a sound is, or figure out what note it is.</p>
<p>We can also use this process on waves that don't look like they're made of sine waves.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at this guy. It’s called a square wave.</p>
<canvas id="square-wave" width="500" height="300"></canvas>
<p>It might not look like it, but it also can be split up into sine waves.</p>
<canvas id="square-wave-split" width="500" height="500"></canvas>
<p>We need a lot of them this time – technically an infinite amount to perfectly represent it. As we add up more and more sine waves the pattern gets closer and closer to the square wave we started with.</p>
<canvas id="square-wave-build-up" width="500" height="500"></canvas>


<p><em>Drag the slider above to play with how many sine waves there are.</em></p>
<p>Visually, you'll notice that actually the first few sine waves are the ones that make the biggest difference. With the slider halfway, we have the general shape of the wave, but it's all wiggly. We just need the rest of the small ones to make the wigglyness flatten out.</p>
<p>When you listen to the wave, you'll hear the sound get lower, because we're removing the higher frequencies.</p>
<p>This process works like that for any repeating line. Give it a go, try drawing your own!</p>


<p><em>Move the slider to see how as we add more sine waves, it gets closer and closer to your drawing</em></p>
<p>Again, aside from the extra wigglyness, the wave looks pretty similar with just half of the sine waves.</p>
<p>We can actually use the fact that the wave is pretty similar to our advantage. By using a Fourier transform, we can get the important parts of a sound, and only store those to end up with something that's pretty close to the original sound.</p>
<p>Normally on a computer we store a wave as a series of points.</p>
<canvas id="wave-samples" width="500" height="500"></canvas>
<p>What we can do instead is represent it as a bunch of sine waves. Then we can compress the sound by ignoring the smaller frequencies. Our end result won't be the same, but it'll sound pretty similar to a person.</p>
<canvas id="wave-frequencies" width="500" height="500"></canvas>
<p>This is essentially what MP3s do, except they're more clever about which frequencies they keep and which ones they throw away.</p>
<p>So in this case, we can use Fourier transforms to get an understanding of the fundamental properties of a wave, and then we can use that for things like compression.</p>
<p>Ok, now let's dig more into the Fourier transform. This next part looks cool, but also gives you a bit more understanding of what the Fourier transform does. But mostly looks cool.</p>
<h2 id="epicycles">Epicycles</h2>
<p>Now at the start, I said it splits things into sine waves. The thing is, the sine waves it creates are not just regular sine waves, but they’re 3D. You could call them "complex sinusoids". Or just "spirals".</p>
<canvas id="complex-sinusoid" width="500" height="500"></canvas>
<p>If we take a look from the side, they look like sine waves. From front on, though, these look like circles.</p>
<canvas id="complex-sinusoid-turn" width="500" height="500"></canvas>
<p>So far everything we’ve been doing has only required the regular 2D sine waves. When we do a Fourier transform on 2D waves, the complex parts cancel out so we just end up with sine waves.</p>
<p>But we can use the 3D sine waves to make something fun looking like this:</p>
<canvas id="peace-epicycles" width="500" height="500"></canvas>
<p>What’s going on here?</p>
<p>Well, we can think of the drawing as a 3D shape because of the way it moves around in time. If you imagine the hand being drawn by a person, the three dimensions represent where the tip of their pencil is at that moment. The x and y dimensions tell us the position, and then the time dimension is the time at that moment.</p>
<canvas id="peace-3d" width="500" height="500"></canvas>
<p>Now that we have a 3D pattern, we can't use the regular 2D sine waves to represent it. No matter how many of the 2D sine waves we add up, we'll never get something 3D. So we need something else.</p>
<p>What we can use is the 3D spiral sine waves from before. If we add up lots of those, we can get something that looks like our 3D pattern.</p>
<p>Remember, these waves look like circles when we look at them from front on. The name for the pattern of a circle moving around another circle is an epicycle.</p>
<canvas id="peace-build-up" width="500" height="500"></canvas>

<p><em>Use the slider above to control how many circles there are.</em></p>
<p>Like before, we get a pretty good approximation of our pattern with just a few circles. Because this is a fairly simple shape, all the last ones do is make the edges a little sharper.</p>
<p>All this applies to any drawing, really! Now it’s your chance to play around with it.</p>


<p><em>Use the slider to control how many circles are used for your drawing</em></p>
<p>Again, you'll see for most shapes, we can approximate them fairly well with just a small number of circles, instead of saving all the points.</p>
<p>Can we use this for real data? Well, we could! In reality we have another data format called SVG, which probably does a better job for the types of shapes we tend to create. So for the moment, this is really just for making cool little gifs.</p>
<canvas id="fourier-title" width="500" height="300"></canvas>
<p>There is another type of visual data that does use Fourier transforms, however.</p>
<h2 id="jpegs">JPEGs</h2>
<p>Did you know Fourier transforms can also be used on images? In fact, we use it all the time, because that's how JPEGs work! We're applying the same principles to images – splitting up something into a bunch of sine waves, and then only storing the important ones.</p>
<p>Now we're dealing with images, we need a different type of sine wave. We need to have something that no matter what image we have, we can add up a bunch of these sine waves to get back to our original image.</p>
<p>To do that, each of our sine waves will be images too. Instead of a wave that's a line, we now have images with black and white sections. To represent the size of a wave, each image will have more or less contrast.</p>
<p>We can also use these to represent color in the same way, but let's start with black-and-white images for now. To represent colorless images, we need some horizontal wave images,</p>
<p><img id="img-y-component" src="http://www.jezzamon.com/fourier/img/components-4-0.png"></p>
<p>Along with some vertical wave images.</p>
<p><img id="img-x-component" src="http://www.jezzamon.com/fourier/img/components-0-4.png"></p>
<p>By themselves, just horizontal and vertical images aren't enough to represent the types of images we get. We also need some extra ones that you get by multiplying the two together.</p>

<p>For an 8x8 image, here are all the images we need.</p>

</p>
<p>If we take the images, adjust their contrast to the right amount, and then add them up we can create any image.</p>
<p>Let's start with this letter 'A'. It's pretty small, but we need it to be small otherwise we'll end up with too many other images.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.jezzamon.com/fourier/img/a.png"></p>
<p>As we add more and more of these images, we end up with something that becomes closer and closer to the actual image. But I think you'll see the pattern here, as we get a reasonable approximation with just a few of them.</p>

<p>For actual JPEG images there are just a few extra details.</p>
<p>The image gets broken up into 8x8 chunks, and each chunk gets split up separately. We use a set of frequencies to determine how light or dark each pixel is, and then another two sets for the color, one for red-green, and another for blue-yellow. The number of frequencies that we use for each chunk determines the quality of the JPEG.</p>
<p>Here's a real JPEG image, zoomed in so we can see the details. When we play with the quality levels we can see this process happen.</p>

<p>So let's recap:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fourier transforms are things that let us take something and split it up into its frequencies.</li>
<li>The frequencies tell us about some fundamental properties of the data we have</li>
<li>And can compress data by only storing the important frequencies</li>
<li>And we can also use them to make cool looking animations with a bunch of circles</li>
</ul>
<p>This is just scratching the surface into some applications. The Fourier transform is an extremely powerful tool, because splitting things up into frequencies is so fundamental. They're used in a lot of fields, …</p></div></div>

                <p>If you are responsible for managing a bunch of your organization’s AWS
resources, you probably know how annoying it is to debug various
deployment-related issues, only to learn that someone accidentally messed with
your setup, yet again. Which you probably resolved by navigating your
command-line history like a maniac (because you don’t use Ansible and have to
<code>Ctrl+R</code>, as you also forgot to put down the setup instructions ;)). We’ve
been there, too. And this is what we learned:</p>
<ol>
<li>You should use Ansible and deploy your environment with a playbook, and</li>
<li>You should make the most of it by taking advantage of both Ansible’s
built-in mechanisms and the modules that allow you to detect
configuration drift, and correct it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Our dear sysadmins and DevOps engineers, this post is for you. Stay with
us and read along!</p>
<h2 id="ansible-and-compliance-how">Ansible and compliance? How?</h2>
<p>According to Cambridge Advanced Learner’s Dictionary, compliance is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fact of obeying a particular law or rule, or of acting according to an
agreement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To see what the above definition has got to do with Ansible and the AWS
Ansible Collection, let’s briefly descend to the world of Ansible playbooks
and modules.</p>
<h3 id="its-all-about-state">It’s all about state</h3>
<p>Ideally, playbook tasks describe the <strong>desired final state</strong> of a managed
system - for example, configuration of an AWS EC2 instance. An Ansible module
takes that description and performs the necessary steps to ensure that state.</p>
<p>It’s important to emphasize that it’s easy to write playbook tasks describing
the final state of a managed system when Ansible modules adopt <strong>declarative
APIs</strong>. As a consequence, we can treat playbook tasks as “the rule”, “the
policy”, or simply as something we need to be <em>compliant with</em>. Perhaps even
more importantly, we can treat Ansible playbooks as simple diagnostic tools to
help us detect when we are not compliant anymore, so that we can mitigate the
situation.</p>
<p>If you are familiar with Ansible, all of this probably rings a bell to you
already. Was your first thought the value of the <code>changed</code> variable that you
see every time you run your playbooks? Or perhaps even Ansible’s
<a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_checkmode.html" title="Official check mode documetation"><code>--diff</code> and <code>--check</code> modes</a>? Indeed, this post is about all of
them!</p>
<p>Let’s walk through a practical example demonstrating how you can use the
modules from the AWS Ansible Collection to <strong>detect and resolve configuration
drift</strong>.</p>
<p>To follow along easier, make sure you have completed the tutorial about the
basic usage of the collection in <a href="https://steampunk.si/blog/aws-ansible-collection-basic-usage/" title="Intro post about AWS Ansible Collection">Getting Started with the AWS Ansible
Collection</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Make sure you have Steampunk AWS Ansible Collection version 0.8.3 installed.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="set-up-the-desired-state">Set up the desired state</h2>
<p>Let’s start by creating a simple AWS enviromnent that will support running an
imaginary app.  The environment will comprise:</p>
<ul>
<li>an EC2 instance named <em>steamy-server</em>;</li>
<li>a network interface named <em>steamy-eni</em> to attach to the EC2 instance,
which we secure with the VPC’s default security group.</li>
</ul>
<p>We created a playbook called <a href="https://github.com/xlab-si/steampunk-aws-examples/blob/master/enforcing-compliance/setup.yaml" title="Ansible playbook for setting up a demo environment">setup.yaml</a> for spinning up this
environment. And then, we run</p>
<pre><code>$ ansible-playbook setup.yaml --diff
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>

PLAY RECAP ******************************************************************
localhost              : ok=3         changed=2    unreachable=0    failed=0
                         skipped=0    rescued=0    ignored=0
</code></pre></div><p>We can see two <code>changed</code> tasks, corresponding to the two newly created AWS
resources. Thanks to the <code>--diff</code> flag which instructs the modules to report
the differences they made, we also get a nice visual indication of what
exactly the modules changed. The red-colored lines show the previous state of
the AWS resource  (before a specific task ran), while the green ones show the
current state, i.e. after the task ran.</p>
<p>We can interpret the diff output above as “the instance and network interface
didn’t exist before, so we created them, and they are now configured as
shown”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Typically, we can’t take support for diff mode for granted, as it is up to
individual modules to implement it. This is why some tasks make changes but
report no differences despite running <code>ansible-playbook</code> with <code>--diff</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="a-word-about-idempotence">A word about idempotence</h3>
<p>Can you guess what will happen if we run the same command again? Let’s try it
out!</p>
<pre><code>$ ansible-playbook setup.yaml --diff
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>PLAY [localhost] ************************************************************

TASK [Create the steamy-server instance for running a simple app] ***********
ok: [localhost]

TASK [Retrieve the default security group for the VPC] **********************
ok: [localhost]

TASK [Create a dedicated network interface and attach it to steamy-server] **
ok: [localhost]

PLAY RECAP ******************************************************************
localhost              : ok=3         changed=0    unreachable=0    failed=0
                         skipped=0    rescued=0    ignored=0
</code></pre><p>This time around, we see that there was nothing to be done - the Ansible
modules already did all the hard work when they were invoked the first time.
So no changed tasks, no updates done, and no diff output shown. With other
words, the current state of our managed AWS resources is compliant with the
state described by the tasks in our <code>setup.yaml</code> playbook. This demonstrates
another important aspect related to Ansible’s declarative approach, which is
that playbook tasks should ideally be idempotent.  If the state of the managed
resource is aligned with the desired state as described by the playbook tasks,
running the playbook again will not affect its state.</p>
<p>But how can all of this be useful to me, you wonder? Glad you asked, time to
spice things up a bit!</p>
<h2 id="deviate-from-the-initial-state">Deviate from the initial state</h2>
<p>Now, let’s put ourselves in the shoes of an adversary that wants to tweak the
state of our AWS resources to their taste. In practice, this could be done
accidentally, or worse - with malicious intent. But we’ll be doing it solely
for the purpose of demonstration. Disclaimer: we won’t actually be doing
anything dangerous, we’ll only make some simple configuration changes that
should indicate that configuration has drifted if we take <a href="https://github.com/xlab-si/steampunk-aws-examples/blob/master/enforcing-compliance/setup.yaml" title="Ansible playbook for setting up a demo environment">setup.yaml</a>
as our baseline for compliance.</p>
<p>To make the changes, we could open the AWS Management Console and manually
modify some properties of the EC2 instance or the network interface that we
created with [setup.yaml][setup` earlier. But since we’re all about
automation, let’s put the tweaks in an Ansible playbook called
<a href="https://github.com/xlab-si/steampunk-aws-examples/blob/master/enforcing-compliance/tweaked-setup.yaml" title="Playbook simulating an adversary">tweaked-setup.yaml</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s a recap of what we’ll be tweaking with this playbook:</p>
<ul>
<li>We’ll downgrade our <em>steamy-server</em>’s CloudWatch monitoring to the
basic level and modify it’s shutdown behavior;</li>
<li>We’ll update the value of <em>steamy-server</em>’s <code>env</code> tag.</li>
<li>We’ll create a new security group called <em>dangerous-secgroup</em> with
some suspicious permissions;</li>
<li>We’ll associate this <em>dangerous-secgroup</em> with the network interface
attached to the <em>steamy-server</em> instance, and we’ll also disable
source/destination checking for the network interface;</li>
</ul>
<p>Sneaky, right? ;)</p>
<p>If we ran <code>ansible-playbook tweaked-setup.yaml</code> now, we would end up with
three changed tasks. But since we’re learning about Ansible diff mode, let’s
do:</p>
<pre><code>$  ansible-playbook tweaked-setup.yaml --diff
</code></pre>
<p>and we end up with three changed tasks, plus the diff output consistent with
the tweaks described above:</p>

<p>I love using <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a>. At my previous job, we managed our infrastructure entirely with Terraform: tens of thousands of resources spread across several cloud providers. The benefits of infrastructure-as-code and Terraform, in particular, are massive, but well known. While I still consider Terraform the best tool of its kind, this article describes some pain points that my team and I encountered as power users. I hope it can lead to some discussion about ways to improve.</p>

<p>All of these are relevant as recently as Terraform v0.13.0-beta3, July 2020.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#refactoring-is-difficult">Refactoring is difficult</a></li>

<li><a href="#type-system-is-too-rigid">Type system is too rigid</a></li>
<li><a href="#upstream-development-frustrating-priorities">Upstream development: frustrating priorities</a></li>
</ul>

<p>This is part one in a series about Terraform. Part two, detailing some Terraform practices that we found effective, will be up shortly.</p>

<h2 id="refactoring-is-difficult">Refactoring is difficult</h2>

<p>Terraform code is unwieldy to refactor. Even giving a resource a new <em>internal</em> name is a hassle. Here’s our simple Terraform definition:</p>

<pre><code>resource "aws_s3_bucket" "bucket" {
  bucket = "images.bigco.com"
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now it’s a month later, and we’re adding our second bucket, so let’s change our Terraform code to use a more specific name:</p>

<pre><code>resource "aws_s3_bucket" "images_bucket" {
  bucket = "images.bigco.com"
}
</code></pre>

<p>If we naively try to make this innocuous-looking change, Terraform will want to delete and recreate the bucket. We probably all understand why that’s the case, and it helps us appreciate how wonderful the concept of <code>terraform plan</code> is, but it’s ludicrous to have no serious facility for doing this smoothly. <code>terraform state mv</code> exists, but you need to run that separately, outside the plan/apply lifecycle. If you need to do this for ten environments, it’s a lot of work.</p>

<p>And that’s the easy case. Moving across module boundaries is harder, especially if you want to move the resources from the module into the root of the state (spoiler: <code>state mv</code> can’t do it). Moving across state boundaries is harder still. While the <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/state/mv.html">documentation</a> mentions moving to a different state file, there’s no support for hooking it up to an already-existing state in S3 (for example). The tool is not at all user friendly or convenient.</p>

<p>The silver lining is that Terraform state is a simple JSON file, so it’s easy to write your own tooling around it. My team had occasion to do several refactors where we pulled individual projects’ resources out of a monolithic state and into their own states, once for each of our environments. Trying to orchestrate that with <code>state mv</code> would have been an awkward mess, but writing a simple Python script to pull state from S3, modify it, and push it back, was not too bad (if you do this, you’ll also want to remove the state checksum from DynamoDB).</p>

<p>You’re never going to nail the module and state boundaries correctly on your first pass (or ever?). Refactoring is inescapable. It needs to be more convenient. It would be great if there was some way to signal to Terraform “hey, this resource used to have a different address”. Something like this seems reasonable:</p>

<pre><code>resource "aws_s3_bucket" "images_bucket" {
  bucket = "images.bigco.com"

  lifecycle {
    old_addresses = [
      "aws_s3_bucket.bucket",
      "module.images_bucket.aws_s3_bucket.bucket",
    ]
  }
}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="code-reuse-is-limited">Code reuse is limited</h2>

<p>Terraform’s main tool for code reuse (i.e. a chunk of resource definitions that can be reused with different inputs) is the <code>module</code> (symlinks may also be useful in some situations, but I haven’t used them for this). Modules are limited in some ways.</p>

<h4 id="it-s-awkward-to-pin-module-versions">It’s awkward to pin module versions</h4>

<p>You <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/1439">can’t do interpolation in a module’s <code>source</code> parameter</a>. So if a dozen modules should all be pointing at the same revision of your <a href="https://blog.gruntwork.io/how-to-create-reusable-infrastructure-with-terraform-modules-25526d65f73d">modules git repository</a>, there’s no clean way to update all those references in one place. My team had a Makefile target, which we ran manually, that used <code>find</code> and <code>sed</code> to update all the references.</p>

<p>Leaving the module source unpinned is not an option I’d be comfortable with because it’s a vector for un-source-controlled drift that can be easily avoided.</p>

<h4 id="can-t-partially-apply-modules">Can’t partially apply modules</h4>

<p>The biggest problem we’ve faced with the module system is the inability to do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_application">partial application</a> (in the computer science sense). In essence, it would be nice to simplify a module’s interface by binding a bunch of common parameters. Here’s an example:</p>

<pre><code>module "service_a" {
  source = "..."

  name = "service_a"

  environment_variables = merge(
    local.environment_variable_defaults,
    {
      THING = "1",
    },
  )

  vpc_id     = local.vpc_id
  subnet_ids = local.subnet_ids
  ...
}

module "service_b" {
  source = "..."

  name = "service_b"

  environment_variables = merge(
    local.environment_variable_defaults,
    {
      THING = "2",
    },
  )

  vpc_id     = local.vpc_id
  subnet_ids = local.subnet_ids
  ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>These services have, say, fifteen parameters being passed in, and they only differ in one or two. There should be some more expressive way of writing them so that only those two unique values are prominent. Instead, you’re stuck copy/pasting a bunch of boilerplate, and editing in the unique values. That’s error-prone and a maintenance burden.</p>

<p>There’s an <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/locals.html">analogy</a> between Terraform definitions and a conventional programming language: a set of Terraform definitions (a module) is like a function, with TF variables being inputs to the function, TF locals being local variables, and TF outputs being return values. The extension of that analogy to this use case is partial application, where you give a module some of its inputs, it binds those values and you get back a module with only the rest of the inputs. Terraform doesn’t support it.</p>

<p>Ideally, we’d be able to define some sort of a “submodule” like this:</p>

<pre><code>submodule "service" {
  source = "..."

  environment_variables = merge(
    local.environment_variable_defaults,
    ?
  )

  vpc_id     = local.vpc_id
  subnet_ids = local.subnet_ids
}

module "service_a" {
  source = submodule.service

  name = "service_a"

  environment_variable_overrides = {
    THING = "1",
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>We can’t use a proper module for this, because it doesn’t have access to its parent’s locals (which seems right). Notice the unsolved problem here of how to refer to those environment variable overrides in the submodule. This isn’t a fully-formed proposal.</p>

<p>Here are some ways we’ve dealt with this.</p>

<h5 id="code-reuse-workaround-1-big-map-of-config">Code reuse workaround 1: big map of config</h5>

<p>You can pass a big map of config as input to the module, rather than individual variables. That map can be defined as a local, and can include all the common values. Each service can merge on top of it to provide its overrides.</p>

<p>It’s a hack, but it works to reduce boilerplate. There are a couple of serious drawbacks, though:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Terraform’s <code>merge()</code> only performs a shallow merge. This is surprising behavior, and can lead to subtle bugs. You can work around it if you know about it, but the workarounds are often awkward. There’s an <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/25032">open PR</a> adding a <code>deepmerge()</code> function.</p></li>

<li><p>When anything in the map is “not known until after apply” (e.g. an attribute of a resource that hasn’t been created yet), the entire map is considered “not known until after apply”. For example, if our config map looks like</p>

<pre><code>config = {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.vpc.id,
  thing_enabled = true,
}
</code></pre>

<p>and the module does something like</p>

<pre><code>resource ... {
  count = var.config.thing_enabled ? 1 : 0

  ...
}
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>then this will fail to plan if the VPC doesn’t already exist because <code>var.config</code> contains something (the VPC id) which isn’t known yet, and so <code>var.config.thing_enabled</code> is not known until after apply. This is subtle and unexpected, and the error messages you’ll see from it are cryptic. But it’s very easy to do by accident once some resources are created already. Then the next time you try to bootstrap a new state (e.g. a new environment), you’ll find that it won’t plan successfully.</p>

<h5 id="code-reuse-workaround-2-generate-terraform-definitions-from-templates">Code reuse workaround 2: generate Terraform definitions from templates</h5>

<p>In some instances, it can make sense to generate Terraform code from templates. On my team, there were a few places that we did this, and we checked those generated files in to git as regular <code>*.tf</code> files (their names started with <code>generated.</code> to make it obvious). This can work well, but adds some process overhead (pre-processing, knowing which files to not edit, CI validation that the files haven’t been edited).</p>

<p>There are also some TF preprocessors, like <a href="https://pypi.org/project/terraformpy/">terraformpy</a>, but I haven’t tried any.</p>

<h2 id="type-system-is-too-rigid">Type system is too rigid</h2>

<p>In Terraform before 0.12, everything was a string, and that was ugly (<code>count = "${var.enabled ? 1 : 0}"</code>). Terraform 0.12 added proper booleans, numbers, even some data structures like sets and maps. That was an improvement. However:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>When defining a module’s contract (i.e. specifying the types for its input variables), it’s not currently practical to use <code>map</code> or <code>object</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>map</code> type requires all values in the map to have the same type, which can be useful in a some cases (environment variable values are always strings), but not very often, in my experience.</p>

<p>The <code>object</code> type is a map without that restriction on value types, but if you’re going to say a variable’s type is <code>object</code>, you need to specify all the names of the keys and the types of their values. Okay… that doesn’t sound so bad. And <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/19898">all of the keys are mandatory</a>. What!? This makes <code>object</code> useless as a variable type, where you’ll often want to just pass in one value as an override and leave some set of defaults.</p>

<p>If you put these types on your variables, you’ll fail to plan in all sorts of surprising ways. You’ll try to pass <code>alarm_config = { enabled = true, threshold_seconds = 30 }</code> to your <code>map</code> variable and fail to plan because the value types aren’t uniform. So you’ll change it to an object, then realize that you can’t omit the <code>period_seconds</code> parameter which was supposed to optionally merge on top of a default. It’s an uphill battle. These types, in this context, are so rigid that they cause a lot of …</p></li></ul></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>This post is a follow-up to the intro post about <a href="https://www.arvarik.com/visiting-the-stable-marriage-problem">The Stable Marriage Problem</a>.
Check out the previous post to understand the problem/solution because this post examines its implications, particularly in the
modern dating world.</p><hr><h2>Modern Times</h2><p>A fascinating consequence of the internet is how much closer it has brought the problem of finding your soulmate, as well as how
much closer the assumptions in the original Stable Marriage Problem (SMP) are true in reality. The <a href="https://www.eecs.harvard.edu/cs286r/courses/fall09/papers/galeshapley.pdf">original paper</a>
from 1962 has assumptions that neither worked then nor now, but it started the discussion on how to best pair people for marriage and any entities for any purpose in general.</p><p>The original SMP assumes that everybody knows everybody so that each person can rank everyone in the opposite gender.
This was a clearly unrealistic assumption back in 1962, however, nothing has been a more unifying resource
in the history of humanity than the interent.</p><p>While the SMP may have been an interesting experiment to replicate in a small closed off town 25 years ago, people are finding other people
at a much greater rate and from a larger and more diverse group, allowing the SMP to simulate real life more accurately.</p><p>The table below shows the top three ways people have met their partner by decade in the past 50 years:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Decade / Rank</th><th>1</th><th>2</th><th>3</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1960’s</td><td>Through Friend (19%)</td><td>Through Family (13%)</td><td>Primary / Secondary School (12%)</td></tr><tr><td>1970’s</td><td>Through Friend (21%)</td><td>Through Family (13%)</td><td>Bar / Restaurant (10%)</td></tr><tr><td>1980’s</td><td>Through Friend (18%)</td><td>Through Coworker (16%)</td><td>Bar / Restaurant (14%)</td></tr><tr><td>1990’s</td><td>Through Friend (18%)</td><td>Through Coworker (15%)</td><td>Bar / Restaurant (12%)</td></tr><tr><td>2000’s</td><td>Through Friend (19%)</td><td>Bar / Restaurant (11%)</td><td>Through Coworker (10%)</td></tr><tr><td>2010’s</td><td>Met Online (19%)</td><td>Through Friend (17%)</td><td>Bar / Restaurant (15%)</td></tr></tbody></table><p><a href="https://data.stanford.edu/hcmst2017">Source</a></p><p>The 2010’s showed a monumental rise in online dating, and the number of people who have met their significant other online is only
going to continue to grow. Online dating is interesting in particular because it provides us with a breadth of
information on dating patterns in the modern age.</p><p>I wanted to see how the SMP actually worked when run through some simulations, and how well it actually models real life.</p><p>In order to benchmark some variants of the SMP that model real life more accurately, let's start off by simulating the classic problem scenario
proposed over 50 years ago.</p><h2>Simulations</h2><h3>Classic</h3><p>I created a <a href="https://github.com/Arvind-Arik/stable-marriage-problem/blob/master/classic/stable_marriage_problem_classic.py">Python implementation</a>
of the classic SMP solution in order to calculate some initial results on what a 'perfect' world would be like.</p><p>The assumptions in the classic SMP scenario is that everybody knows each other and people's preference towards the opposite
group is randomly and uniformly distributed. This basically means that everybody has an equal chance to be liked by someone of the opposite gender.</p><p>The standard algorithm was run with different population levels and the number of iterations to find a stable
matching as well as the preference rank each person matched with on average was recorded.</p><p>The latter point is shown in the second graph
and is portrayed as the difference between the rank of what every girl got, minus the rank of what every guy got (notice
the title indicates an advantage for men, this is because in pretty much all scenarios the man came out higher in the matching, a.k.a
the 'reacher')</p><p><span>
      <span></span>

    </span></p><p>From the simulations we can observe two things:</p><ul><li><p>The first graph demonstrates the <code>O(n²)</code> complexity of the algorithm. We can see that as the community grows larger, even
by a small amount, the amount of iterations it takes to solve the matching problem grows exponentially.</p><ul><li>It shows how the difficulty of finding a stable matching between two people grows at a disproportionate rate when population
of the community increases. </li></ul></li><li><p>The second graph shows the difference in preference ranks for each group of people. It is calculated by examining each
matching and seeing where the woman lies on the man's preference rank and where the man lies on the woman's preference rank.</p><ul><li><p>Since the only difference between the two groups is which group 'proposes' first, we see as an outcome that men have an
advantage in this scenario in that, compared to women, they end up with a partner higher on their preference list.</p></li><li><p>The advantage starts off high, and seems to converge at around 13-14% advantage for men</p></li></ul></li></ul><h3>Preference Manipulated by Dating Pattern</h3><p>There are some pretty large assumptions being thrown around in the classic SMP scenario.</p><p>In my opinion, the biggest
assumption made is that preference sets are randomly assigned and uniformly distributed. This means that everyone's preference
is not correlated with one another's, and that for large enough populations everyone's attractivness is roughly the same
(based on how the opposite gender ranks).</p><p>I don't know about you, but I certainly don't have an online following of girls gushing over me like Timothée Chalamet does.</p><hr><p>As mentioned before, one of the interesting ramifications of the rise in online dating is the amount of data we can aggregate from it.</p><p>OkCupid periodically releases dating information in <a href="https://theblog.okcupid.com/">their blog</a>, and some time ago they released
some interesting numbers in how men perceive attractiveness of the opposite sex versus women. The following charts outline the discrepancy:</p><p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="Attractiveness" title="Attractiveness" src="https://www.arvarik.com/static/980433e71b121de8ddd0ab2ecd864ba9/7d769/attractiveness.png" srcset="https://www.arvarik.com/static/980433e71b121de8ddd0ab2ecd864ba9/5243c/attractiveness.png 240w,https://www.arvarik.com/static/980433e71b121de8ddd0ab2ecd864ba9/ab158/attractiveness.png 480w,https://www.arvarik.com/static/980433e71b121de8ddd0ab2ecd864ba9/7d769/attractiveness.png 960w,https://www.arvarik.com/static/980433e71b121de8ddd0ab2ecd864ba9/8ba70/attractiveness.png 1202w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" loading="lazy">
    </span></p><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/11/18/okcupid-inbox-attractive/">Source</a></p><p>From the data (specifically the dotted lines) we can see two things:</p><ul><li><p>Men's ranking of women pretty closely resembles a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">normal distribution</a>.
This is easy to conceptualize as essentially half of women in mens eyes are above average and half are below.</p></li><li><p>Women's ranking of men is more closely related to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_distribution">Pareto distribution</a>, also known as the 80-20 distribution.
With respect to this problem, it means that if we could quantify attractiveness for every guy, the top 20% of men hold 80% of cumulative attractiveness
in the eyes of women. In an unrelated note, Bernie seems a lot more appealing right about now.</p></li></ul><h3>So how do we change our problem?</h3><p>We can tweak our original code so that each gender's preference rankings are more aligned with their respective distribution of opposite
sex attractiveness.</p><p>Here is the <a href="https://github.com/Arvind-Arik/stable-marriage-problem/blob/master/distribution/stable_marriage_problem_distribution.py">updated code</a>. Take a
look in particular about the shuffling code for preference lists. The new shuffling code applies the normal distribution for guys
and pareto distribution for girls.</p><p>I ran the same simulations again with the updated code and it produced the following results: </p><p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="SMP Distribution" title="SMP Distribution" src="https://www.arvarik.com/static/a637509c86c5ca77b0b6bcb3d10b015f/ff59c/smp_distribution.png" srcset="https://www.arvarik.com/static/a637509c86c5ca77b0b6bcb3d10b015f/5243c/smp_distribution.png 240w,https://www.arvarik.com/static/a637509c86c5ca77b0b6bcb3d10b015f/ab158/smp_distribution.png 480w,https://www.arvarik.com/static/a637509c86c5ca77b0b6bcb3d10b015f/ff59c/smp_distribution.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" loading="lazy">
    </span></p><p>This is the same type of data analyzed from the previous simulation, but with much different results:</p><ul><li><p>The first graph shows a similar <code>O(n²)</code> complexity of the algorithm, but the constant value for the graph's equation is much higher</p><ul><li><p>The standard SMP for 1000 pairings took around 7,000 iterations to complete - with the new simulations, the SMP algorithm
runs in about 21,000 iterations, or 3 times as much</p></li><li><p>This makes sense in terms of the distributions. Since more women now have the same few men in the top 20% of their preference lists, the number
of conflicts increases when running the algorithm and causes a lot more men to be dumped and subsequently resume their search for a better soulmate</p></li></ul></li><li><p>The second graph is particularly interesting and shows a marked increase in the 'advantage' men have simply for being the proposers</p><ul><li><p>The increase here stabilizes at around 38-39% and is again around 3 times larger than the advantage men had in the classic SMP scenario</p></li><li><p>This increase also makes sense because of the discrepancies in preferences between men and women. If the average man was paired with the average woman,
the OkCupid data shows that the man would see the woman as average in attractiveness while the woman would see the man as below average attractiveness</p></li></ul></li></ul><h2>What Did We Learn From This?</h2><p>There's obviously many gross inaccuaries when trying to reasonably model the dating world, but the SMP offers an initial glimpse as to why dating is so difficult
and why certain tropes exist.</p><h3>Why it's always better to be the initiator</h3><p>A clear callout from the analysis is that men end up having the advantage when everyone is paired. There's two main reason for this:</p><p><strong>1) Societal Expectations:</strong></p><p>Men are traditionally assumed to be the first group to make a move and it is why the men in the code simulations make the first move.
Because men make the first move, the algorithm benefits men as it works in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm">greedy behavior</a> to get them the
best possible partner.</p><p>With respect to the problem, any gender can theoretically be the one to make the first move and reap the benefits demonstrated by the SMP simulations.</p><p><span>

    </span> <em>⠀From WikiHow, I can't really draw this well</em></p><p><strong>2) Preferences of Men vs Women:</strong></p><p>The discrepancy in preferences for the opposite sex between men and women is what caused the stable pairing advantage for men to jump from 13% to 39%. While
all other things are held constant, it was the preferences that caused this jump because it all ends up relating to how people <em>perceive</em> attractiveness.</p><p>The OkCupid data shows that women have higher standards for men than men have for women, and this is the main driver for why there is a larger male advantage
when the SMP algorithm incorporated the gender attractiveness distributions.</p><p>I am in no way concluding that women are unhappier with men in their relationships - there are a million other factors including personality, status and chemistry
that affect how each person in the relationship views each other.</p><p><em>However</em>, it does lead us to how the outside world perceives the relationships...</p><h3>Settlers and Reachers</h3><p>The show <em>How I Met Your Mother</em> was a staple TV show during my coming of age years, and it surprisingly had many apt theories surrounding modern dating.</p><p>One of the most notable ones was the concept of Settlers and Reachers - as said in the show:</p><blockquote><p><em>Every good relationship has a reacher and a settler.

      <p>“What would you say if I asked you to design me a service capable of responding to millions of user requests every second and latency was critical?”</p>

<p>“Umm…that you have to solve this problem at work. But you’re out of ideas, and are looking to interviewees for suggestions”</p>

<p>That’s the actual response I gave the interviewer the first time I was asked a design question. He had a good laugh. But then still made me design the service.</p>

<p>In the decade since I’ve lost track of how many hours I’ve spent in the interview room, on both sides of the table. I’ve worked at Microsoft, Google, and Stripe, and received offers from many other companies. As I interviewed, I realized one thing: standard interviewing advice falls woefully short.</p>

<p>What good does it do to practice coding problems for weeks if your mind goes blank in an interview room? How can you show your “best self” if you’re too afraid to let it out? Everyone says to be wary of the recruiters, but what if you weren’t?</p>

<p>I tested the answers to these questions multiple times (sometimes by accident). Turns out conventional wisdom gets you conventional results. But you can do better. Interviewing is a skill and anyone can learn it.</p>

<p>For some reason no one talks about these challenges with interviewing. But I’ve found some principles that help me over and over again:</p>

<p>We’ll cover:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Using recruiters to your advantage</li>
  <li>Going to real interviews for practice</li>
  <li>Being open to learning during interviews</li>
  <li>Keeping those skills sharp even when you’re not job hunting</li>
</ul>



<p>Their voice sounds so friendly and helpful when you chat with them on the phone. “Zain, I’m looking forward to seeing you when you come for your interview!” Clearly it’s all an act, past-me assumed. I was sure they were secretly judging me, deciding if I was good enough to work at the company.</p>

<p>And they do judge. But not in the way I was expecting.</p>

<p>Recruiters aren’t evaluating you technically, not by the time you pick up the phone anyways. Their decision on whether you have the technical chops to be worth interviewing was made well before that call. If you’re being offered an interview: Congratulations, you’ve already passed that bar</p>

<p>Now the recruiter wants to work with you. Their whole job is to, you know, recruit. They know that you statistically have poor interview prep skills, and they’re happy to help fix that flaw. Why discard a strong candidate who can’t interview well? They’ll level the playing field by helping everyone show their best selves when interviewing.</p>

<p><strong>How can you take advantage of this?</strong></p>

<p>Ask them questions! Things like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>“What are the company values that would be good to highlight during the interview?”</li>
  <li>“I’m interested in X, Y, &amp; Z. What other companies are hiring?” (Only try this if the recruiter reached out to you first, they work for a recruiting agency, and you haven’t had your interview yet)</li>
</ul>

<p>And you can be forthright about any problems you run into:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you get sick the day before the interview, call up the recruiter and ask to reschedule. They want to test you when you’re at your best!</li>
  <li>Work pressures left you with no time to prepare? You can still try rescheduling. At worst they’ll say “sorry, we can’t do that”. It will not hurt your chances of getting in</li>
</ul>

<p>Your mad technical skills no longer matter to them. If anything, humility and an openness to learning will show you in the best light.</p>



<p>You need to build up your interview skills. LeetCode is great, but it doesn’t come close to the real thing. Try to interview at actual companies as much as possible. And don’t limit yourself to the companies you care about.</p>

<p><strong>Learn to deal with pressure</strong></p>

<p>When you’re in a real interview the world changes: You’re locked in a cage with a lion. Every heartbeat is a gorilla bashing to break free. Your mental gears gunk up as your body goes into fight or flight mode. Your clammy hands struggle to write half legible code on the white board. A threat hides behind every shadow. Even an innocuous “Would you like something to drink?” is a nefarious test: do I pick coke or coffee?</p>

<p>You only get that experience in a real interview. And only real interviews teach you how to deal with it. The first interview will kick your ass. So will the second. But once you get a few under your belt you’ll get used to the adrenaline rush. Perhaps enjoy it even. You’ll become a bullfighter, confidently facing down the charging bull. That’s how you get over the fear.</p>

<p>You may even find that these practice interviews are much easier! When the stakes are low that lion doesn’t look so fierce. I’ve found that I perform the best in the interviews where I don’t care about the outcome. I’m much more relaxed and at ease. I can think faster, my brain reaches out to more possibilities. Now, even in important interviews I try to convince myself that I don’t really care. That mindset shift is only possible because I got to experience it in the low stakes games first.</p>

<p><strong>Learn to answer the more ambiguous questions</strong></p>

<p>And what about the questions? After each interview write down all the questions you were asked. The same evening look over the questions while they’re still fresh in your mind. Focus especially on ones which have no clear right answer, such as behavioral and design questions. Think about how you could have responded better. Are there stories from your life you could have referenced? Wait a few days and look at them again. You’ll find better answers.</p>

<p>Each answer you prepare this way becomes a blob of paint on your pallet. Chances are high that you’ll come across similar questions in future interviews. Over time you’ll be able to mix the answers from your pallet to paint a picture demonstrating just how valuable an asset you can be to their company.</p>

<p><strong>Stay open to serendipity</strong></p>

<p>As you do these interviews, you may discover that the “practice” company is actually interesting after all. Recruiters count on that. I’ve had recruiters suggest I interview even when I told them I didn’t care for the company. “Maybe you’ll change your mind after seeing us up close”, they’d suggest.</p>

<p>And I did. More than once.</p>



<p>I learned this one by accident, but boy does it pay off.</p>

<p>I was wandering around the booths with my bag full of swag. My eyes caught a pile of rubik’s cubes being given away by some company I’d never heard of. I wanted one! Of course I couldn’t just go up and ask for it directly, so I went and chatted with the guy manning the booth. His name was Vince. A few minutes later I walked away with my prized rubik’s cube in hand. That evening Vince called me up offering to conduct a full interview loop on campus. I already had a job offer from a company I liked, but I thought “Sure, why not? I could use the experience”</p>

<p>I had no intention of joining the company, they were some boring finance business. There was nothing to lose. So during the interview I felt free to ask any question I wanted. When I thought I got the answer to an interview question wrong, I’d ask “I don’t think I did so great here. What’s the right answer to this problem?” (I wanted to learn the answer for future interviews!). When asked a challenging question I could grin and delight in the problem solving aspect instead of worrying about how badly it would reflect on me. (Remember my smart aleck remark in the intro? That was this interview.)</p>

<p>Turns out they liked that: the next day I had a second job offer. At a significantly higher salary than my first one. Oh, and they wanted to fly me to New York in two weeks for an introduction to the company. I still didn’t want to join, but a free trip to New York? Sign me up! The company’s name: Bloomberg</p>

<p>Bloomberg was a practiced hand at recruiting. They had a full two days of events to leave us starry eyed about the company (I came thiiiiis close to accepting their offer). While there, Vince told me I’d made a great impression by fearlessly asking questions, even when I was stumped.</p>

<p>Since then I’ve stopped hesitating before asking any question in an interview. Let your curiosity run free! Don’t cage it! And as an interviewer, I can attest: sincere interest is always a good sign.</p>



<p><a href="https://twitter.com/docjamesw">James Whittaker</a> recommends trying to get a job offer every year, just to make sure you can.</p>

<p>It’s an extremely liberating feeling knowing that even if you lose your job you’ll be able to find another one quickly. That’s a huge stress off your back.</p>

<p>I haven’t been very good about this myself, but every once in a while I’ll accept an invitation from a recruiter (it helps to set up your LinkedIn account). I don’t bother doing any prep for these interviews, at least not initially. Those interviews show me the areas I need to brush up on or where the industry practices are changing.</p>

<p>For example, in a tech screen I did last summer there was some miscommunication and I didn’t realize they expected actual working code. Instead of the usual pseudo code written in a google doc, the interviewer told me to select my language of choice on an online IDE. Now, I don’t have a particular language I consider myself super proficient in. I touch many different tools at work and end up having to use a different language about every 5 months. So even basic things like “create an array” tends to require googling the syntax. Given that, what’s my favorite language of choice? C#, hands down. So I selected that.</p>

<p>What hadn’t occurred to me at the time is that C# is a very verbose language which Visual Studio beautifully automates away the tedious parts of. This online IDE automated nothing. Even for a basic task like creating an array I had to spend precious interview minutes looking up the right package to import and the exact syntax to use. Needless to say, I ran out of time. I crashed and burned there, but it opened my eyes to the way interviews are changing and how I needed to prepare in the future.</p>

<p>Four months later a company called Stripe reached out to me. They also expect you to write working code and even let you use your own IDE. This time I was ready. And …</p></div></div>

              <p>One common pattern for modern organizations is to centralize user management with a bottleneck architecture. A solid user management system is provisioned and all authentication and authorization requests are routed through it, rather than individual applications having their own auth components.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="the-architectural-pattern-with-oidc-and-saml">The Architectural Pattern With OIDC and SAML</h2>

<p>In this architectural pattern, applications delegate user management to the user management system. Many kinds of applications can perform such delegation. Examples include custom applications written by internal teams, third party services used by employees, such as Salesforce and Zendesk, and applications used by customers, such as forums or account management.</p>

<p>Like any serious architecture discussion, we’ll need some acronyms and jargon. There are a few identity management standards, including OpenID Connect (OIDC), released in the mid 2010s, and Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML), which was standardized in the 2000s.</p>

<p>If the protocol in use is OIDC, applications delegating auth decisions are called Relying Parties, or RPs. If the protocol is SAML, the delegating applications are called Service Providers, or SPs. In either case, decisions about authentication or authorization, and often account management, are shifted from the application to a central service.</p>

<p>In OIDC systems, this centralized auth system is referred to as an OpenID provider, or OP. For SAML based systems, it is called an Identity Provider, or IdP. The system’s scope includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>authentication - who is this user?</li>
  <li>authorization - what can this user do?</li>
  <li>user management - registration, forgot password flows, two factor authentication, reporting, and more</li>
</ul>

<p>However, an auth system isn’t limited to just verifying users locally. It can also federate to other providers of identity, such as Google, HYPR or Facebook. In addition, standards compliant providers adhering to the SAML or OIDC specifications can be integrated.</p>

<p>Here’s a diagram of the bottleneck architecture:</p>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/bottleneck-pattern/bottleneck-diagram.png" alt="A common archictural diagram."></p>

<p>The applications, in purple, rely on the centralized auth system, which is in gray. They’ll send all their auth requests to one place. Depending on how the auth system is configured, the applications’ requests for user information may be answered directly, based on information in the auth system’s datastore. Or, alternately, auth requests for a given user can be relayed to the federated identity providers, in orange. (You can read more about <a href="https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/identity-providers/">the identity providers</a> FusionAuth supports.)</p>

<h2 id="benefits-of-a-user-auth-service">Benefits of a User Auth Service</h2>

<p>This user management architecture enables single sign-on (SSO) and has substantial benefits when implemented. Among them are increased visibility, decreased operational complexity, and increased choice of auth method.</p>

<h3 id="increased-visibility-and-development-speed">Increased Visibility and Development Speed</h3>

<p>There is one location for user and application management. Therefore, implementing organization wide policies is easier, including those which are security or compliance related. Users also have only one identity to maintain, so any changes, such as to their password or personal information, are relatively easy to make.</p>

<p>This bottleneck also serves as a well maintained list of applications used by the organization. That is, if everyone uses it. Knowing which services are in use, and seeing who is using them how often, is as simple as signing into the auth service administration panel. This also helps the organization avoid buying apps with overlapping functionality, since you can review the list of active applications.</p>

<p>If your auth system has mature user management functionality, it will accelerate custom application development by providing often used services. No more worrying about building a front end to allow customer service reps to lock accounts. Nor do you have to build a way to let end users reset their passwords or register.</p>

<h3 id="operational-ease">Operational Ease</h3>

<p>Such a centralized user auth service also makes it easy to turn accounts on and off. Onboarding a new employee becomes simpler, and offboarding departing employees is a matter of disabling their account in one place, rather than hunting down all the applications to which they have access. Or worse, leaving those accounts enabled.</p>

<p>There are additional benefits to end users, as well. While identifying people with username, password and multi-factor authentication is a secure and relatively convenient method, there may be times when an alternative is a better user experience.</p>

<h3 id="give-your-users-the-experience-they-want">Give Your Users the Experience They Want</h3>

<p>As you might expect, different types of users have different third party accounts. If you have a consumer focused application, offering sign on with Facebook is a great idea, because everyone has a Facebook account. One less password for your potential users to remember, and one less obstacle to signing up.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if the application is aimed at enterprise customers, integrating with ActiveDirectory can help adoption. If developers are your target market, GitHub authentication eases the sign-up process as well as signals to them that you understand their needs.</p>

<p>If your auth system allows for multiple different identity providers, your application can meet users “where they are”, rather than requiring them to create and manage a new account.</p>

<p>If you work for a large organization, you may need to federate your user management system, using one of the standards such as OIDC, to other user datastores. Having a central service for your suite of applications means federation and integration only needs to be done once, rather than for each application you build.</p>

<h2 id="challenges-with-sso">Challenges With SSO</h2>

<p>Of course, nothing is perfect. There are challenges with this approach as well. Some technical, some not so much.</p>

<p>First off is the <a href="https://sso.tax/">SSO tax</a>. Many third party applications don’t support this user auth delegation until you are on an enterprise plan. Ouch. Investigate required applications to see if and how they can act as a RP or SP to a centralized user management system before you decide to pursue this architecture.</p>

<p>Another organizational challenge is ensuring developers and end users actually use the organization’s user management system. Some may want to use their old, familiar authentication solutions. Encourage everyone to work within these constraints by making adoption as easy as possible and clearly explaining the benefits. Providing examples of successful integrations can help with both of these.</p>

<p>Tying together the bottleneck system, the delegating applications, and the external identity providers requires effort. Sometimes it is as simple as following a tutorial on a website and adding a few lines of configuration. Other times it may be more complicated and may require support.</p>

<p>Finally, beware of insecure or slow auth services. No one cares about authentication and authorization, except when it doesn’t work. When was the last time you heard someone exclaim “I love that login page!”? People want to log in when and how they choose and have it work, so they can get on to the task they need to accomplish. Select a system that is robust, has great support, and is flexible enough to meet future needs.</p>

<h2 id="see-it-in-action-see-with-hypr-and-fusionauth">See It In Action See With HYPR and FusionAuth</h2>

<p>If you’d like to see how easy it is to configure FusionAuth to serve as an centralized authentication and authorization service, HYPR and FusionAuth are hosting a webinar on Thursday, July 16 2020.</p>

<p>In less than 15 minutes, Zendesk will be set up as an application delegating auth decisions to FusionAuth (well, if you want to be technical, as an SP using SAML). HYPR will be configured as an identity provider. At the end, a user will be able to sign into Zendesk using HYPR’s Passwordless technology.</p>

        <p>Automated firmware testing on real embedded hardware is what every hardware
company strives to build. The mission is to repeatedly verify that changes to
firmware being merged into master and shipped to customers will not cause
catastrophic failures like power regressions or bootloops.</p>

<p>The problem with automated firmware testing with real hardware is that it’s
<strong>hard</strong>. Not only does the system require a stable firmware to build on top of,
but it will also require extra hardware, like flashers and power supplies, and
software to orchestrate the tests and capture results.</p>

<p>An alternative to building a complicated orchestration system for automated
tests is to use the popular hardware emulator project, Renode, and its built-in
Robot Framework integration. By using Renode in conjunction with GitHub Actions,
we can ensure that every pull-request and commit to master passes all our tests.</p>

<!-- excerpt start -->

<p>In this post, I cover what it takes to build a simple firmware for use with
Renode, how to build and administer tests with Robot Framework, and how to run
these tests within GitHub’s continuous integration system.</p>

<h2 id="automation-testing-for-firmware">Automation Testing for Firmware</h2>

<p>Test automation is the practice of testing software and/or hardware in a
repeatable and scalable way where expected values are compared against actual
values.</p>

<p>There are various forms of test automation, and they are usually run under a
continuous integration system, such as Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or CircleCI.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Software Unit Tests - Isolated tests that exercise a single module. Usually
run on the host machine and sometimes on an emulator or real device.</li>
  <li>Integration Tests - Tests that exercise a collection of modules that interact
with each other</li>
  <li>End-to-end Tests - Tests that exercise an entire technical stack end-to-end.
These tests would usually communicate with some sort of backend in the cloud
or a mobile phone.</li>
</ul>

<p>These testing approaches are not limited entirely to software, as hardware can
be tested in similar ways. “Hardware unit testing” is a concept where individual
pieces of the larger hardware board are put under test to ensure the chip itself
behaves correctly. Integration tests and end-to-end tests can also be performed
on hardware, but the complexity increases exponentially as more hardware is
thrown into the mix.</p>

<p>A middle ground between host-run tests and hardware tests is testing on an
emulator which emulates the real hardware as much as possible. Renode, by
Antmicro, has become our favorite emulator at Memfault, and its list of support
boards is continually growing<sup id="fnref:renode_boards"><a href="#fn:renode_boards">1</a></sup>. Renode emulates many peripherals
of the board, including the UART, SPI, I2C, RAM, ROM, and GPIO’s.</p>

<p>Renode has a built-in integration with the open-source testing framework called
Robot Framework<sup id="fnref:robot_framework"><a href="#fn:robot_framework">2</a></sup>. Robot Framework is most popular in the web
world, but it is generic and powerful enough to be used for many more use-cases.
It provides the glue between various test scripts, test reporting, and multiple
machines under test.</p>

<h2 id="using-a-shell-for-testing">Using a Shell for Testing</h2>

<p>Whether tests are being run within Renode or on real hardware, there should be a
way to easily run tests on a device.</p>

<p>A common approach is to use a CLI-based shell over serial, which we wrote about
in our post <a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/firmware-shell#integration--automated-tests">Building a Tiny CLI Shell for Tiny
Firmware</a>.</p>

<p>The idea is relatively simple.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create a test that will execute a series of shell commands on a device.</li>
  <li>After each command or series of commands, the results will be compared
against expected values.</li>
  <li>At the end of the test run, the harness determines whether the test was
successful or not.</li>
</ol>

<p>Thankfully for us, Renode has several utilities and helpers built-in that we can
take advantage of.</p>

the examples run fine on the STM32F429i discovery board, they were developed in
Renode, a popular MCU emulation platform.</p>

<p>You can find the complete code example for this blog post in a separate
<a href="https://github.com/memfault/interrupt-renode-test-automation">GitHub repository</a>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/memfault/interrupt-renode-test-automation.git
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="toolchain">Toolchain</h3>

<p>I used the following tools to build my firmware:</p>

<ul>
  <li>GCC 8.3.1 / GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain as our compiler<sup id="fnref:gnu_toolchain"><a href="#fn:gnu_toolchain">3</a></sup></li>
  <li>GNU Make 4.2.1 as the build system</li>
</ul>

<p>Running automated tests with Renode, unfortunately, requires Python 2.7. To keep
things simple for me, I decided to use a Conda environment to keep this entire
environment isolated.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ conda create -n renode
$ conda activate renode
$ conda install -c conda-forge -c memfault \
      python=2.7 gcc-arm-none-eabi make=4.2.1

$ which arm-none-eabi-gcc
/Users/tyler/miniconda3/envs/renode/bin/arm-none-eabi-gcc
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Perfect, I now have <code>arm-none-eabi-gcc</code> and <code>python2.7</code> in my path.</p>

development</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It turns out the Renode team packages the application in a
<a href="https://anaconda.org/antmicro/renode">Renode Conda package</a>, but at the time of
writing this post, not all platforms had the latest version released (v1.9,
released in March). For that reason, I chose to install it locally for this
post.</p>

<h3 id="renode--robot-framework">Renode &amp; Robot Framework</h3>

<p>To install Renode, I’ve found the best instructions to be on the
<a href="https://github.com/renode/renode#installation">Renode GitHub Page</a>. In the
example repo, I’ve created a <code>start.sh</code> script which points to my local Renode
installation on my Mac. If you are using another platform, you’ll have to update
this script to point to your own Renode start script.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/bin/sh</span>

sh /Applications/Renode.app/Contents/MacOS/macos_run.command renode-config.resc
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To run Robot Framework alongside Renode, we’ll also need to clone the Renode
repository and all of its submodules, as well as install all of the required
Python dependencies.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:renode/renode.git
$ cd renode

# Install Robot Framework and other dependencies
$ pip install -r tools/requirements.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="docker">Docker</h3>

<p>To use Renode with Robot Framework in CI, it’s best to use the official
<a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/antmicro/renode">Renode Docker image</a> for running the
tests. If you haven’t already, you’ll want to install
<a href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop">Docker</a>.</p>

<h2 id="example-firmware-overview">Example Firmware Overview</h2>

<p>This post builds upon previous ideas and examples written on Interrupt. If you
find yourself missing some context, the following posts would be useful:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/intro-to-renode">Cortex-M MCU Emulation with
Renode</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/firmware-shell">Building a Tiny CLI Shell for Tiny Firmware</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Rather than the STM32Cube HAL, I used an open-source MCU HAL called <code>libopencm3</code>
with excellent support for the STM32. It is included as a submodule in the repo.</p>

<p>The primary way we’ll control the firmware is through a CLI shell written
previously and linked above.</p>

<p>With the shell in place, this means that our main loop of the firmware is
simply:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>clock_setup</span><span>();</span>
    <span>gpio_setup</span><span>();</span>
    <span>usart_setup</span><span>();</span>

    <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"App STARTED</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>);</span>

    <span>// Configure shell</span>
    <span>sShellImpl</span> <span>shell_impl</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>.</span><span>send_char</span> <span>=</span> <span>usart_putc</span><span>,</span>
    <span>};</span>
    <span>shell_boot</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>shell_impl</span><span>);</span>

    <span>char</span> <span>c</span><span>;</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>c</span> <span>=</span> <span>usart_getc</span><span>();</span>
        <span>shell_receive_char</span><span>(</span><span>c</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The supporting <code>*_setup()</code> calls and their implementations can be found in the
other <code>.c</code> files in
<a href="https://github.com/memfault/interrupt-renode-test-automation/tree/master/src"><code>src/</code></a>.</p>

<p>We can build our example firmware by invoking Make.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ make -j4
Building libopencm3
  GENHDR  include/libopencm3/stm32/f4/irq.json
  [...]
  AR      libopencm3_stm32f4.a
  LD    build/renode-example.elf
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now we have our <code>renode-example.elf</code> file which we can load into Renode.</p>



<p>And then we see our firmware’s shell in the UART window of Renode.</p>

<p>
  <img width="700" src="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/img/test-automation-renode/renode-start.png">
</p>

<p>We can interact with it exactly as if it was connected to our computer over USB
serial! This would have made writing and testing the firmware for my <a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/firmware-shell">Tiny
Shell</a> post <strong>much</strong> easier. I’m glad
I took the time now to learn Renode for the next time.</p>

<h2 id="anatomy-of-a-robot-framework-test">Anatomy of a Robot Framework Test</h2>

<p>Now that we’ve verified that the firmware works within Renode, it’s time to
think about how we are going to test our firmware. We have two shell commands,
<code>help</code> and <code>ping</code> which are probably useful “sanity” checks that we can test, so
let’s start with those.</p>

<p>If we write <code>ping</code> as a command into our shell, the following is printed:</p>



<p>It makes logical sense to test that this exact text is printed. Although
incredibly basic, this is the code that we are testing within our firmware:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>cli_command_ping</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>argc</span><span>,</span> <span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>argv</span><span>[])</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>shell_put_line</span><span>(</span><span>"PONG"</span><span>);</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The following is a Robot Framework test file that calls the <code>ping</code> shell command
and expects that <code>PONG</code> is printed.</p>

July 8, 2020 | https://blog.quidsentio.com/posts/journal-types-and-writing-techniques/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.quidsentio.com/posts/journal-types-and-writing-techniques/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The reasons to start a journal, the topics contained in a journal, and the
journaling techniques available are as diverse as the humans in the world. But
your unique journaling idiosyncrasy might draw inspiration from how other people
journal.</p>
<p>We start with the <a href="#journal-types">Journal Types list</a>, or you can go directly
to the <a href="#writing-techniques">Writing Techniques list</a> down below.</p>

<h2>Journal Types (or Themes)</h2>
<p>These are ways of keeping a journal around a topic or theme. While in general
they are used as single-purpose journals, there’s no reason you couldn’t mix any
of them together in your own journal.</p>
<h3>Diary or Personal Journal</h3>
<p>The most common type, this is just you writing about you. It’s probably the
first thing that pops into your mind when you think about a journal.</p>
<p>You could think of it as <em>tabula rasa</em>, a blank slate that you can transform into
anything. The types below are more specific about what or how you should write
(or draw or record or glue).</p>
<p><strong><em>Basic orientation:</em></strong> Write every day about your day, whatever comes to mind. The
only rule is that it should be a daily habit.</p>
<h3>Gratitude Journal</h3>
<p><em>"A gratitude journal is a diary of things for which one is grateful."</em> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratitude_journal" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>)</p>
<p>The idea is that you focus on what's positive in your life. Things, people,
circumstances, luck, the divine, the small things, anything that you are
thankful to have in your life and happening to you.</p>
<p><strong><em>Basic orientation:</em></strong> Write at least once a week and explain what you’re grateful
for, and try to discover why those good things happened to you. You can use
lists, write at length, or even draw.</p>
<h3>Art Journal</h3>
<p>This is for the artists! Not necessarily professional ones, of course. It’s
dedicated to registering the art you produce. It usually takes the form of
drawings or poetry, as those are the arts that are better suited for the medium
— if you are using a paper journal. If you are using Quid Sentio, you can sing!</p>
<p>It can be either for practice, like a sketchbook, a concept book, or an ideas
book, or for personal thoughts and feelings. It’s similar to a regular personal
journal, but you use art to record thoughts about your day.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poetic_diary" target="_blank">Japanese Poetic Diaries</a> are a
particularly distinguished variation — actually more of a literary genre of their
own.</p>
<p><strong><em>Basic orientation:</em></strong> Reserve a time for your art practice, create the habit and do
it in your journal. But only your drafts, experiments, and concepts. Real art
should go elsewhere.</p>
<h3>Doodle Journal</h3>
<p>Not much of an artist, but still into drawing? Try a doodle journal! Doodles are
those drawings done while your mind is elsewhere — a phone conversation, a math
lesson, a lecture. If you are keeping a journal of them, it’s not so
absent-minded anymore, but you can keep the same unpretentiousness and
inconsequentialness to it.</p>
<p>Doodling mostly requires physical journals, and while a whole journal of doodles
might not be so attractive, they can be a good addition to your regular journal.</p>
<p><strong><em>Basic orientation:</em></strong> Doodle without shame in whatever type of journal you decide
to keep.</p>
<h3>Scrapbook</h3>
<p>A notebook where you add photographs, tickets, small objects, letters, cards,
and anything else that can be held among paper pages. Digitally, it could add
video, audio, and web links. It can have a theme — your children, a friend, a
particular hobby — or it can be about your life in general.</p>
<p>Scrapbooking tend to be less about writing or creating, and more about
collecting and preserving. You are placing your memories there that have
emotional significance for you. If you write, you write as a label, or
description to what you added there. Scrapbooks have the power to create
beautiful, meaningful, personal collages.</p>
<p><strong><em>Basic orientation:</em></strong> Identify important moments, facts, and events that happen in
your life, and save (or create) some memorabilia for them. It is different from
a regular personal journal in the sense that doesn't have to be a regular habit,
and actually, it shouldn't. You go back to your scrapbook when you have
something that you want to preserve and remember.</p>
<h3>Dream Journal</h3>
<p>Write down your dreams while you remember them. Opinions might diverge about the
meanings and the interpretations of dreams, but it is undeniable that they have
rich imagery. Your conscious mind doesn't even take notice of most of your
dreams, so why not make an effort to record those that are still there when you
wake up?</p>
<p>The exercise of transforming into words the images of your unconscious mind is a
great exercise in itself. And years from now, you can read the very weird and
colorful details of past dreams and draw new interpretations, or just find
entertainment.</p>
<p><strong><em>Basic orientation:</em></strong> Every single day that you wake up and remember a dream (or
nightmare), write it down in detail as soon as you can.</p>
<h3>Travel Journal</h3>
<p>As a traveler, you have a very unique point of view. A lot of what you see is
new, while also maybe oddly familiar. It is a great opportunity to write down
your observations of the world, as every little detail will stand out because of
its different environment, different geography, and people from a different
culture.</p>
<p>It is also one of those techniques that it's a literary genre in itself — not
that you need to write it with any form of publication in mind, or even share it
with anyone.</p>
<p><strong><em>Basic orientation:</em></strong> Write down what stands out about what you observe while
traveling. Don't procrastinate until after the travel is finished. You will
miss, or misremember, a lot of interesting details.</p>
<h3>Goal Journal</h3>
<p>A more straightforward and explicit self-help approach to journaling. You write
your goal or goals and track your progress toward them every day. The idea is
that you keep yourself accountable and always have your goal at the top of your
mind.</p>
<p>It can be reflexive, but it suits better to a less free form of writing. It is
supposed to be pragmatic and critical. You are seeking to achieve a specific
goal.</p>
<p><strong><em>Basic orientation:</em></strong> Write your goals, with very clear ways to measure success or
failure. Then, every day, write if you are making progress towards the goals.
You can write how and why you are progressing or failing to progress.</p>
<h3>Commentarii</h3>
<p>That's one for the old times. By "old times" we mean "Roman Empire old times".</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commentarii" target="_blank">Commentarii</a>
are notes to assist the memory. They were common
in the Roman Empire as public accounts from public men about their perspective
on important events, like wars and other things men do.</p>
<p>Even though you are probably not a Roman statesman, it can add color to our more
mundane observations of the events of our lives. Writing down an account of
events in a little bit more structured way can be a great way to remind yourself
what really happened back then. Our memories can be transformed by our emotions,
and reading your own past description can help uncover perspectives that you may
have forgotten you held.</p>
<p><strong><em>Basic orientation:</em></strong> Something important happened in the world? Write a
structured narrative of the events. It can (and will) be from your subjective
perspective, but try to include the facts. Write as clearly as possible, as a
total stranger could read and understand in totality — not because you are going
to share it with a total stranger, but because years from now you will be a total
stranger to your current self.</p>
<h3>Organizers</h3>
<p>We are starting to drift away from what we generally understand as journaling,
but I want to add the last broad category before moving to writing techniques:
organizers.</p>
<p>It can be a very methodic task organizer, like a bullet journal, or more
activity-focused, like a gardening journal, a sleep diary, a diet diary, or many
other types of logging and task lists.</p>
<p><strong><em>Basic orientation:</em></strong> Each type of organizer has a different method. A bullet
journal is actually a whole journaling method of its own. Overall, they tend to
be very pragmatic and specific in what to write about your tasks and not a good
place for rambling and feelings, so probably not a journal at all in the way we
mean it. We just added them here because they have "journal" or "diary" in their
names, so it’s worth clarifying.</p>

<h2>Writing techniques</h2>
<p>Wow, that was a lot of journal types. "Paradox of Choice" notwithstanding, there
are still a lot of ways you can write in a regular, typical personal journal.</p>
<p>These are suggestions you can use when you feel a sort of writer’s block. You
can have these styles mixed together in your journal, which can be as diverse as
you are.</p>
<h3>Free Form writing</h3>
<p>Your mind is constantly full of thoughts, even if they are half-formed ideas,
untranslatable feelings, and intangible sensations. Free form writing is
transcribing thoughts into words without putting much thought into it. It’s
writing without the need to make sense.</p>
<p>When free form writing, you just start writing — anything, start with any word or
sequence of words. It doesn't have to be coherent or cohesive; it actually
doesn't even have to make grammatical sense. You don't filter, you don't edit,
you don’t worry about using the right words. You just write fast and
continuously.</p>
<p>It is a good technique if you are facing a writers' block, or struggling with
too many thoughts and emotions at the same time that are hard to describe in
words, or for when you just don't want to think anymore, just vent a little bit
through writing.</p>
<p>It is not a good technique if you want to write about an important event in your
life as a memory for your future self or others.</p>
<h3>Reflective writing</h3>
<p>Sometimes you want to properly translate your thoughts into words. In reflective
writing, you more deliberately describe a situation and always add a personal
reflection on the meaning of what you just described.</p>
<p>It requires and reinforces a more structured thought process. Clarity is
paramount. A good way to write is following these three steps in order:
description, interpretation, and outcome.</p>
<p>You start by describing what are you going to analyze. If it is a fact of your
life, you describe what happened. If it is an imaginary situation, you describe
the scene. If it is about a concept, you explain the idea. Then you interpret
the meaning …</p></div></div>

            <section>
                <p>Encoding URIs* has always been a tough job. What exactly do we need to encode? Why are there sometimes <code>%20</code> and <code>+</code> signs in the URI? Why do we need to encode anyway? The answers to these questions are written in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986" target="_blank">RFC3986</a>. This article is a practical summary of the RFC.</p>
<p>* Note that URI is just a collective name for both URL and URN</p>

                <h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
                <p>These are the summarized steps that need to be taken when encoding and decoding a URI. An extended explanation can be found below this section.</p>
                <h3 id="encoding-and-decoding-uris">Encoding and decoding URIs</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>1. Split the URI into its components, based on the <a href="#generic-delimiters">generic delimiters</a>.
                    </li><li>2. Are there scheme-specific (e.g. http, ftp, file) or implementation-specific (a browser or web application) delimiters that need to be used for this URI? *
                        <ul>
                            <li>a. Yes, split the components into subcomponents based on the <a href="#subcomponent-delimiters">subcomponent delimiters</a>. 
                            </li><li>b. No, leave it.
                        </li></ul>
                    </li><li>3. Is there a protocol used that subscribes the encoding?
                        <ul>
                            <li>a. Yes, use the subscribed encoding by the protocol 
                            </li><li>b. No, use the same encoding as the surrounding text
                        </li></ul>
                    </li><li>4a. <strong>ENCODING</strong>: Encode every component and/or subcomponent with the chosen encoding (i.e. transform it into its percent-encoded hexadecimal pair). Use the <a href="#what-characters-to-encode-and-decode?">table</a> to encode all characters except the "never encode" and (depending on your subcomponent delimiters) the "sometimes encode" characters.

                <p>* The RFC only describes the generic syntax of a URI. All URIs should follow that syntax, but every scheme-specific (e.g. http, ftp, file) or implementation-specific (a browser or web application that handles URIs) syntax can have additional rules about which characters are delimiters. It is therefor always necessary to know the additional delimiting rules to 100% correctly encode and decode.</p>

                <h2 id="the-long-read">The long read</h2>
                <h2 id="breaking-the-uri-into-pieces">Breaking the URI into pieces</h2>

<p>
A URI can be divided into components by certain characters that are used as delimiters. The RFC distinguishes generic delimiters and subcomponent delimiters.
</p>

<h3 id="generic-delimiters">Generic delimiters</h3>
<p>
The RFC reserves certain characters to be used as generic delimiters. Those are: <code>:</code>, <code>/</code>, <code>?</code>, <code>#</code>, <code>[</code>, <code>]</code>, <code>@</code>. These might seem familiar if we take a look at a simple URI.</p>

<code>
  foo://alice@example.com:8042/over/there?search=bar#nose
  \_/   \___/ \_________/ \__/ \________/ \________/ \__/
   |	  |        |       |        |         |       |
 scheme userinfo  host    port     path     query  fragment

</code>

<p>* In practice it is also possible to have an IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6) instead of a registered host name, but for simplicity's sake we leave those out.<br>
** Old URIs can also contain a password in the userinfo <code>alice:password</code>, but that has been deprecated because of security.
</p> 


<p>When processing a URI into its components, a URI should be delimited using the generic delimiters based on a "first-match-wins" algorithm. The first <code>?</code> that is encountered after the path or host indicates the start of the query part. Other <code>?</code> that come after the first occurence, are not considered generic delimiters anymore, but data. This means that the following URI should be processed like this:</p>

<code>
 foo://alice@example.com:8042/ove@r/there;color=red;height=200?name?color=brown&amp;height=300#nose?
 \_/   \___/ \_________/ \__/ \______________________________/ \_________________________/ \___/
  |      |        |       |                  |                               |               |
scheme userinfo  host    port               path                           query         fragment

</code>

<p>Note that the second <code>@</code> (in the path) is treated as data in a path and not as a delimiter between userinfo and host. Same goes for the second and third <code>?</code> in the query and fragment parts.</p>

<h3 id="subcomponent-delimiters">Subcomponent delimiters</h3>
<p>In every component there are possible subcomponent delimiters defined. All the reserved subcomponent delimiters are: <code>!</code> <code>$</code> <code>&amp;</code> <code>'</code> <code>(</code> <code>)</code> <code>*</code> <code>+</code> <code>,</code> <code>;</code> <code>=</code>.</p>

<p>An implementation-specific entity (e.g. an API of a web application) can have additional delimitation rules with characters from the reserved subcomponent set. But this is only a rule of the implementation-specific entity itself. The RFC doesn't specify anything about which characters to use when, it only shows the allowed characters to be chosen as subcomponent delimiters.</p>

<p>Let's say that an API has two additional subcomponent rules. </p>
<ol>
<li>In the path, we distinguish key-value pairs coupled with the <code>=</code> character and delimited by the <code>;</code> character (back in the day the so called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/MatrixURIs.html">Matrix URIs</a>).<br>
</li><li>In the query, we distinguish key-value pairs coupled with the <code>=</code> character and delimited by the <code>&amp;</code> character (used for handling web forms).</li></ol>

<p> Further processing of the path and query component would give us:</p>

<code>
foo://alice@example.com:8042/ove@r/there;color=red;height=200?name?color=brown&amp;height=300#nose?
                                         \___/ \_/ \____/ \_/ \________/ \___/ \____/ \_/
                                           |    |    |     |      |        |     |     |
                                           k1   v1   k2    v2     k1       v1    k2    v2
                             \______________________________/ \_________________________/
                                             |                             |
                                            path                         query

</code>

<p>For processing of URIs it is always necessary to know the components of the URI (determined by the generic delimiters) and the subcomponents if there are any specified (determined by the subcomponent delimiters) by an API for example. Only then can the right semantics be determined.</p>


<h2 id="why-to-encode?">Why to encode?</h2>
<div><p>We would like to express as many characters of every language in URIs, so the whole world can use URIs. This is powerful. But not all applications that need to display URIs and their characters want to implement the complete <a href="https://www.unicode.org/charts/" target="_blank">Unicode Character Set</a>.</p><p>
Next to that, we've seen that the URI has a certain structure delimited by special characters. We still would like the possibility to use those special characters in a URI as data. In that case, we need to encode them.</p></div>

<h2 id="different-encoding-format">Different encoding formats</h2>
<p>When we determine that a character should be encoded, we should encode it in a percent-encoded hexadecimal pair (a so called percent-encoded octet). There are multiple encoding formats which encode characters from the UCS into 8-bit octets. A few examples are "UTF-8", "UTF-16" or "ISO-8859-1" (not all of them cover the whole UCS). When we want to transform the character <code>æ</code> to the percent-encoded octet in UTF-8, we see in <a href="https://www.fileformat.info/info/charset/UTF-8/list.htm" target="_blank">this table</a> that it has two hexadecimal pairs: <code>C3A6</code>. This would result in an encoding of the form <code>%C3%A6</code>.
When we would transform the same letter <code>æ</code> to the percent-encoded octet in "ISO-8859-1", we see in <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/miles/iso8859.html#ISO" target="_blank">this table</a> that it has one hexadecimal pair: <code>E6</code>. The resulting encoding would look like this <code>%E6</code>.</p>

<p>Different encoding formats will generate different percent-encoded octets. Therefor it is always necessary to determine the encoding that is used to encode or decode.</p>

<h2 id="which-encoding-to-use?">Which encoding to use?</h2>
<p>It could be that a scheme or certain protocol enforces the use of a certain encoding. In that case that encoding is used. When there is nothing subscribed, the same encoding should be used as the surrounding text of the URI.</p> 
                    
<h2 id="what-characters-to-encode-and-decode?">What characters to encode and decode?</h2>
<p>When a URI is split into the right components we are ready to encode! For every component there is a defined list of which characters should never be encoded, which characters should sometimes be encoded because of the implementation and which characters should sometimes be encoded because of their special use in certain parts of the URI. In the following table all the characters from the RFC are summarized and separated.</p>

<div><p><strong>How should we read this table?</strong><br>
Column 2: For every component there are certain characters always allowed and should never be encoded.</p><p>
Column 3: If some of the implementation-specific characters are delimiters and you also want to use those characters as data, you should encode those characters. If none of the implementation-specific characters are delimiters, you can use all characters as data and don't have to encode anything. </p><p>
Column 4: There are some characters that have special meaning within a component and should always be encoded when used as data.</p><p>
Column 5: Indicates if encoding into a percent-encoded octet is even allowed within that component. If not, encoding is never done.
</p></div>
<p><strong>Example 1</strong><br>
Let's take a look at an example. We have a UTF-8 encoded website <code>http://foo.com</code> where the HTTP protocol doesn't subscribe any implementation-specific delimiters. We have a page on our website with the name <code>bar&amp;fuz</code> (path), a subpage called <code>(fux*)</code> (path) and a query with the name <code>crux&amp;crux</code>. The URI should be displayed like this:<br>
</p>
<code>
http://foo.com/bar&amp;fuz/(fux*)?crux&amp;crux

            because one of the principles involved a commitment to not building

We have never provided user data to the Chinese government, nor would we do so if asked ."</blockquote></div><p>Now this Headline follows a similar story last week which resulted in India banning TikTok and WeChat along with other Chinese applications over similar privacy concerns. A concern that it's worth nothing TikTok also denies.</p><p>Now, what important to put into context just how popular TikTok is a global scale, more than half a billion people use TikTok every single month and well over billion people have downloaded the app worldwide. In the united stated over a quarter of everyone age 24 to, 36 are looking at the app on an almost daily basis , and they spend a lot of time swing videos, all that time spent is teaching the TikTok algorithms hot to understand our consumer behavior it's learning what kind of music we like what kind of people makes us click on things what kind of people we immediately swipe past,&nbsp; what kind of thing we like in terms of outdoor vs indoors, clothing and all sort of other random technical aspects that all add up to really interesting very complete depiction of what we want as consumers.</p>
<!--responsive-->

<p>That information can be used in a million different ways often to sell us things or pushed as to believe things that we may not have otherwise considered and the danger lies in that information getting into the hands of someone who want to leverage it for their personal gain.</p><p>That is the concern with pretty much all date online getting out when it comes to something like TikTok which understand hundreds of data points about its users. It's especial concerns that somebody might want to access that. Now it unclear what will happen from this point forward but we gonna continue covering this story here because TikTok is obviously becoming a major force in the music industry.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>On a recent attempt to pull a realm database file created by an application that I built on my device, I got an error with the following message:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>adb pull /data/data/com.example.test/files/default.realm <span>.</span>
adb: error: failed to <span>stat </span>remote object <span>'/data/data/com.example.test/files/default.realm'</span>: Permission denied
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Let’s see how we can solve this!</p> <h2 id="tldr">TLDR</h2> <p>Long story short, you can run the following command from the <code>Terminal</code> to create a copy of the file in your machine’s file system:</p> <div><div><pre><code>adb shell "run-as om.example.test cat /data/data/com.example.test/files/default.realm" &gt; default.realm
</code></pre></div></div> <blockquote> <p>This only works for Debug builds and not for a production app.</p> </blockquote> <p>But let’s break it down to pieces!</p> <h2 id="explanation">Explanation</h2> <p>You can use <code>adb shell</code> to connect to the device’s shell. Then, if you want to access the data of an app with an <code>applicationId</code> set to <code>com.example.test</code>, you will have to run the command <code>run-as com.example.test</code> inside the adb shell.</p> <p>Once you execute this command, the working directory will change to the <code>/data/data/com.example.test</code>. From there, you can use commands like <code>ls</code> to get a list of the available directories and <code>cat</code> to get the content of a specific file.</p> <p>The last step (<code>&gt; default.realm</code>) is to redirect the content of the file to a file on my machine’s file system.</p> <p>And that’s it! Now you will be able to copy the file from a device for an application that you have built without any error!</p> </div></div>]]>

This hacker is responsible for stealing sensitive data from governments and companies totaling over 300 in number and across 44 countries. About $1.5 million was realized from this cyber attack.</p><p>The invisible god hacker, also known as Fxmsp has been revealed to be a 37-year old citizen of Kazakhstan, Andrey Turchin.&nbsp; Sometime in 2019, Andrey Turchin ran adverts of source and access codes of top digital companies that he had stolen online.</p><p>Among the advertised companies were Trend Micro, McAfee, and Symantec – this drew the attention of many and that was how he became popular. The invisible god sold these source and access codes for $300,000 – $1 million. Millions of dollars were lost due to this. In addition to advertising, he also asserted that he’ll make his customers invisible so they can’t be traced.</p><p><strong>Read Also: <a href="https://secureblitz.com/protect-your-organization-from-internal-threats/">Breachers Gonna Breach: Protect Your Organization From Internal Threats</a></strong></p><p>According to reports, his true identity of the invisible god hacker had been long discovered but for reasons relating to him being a foreign hacker, it was kept sealed. Contained in his criminal charges are five felony charges which date back to 2018. It was also around that time that his true identity was discovered.</p><p>Following a ruling by a judge in the Western District of Washington, his charges were unsealed. This was provoked by Group-IB, a cybersecurity company. Last month, Group-IB released a report which revealed the identity of the invisible god hacker, Andrey Turchin.</p><p>Group-IB traced his first appearance on the web to be in 2016. He was tagged as a hacker with so much technical know-how but less business knowledge. By 2017, the invisible god hacker started his advertising with data of hotels and banks.</p><p>Dmitry Volkov from Group-IB described Andrey Turchin as “one of the most prolific sellers of access to corporate networks in the history of the Russian-speaking cybercriminal underground”. Currently, the UK’s National Crime Agency and FBI are now involved in the case as well as some security companies in the private sector.</p><div><ul><li><a href="#abh_about">Author</a></li><li><a href="#abh_posts">Recent Posts</a></li></ul><div><section itemscope="" itemprop="author" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"><p><a href="https://secureblitz.com/author/johnray/" title="John Raymond"> <img src="https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/gravatar/john-raymond.jpg?w=250&amp;ssl=1" alt="John Raymond" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/secureblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/gravatar/john-raymond.jpg?w=250&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></a></p><div><p>John Raymond is an author, writer, and scriptwriter.

I've thought a lot about dependency management, systems configuration, programming languages, and compilers.</p><p>Again and again, I saw the same fundamental data structure underpinning these technologies: the <strong>directed acyclic graph</strong>. The most frustrating part was modeling graph-based configuration in languages that optimized for hierarchical data structures. That's why I created Virgo.</p><p>Virgo is a graph-based configuration language. It has two main features: edge definitions and vertex definitions. The Virgo configuration file then parses into an adjacency list. You can clearly achieve similar results from adding additional conventions and restrictions on YAML or JSON. Much like YAML optimized for human readability, Virgo optimizes for natural graph readability, editability, and representation. </p><pre><code>// config.vgo

Please open up an issue to start a discussion at </em><a href="https://github.com/r2d4/virgo">https://github.com/r2d4/virgo</a><em>.</em></p><p>Graphs are everywhere in configuration management. One graph that engineers may be familiar with is the <code>Makefile</code> target graph. The <code>make</code> tool topologically sorts the targets that it resolves which lets it build the files in order. Virgo's CLI or Go library allow developers to replicate this feature easily.</p><figure><pre><code>clean -&gt; parser, lexer -&gt; "src files" -&gt; test

            <p>Richard Murphey, 5/3/2019</p>
            
            <p>The biotech<sup>1</sup> industry is in the midst of a period of incredible innovation and growth.  It is also a highly controversial industry: drug pricing is a top political issue in the United States.</p>
            <p>But the inner workings of the industry are fairly opaque to outsiders.  This is a shame, because the industry is in desperate need of new and diverse perspectives.</p>
            <p>The goal of this post is to provide <b>an introduction to the business of biotech</b>.  We'll do this by examining the finances of an actual biotech startup, with a spreadsheet you can play around with as we go through the analysis.  Biotech startups are the “atomic unit” of biomedical innovation.  <a href="http://www.hbmpartners.com/media/docs/industry-reports/Analysis-of-FDA-Approvals-2018-and-Previous-Years.pdf">Most FDA approved drugs</a> are originally developed by biotech startups, often leveraging academic research.  Understanding how biotech startups work is a great starting point for understanding the rest of the industry.</p>
            <p>Specifically, I’ll discuss a biotech startup called AveXis, a gene therapy company developing a potential cure for the most common genetic cause of infant death.  AveXis was acquired by Novartis for $8.7B in 2018.  AveXis is an exemplar of the tremendous clinical value that innovative science can create, but also an example of how aggressive pricing can erode that social value.</p>
            <p>The post will refer to a financial model, which I've embedded below.  You can also download it using the button on the bottom right.</p>
            
            
            <p>Feel free to <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/kHRFwxfXidRVZsDf1">contact us</a> with questions or <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/kHRFwxfXidRVZsDf1">sign up</a> to get emailed when we write something new.</p>
            <p>This isn’t intended to be an exercise in financial modeling, but a financial model of a real company is a great way to learn about business models in biotech.  Why do investors focus so much on cancer and rare disease?  Why are late-stage drugs so much more valuable than early-stage drugs?  Why do biotech VCs do so much more diligence than tech VCs?  Why are drugs so expensive?  The answers to all of these have a lot to do with risk and value.  In other words, finance.</p>
            <div>
              <p>This is a <b>long post</b>.  Here’s the TOC:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Brief overview of AveXis’ lead product</li>
                <li>Analysis of AveXis’ finances, using the financial statements as a way to introduce key biotech business concepts</li>
                <li>Analysis of AveXis’ valuation</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Discussion of the factors that drive valuation</li>
                  <li>Discussion of why Novartis paid what it did, and why they could be wrong</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Discussion of the relationship between R&amp;D risk and drug price</li>
              </ul>
              <p>This post is adapted from a lecture I gave as part of a career development program for young scientists, first in 2017.  I've updated data since then where relevant.</p>

            <h2>AveXis</h2>
            
            <p>AveXis is a gene therapy company developing treatments for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).  SMA is the most common <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4404441/">genetic cause of infant death</a>.  SMA is caused by loss of a gene called SMN1.  The loss of this gene causes motor neurons to wither away, which leads to muscle atrophy and loss of muscle function (“use it or lose it”), and in the most severe forms of the disease, ultimately death.  For a good layperson’s overview of SMA, check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ax89gbbC-4g">this video</a> .</p>
            <p><img src="https://www.baybridgebio.com/Images/sma_unmet_need.png"></p><p>From AveXis presentation at AAN 2017, accessible <a href="http://investors.avexis.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=254285&amp;p=irol-calendar">here</a></p>
            <p>It is a terrible disease.  Babies with Type 1 SMA<sup>2</sup>, the most severe form of SMA, will never be able to sit without support, have difficulty breathing or swallowing, cannot crawl, and will never walk.  Over 90% of babies with Type 1 SMA will die or require continuous ventilation by age 2 .  This is what people in the pharma industry call an “unmet need”.  Only a few hundred patients in the United States have Type 1 SMA.</p>
            <p><img src="https://www.baybridgebio.com/Images/avxs_solution.png"></p><p>From AveXis presentation at AAN 2017, accessible <a href="http://investors.avexis.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=254285&amp;p=irol-calendar">here</a></p>
            <p>AveXis’ lead product, AVXS-101, is a gene therapy that delivers a functional copy of SMN1 to motor neurons.  It has potential to be a true cure.  The technology underlying gene therapy is highly innovative and only recently has matured to the point where it has true therapeutic potential.  At the time AveXis began developing AVXS-101, no gene therapies had ever received FDA approval despite decades of attempts to develop gene therapy products (the first gene therapy was approved in the US in 2018).</p>
            <p><img src="https://www.baybridgebio.com/Images/avxs_phase1_summary.png"></p><p>From AveXis presentation at AAN 2017, accessible <a href="http://investors.avexis.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=254285&amp;p=irol-calendar">here</a></p>
            <p>The preliminary clinical evidence suggests that AVXS-101 is a transformative therapy.  A clinical study of their drug showed that 15/15 patients receiving AVXS-101 lived to 13.6 months without requiring continuous ventilation.  Only 25% of patients are expected to live that long, or live that long without ventilation.  At the 20-month time point, 9/9 patients were alive and not ventilated (the other six patients were not 20 months old yet so weren’t included in that analysis).  Only 8% of babies are expected to be alive and not on ventilation at 20 months.  10 of 12 patients receiving the highest dose sat unassisted, and two crawled.  The drug also appears to be safe.</p>
            <p>Patient advocacy groups describe the effects of the drug as “miraculous” (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/endsma/videos/another-miraculous-sma-research-breakthrough-to-share-this-is-the-sma-gene-thera/10154441343506826/">video here</a>). For a deeper overview of the history of gene therapy, and a good description of a patient and family perspective, this is a <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/11/gene-therapy-s-new-hope-neuron-targeting-virus-saving-infant-lives">good article</a>.</p>
            <p>A full discussion of the clinical evidence is beyond the scope of this post, but I’ll note that typically you’d want to see a much more robust study before drawing strong conclusions about whether the drug is safe and effective.  This is a Phase 1 study: it is very small (just 15 patients) and uncontrolled (no placebo or active comparator; it is also open-label / unblinded and non-randomized).  Typically, a study with such limitations wouldn’t tell you much about whether a drug is safe and effective and would potentially be subject to bias.</p>
            <p>But this case is a bit different.  The natural history of the disease (what percent of patients reach various motor milestones and survive to various ages) is fairly well characterized.  The natural history studies act as a sort of “synthetic” control.  The endpoints are fairly objective, so are less subject to bias – do patients die or not?  Can patients walk or not?  And the effect size is very large: all patients are alive at each follow-up point, whereas the natural history studies suggest very few patients would be alive without treatment.  So this study is pretty powerful, despite its limitations.</p>
            <p>AveXis has conducted additional studies to strengthen the evidence base, including a Phase 3 study with 22 Type 1 SMA patients.  Data from this study will be presented at the American Academy of Neurology meeting in the next few days (May 4-10).  AveXis is also enrolling patients in several other studies, in both Type 1, Type 2 and presymptomatic SMA.</p>
            <p><img src="https://www.baybridgebio.com/Images/avxs101_studies.png"></p><p>From Novartis Nov. 2018 investor day, accessible <a href="https://www.novartis.com/sites/www.novartis.com/files/2018-11-05-r-d-day-investor-presentation.pdf">here</a></p>
            <p>AveXis / Novartis <a href="http://investors.avexis.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=254285&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=2378942">submitted</a> for FDA approval with full data from just the initial portion of the 15-patient Phase 1, interim data on all 22 patients from the Phase 3 study, and interim data on a subset of patients for the other studies.  This is possible because of <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/94068/download">FDA programs</a> that make it easier to develop drugs for severe rare diseases.  For a disease with just a few hundred patients a year, it’s very difficult to fulfill <a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=314.126">FDA’s requirements</a> of multiple “adequate and well-controlled studies”.  Without these expedited approval pathways, investors would not fund research into these rare diseases.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Financial analysis</h2>
            
            <p>It seems like AVXS-101 is an incredibly valuable medicine.  But is it a commercially viable product?  We will take a look at the company’s finances to estimate the value of the product.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Revenue</h3>
            
            <p>As you see from the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652923/000155837018001313/avxs-20171231x10k.htm">historical financial statements</a>, AveXis has never generated revenue.  Companies can’t market drugs until they are approved by FDA, and it takes years of expensive R&amp;D to get FDA approval.  Most biotech startups never generate revenue – they either fail or get acquired before approval, usually by a company that has a sales force and commercial infrastructure.</p>
            <p>In other industries, as a first approximation you can simply project future revenue using the historical revenue growth rate.  That isn’t possible for pre-revenue biotech.</p>
            <p>Instead, we will do a “revenue build”.  Our revenue build is comprised of:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Annual births in the US (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/births.htm">source: CDC</a>)</li>
              <li>Incidence of SMA (% of live births diagnosed with SMA) (<a href="https://ojrd.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13023-017-0671-8">source: Verhaart et al 2017 Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases</a>) </li>
              <li>Percent of new SMA diagnoses by type (<a href="https://ojrd.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13023-017-0671-8">source: ibid</a>)</li>
              <li>Percent of newly diagnosed Type 1 patients receiving treatment (source: consensus equity research estimates and benchmarking of Spinraza launch)</li>
              <li>Price per patient (source: consensus equity research estimates)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Here’s a screenshot of the spreadsheet showing the revenue build.  I’ll walk through this in detail below.</p>
            <p><img src="https://www.baybridgebio.com/Images/avxs_rev_build.png"></p><p>As this is just an example, I did only cursory research to get these assumptions.  Doing more thorough and rigorous research into these assumptions is a critical part of biotech investing and entrepreneurship, but this high level analysis will suffice for the purposes of this post.  The actual model itself is not nearly as important as the research that goes into the assumptions: talking to doctors and researchers and reviewing the literature / data to understand whether your tech will work and whether your product will be useful.</p>
            <p>How you do the revenue build will differ for each …</p></div></div>

<p>SQL is one of the most in-demand technical skills in the workplace today. Developed back in the 1970s, it is still the way we interface most of our data systems today. Regardless of what drag and drop tools come around or what new query paradigms try to overtake it, it has remained.</p>
<p>Many modern database technologies we will talk about today in this article are constantly having to comply with SQL policies vs. SQL needs to be updated.</p>
<p>However, this isn’t to say the SQL landscape hasn’t changed a lot in the past few decades and doesn’t continue to evolve. This is one reason SQL has stuck around so much. It grows and evolves with the times.</p>
<p>This article will summarize some of the major trends currently occurring in the SQL and data analytics world that are impacting teams across the world.</p>
<p>We will be discussing how SQL is becoming more collaborative and open. How the majority of databases our world continues to operate on are open source or switching to open source. As well as bringing up a few technologies you may not have heard of but should watch out for.</p>
<p>With so much going on in the technical world, this will help provide a clear picture of some of the more important changes in the SQL and data world.</p>
<h3><a href="https://dev.to/seattledataguy/what-is-trending-in-the-big-data-and-sql-world-in-2020-5c0n#sql-is-not-just-for-data-engineers-and-analysts-in-datadriven-companies" name="sql-is-not-just-for-data-engineers-and-analysts-in-datadriven-companies"></a>SQL Is Not Just For Data Engineers And Analysts In Data-Driven Companies</h3>
<p>If you have ever worked at a FAANG or even technology-driven start-up like Instacart, then you have probably realized that data drives everything.</p>
<p>To the point that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dataquest.io/blog/data-analyst-skills/">analysts</a>, PMs, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.departmentofproduct.com/blog/sql-skills-for-product-managers/">product managers</a>&nbsp;are starting to understand SQL out of necessity. SQL is the language of data and if you want to interact with data, you need to know it.</p>
<p>Do you want to easily figure out the average amount of time a user spends on your product, but don’t want to wait for an analyst? You better figure out how to run a query.</p>
<p>This ability to run queries easily is also driven by the fact that SQL editors no longer need to be installed. With cloud-based data, warehouses come SaaS SQL editors. We will talk about a SaaS SQL editor more in the next section.</p>
<p>However, the importance here is you don’t have to wait 30 minutes to install and editor and deal with all the hassle of managing it.</p>
<p>Now you can just go to a URL and access your team’s data warehouse. This has allowed anyone in the company easy access to their data.</p>
<p>We know both from anecdotal experience as well as the fact that indeed.com’s tracking in 2019 has shown a steady requirement for SQL skill sets for the past 5 years.</p>
<p>Overall, we foresee a future where not just big tech companies are using SQL and analytics to drive good decisions. For that, we will need tools that make it easier for anyone to access their companies data.</p>
<h2><a href="https://dev.to/seattledataguy/what-is-trending-in-the-big-data-and-sql-world-in-2020-5c0n#sql-and-analytics-are-becoming-more-collaborative%C2%A0" name="sql-and-analytics-are-becoming-more-collaborative%C2%A0"></a>SQL and Analytics Are Becoming More Collaborative</h2>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--TsiJN7mv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/bie8pm39rvfcno20u7a8.png?ssl=1"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--TsiJN7mv--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/bie8pm39rvfcno20u7a8.png?w=3840&amp;ssl=1" alt="Alt Text" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p>SQL and analytics are becoming more collaborative. As discussed earlier, getting insights from data is becoming more prolific. That means more people are getting involved in creating queries, analytics, and metrics.</p>
<p>Collaborative work started with products like Google Sheets. The trend has continued to expand into SaaS products like Figma which is collaborative design and&nbsp;<a href="https://popsql.com/?utm_source=seattledataguy">PopSQL</a>&nbsp;which is collaborative SQL.</p>
<p>Technologies like PopSQL offer the ability for your team to collaborate and track your work on queries easily through folders and version control.</p>
<p>Now you don’t have to worry about someone accidentally changing your query on a report or dashboard. Version control, allows you to revert what the query was at a previously saved state. This ensures that your team is constantly on the same page as far as SQL and the logic you are using to calculate your metrics.</p>
<p>You also can easily share queries, update them, fork them, and visualize data.</p>
<p>Also, tools like Figma, Google Sheets, and PopSQL integrate easily with other collaborative tools like Slack. These integrations further allow your team to share charts, queries, designs, and insights with ease.</p>
<p>Your team can easily see what work everyone else is doing, the changes they are making, and understanding why they are making the changes.</p>
<p>With the concept of remote work becoming more and more of a reality for many companies, having tools that make it easy to collaborate will be important.</p>
<p>In the end, technologies like PopSQL are a great step in the direction of self-service analytics because they put the power of querying data outside of just the analysts and the data engineers’ hands.</p>
<h3><a href="https://dev.to/seattledataguy/what-is-trending-in-the-big-data-and-sql-world-in-2020-5c0n#open-source-remains-the-most-popular-database" name="open-source-remains-the-most-popular-database"></a>Open Source Remains The Most popular Database</h3>

<p>Paid licensed database management systems like Oracle and MSSQL might seem like very popular options for teams to develop upon. However, MySQL and Postgres, two open-source database management systems are currently the most popular options for developers to use.</p>
<p>According to a survey conducted in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eversql.com/most-popular-databases-in-2018-according-to-stackoverflow-survey/">2018</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eversql.com/most-popular-databases-in-2020/">2020</a>&nbsp;by EverSQL, MySQL continues to be the most popular database management system to develop on. Also, Postgres has recently surpassed MSSQL as the second most popular database according to Stackoverflow.</p>
<p>Postgres is what is called the object-relational database management system or (ORDBMS). This takes on similar properties as object-oriented programming where you can have classes and inheritance. Also, some other nifty features about Postgres are that it allows for arrays and has some PubSub abilities.</p>
<p>This shift to open source isn’t new. However, the&nbsp;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/migration-complete-amazons-consumer-business-just-turned-off-its-final-oracle-database/">fact is that many companies are starting to drop the Oracles and Microsofts&nbsp;</a>for the free option. They are opting into paying cloud costs vs. paying licensing cost.</p>
<p>Overall, we are seeing a lot of shifts in the choice of database developers are picking.</p>

<p>Although Postgres has often been a common choice for companies choosing to switch from Oracle to an Open Source solution, Postgres was not developed with Cloud infrastructure and complexities in mind.</p>
<p>This forces teams to develop complex cloud infrastructure to manage applications that are being used all across the world.</p>
<p>But, there are other open-source solutions.&nbsp;<a href="https://thenewstack.io/yugabyte-new-database-solve-sql-vs-nosql-dilemma/">In July 2019 YugabyteDB went 100% open source</a>. Now many of you are probably asking(especially if you are in the US), what is YugabyteDB?</p>
<p>YugaByte’s proprietary document-oriented storage format — a heavily customized form of&nbsp;<a href="http://rocksdb.org/">RocksDB</a>, which provides for low-latency access and a high density of data. It runs on popular and known APIs.</p>
<p>YugaByte aim’s to fill in all the gaps. You want a NoSQL database that also is ACID, then Yugabyte is looking to take over that market.</p>
<p>It is looking to solve the problems that developers have when deploying SQL databases like MySQL that require sharding and complex infrastructure to run multi-region systems.</p>
<p>YugaByteDB does so by auto-sharding and loading balancing as well as several other features that take advantage of the cloud’s first approach.</p>
<p>So why is YugaByte in this update if it has been around since 2016?</p>
<p>This is because Wipro ventures invested 30 million in Yugabyte earlier this month. Also, Wipro plans to take Yugabyte’s open-source SQL database to its clients. There are 1000 new possible companies that could be using Yugabyte.</p>
<p>Although Yugabyte is not on EverSQL’s survey results. In a couple of years, with more traction and users it may be. Now, truth be told, a database that solves all the problems of both NoSQL and standard relational databases would be a miracle. So in many ways, we are surprised there isn’t larger adoption.</p>
<p>We will be curious to see if in the next few years Yugabyte is like many of the other miracle technologies promised to solve all of your organization’s problems or if it will disappear like so many others.</p>

<p>In the tech world, there are two main uses of databases: applications, and analytics.</p>
<p>These two major use cases benefit from different database systems as well as different database designs.</p>
<p>In particular, analytical databases that run millions of calculations for thousands of analysts, data scientists, and data engineers at a single company often benefit from having some form of distributed or parallel component. Think Redshift and how it relies on MPP(massively parallel processing).</p>
<p>But there are a lot of new SQL and NoSQL technologies coming into this space.</p>
<p>For example, Starburst, a fork of Facebook’s Presto, received an<a href="https://www.crn.com/news/applications-os/starburst-collects-42m-in-funding-as-big-data-startup-ramps-up-product-development-channel-expansion">&nbsp;additional $42 million of funding.</a>&nbsp;Starburst is a spin-off of a Facebook open-source project(Presto). Starburst’s goal is to create an enterprise version of Presto since Presto in itself does not have access management, connectors to enterprise systems like Teradata, Snowflake, and DB2, or a management console where users can configure the cluster to auto-scale, for example.</p>
<p>This makes utilizing Presto on its own difficult if not impossible for most companies. This is a shame because Presto allows you to easily run queries across databases without loading the data into a data warehouse.</p>
<p>So the recent funding in Starbursts is great to see. We look forward to seeing where this technology will go and hope that more companies can take advantage of Presto without all the hassle of having to manage all of presto’s complexities.</p>
<p>While we are talking about distributed database systems like Presto, another interesting development this month&nbsp;<a href="http://spark.apache.org/releases/spark-release-3-0-0.html">was the release of Spark 3.0</a>. With this new version of Spark comes many enhancements. Many of these enhancements have been geared to allow Spark SQL to become more ANSI SQL compliant.</p>
<p>This is an important note. One pattern that seems to remain true is that you can’t get rid of SQL as is. Many tools and technologies have tried to develop their query languages. However, at the end of the day, SQL remains. Unlike many programming languages that have died out.</p>
<p>SQL remains the language of data.</p>

<p>A diff algorithm outputs the set of differences between two inputs. These algorithms are the basis of a number of commonly used developer tools. Yet understanding the inner workings of diff algorithms is rarely necessary to use said tools. Git is one example where a developer can read, commit, pull, and merge diffs without ever understanding the <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-repack">underlying diff algorithm</a>. Having said that there is very limited knowledge on the subject across the developer community.</p>
<p>The purpose of this article is not to detail how <a href="https://ably.com/">Ably</a> programmatically implemented a diff algorithm across its distributed <a href="https://ably.com/platform">pub/sub messaging platform</a>, but rather to share our research and provide systematic knowledge on the subject of diff algorithms that could be useful to implementers of diff/delta/patch functionality.</p>

<p>For Ably customers like Tennis Australia or HubSpot, <a href="https://ably.com/blog/message-delta-compression">Message Delta Compression</a> reduces the bandwidth required to transmit realtime messages by sending only the diff of a message. This means subscribers receive only the changes since the last update instead of the entire stream. &nbsp;Sending fewer bits is more bandwidth-efficient and reduces overall costs and latencies for our customers. To develop this feature we needed to implement a diff algorithm that supported binary encoding and didn’t sacrifice latency when generating deltas.</p>
<figure><img src="https://files.ably.io/ghost/prod/2020/06/delta-savings-1.png"><figcaption>The benefits of providing deltas for realtime messaging</figcaption></figure><h2 id="diff-algorithms">Diff algorithms</h2>
<h3 id="purpose-and-usage">Purpose and usage</h3>
<p>The output of a diff algorithm is called <em>patch</em> or <em>delta</em>. The delta format might be human readable (text) or only machine readable (binary). Human readable format is usually employed for tracking and reconciling changes to human readable text like source code. Binary format is usually space optimized and used in order to save bandwidth. It transfers only the set of changes to an old version of the data already available to a recipient as opposed to transferring all the new data. The formal term for this is <em>delta encoding</em>.</p>
<h3 id="binary-vs-text">Binary vs. text</h3>
<div><p>There seems to be a common misconception that diff algorithms are specialized based on the type of input. The truth is, <strong>diff algorithms are omnivorous and can handle any input</strong>, as long as the input can simply be treated as a <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7049#section-2.2.2">string of bytes</a>. That string might consist of the English alphabet or opaque binary data. Any diff algorithm will generate a correct delta given two input strings in the same alphabet.</p><p>The misconception that a different algorithm is required to handle binary data arises from commonly used diff/merge tools treating text and binary as if they were actually different. These tools generally aim to provide a human-readable delta, and as such focus on human-readable input to the exclusion of binary data. The assumption is that binary data is not human-readable so the delta between two binary data inputs will also not be human readable, and thus rendering it human-readable is deemed to be too much effort. Equality is the only relevant output in the case of binary diffs, and as such, a simple bit-by-bit comparison is considered to be the fastest and most appropriate solution. &nbsp;This categorization of algorithms by the efficiency of solution causes a partitioning of inputs into different types.</p><p>Another aspect that adds to the confusion is the line-based, word-based, and character-based classification of textual diff outputs produced by diff/merge tools. A diff algorithm that is described as “line-based” gives the impression that it produces “text-only” output, and that this means that it accepts only text input and never binary data inputs. &nbsp;However, line/word/character-based is not a characteristic of a diff algorithm itself; rather, it is an optimization applied to the input before feeding it to the actual diff algorithm. </p><p>Because new lines and spaces have meaning as separators in human-readable text, the diff tool can segment the string based on the hashes of the lines or words in the text. This hash string is much shorter than the original text thus saving time at the cost of reduced granularity of the diff. &nbsp;Additionally, line-based granularity might actually even increase human readability of the diff in some cases.</p><p>However, if the input is known to be opaque binary data, there are no meaningful separators nor human-readable diff to display, so this optimization cannot be applied. &nbsp;Algorithms <em>capable</em> of optimizing human-readable data before it becomes an input are thus prone to getting miscast as wholly <em>incapable</em> of processing binary data. &nbsp;The truth remains, however: apart from pre-processing optimization, both binary and human-readable data can be treated as strings-of-bytes inputs and easily processed.</p></div>
<h2 id="three-generations-of-diff-algorithms">Three generations of diff algorithms</h2>
<p>The notion of how a diff should be generated has evolved over time.</p>
<figure><img src="https://files.ably.io/ghost/prod/2020/06/delta-arrow-1.jpg"></figure><h3 id="string-to-string-correction-or-insert-delete">String-to-string Correction or Insert/Delete</h3>
<p>The first generation of diff algorithms solved the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String-to-string_correction_problem">string-to-string correction problem</a> and emerged in the 60s and 70s. Each of the two inputs is interpreted as a string composed of characters in some alphabet. The output is a sequence of character edits, most commonly insert/delete operations, that could be applied to one of the inputs to transform it to the other input. That makes this class of algorithms particularly suitable for generating human readable diffs on human readable inputs, e.g. different versions of the same text/source code resulting from actual edits being made over time. What helps even further is that in theory, and more often than not in practice, there is more than one minimal length sequence of edit operations that gets the job done. Various heuristics can be used to pick the edit sequences that most closely resembles actual human made edits.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145%2F321796.321811">Wagner-Fischer algorithm</a> set the foundation for this generation of diff algorithms. The <a href="http://www.xmailserver.org/diff2.pdf">Myers Algorithm</a> is the latest improvement and the de facto standard for the generation and is currently used in multiple diff tools including the GNU diff utility.This generation of algorithms usually finds either the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_subsequence_problem">longest common subsequence</a> or the minimal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edit_distance#Common_algorithm">edit distance</a> (usually that would be the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance">Levenshtein distance</a>) and uses these to generate the sequence of edits needed to transform one input into the other.</p>
<h2 id="block-move-or-copy-insert">Block move or copy/insert</h2>
<h3 id="pure-block-move">Pure block move</h3>
<p>The next generation of diff algorithms was based on seemingly small optimizations over the previous generation. The character edits were upgraded to block-of-characters edits. That is, instead of expressing the diff as operations on single characters, the diff would be expressed as operations on blocks of characters. The operations are usually copy and insert where blocks of data that appear in both inputs are recorded in the delta as copied from one input to the other. The blocks unique to one of the inputs are recorded as insertions. This approach was first proposed by <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.470.9110&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">Walter Tichy</a>.</p>
<h3 id="compression-based-block-move">Compression based block move</h3>
<figure><img src="https://files.ably.io/ghost/prod/2020/06/delta-messages-5.png"><figcaption>How Ably generates deltas in its pub/sub messaging platform using the block move approach</figcaption></figure><p>At first glance, the block move approach seems like a minor optimization. However, it has significant impact once you take into account the possibility that some block(s) of characters can repeat in some or both of the inputs. Thinking about diff generation in terms of copying blocks of data and keeping an eye out for the same block repeating more than once opens the door to using compression algorithms to generate a diff and delta file.</p>
<p>Compression algorithms do just that: find the biggest possible repeating blocks of data and replace each consecutive occurrence with a reference to the first occurrence. Blocks of data that never repeat are copied straight to the output. Compression algorithms are in essence block move algorithms.</p>
<p>If the block move analysis done by a compression algorithm is performed on both inputs of a diff algorithm, it will easily identify the common parts of both inputs. It will also point out which blocks of data are unique, that is different in both of the inputs. Once you have this data, it is straightforward to come up with a sequence of block copy/delete operations that will convert one of the inputs to the other one.</p>
<p>The major benefit of using compression algorithms is the greatly reduced size of the delta. A block of data will never appear more than once in the delta. It might be referred to multiple times but the actual data of the block will be contained in the delta only once. That is a major difference from the preceding approaches. It should also be mentioned that the delta size is reduced at the cost of reduced human readability.</p>
<p><strong>xDelta</strong>, <strong>zDelta</strong>, <strong>Bentley/McIlroy</strong> are widely used de-facto standard implementations of diff algorithms of this generation.</p>
<h3 id="latest-upgrades">Latest Upgrades</h3>
<p>This would be the latest generation of diff algorithms. Most of its members exist only in research papers and don’t have any commercial implementations yet. They are largely based on the block move approach but offer substantial implementation optimizations, which result in claims of double-digit factor improvements in speed over the previous generation.</p>
<p>These optimizations are mostly focused on efficiently finding matching blocks of data in the two inputs. Various incremental hashing or compression-like techniques (such as suffix-trees) are used to achieve this purpose.</p>
<p><strong>edelta</strong>, <strong>ddelta</strong>, <strong>bsdiff</strong> could be assigned to this generation of diff algorithms</p>
<h2 id="delta-generation-algorithms-currently-in-use"><strong>Delta generation algorithms currently in use</strong></h2>
<p>This is a short overview of the tools and libraries focused on efficient delta/patch file generation and available at the time of writing (June 2019). Various other existing implementations of general purpose diff algorithms in different languages are omitted here for brevity’s sake.</p>

    <p>After watching <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0417299/">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a> I wanted to experience bending the elements just like in the show.
Of course actually doing this is impossible but could a game give that feeling?</p>

<p><img src="https://fraser-greenlee.github.io/images/katara_waterbend.gif" alt="GIF of katara water bending." title="See the smooth movement of the water."></p>

<p><a href="https://coronalabs.com/">Corona Labs</a> lets you make 2D cross-platform games and it comes with a realistic particle simulator.</p>

<p>It comes with this demo below, <strong>click below</strong> to try it!</p>

<!--  -->
<figure>
    
</figure>
<!--  -->

<p>This gives some interaction with particles but doesn’t create the smooth flows of water you see in the show.</p>

<p>It works by making all particles within the orange box match the box’s velocity.
This is done by repeatedly running <a href="https://docs.coronalabs.com/api/type/ParticleSystem/queryRegion.html"><code>queryRegion</code></a> which sets particle velocity is a given region.
It allows not just setting particle velocity but incrimenting it as well.</p>

<p>Lets picture the first GIF but with imagined forces on the water drawn as arrows.</p>

<p><img src="https://fraser-greenlee.github.io/images/katara_waterbend_arrows.gif" alt="Katara water bending." title="The arrows denote forces on the water."></p>

<p>Now to get a bending effect we can recreate the above GIF it with multiple <code>queryRegion</code> boxes.</p>

<p>Using the grid above, when a user taps the screen a ring of cells are updated with each pointing to the cursor.
To ensure the cursor is always in the middle of a grid cell the whole grid is shifted as the cursor moves between cells.</p>

<p>For cell values I make the magnitude’s greater for further out cells as I found this better holds the particles together.
To get long streams of water I gradually decrease old cell values.</p>

<p>Below I show the cell values with white arrows (longer for greator velocity incriments).</p>

<p><strong>Try water bending below.</strong></p>

    <figcaption>Note that the web version can be slow.</figcaption>

<p>Then by making particles with different physical properties you get different materials.
Ice is a solid group of particles, green acid mixes colour with the blue water, slime is a sticky group of particles while mud is viscous.</p>

<p>For fire particles I use the same bending system as before but now particles are created while you bend.
They also have a slightly negative gravity and self-destruct after a few seconds.</p>

<p>This could be part of a really great game, I hope to work on it more but I’m not sure I have the time.
For now I’m releasing the <a href="https://github.com/Fraser-Greenlee/benders">code</a> and hoping someone is inspired by this mechanic to make a great game.</p>

				<p>Whatever programming language you use, sooner or later you will want to find out what happens in your program at runtime. The objectives of obtaining such information may differ from developer to developer and from user to user, but whatever the objective one thing remains consistent - you will need the logs of your program to achieve it. Like many before us, we experienced this need.</p><p>Considering the fact that all of our almost-monolithic applications run inside docker containers, at first, work was organized to collect logs from these containers.</p><p>A critical requirement for collecting logs was the need for <strong>an aggregate</strong> search when responding to incidents - ddos ​​attacks, abnormal user behavior, error spikes given to mobile applications, and research on penetration attempts. What free solution can beautifully display our logs at consecutive intervals? We settled on ElasticSearch along with Kibana, which provides out-of-the-box fast aggregate searches within consecutive time intervals.</p><figure><img src="https://dev.sweatco.in/content/images/2020/05/aggregation-2.png" alt=""></figure><p>When inserting non-single records in ElasticSearch, ElasticSearch insists on inserting data with a large set of records (batches) in the format that ElasticSearch defines.</p><figure><img src="https://dev.sweatco.in/content/images/2020/05/Logging-Arc0-1.svg" alt=""></figure><p>As you can see in the picture above, we know the sending point and the destination point of our structured messages (logs). And we want to minimize the number of programs that will convert message formats - from docker-container to the message set format that ElasticSearch requires.</p><p>Elasticsearch for such cases has a special solution - Logstash, thus forming the famous ELK abbreviation (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).</p><p>Among the possible solutions for integrating Logstash together with docker <a href="https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/gelf/">in the documentation</a> we can find the GELF (graylog extended format logging) message format. Let's look at the final log transfer stream.</p><figure><img src="https://dev.sweatco.in/content/images/2020/05/Logging-Arc1.0-1.svg" alt=""><figcaption>initial application logs dataflow</figcaption></figure><p>Inside the docker containers there is a web application written in ruby ​​(best language in the world, btw) that processes each request in a separate thread. To prevent slow clients from slowing down application threads, we, like many, use nginx. Therefore, we would also like to receive request logs from nginx.</p><figure><img src="https://dev.sweatco.in/content/images/2020/05/Logging-Arc1.1-1.svg" alt=""><figcaption>application logs dataflow</figcaption></figure><p>This stack is relatively quick to configure, without blocking the continuous improvements that are still required.</p><hr><h2 id="logging-2-0">Logging 2.0</h2><p>There were several issues with configured logging 1.0.:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>
<li>when reconfiguring Logstash, we lost logs</li>
<li>when reconfiguring ElasticSearch, we lost logs</li>
<li>during abnormal work of ElasticSearch, we lost logs</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>The need for long-term storage of logs while maintaining the <strong>highest possible availability</strong> forced us to search for the ideal application logging scheme.</p><h2 id="gathering-requirements">Gathering requirements</h2><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>
<li>availability in case of emergency<br>
In any emergency mode, it is important for us to be able to find the cause of the problem. It's impossible to do this without the logs.</li>
<li>reliability in normal operation<br>
in normal mode, we would like to have reliable log delivery, so that looking at the logs according to certain criteria, we can always easily find them and not think why they disappeared, and sometimes they disappeared.</li>
<li>short time management<br>
On average, we have 1M active users per backend developer, and it is more profitable for a business to spend our time developing user features than supporting infrastructure (for example, restoring a cluster after unexpected error)</li>
<li>business doesn't like vendor-locks</li>
<li>cost</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h2 id="system-architecture">System architecture</h2><p>The first reflex thought that appears in the head when required to provide maximum availability.</p><figure><img src="https://dev.sweatco.in/content/images/2020/05/Logging-availability.svg" alt=""></figure><p>We put a balancer in front of Logstash (haproxy or a ready-made aws solution if you are inside aws), instead of a single elasticsearch instance, we make an elasticsearch cluster. But in this scenario, we begin to pay at least x2 for processing logs, and this comes on top of our reconfiguration and maintenance efforts. So, we increase availability, but somehow it is rapidly becoming very expensive. What do we do?</p><figure><img src="https://dev.sweatco.in/content/images/2020/05/images.jpeg" alt=""></figure><p>Maybe we should look at ready-made solutions? Here is the list of tools we considered at least in passing:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>
<li>Riemann</li>
<li>SaaS log management
<ul>
<li>cloudwatch(AWS)</li>
<li>kinesis(AWS)</li>
<li>DataDog</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>fluentd</li>
<li>heka, logstash</li>
<li>rsyslog, syslog-ng</li>
<li>there was probably something else</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>And this the moment when one realises the value of having very smart colleagues who are there to challenge and to help you. The proposed solution turned out to be so concise, simple and amazing that one doesn't immediately realize all of its beauty.</p><figure><img src="https://dev.sweatco.in/content/images/2020/05/Logging-Arc2.0pre.svg" alt=""></figure><p>Let's just write to files, then we can ensure the availability of logs at critical moments, with the advantages of the existing solution.</p><p>You can write to files on the local instance and send all the information to a remote machine at the same time. Therefore, the "Magic Solution" in the general case, we had as follows.</p><figure><img src="https://dev.sweatco.in/content/images/2020/05/Logging-Arc2.1pre.svg" alt=""></figure><p>In emergency situations, we can always make 'grep' and find the source of an emergency, even if the main log collector stops working for us (we provide availability).</p><p>But here we recall that Logstash can take logs from files, watching for changes in them. Thus, we can do this and, at a minimum, get rid of the need for a balancer and Elasticearch cluster (the cost criteria is still important for us).</p><figure><img src="https://dev.sweatco.in/content/images/2020/05/Logging-Arc2.2pre.svg" alt=""></figure><p>And then the question arose: did people really not solve such problems with centralizing file logs before, because we all know that on Linux all logs are in /var/log. This means that earlier developers and administrators had problems collecting and sending them to a centralized log server.</p><p>After an extended study of probably the longest-lasting open source project in logging systems - rsyslog, it became clear that it could easily replace Logstash and our logging system could be made exceptionally simple. But for a start, we had a smooth transition to logging 2.0</p><figure><img src="https://dev.sweatco.in/content/images/2020/05/Logging-Arc2-transition-2.svg" alt=""></figure><p><strong>So we got to the architecture, where on each instance there will be a local rsyslog log collector that sends logs to the central rsyslog server, which in the future can write logs to files and Elasticsearch at the same time.

<p>I recently left my high-paying job as a restaurant manager with the intent on creating my own destiny. </p>



<p>But why? Being in charge of such a large organization had all the trappings anyone might want: money, power, status, a comfortable two-bedroom top-floor apartment, and all that comes with such a lifestyle.</p>



<p>I really thought I found the key to success.  I was living the life. And yet, I wasn’t happy. </p>



<p>Not even close.</p>



<p><em>(NOTE: This post, being available for public consumption, may render me totally unemployable. That is my goal. You might ask ‘why?’ By the end you’ll be asking ‘why not?’)</em></p>







<p>Beginning in the early months of 2018, I spent two years as the general manager of a brand new restaurant on the edge of a college campus. The place was huge, and the challenge was immense: 9,000 sq ft, 80+ employees, $4 million+ in revenue per year. The owner of the restaurant rarely spent time there, so from day one I felt it was solely my responsibility to make it a success. </p>



<p>I was in charge of everything, from setting up the new restaurant, to hiring and training hundreds of employees. From daily inventory and ordering, to developing an atmosphere and a community that would set the business on a trajectory to be the hottest thing in the region. </p>



<p>The work was hard, and at times, soul-crushing. But the process of building something meaningful had always appealed to me, and this was my big chance to make my mark. </p>



<p>I felt that I would work there for a long time. I could pay off my student loan debt, save money for my own restaurant one day, and I would never have to worry about money ever again. <em>This path was my destiny</em> …is what I kept telling myself.</p>



<h4>Origins of my “Destiny”</h4>



<p>I had come a long way. In 2017, only a year prior to joining the restaurant business, I was living an aimless life, doing mindless work at a payroll company. I had spent three of the most capable years of my life at the company <em>not pursuing my dreams</em>, and <em>not knowing what my dreams even were</em>. Eventually I decided I wasn’t cut out for shuffling papers for 40 hours a week, and <a href="https://joebalcom.blog/2020/06/08/12-lessons/">I left the 9-5 cubicle life behind</a>. </p>



<p>In the months to follow, I embarked on a journey of self-discovery that would change the trajectory of my life. I <span><a href="http://santiago-compostela.net/">walked 500 miles across northern Spain</a></span> on the fabled Camino de Santiago. And when I returned, I started my own fidget spinner side-hustle during the height of the craze.</p>



<p>The overarching goal of my self-imposed sabbatical was to stretch and redefine my comfort zone every single day. Over that time, I learned what it means to work for myself and I explored the edges of comfort more than I ever could in a cloistered paycheck-to-paycheck cubicle environment. </p>



<p><em><strong>I discovered I had been unconsciously limiting myself my entire life. </strong></em></p>



<h4>Movin’ On Up</h4>



<p>By early 2018, through leveraging my experiences, utilizing my network, and <a href="https://joebalcom.blog/2020/07/06/stand-out-at-work/">solving the principal-agent problem</a>, I had been hired to run the restaurant. With no prior restaurant experience besides dining in them, I was tasked with building and managing this brand new multi-million dollar project from the ground up. </p>



<p>This location would be the largest in the restaurant group, which has dozens of locations in the Philadelphia area. Despite my blatant lack of experience, the owner of the company saw enough character and potential to hand me the keys. Through many long days, hard work, and consistency, I was projected to someday be “the best manager the company has ever seen” by one of the owner’s top lieutenants.</p>



<p>My admiration within the restaurant empire grew rapidly.  I was soon looked to as the standard-bearer of principled leadership within an otherwise ethically-challenged organization. </p>



<p>The team of employees I put together was outstanding. The camaraderie and the energy within the team was remarkable. Employees felt that working at the restaurant was often the best part of their day. In essence, I had cultivated a work environment I was never able to find on my own. </p>



<p>The mayor, local government officials, business owners, and even some professional sports stars began dining there on a regular basis.  And within a large college community, the restaurant achieved success almost instantly.</p>

<p>I was making a comfortable living, I had a fun and engaging job, I had the status, and I had the respect. What more could I want?</p>



<h4>The Inevitable Turn of Events</h4>



<p>The learning curve, after so long in a particular role, inevitably stumbles into unsavory territory. The owner had an inner-circle of lieutenants who he trusted to be his eyes and ears throughout the organization. But there was a catch–he only admitted “yes-men” into this exclusive group, or people who would only tell him what he wanted to hear. By now, I’m sure you can think of one or more leaders with this quality. They’re on TV every day. And you might even deal with them at your job on a daily basis. </p>



<p>I began, by default, as an unofficial member of this inner-circle, but I quickly chose to find my way out. I have never been one to tell people only what they want to hear. With this being in diametric opposition of what the owner liked, it set the stage for a challenging relationship. Put simply, he was always more interested in his way of doing things rather than the best way. It was his company, after all.</p>



<p>Often, he didn’t take kindly to hard truths I would present to him about many of the unfortunate realities within the organization. And as the sole owner of the company, his attitude of denial would ultimately enable such issues to persist. I had eventually lost the ability to convince him of the truth.</p>



<p>But do you know the beautiful thing about <strong>truth</strong>? Truth doesn’t care about what anyone thinks of it. It cannot be molded into something it is not. This powerlessness over truth causes many to avoid it at all costs. Many are scared of the consequences truth brings along. The all-powerful owner of this organization was no different. So be it.</p>



<h4>The Writing on the Wall</h4>



<p>As I grew to learn the inner workings of the power structure within the company, I began to sense that one way or another, I was not going to stay there long-term. </p>



<p>My principles and values would be tested on many occasions, but they were never broken. I did my best to<a href="https://joebalcom.blog/2020/05/02/keep-your-soul/"><span> </span><span>keep</span><span> </span><span>my soul</span></a> through it all.</p>



<p>It had been almost two years with the organization, but by late 2019, the writing was on the wall. It became increasingly challenging to work with the owner. All the money and status wasn’t enough to keep me motivated. All the cheese wasn’t enough to keep me in the trap. </p>



<p>I became indifferent to the non-sense and to “playing politics.” I was chronically over-stressed and everyone around me felt it. By the time my (“keep it short”) August vacation came around, I decided I needed to make a change. </p>



<p>Shortly after I returned, I sat down with the owner and made the decision to resign. I had reached the point of no return. I had to move on for the sake of my health and my sanity. The <em>destiny</em> I had envisioned for myself was little more than an illusion. I knew that working for someone else would never be the answer to my ambitions. </p>



<p>I needed to take matters into my own hands and create my own destiny.</p>



<h4>That Which You Cannot Buy</h4>



<p>During my time at the restaurant, I learned, firsthand, that money doesn’t solve all your problems, just your money problems. Money doesn’t make you happy, but can buy things that make you happy (momentarily). </p>



<p>I also learned that status is a fleeting concept. You are not your status.  You can enjoy it briefly, but it tends to only bring you more problems, which money cannot solve. </p>



<p>What I was missing was that which you cannot point to, put a finger on, or buy: </p>



<h6><strong>Time</strong></h6>



<p>I was always at the restaurant. 60, 70, 80 hours a week. After all, my top-floor apartment was literally across the street. I could roll out of bed and into work. The downside? Obvious. As the single point of authority and communication of a multi-million dollar restaurant, I constantly lacked the most precious resource of all: <em>time</em>. </p>



<h6><strong>Freedom</strong></h6>



<p>If time is the bathwater, then freedom is the baby. Managing a restaurant will throw both out in a hurry. <em>Want a vacation? Wait until August when it’s slow. Remember, keep it short.</em> <em>Want a second day off? “You have banker’s hours.”</em> <em>Want to take an early day? Go ahead, but you’d better keep your phone with you.</em> I was nothing more than a well-paid tiger in a cage. </p>



<p><em>Everyone wants money and status. Until they know the price for it.</em></p>







<h4><strong><em>Want</em> Makes You a Servant</strong></h4>



<p>I was free! Well, almost. I went from 14-hour days to…</p>

<p>Soon after, out of boredom and recognition of what I thought was another promising opportunity, I began working at a marketing company. Although I learned a lot of skills (many of which I am putting to use now), the company was spinning its wheels. My long-term goals and the short-term discipline of the company were not aligned,  so I decided to leave after two months.</p>



<p>The problem I was having was letting my desires and my wants drive my decisions. As Nassim Nicholas Taleb says “The three most harmful addictions are heroin, carbohydrates, and a monthly salary.” I’ve done fairly well steering clear of the first two, but my addiction to a steady paycheck has always led me to unhappiness.</p>

  <p>Modern OpenGL, and by extension WebGL, is very different from the legacy OpenGL I learned in the past. I understand how rasterization works, so I’m comfortable with the concepts. However, every tutorial I’ve read introduced abstractions and helper functions that make it harder for me to understand which parts are truly core to the OpenGL APIs.</p>

<p>To be clear, abstractions like separating positional data and rendering functionality into separate classes is important in a real-world application. But, these abstractions spread code across multiple areas, and introduce overhead due to boilerplate and passing around data between logical units. The way I <em>learn</em> best is a linear flow of code where every line is core to the subject at hand.</p>

<p>First, credit goes to <a href="https://www.toptal.com/javascript/3d-graphics-a-webgl-tutorial">the tutorial I used</a>. Starting from this base, I stripped down all the abstractions until I had a “minimal viable program”. Hopefully, this will help you get off the ground with modern OpenGL. Here’s what we’re making:</p>

<figure>
  <p><img src="https://avikdas.com/assets/images/2020-07-08-barebones-webgl-in-75-lines-of-code/multi-colored-triangle.png" alt="An equilateral triangle, green on top, black on the bottom-left and red on the bottom-right, with colors interpolated in between."></p>

<h2 id="initialization">Initialization</h2>

<p>With WebGL, we need a <code>canvas</code> to paint on. You’ll definitely want to include all the usual HTML boilerplate, some styling, etc., but the canvas is the most crucial. Once the DOM has loaded, we’ll be able to access the canvas using Javascript.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;canvas</span> <span>id=</span><span>"container"</span> <span>width=</span><span>"500"</span> <span>height=</span><span>"500"</span><span>&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;</span>

<span>&lt;script&gt;</span>
  <span>document</span><span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>DOMContentLoaded</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// All the Javascript code below goes here</span>
  <span>});</span>
<span>&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With the canvas accessible, we can get the WebGL rendering context, and initialize its clear color. Colors in the OpenGL world are RGBA, with each component between <code>0</code> and <code>1</code>. The clear color is the one used to paint the canvas at the beginning of any frame that redraws the scene.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>canvas</span> <span>=</span> <span>document</span><span>.</span><span>getElementById</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>container</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>
<span>const</span> <span>gl</span> <span>=</span> <span>canvas</span><span>.</span><span>getContext</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>webgl</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>

<span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>clearColor</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There’s more initialization that can, and in real programs should, be done. Of particular note is enabling the <em>depth buffer</em>, which would allow sorting geometry based on the Z coordinates. We’ll avoid that for this basic program consisting of only one triangle.</p>

<h2 id="compile-shaders">Compile shaders</h2>

<p>OpenGL is at its core a rasterization framework, where <em>we</em> get to decide how to implement everything but the rasterization. This entails running at minimum two pieces of code on the GPU:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>A vertex shader that runs for each piece of input, outputting one 3D (really, 4D in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_coordinates">homogeneous coordinates</a>) positions per input.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A fragment shader that runs for each pixel on the screen, outputting what color that pixel should be.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>In between these two steps, OpenGL takes the geometry from the vertex shader and determines which pixels on the screen are actually covered by that geometry. This is the rasterization part.</p>

<p>Both shaders are typically written in GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language), which is then compiled down to machine code for the GPU. The machine code is then sent to the GPU, so it can be run during the rendering process. I won’t spend much time on GLSL, as I’m only trying to show the basics, but the language is sufficiently close to C to be familiar to most programmers.</p>

<p>First, we compile and send a vertex shader to the GPU. Here, the source code for the shader is stored in a string, but it can be loaded from other places. Ultimately, the string is sent to the WebGL APIs.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>sourceV</span> <span>=</span> <span>`
  attribute vec3 position;
  varying vec4 color;

  void main() {
    gl_Position = vec4(position, 1);
    color = gl_Position * 0.5 + 0.5;
  }
`</span><span>;</span>

<span>const</span> <span>shaderV</span> <span>=</span> <span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>createShader</span><span>(</span><span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>VERTEX_SHADER</span><span>);</span>
<span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>shaderSource</span><span>(</span><span>shaderV</span><span>,</span> <span>sourceV</span><span>);</span>
<span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>compileShader</span><span>(</span><span>shaderV</span><span>);</span>

<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>getShaderParameter</span><span>(</span><span>shaderV</span><span>,</span> <span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>COMPILE_STATUS</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>error</span><span>(</span><span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>getShaderInfoLog</span><span>(</span><span>shaderV</span><span>));</span>
  <span>throw</span> <span>new</span> <span>Error</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>Failed to compile vertex shader</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here, there are a few variables in the GLSL code worth calling out:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>An <em>attribute</em> called <code>position</code>. An attribute is essentially an input, and the shader is called for each such input.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <em>varying</em> called <code>color</code>. This is an output from the vertex shader (one per input), and an input to the fragment shader. By the time the value is passed to the fragment shader, the value will be interpolated based on the properties of the rasterization.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <code>gl_Position</code> value. Essentially an output from the vertex shader, like any varying value. This one is special because it’s used to determine which pixels need to be drawn at all.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>There’s also a variable type called <em>uniform</em>, which is will be constant across multiple invocations of the vertex shader. These uniforms are used for properties like the transformation matrix, which will be constant for all vertices on a single piece of geometry.</p>

<p>Next, we do the same thing with fragment shader, compiling and sending it to the GPU. Notice the <code>color</code> variable from the vertex shader is now read by the fragment shader.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>sourceF</span> <span>=</span> <span>`
  precision mediump float;
  varying vec4 color;

  void main() {
    gl_FragColor = color;
  }
`</span><span>;</span>

<span>const</span> <span>shaderF</span> <span>=</span> <span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>createShader</span><span>(</span><span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>FRAGMENT_SHADER</span><span>);</span>
<span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>shaderSource</span><span>(</span><span>shaderF</span><span>,</span> <span>sourceF</span><span>);</span>
<span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>compileShader</span><span>(</span><span>shaderF</span><span>);</span>

<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>getShaderParameter</span><span>(</span><span>shaderF</span><span>,</span> <span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>COMPILE_STATUS</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>error</span><span>(</span><span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>getShaderInfoLog</span><span>(</span><span>shaderF</span><span>));</span>
  <span>throw</span> <span>new</span> <span>Error</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>Failed to compile fragment shader</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Finally, both the vertex and fragment shader are linked into a single OpenGL program.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>program</span> <span>=</span> <span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>createProgram</span><span>();</span>
<span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>attachShader</span><span>(</span><span>program</span><span>,</span> <span>shaderV</span><span>);</span>
<span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>attachShader</span><span>(</span><span>program</span><span>,</span> <span>shaderF</span><span>);</span>
<span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>linkProgram</span><span>(</span><span>program</span><span>);</span>

<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>getProgramParameter</span><span>(</span><span>program</span><span>,</span> <span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>LINK_STATUS</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>error</span><span>(</span><span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>getProgramInfoLog</span><span>(</span><span>program</span><span>));</span>
  <span>throw</span> <span>new</span> <span>Error</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>Failed to link program</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>useProgram</span><span>(</span><span>program</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We tell the GPU that the shaders we defined above are the ones we want to run. So, now what’s left is to create the inputs and let the GPU loose on those inputs.</p>

<h2 id="send-the-input-data-to-the-gpu">Send the input data to the GPU</h2>

<p>The input data will be stored in the GPU’s memory and processed from there. Instead of making separate draw calls for each piece of input, which would transfer the relevant data one piece at a time, the entire input is transferred to the GPU and read from there. (Legacy OpenGL would transfer data one piece at at time, leading to worse performance.)</p>

<p>OpenGL provides an abstraction known as a Vertex Buffer Object (VBO). I’m still figuring out how all of this works, but ultimately, we’ll do the following using the abstraction:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Store a sequence of bytes in the CPU’s memory.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Transfer the bytes to the GPU’s memory using a unique buffer created using <code>gl.createBuffer()</code> and a <em>binding point</em> of <code>gl.ARRAY_BUFFER</code>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>We’ll have one VBO per input variable (attribute) in the vertex shader, though it’s possible to use a single VBO for multiple inputs.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>positionsData</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Float32Array</span><span>([</span>
  <span>-</span><span>0.75</span><span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>0.65</span><span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>,</span>
   <span>0.75</span><span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>0.65</span><span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>,</span>
   <span>0</span>   <span>,</span>  <span>0.65</span><span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>,</span>
<span>]);</span>

<span>const</span> <span>buffer</span> <span>=</span> <span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>createBuffer</span><span>();</span>
<span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>bindBuffer</span><span>(</span><span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>ARRAY_BUFFER</span><span>,</span> <span>buffer</span><span>);</span>
<span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>bufferData</span><span>(</span><span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>ARRAY_BUFFER</span><span>,</span> <span>positionsData</span><span>,</span> <span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>STATIC_DRAW</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Typically, you’ll specify your geometry with whatever coordinates are meaningful to your application, then use a series of transformations in the vertex shader to get them into OpenGL’s <em>clip space</em>. I won’t go into the details of clip space (they have to do with homogeneous coordinates), but for now, X and Y vary from -1 to +1. Because our vertex shader just passes along the input data as is, we can specify our coordinates directly in clip space.</p>

<p>Next, we’ll also associate the buffer with one of the variables in the vertex shader. Here, we:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Get a handle to the <code>position</code> variable from the program we created above.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tell OpenGL to read data from the <code>gl.ARRAY_BUFFER</code> binding point, in batches of 3, with particular parameters like an offset and stride of zero.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>attribute</span> <span>=</span> <span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>getAttribLocation</span><span>(</span><span>program</span><span>,</span> <span>'</span><span>position</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>
<span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>enableVertexAttribArray</span><span>(</span><span>attribute</span><span>);</span>
<span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>vertexAttribPointer</span><span>(</span><span>attribute</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>FLOAT</span><span>,</span> <span>false</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that we can create the VBO and associate it with the vertex shader attribute this way because we do both one after another. If we separated these two functions (for example creating all the VBOs in one go, then associating them to individual attributes), we would need to call <code>gl.bindBuffer(...)</code> before associating each VBO with its corresponding attribute.</p>

<h2 id="draw">Draw!</h2>

<p>Finally, with all the data in the GPU’s memory set up the way we want, we can tell OpenGL to clear the screen and run the program on the arrays we set up. As part of the rasterization (determining which pixels are covered by the vertices), we tell OpenGL to treat the vertices in groups of 3 as triangles.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>clear</span><span>(</span><span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>COLOR_BUFFER_BIT</span><span>);</span>
<span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>drawArrays</span><span>(</span><span>gl</span><span>.</span><span>TRIANGLES</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The way we’ve set this up in a linear fashion does mean the program runs in one shot. In any practical application, we’d store the data in a structured way, send it to the GPU whenever it changes, and perform the drawing every frame.</p>

<hr>

<p>Putting everything together, the diagram below shows the minimal set of concepts that go into showing your first triangle on the screen. Even then, the diagram is heavily simplified, so your best bet is to put together the 75 lines of code presented in this article and study that.</p>

  <figcaption>The final, though heavily simplified, sequence of steps needed to show the coveted triangle</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The hard part of learning OpenGL for me has been the sheer amount of boilerplate needed to get the most basic image on the screen. Because the rasterization framework requires us to provide 3D rendering functionality, and communicating with the GPU is verbose, there are many concepts to learn right up front. I hope this article shows the basics are simpler than other tutorials make them out to be!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>The JVM’s garbage collectors make use of Thread-Local Allocation Buffers (TLABs) to improve allocation performance. In this article we’re going to understand what TLABs are, how they affect the code generated by the JIT for allocation and what the resulting effect on performance is. Along the way we’ll learn about the organisation of CPU caches and how multiple CPU cores keep their contents coherent and how you can use this knowledge to avoid multithreaded scalability bottlenecks.</p>
<p>Let’s begin by discussing what TLABs are and why they’re necessary. TLABs are blocks of the Java heap that each JVM thread has into which it can allocate. They are exclusive to one thread for the purposes of allocation but as they are part of the Java heap any other thread may reference or access objects within them. Exclusivity for allocation means an individual thread can allocate efficiently into its TLAB without needing to coordinate or synchronise with any other threads. When a thread runs out of space in its TLAB it requests a new buffer from the JVM’s Garbage Collector. We cover how allocation happens in a TLAB in our related blog post on <a href="https://www.opsian.com/blog/jvms-allocateprefetch-options/">JVM Allocation Prefetching</a> but in summary, it boils down to incrementing a pointer.</p>
<h2>CPU Cache Coherency</h2>
<p>Why are we trying to avoid incrementing the allocation pointer from multiple threads? To understand this we need to look at how caches are organised amongst multiple cores in a multicore processor. Memory in caches is organised in <em>cache lines</em>. These are sequential blocks of normally a fixed size that depends on the CPU architecture and model, on modern AMD/Intel x86 cores this is 64 bytes. There are multiple levels of caches with two or three being usual and with some caches shared between groups or all cores whilst others are exclusive to an individual core. The configuration depends very much on the architecture and specific model of processor. As an example, the AMD’s “Zen 2” Ryzen 7 3700X has 8 cores each of which has a 64kb L1 cache (half for instructions, half for data) and a 512kb L2 cache. The Ryzen 7 cores are in two groups of four, each group of four share a 16MB L3 cache.</p>
<p><img alt="Ryzen 7 3700X cache configuration" src="https://www.opsian.com/images/jvm_tlabs/ryzen_7_caches.png" title="Ryzen 7 3700X cache configuration"></p>
<p>AMD’s Zen 2 cache configuration (taken from <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/AMD/the-path-to-zen-2">https://www.slideshare.net/AMD/the-path-to-zen-2</a>)</p>
<p>Keeping all of these caches in sync is what’s called a <em>cache coherency</em> protocol. It specifies a set of states that each cache line can be in and the valid transitions between those states. The most common protocol on x86 is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MESI_protocol">MESI</a> and both Intel and AMD use variants of it. For each cache, their cache lines can be in one of the following states under MESI:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Modified (M)</strong> - this contents of the cache line have been modified and this cache has the only copy. All other caches corresponding lines are marked <strong>Invalid</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Exclusive (E)</strong> - this cache has the only copy of this cache line and it matches main memory. All other caches corresponding lines are marked <strong>Invalid.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Shared (S)</strong> - this cache line matches memory and is present in other caches, other caches may have this line marked <strong>Shared</strong> too.</li>
<li><strong>Invalid (I)</strong> - this cache line is empty.</li>
</ul>
<p>AMD and Intel’s variants (MOESI and MESIF respectively) add additional states that can reduce writes to main memory and also optimise traffic in NUMA environments.</p>
<p>At a very high level, a memory write under MESI goes as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the cache line is in present in our cache<ul>
<li>If <strong>Exclusive</strong> then modify and transition the line to <strong>Modified</strong></li>
<li>If <strong>Modified </strong>then modify and leave in <strong>Modified</strong></li>
<li>If <strong>Shared</strong> then make other caches invalidate their copies, modify and move to <strong>Modified</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the cache line is not present in our cache<ul>
<li>If another cache has the line in <strong>Modified</strong> they send the line contents to this cache and also to main memory, marking their line <strong>Invalid</strong></li>
<li>If other caches have the line in <strong>Exclusive</strong> or <strong>Shared</strong> state they send their contents and mark their lines <strong>Invalid</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As we can see, concurrent memory writes to the same location from multiple cores can involve cache lines being invalidated and changing state fairly rapidly. The term often used for this effect is called cache line ping-pong.</p>
<h2>Why caches matter for allocation</h2>
<p>The main takeaways from the above steps is that if we have a cache line exclusively or in the modified state then we don’t need to force other caches to do work. If the cache line is shared with other caches we need them to invalidate. Invalidating means those cache lines are now no longer present in other cores’ caches. Subsequent reads could involve cores stalling to re-acquire the data from other caches (50+ cycles depending on which cache and the topology) or worse hitting main memory itself (100s of cycles). This is in contrast with a L1 cache hit which, on the i7 4770k (Haswell) we’ll use later on for benchmarking, is in the region of <a href="https://www.7-cpu.com/cpu/Haswell.html">4-5 cycles</a>.</p>
<p>Put into the context of memory allocation, every thread competing to read and write a single allocation pointer would lead to each core cache repeatedly needing to take ownership of the allocation pointer’s cache line and all other cores invalidating their copies. In comparison, with TLABs each thread has its own local allocation pointer into its buffer which is not visible to other cores and avoids the need to synchronise with other caches.</p>
<h2>Testing allocation with and without TLABs</h2>
<p>That’s the theory, let’s see how well it applies in practise. To test this we’re going to conduct some multithreaded benchmarks using Java’s Parallel Garbage Collector on JDK 13.0.2 with and without TLABs. </p>
<p>We’re using the Parallel GC because for all our benchmarks the instructions for manipulating the allocation pointer get inlined into generated code by the JIT. Other collectors like G1 and CMS actually call in to the collectors themselves on allocation which makes things a little harder to demonstrate. Both G1 and CMS also serialize allocations in the non-TLAB case by taking a lock.</p>
<p>For this we will use the excellent <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/">JMH</a> and the benchmarks themselves are:</p>

<p>It’s worth noting that we’re using <em>Object</em> here which is the smallest allocation we can actually do. This is unrealistic because nobody really allocates like this (if you do, please let me know) but magnifies the effect of the allocation machinery so we can clearly see what effect TLABs have. We’ll look at some benchmarks which allocate larger objects near the end of this post.</p>
<p>We run the benchmarks with the <em>-prof perfasm</em> option so we can dump out the assembly for the two benchmarks. We have simplified and rearranged the assembly below a little to make it easier to read.</p>
<p>For <em>allocateWithTLABOneThread</em> we have:</p>
<pre>try_allocation:
<b>// Load the current thread-local allocation pointer</b>
mov     0x118(%r15),%rax

<b>// Compute new global allocation pointer by adding allocation size (16 bytes)</b>
mov     %rax,%r10
add     $0x10,%r10

<b>// Check that this doesn't go beyond the TLAB limit, if it does call in to the GC to refill</b>
cmp     0x128(%r15),%r10 // check this is not over our buffer
jb      continue_allocation
.. call in to GC and deal with refilling buffer ..

<b>// Allocation was inside TLAB limit, so update limit</b>
continue_allocation:
mov     %r10,0x118(%r15)

<b>// Prefetch for next allocation</b>
prefetchnta 0xc0(%r10) // prefetch for future allocations
.. initialise object with mark word and klass pointer ..
.. benchmark loop logic ..
</pre>

<p>For <em>allocateWithoutTLABOneThread</em> we have:</p>
<pre>try_allocation:
<b>// Load the current global allocation limit into %r10</b>
movabs  $0x7f764804d2d0,%r10
mov     (%r10),%r10

increment_allocation_pointer:
<b>// Load the current global allocation pointer into %r11 and %rax</b>
movabs  $0x7f764804d2f8,%r11 
mov     (%r11),%rax
mov     %rax,%r11

<b>// Compute new global allocation pointer by adding allocation size (16 bytes)</b>
add     $0x10,%r11

<b>// Is the new pointer over the limit? If so call in to the GC</b>
cmp     %r10,%r11
jnb     call_gc

<b>// Atomic compare-and-swap (CAS) global allocation pointer (address in %r9). Old expected value is in %rax, new value is in %r11</b>
movabs  $0x7f764804d2f8,%r9
lock cmpxchg %r11,(%r9)

<b>// If the CAS succeeded continue to initialise the object - otherwise retry</b>
je      continue_allocation // success we can go initialise the object
jmp     increment_allocation_pointer // failure we need to try again

continue_allocation:
<b>// New object address in %r11. Increment thread allocations stats and prefetch for the next allocation, then continue with initialisation.</b>
addq    $0x10,0x190(%r15) // bump thread allocated bytes stats
prefetchnta 0xc0(%r11) // prefetch for future allocations
.. initialise object with mark word and klass pointer ..
.. benchmark loop logic ..
</pre>

<p>As you can see the case without TLABs is a little more involved and also explicitly needs to deal with contention amongst threads, where one thread might be incrementing the allocation pointer in between another thread having loaded it and attempting to increment it.</p>
<h2>The single threaded case</h2>
<p>Let’s see how the two single threaded cases stack up on a Intel Core i7-4770 CPU:</p>
<table>
  <tbody><tr>
   <td>Test
   </td>
   <td>Op/s (throughput)
   </td>
   <td>Error (for 99.9% CI)
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>allocateWithTLABOneThread
   </td>
   <td>279,772,768
   </td>
   <td>± 4,153,915
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>allocateWithoutTLABOneThread
   </td>
   <td>101,167,412
   </td>
   <td>± 128,394
   </td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>So even with one thread where we’re sure there’s no contention, we’re only seeing half the performance when compared to using a TLAB. This is because the Atomic Compare-And-Swap (CAS) instruction required when not using a TLAB (<code>lock cmpxchg</code> in the above assembly snippet) is more expensive than the normal load and store combination used in the TLAB test.</p>
<h2>Digging deeper on Atomic CASes</h2>
<p>There are a couple of reasons for this. The first is that, on modern x86 cores, a normal store doesn’t immediately …</p></div></div>

He also shares his insights into the future of multi-cluster Kubernetes.</p><p><br>Be sure to check out the additional episodes of the “<a href="https://www.getambassador.io/podcasts/" target="_blank"> <!-- -->Livin' on the Edge<!-- --> </a>” podcast.</p><h3>Key takeaways from the podcast included: </h3><ul><li><a target="_blank" href="https://crossplane.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crossplane</a> is an open source cloud control plane that enables engineers to provision infrastructure from the Kubernetes API. It can be used by organisations to build and operate an internal platform-as-a-service (PaaS) across a variety of infrastructures and cloud vendors. Crossplane has recently been accepted into the CNCF as a sandbox project.</li><li>Infrastructure and applications can be packaged together in a bundle using Crossplane. Kubernetes Custom Resources can be used to declaratively specify this configuration, and a Crossplane uses the control loop model to continually reconcile the specified config with what is running in the target environment.</li><li>Crossplane is the Kubernetes-specific implementation of the <a target="_blank" href="https://oam.dev/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open Application Model (OAM)</a>. OAM is a team-centric standard for building cloud native apps.</li><li>OAM describes a model where developers are responsible for defining application components, while application operators are responsible for creating instances of those components and assigning them application configurations. Infrastructure operators are responsible for declaring, installing, and maintaining the underlying services that are available on the platform.</li><li>The workflow of all of the personas is compatible with continuous delivery best practices such as GitOps.</li><li>The recently released <a target="_blank" href="https://upbound.io/browse" rel="noopener noreferrer">Upbound Registry</a> will contain a collection of existing cloud providers (Alibaba, AWS, Azure, GCP, etc), stacks (curated environment configurations), and bundles of existing applications and infrastructure (such as Wordpress with a LAMP stack).</li><li>As Crossplane provides a control plane for a platform that may span multiple underlying infrastructures, this is an ideal location to implement cross-cutting concerns, such as security via RBAC and Open Policy Agent (OPA), and auditing.</li><li>Crossplane can be used to manage workloads spanning multiple Kubernetes clusters. Platform operators may use a Kubernetes cluster bootstrap tool like kind, or the Cluster API, to provision clusters, and then use Crossplane to initialise applications and infrastructure.</li><li>Communication between these clusters is outside of Crossplane’s purvey, and instead API gateway technologies like the <a href="https://www.getambassador.io/podcasts/daniel-mangum-on-crossplane-building-a-paas-and-multi-cluster-kubernetes/docs/latest/tutorials/getting-started/" target="_blank"> <!-- -->Ambassador Edge Stack<!-- --> </a>, and service mesh technologies, such as <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.getambassador.io/multi-cluster-kubernetes-with-ambassador-and-linkerd-2caf0e978f8f" rel="noopener noreferrer">Linkerd</a>, will provide this functionality.</li><li>The open source <a target="_blank" href="https://doc.crds.dev/" rel="noopener noreferrer">doc.crds.dev</a> project provides automatic generation of documentation for Kubernetes CRDs in much the same way tools like Javadoc and Godoc function.

The show that focuses on all things related to cloud native platforms, creating effective developer workflows and building modern APIs. Today I'm joined by Daniel Mangum, software engineer at Upbound and fellow podcaster in the cloud space.</p><p>At Datawire we've been following Upbound's work on the Crossplane project for quite some time. Crossplane is an open source Kubernetes add-on that augments your clusters and enables you to provision and manage infrastructure services and applications from kubectl or using well-established continuous delivery best practices like GitOps.</p><p>Daniel Bryant (00:36):</p><p>A lot of folks I chat to in my day job are looking to create some kind of internal platform as a service experience. Something like an internal Heroku or some other PaaS, and Crossplane is aimed at helping teams provide, manage, and configure the infrastructure and application bundles associated with this.</p><p>If you like what you hear today, I would definitely encourage you to pop over to our website. That's www.getambassodor.io, where we have a range of articles, white papers and videos that provide more information for engineers working in the Kubernetes and cloud space. You can also find links there to our latest releases, such as the ambassador edge stack, which focuses on the edge and API gateway use cases in Kubernetes and allows advanced routing and security config. You can also find our latest open source releases at the Ambassador API gateway and our CNCF-hosted telepresence tool too.</p><p>So, welcome to the Ambassador Living on the edge podcast, Daniel.</p><p>Daniel Mangum (01:19):</p><p>Thanks, I'm happy to be here. It's quite the honor to come on today.</p><p>Daniel Bryant (01:22):</p><p>Super. So before introducing yourself, I know you wanted to say a few words about the current happenings in the world.</p><p>Daniel Mangum (01:27):</p><p>Yeah, for sure. I appreciate you giving me a moment. I'm here to talk. And as you said before we get started, I did want to say a few words about everything that's going on in the United States and many other countries as well, as folks are taking a stand against systemic racism and police brutality. First off as a white person, this is a time where I mostly need to close my mouth and open my ears in most settings. We need to hear our brothers and sisters who have had enough with centuries of oppression. Because of this, as I mentioned to Daniel before we got started, I was pretty hesitant to record this podcast today. I've had the opportunity to be a guest on this podcast in large part because of privileges I've been afforded due to the color of my own skin.</p><p>Daniel Mangum (02:05):</p><p>That being said, one of the most important things I can do is use my voice when given a platform to speak, and we all can do when given a platform to speak. Today we're going to talk about software, Cloud, Kubernetes, and plenty of other topics that I care really deeply about. But if you take anything away from this episode, I hope it is this, each and every one of us has a sphere of influence. We have people in our lives who listen when we speak, you may have a large social media following, you may have a podcast, or you may just have your family and friends, whatever your sphere of influence is, but you have the opportunity and the responsibility not just today, but every day for the rest of your life to fight injustice in that sphere. So fight it with your words, with your actions and with your money, do it at the national level, the local level, and within your own home.</p><p>Daniel Mangum (02:51):</p><p>There is no easy fix and if you're like me, you have a lot of learning and listening to do every day to even begin to bring change. But don't wait until you know everything. You'll never know everything, and you're always going to make mistakes. Just wake up every day and consider what your role is in bringing change to that day and then go out and do it. If you don't exactly hit the mark, except criticism, have humility, listen to correction and do better next time. Inaction holds back change, start taking these steps today, and don't forget their importance a year from now when the new cycle has moved on to something different. Fighting injustice is a constant daily battle. Do not let yourself get comfortable.</p><p>Daniel Mangum (03:30):</p><p>I know Daniel has penned some tweets on his account with some good learning materials, but please feel free to also reach out to me directly on Twitter, or any other medium where you'd find me. And I will not give you advice, but I will try to point you to some resources that have been helpful to me, and people I trust who have more experience in fighting oppression that have recommended to me, I'll try to point you to those.</p><p>Daniel Mangum (03:53):</p><p>So yeah, I just wanted to start off with saying that because that's way more important than anything we're going to talk about today. And the reason why I think we decided to go ahead and record this is because we do have an opportunity where people are going to be listening to us, and we need to make the most of that. So, I just wanted to give that little spiel before we get started. And please, please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or thoughts on that or anything like that.</p><p>Daniel Bryant (04:17):</p><p>Well said Daniel, well said. One of the key takeaways I've had myself the last few days is that need to learn more. That tweet I've pinned on my account is a small thing to do, but it's somewhere where I want to start, I want to educate myself. And like you, I want to then share my learnings and so forth. And difficult times for everyone, but I think this community we have, the Cloud community, is fantastic at generating awareness, fantastic at sharing ideas, listening to each other. So I think we need to not only focus on technology, we need to focus on important social issues too. So yes, very well said.</p><p>Daniel Mangum (04:45):</p><p>Thanks.</p><p>Daniel Bryant (04:47):</p><p>So, could you introduce yourself Daniel and share a recent career highlight for us please?</p><p>Daniel Mangum (04:51):</p><p>Yeah, for sure. So my name is Daniel Mangum. I work at Upbound, which is a company based in Seattle, Washington, but we're remote-first. So, I actually live in St. Louis, Missouri in the US. And Upbound's main focus is a project called Crossplane, which is an open source, basically Cloud control plane that is standardized on the Kubernetes API. I personally work on what we …</p></div></main></div></div></div></div>

Also called, “Ethio-jazz”, it blends traditional Ethiopian sounds/melodies with jazz, funk, and even Latin influences.  If that sounds confusing, let me reassure you that it is a dynamite combination.  <em>To Know Without Knowing</em> has all of these great Ethio-jazz sounds, plus hip-hop.  This is what happens when you combine Mulata Astatke (commonly known as the father of Ethio-jazz) with Black Jesus Experience - Astatke’s hip-hop influenced backing band.  Many of the tracks flow nicely, with trumpet, saxophone, piano, and other jazz rhythmic instruments.  But then, Black Jesus Experience lays down smooth, timely rhymes overtop, and it just sounds meant to be.  This album will be a part of my working playlist for a long time, it is perfect to have on while powering through something.</p><p><span>Release date: </span>May 15, 2020</p><p><span>Similar artist(s): </span>The Heliocentrics</p><p><span>Top tracks: </span>A Chance to Give, Mulata, Kulun Mankwaleshi</p></div></div>]]>

<p>At user groups and in online communities they keep talking about Vim and how cool it is to use this text editor. Let’s explore what all the Fuzz is about.</p>



<h3>What is Vim?</h3>



<p>Vim is a text editor that operates within the terminal and works with keyboard shortcuts only. It is known for the editing speed you can achieve and therefore increased productivity.</p>



<h3>Why is Vim so popular?</h3>



<p>Despite its age (at the time of writing, 28 years) it’s still popular among a lot of software developers. Vim is available on almost any operating system. It comes preinstalled on Linux Distributions and macOS, and there are packages available for Windows as well. Once you mastered the keyboard shortcuts, you can edit files very quickly. </p>

<h3>How can I get started with Vim?</h3>



<p>If you’re on Linux or macOS, open a terminal and type in <code>vim</code>. This will open the editor and it’s ready to open a file. On Windows, you might need to <a href="https://www.vim.org/download.php" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.vim.org/download.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">install it first</a>.</p>



<h3>Vim Foundations</h3>



<p>If you have used other editors such as Notepad++, Sublime, TextMate or Visual Studio Code, Vim will seem quite obscure. In these other editors, you use keyboard shortcuts as well as the mouse to open, save and edit files. <br>Since Vim is keyboard-only, it comes with shortcuts for all operations (also those you’d use a mouse for otherwise). <br>The main difference to other editors is its two different modes. Vim has a Normal and Insert Mode. </p>



<h4>Normal Mode</h4>



<p>In Normal Mode you execute commands such as open or save file but also navigating across the file. </p>



<p>Vim is already in Normal Mode once it opens. Some commands consist of a single letter such as <code>i</code>, <code>p</code> or <code>w</code>. Others require a colon, such as <code>:w</code>, <code>:q</code> or <code>:e</code>. (More on those commands below.)</p>



<h4>Insert Mode</h4>



<p>Once in Insert Mode, every key you hit will result in a character in your file as you’re used to it in other editors. </p>



<h4>Switching Between Modes</h4>



<p>When you open Vim, it’s in Normal mode already. To get into Insert Mode, press <code>i</code>. You will see <code>-- INSERT --</code> in the bottom left corner. </p>

<p>Once you’re done adding / changing characters, hit the <code>&lt;ESC&gt;</code> key to switch back to Normal mode. You will notice, that <code>-- INSERT --</code> will disappear again. </p>



<p>When you edit a file, you will constantly change between both modes, with Normal as the default mode. When you navigate through a file, copy or delete characters, you do all of that in Normal Mode. Insert Mode is for character manipulation (Insert and Delete) only.</p>



<h3>Vim Commands</h3>



<p>The list of Vim Commands is pretty long, but you won’t need to know all of them to get started.<br>In fact, only a handful commands will do in the beginning:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><code>&lt;ESC&gt;</code></td><td>Switch into Normal Mode</td></tr><tr><td><code>i</code></td><td>Switch into Insert Mode</td></tr><tr><td><code>:w</code></td><td>Save file</td></tr><tr><td><code>:q</code></td><td>Close Vim</td></tr><tr><td><code>:wq</code></td><td>Save file and Close Vim</td></tr><tr><td><code>:e &lt;filename&gt;</code></td><td>Open a file</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>Vim Commands you need to know to get started</figcaption></figure>



<p>These six commands will get you quite far already, allowing you to open, manipulate and save files, as well as closing Vim. </p>



<p>Additionally, download the Cheat Sheet below with additional commands that build on top of the foundational commands above.</p>







<p>It will take time to pick up speed and come back to a productivity level you’re used to. Start with the commands in the table above and focus your effort on switching between Normal and Insert Mode. <br>Once you’re comfortable with that, add one command at a time from the Cheat Sheet to your repertoire. You will notice over time how your muscle memory will build up. That will also be the time to install additional plugins. </p>



<p>Let’s get started with learning! I’m curious about your learning experience. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/ganzefolge" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/ganzefolge" target="_blank">Follow me on Twitter </a>and share your progress with me!</p>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>【想看中文的读者<a href="#chinese-version-below">请点击这里</a>】</p><p>As I noted in <a href="https://interconnected.blog/june-14-2020-interconnected-weekly/">Interconnected Weekly,</a> the most interesting news item from last week was <a href="https://en.pingwest.com/a/6875">the revelation that ByteDance</a> is cutting its China-based engineers data access to TikTok and its other international products, reported by PingWest.</p><p>While many Chinese tech companies have global ambitions, ByteDance is in a class of its own. Its various social media products have reached significant traction and cultural relevance in both the Chinese market and other large Internet markets, like the U.S., India, and Indonesia. And with that traction comes intense geopolitical scrutiny.</p><p>Instead of being reflexively skeptical about everything a Chinese tech company does, it’s worth deep-diving into how ByteDance <em><strong>could</strong> </em>accomplish this internal separation from a technical angle to build trust and alleviate legitimate geopolitical concerns.</p><h2 id="rbac-on-crack">RBAC on Crack</h2><p><strong>The simple answer is RBAC (role-based access control). And lots of it.</strong></p><p>By designing a set of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_management">identity and access management (IAM)</a> policies along individual roles, ByteDance can restrict every single employee’s access on a product by product basis. China-based employees of <em>all functions</em> -- engineering, data analysis, growth, marketing, etc. -- will only have access to the product codebase, production databases, and all their replicas related to the China market products, e.g. Toutiao, Douyin, Xigua. The same rules can be applied to its non-China-based employees for its international products, e.g. TikTok, Helo, BaBe, Lark.</p><p>This separation will have to be cleanly cut along the entire technical stack, from the pixels on the frontend UI, through the algorithm-driven content layer, through the backend server-side layer, through the database layer, and all the way down to computing and storage resources in its data center layer. PingWest’s report hinted that this type of separation may have already started with <a href="https://en.pingwest.com/a/6875">the splitting of the internal middleware team</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/1Juobo_pByHZ4DPym6wJXkrLgEYt5a3QltEf-fL3P3Jp9GZ6nvko2CzhNlzbI6zykqY1VQ9n5MqQjxxB_HinZCscdvwCBGnNnj0YiX7ZLmx8kpeEw1iCvOl8knna9Z4hPcYywFtB"></figure><p>Consequently, ByteDance will need two sets of people for every function to support its product portfolio in and outside of China in parallel. This is arguably much harder to accomplish than separating the tech stack. Collaboration, if not just regular communication, between the two parallel universes may have to be cut off. If that’s the direction ByteDance is going, it would explain why its headcount is planned to balloon from roughly 60,000 to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-bytedance/tiktok-owner-bytedance-announces-china-leaders-targets-100000-global-headcount-idUSKBN20Z1BA">100,000 by the end of 2020</a>. To put this 40,000 person increase in context, Facebook’s <em><strong>entire</strong></em> headcount at the end of 2019 was about 45,000. That’s a lot of IAM policies to administer in a short amount of time -- many, many YAML files. Clean separation may be the hardest for HR and recruiting, who are trying to meet this aggressive hiring goal. (An anecdote: the day before this post was published, I received a cold LinkedIn outreach from a ByteDance recruiter in Chinese for an international product role but based in Beijing or Shanghai.)</p><p>The administrative details get even more challenging, when such a large employee base starts traveling to and from various locations around the globe -- only a non-issue at the moment due to COVID-19. But ByteDance can draw from large Silicon Valley companies, most of whom already have best practices to geofence employee data access while traveling, especially in and out of China.</p><p>Of course, there will have to be a central team that manages, evolves, and enforces this set of complex IAM policies for the long haul. <strong>Where should this team sit organizationally? Who can be on this team, since they can see both universes?</strong> <strong>Who should this team report to? </strong>These are some of the important questions that remain unanswered.</p><p>All these measures are both technically and operationally doable. They will be painful to implement and maintain. And they will present a massive challenge to building a unified company culture. But they can be done. If ByteDance gets this right, it’ll be a template Chinese tech companies with global expansion ambitions will follow.</p><p><em>(An aside: this setup reminds me a bit of how the Hatch Act works when a U.S. president is running for re-election. There is complete bifurcation between the rank and file employees of the White House and the re-election campaign operation, but high-level government officials appointed by the President, e.g. a Cabinet secretary, can legally access both.)</em></p><p>For something as granular and tedious as RBAC at the scale of 100,000-plus people, the devil is indeed in the details. Assuming those details are implemented and operationalized to perfection, <strong>ByteDance will still need to present a way for third party organizations to audit and verify those implementations on an ongoing basis. </strong>While ByteDance’s intention <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-to-launch-transparency-center-for-moderation-and-data-practices">to build various Transparency Centers</a> is a nice touch (arguably more than what Facebook or YouTube has done in this regard), these centers appear to be focused on human content moderation and as controlled PR spin machines for the media. They won’t convince many technical experts.</p><p><strong>The best way to build trust with the technical community? Open source.</strong></p><h2 id="open-source">Open Source</h2><p>Regular readers of Interconnected know I write a lot about open source. I’m a proponent and practitioner of the power of open source in building robust, sustainable, and trustworthy technologies.</p><p><strong>Sunlight is always the best disinfectant. Open source is that sunlight in the technology world.</strong></p><p>There are few examples of large tech companies open sourcing their RBAC implementations and IAM policies. I don’t think it is because there’s something inherent to RBAC that makes it unsuitable to open source. You can remove the business and organizational logic and open source just the implementation mechanisms. But large tech companies usually open-source something if there is externally strategic value in doing so, e.g. creating a developer ecosystem (Apple with Swift, Microsoft with VSCode). RBAC rarely holds any strategic value. <strong>It’s mundane and boring. </strong></p><p>However, for ByteDance, how its RBAC implementation works is anything but mundane or boring to the government regulators, cybersecurity auditors, and privacy advocates -- three audiences who have lots of skepticism about the company.</p><p>Each tech company sees its strategic differentiation and focus differently. As I discussed in “<a href="https://interconnected.blog/why-is-facebook-not-in-the-cloud-business/">Why Is Facebook Not in the Cloud Business?</a>”, because Facebook is dead set on becoming the dominant social media company and not interested in having a cloud PaaS business, it open sourced its data center design for the strategic purpose of achieving more infrastructure efficiencies. Google, on the other hand, saw its data center design as a competitive advantage and kept it proprietary.</p><p>Facebook is differentiated by its algorithm-driven social network, and not by its data centers. Similarly, ByteDance is also differentiated by its algorithm-driven social network, and not by its RBAC implementation (nor is any company for that matter). <strong>What’s different is that open sourcing RBAC has strategic value to ByteDance to help it shore up the only currency it lacks: trust.</strong></p><p>Unfortunately, ByteDance does not have a long or strong track record of creating, contributing or stewarding open source projects. Given its unique potential and predicament, ByteDance would be well-served to develop that competency sooner rather than later. There may not be a direct template to open sourcing RBAC at the scale of ByteDance, but there are many open source practices beyond just sharing code publicly to draw from to build trust -- community discussion forums, open documentation, transparent governance, etc.</p><p>Earning the trust of a global audience will take a lot more work than poaching “<a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/disney-shakes-up-streaming-group-following-leaders-departure">Captain America</a>” from Disney. It’ll take a lot more work than <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-influence/2019/11/19/former-congressman-will-lobby-for-tiktok-782697">hiring a former congressman</a> to lobby on your behalf.

<p>SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2), of which SHA-256 is a part, is one of the most popular <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/01/01/very-basic-intro-to-hash-functions-sha-256-md-5-etc/">hashing algorithms</a> out there. In this article, we are going to break down each step of the algorithm as simple as we can and work through a real-life example by hand.</p>



<p>SHA-2 is known for its security (it hasn’t <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://shattered.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">broken down like SHA-1</a>), and its speed. In cases where <a href="https://qvault.io/2019/12/30/very-basic-intro-to-key-derivation-functions-argon2-scrypt-etc/">keys are not being generated</a>, such as mining Bitcoin, a fast hash algorithm like SHA-2 often reigns supreme.</p>



<h2><span id="What_Is_a_Hash_Function">What Is a Hash Function?</span>
</h2>



<p>If you want to read more about hash functions in general, do so <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/01/01/very-basic-intro-to-hash-functions-sha-256-md-5-etc/">here</a>. That said, in order to move forward let’s recap three of the main purposes of a hash function:</p>



<ul>
<li>To scramble data deterministically</li>
<li>To accepts input of any length and output a fixed-length result</li>
<li>To irreversibly manipulate data. The input can’t be derived from the output</li>
</ul>
<h2><span id="SHA-2_vs_SHA-256">SHA-2 vs SHA-256</span>
</h2>



<p>SHA-2 is an <em>algorithm</em>, a generalized idea of how to hash data. SHA-256 sets additional constants that define the SHA-2 algorithm’s behavior. One such constant is the output size. “256” and “512” refer to their respective output digest sizes in bits.</p>



<p>Let’s step through an example of SHA-256.</p>



<h2><span id="SHA-256_hello_world_Step_1_-_Pre-Processing">SHA-256 “hello world”; Step 1 – Pre-Processing</span>
</h2>



<ul><li>Convert “hello world” to binary:</li></ul>
<pre><code>01101000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111 00100000 01110111 01101111
01110010 01101100 01100100</code></pre>



<ul><li>Append a single 1:</li></ul>
<pre><code>01101000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111 00100000 01110111 01101111
01110010 01101100 01100100 1</code></pre>



<ul><li>Pad with 0’s until data is a multiple of 512, less 64 bits (448 bits in our case):</li></ul>
<pre><code>01101000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111 00100000 01110111 01101111
01110010 01101100 01100100 10000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000

00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000
00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000

</code></pre>



<ul><li>Append 64 bits to the end, where the 64 bits are a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness">big-endian</a> integer representing the length of the original input in binary. In our case, 88, or in binary, “1011000”.</li></ul>
<pre><code>01101000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111 00100000 01110111 01101111

<p>Now we have our input, which will always be evenly divisible by 512.</p>



<h2><span id="Step_2_-_Initialize_Hash_Values_h">Step 2 – Initialize Hash Values (h)</span>
</h2>



<p>Now we create 8 hash values. These are hard-coded constants that represent the first 32 bits of the fractional parts of the square roots of the first 8 primes: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19</p>



<pre><code>h0 := 0x6a09e667
h1 := 0xbb67ae85
h2 := 0x3c6ef372
h3 := 0xa54ff53a
h4 := 0x510e527f
h5 := 0x9b05688c
h6 := 0x1f83d9ab
h7 := 0x5be0cd19</code></pre>



<h2><span id="Step_3_-_Initialize_Round_Constants_k">Step 3 – Initialize Round Constants (k)</span>
</h2>



<p>Similar to step 2, we are creating some constants (<em>Learn more about constants and when to use them <a href="https://qvault.io/2019/10/14/constants-in-go-vs-javascript-and-when-to-use-them/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a></em>). This time, there are 64 of them. Each value (0-63)  is the first 32 bits of the fractional parts of the cube roots of the first 64 primes (2 – 311).</p>

<h2><span id="Step_4_-_Chunk_Loop">Step 4 – Chunk Loop</span>
</h2>



<p>The following steps will happen for each 512-bit “chunk” of data from our input. In our case, because <em>“hello world”</em> is so short, we only have one chunk. At each iteration of the loop, we will be mutating the hash values h0-h7, which will be the final output.</p>

<p>Let’s do w[16] so we can see how it works:</p>

The promise of blockchain is huge. And large companies are continuing to hire and expand their blockchain teams, incl. Facebook, Amazon, Microsft, EY, Deloitte, IBM, and Oracle, to name a few. So, it should be well worth the effort to become familiar with how blockchain works, what its perceived benefits are, and as a developer starting building on top of them. </p>
<p>Over the past few years, I’ve been helping and on-boarding new team members and developers into the blockchain space. This helped me to collect blogs, links, materials, and resources and see which worked well for everyone’s learning journey. It’s time to share that with a broader audience. This guide provides a starting point for developers who’re keen to learn more about blockchain and development on top of Ethereum. It will be opinionated and not contain a full list of everything available. But rather, a concise list of highly recommended options, from my own experiences. </p>

<p>Now that we have an understanding where we’re coming from, let’s dive in a little bit deeper into the fundamental components &amp; building blocks.</p>

<p>Once you’ve gone through all (or at least most) of the above, you should have a solid grasp of all the concepts. So now we can finally move on to the fun part: actually building stuff! </p>
<p>To get a full, comprehensive overview of the Ethereum development landscape, check out:</p>

<li><a href="https://github.com/ConsenSys/ethereum-developer-tools-list">The full ConsenSys developer tool list</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The Ethereum portal covers sections per programming language, to help you filter out what’s relevant for you. Though JavaScript is most commonly used, I’d start with something that you’re already familiar with, to flatten the learning curve. Use the above only for future reference. As mentioned previously, I’m trying to keep it simple and offer a few recommended options, from my own experiences. Feel free to discover, try, and learn everything from the developer portals, once you’ve covered these.</p>

<p>Above should cover everything you need to write your own smart contracts and build decentralized applications on top of Ethereum. </p>

<p>The goal of this guide is mainly to help new developers to enter the space and I won’t go into much depth on advanced topics, such as design &amp; architecture, scalability, privacy, etc.</p>
<p>But a few pointers, for those who feel up to it. </p>
<h2>Architecture</h2>
<p>The following diagram is a stack representation of the enterprise Ethereum architecture. While this is aimed towards enterprises, it gives a good overview of the relationship between components and can be part of any implementation. </p>
<p><span>

  <img alt="Enterprise Ethereum architecture stack" title="Enterprise Ethereum architecture stack" src="https://www.wslyvh.com/static/1b23770e7ae9817bc9854bcd0dda76eb/fcda8/eth-architecture.png" srcset="https://www.wslyvh.com/static/1b23770e7ae9817bc9854bcd0dda76eb/12f09/eth-architecture.png 148w,

<p>For more details check out the <a href="https://entethalliance.github.io/client-spec/spec.html#sec-smart-contract-tools-sublayer">specification</a> or <a href="https://entethalliance.org/resources/">Ethereum Enterprise Alliance</a>.</p>
<p>As you can see in the diagram, we’ve covered most from the application layer to the tooling, core blockchain, and networking layer. What’s missing really are the Enterprise 3 P’s.</p>
<ul>
<li>Performance</li>
<li>Permissioning</li>
<li>Privacy</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, this does not only apply to enterprise but applies to any Ethereum application. I’ll leave these for a future blog post.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><div><p>You've worked remotely, and you've worked in an office. You like both. You're not alone—there are countless people missing the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/05/never-go-back-office/611830/" rel="noopener">perks of going into an office</a>.</p><p>You know it’s not an either-or question. Legions of workers like you are all too aware that it's less about the location, and more about creating the proper mind space and vibe to get into your <a href="https://positivepsychology.com/flow-at-work/" rel="noopener">flow</a>. That's how you and your team get things done. </p><p>Just being able to work from home without this mixed in is a recipe for chaos and <a href="https://www.range.co/blog/how-to-prevent-workplace-burnout-on-your-team">burnout</a>. Not to mention being forced to work from home due to a pandemic is not the same as intentional remote work.</p><p>For a long, long time, research has shown that <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/07/to-be-happier-at-work-invest-more-in-your-relationships" rel="noopener">social connection inspires purpose, well-being, effectiveness</a>, and overall happiness in the workplace. And it’s very, very good for business in a number of ways. </p><p>While building these relationships is possible via video chat, it takes more effort and intention—something not all teams are taking into account. Get this: a whopping <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90433799/want-a-happy-employee-give-them-an-office" rel="noopener">77%</a> of people who work in open offices reported being happy in their jobs. The numbers remain more or less the same when private office spaces and cubicles come into the picture. People just like going into the office (even if they suppose they want to work from home).</p><p>So why all the fuss about remote-only? You don't want to choose between the two—you're not ready to cross that bridge yet. Just because the buzzword 'remote work' has put a stranglehold on the zeitgeist, doesn't mean you have to get on board.</p><p>I hear you: working from home exclusively, FOREVER actually doesn't sound that rad. But how do you put it into words? Hear me out.</p><p><strong>1. The office is not your enemy! It's poor work practices</strong></p><p>Think about the last time you wanted to storm out of a meeting or your office. What caused you to want to do this? Was it the neat whiteboard where you jot down all of your best ideas for new products or campaigns? Was it the coffee maker that gave you life some mornings when you couldn't even? Maybe it was the sweet lounge area where you have inspiring chats or a good laugh with Bob from IT?</p><p>I'm willing to bet it was none of the above. It was probably someone who talked over you in a meeting or booked a session that you didn't need to be in over your deep focus time. So, why does the office get all the flack? Your office was a destination that actually offered a lot. I’m just saying, I think the hate on the actual physical spaces must stop.</p><p>Instead, we should focus on building a stronger work culture and address the issues creating a bad one.</p><p><em>P.s. Could you imagine storming out of your own house? It would be so awkward and anti-climatic because you'd have to go back at some point that night.</em></p><p><strong>2. Not everyone has a sprawling home to work from</strong></p><p>Some people (maybe even most people these days) live in tiny studio apartments or share a flat with roommates who are also working from home. There's no space to roam, no areas to spread your wings or change the scenery up, and indeed, no rooms to have productive meetings free of children playing or your roommate's lousy taste in music.</p><p>Sure, there are ways to get around this at home. You could come up with a schedule for who gets what common area, when—or duel to the death. The point is, a team of expert designers probably crafted your office space to encourage movement and inspire creativity. It's difficult to mimic this at home where you just want to chill, wear flowy pants, and not care about anything other than <a href="https://bgr.com/2020/03/28/coronavirus-news-streaming-increase-during-office-hours-netflix/" rel="noopener">Netflix</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/18/21185114/twitch-youtube-livestreaming-streamelements-coronavirus-quarantine-viewership-numbers" rel="noopener">Twitch</a>, or reading a good book. Also, you probably don't have a degree in interior design, so there's that.</p><p><strong>3. Say it with me: Communication!</strong></p><p>We speak to one another through body language as much as we do with our words. So when it comes to communicating with coworkers, it's easy to see why being in an office makes it a little easier to get your message across without confusion. Every time we greet each other in the morning, we renew belonging cues. They help us feel connected to the environment and to each other. We add little deposits of trust to the relationships we share, helping to maintain them.</p><p>That's not to say office communication is perfect and that issues work themselves out without internal communications processes for support. It just means that you don't have the same handicap working in an office that you do when trying to express your ideas over a video call or <a href="https://slack.com/apps/A938TS1QS-range" rel="noopener">Slack</a>. You could gesticulate like a madman, but I'm not sure that will get you where you need to go. You're free to give it a try, though!</p><p>In any case, it's another +1 for being in an office.</p><p><strong>4.Taking your office perks for granted</strong></p><p>Who doesn't love a fully stocked snack wrack or a fridge with the latest dairy-free milk craze for your coffee obsession or bourgie flavored water with hard-to-pronounce names that spark loud conversations with coworkers, none of which you have to pay for out of pocket? As they say, talk is cheap, and so is not paying for your snacks.</p><p>If you're one of the few people still clinging to their New Years' resolution to nibble less and eat healthier, you may think working from home is a blessing in disguise. But then you look at your cupboard and find oreo cookies, hot Cheetos, and a ton of other crap that you had to get because you need emotional support after working way too many hours. Alternatively, in the last few years, office snacks have gotten healthier and healthier (mostly).</p><p>Plus, being at home is the ultimate cheat day excuse. Admit it: the office has just the right amount of social pressure to keep you accountable for those health goals you broadcasted to everyone in a two-mile radius. I'm just saying.</p><p><strong>5. The hidden fees of working from home</strong></p><p>On top of buying snacks out of your hard-earned moola (lame sauce), you may have noticed that your electricity bill and Amazon spending have skyrocketed. Who's paying for that?! You are my friend. You and you alone!</p><p>At that moment, you realize that your company was paying for a ton of stuff this whole time (who knew). Paying for it yourself is just less desirable. Some companies that get how much a home workspace and services matter let you expense part of your internet bill, desk purchase, office chair, and even gourmet coffee (you should ask!). But this isn't universal. Part of the point I'm making here is that not all home offices are created equal.</p><p><strong>6. (Work) is where the heart is</strong></p><p>But seriously, we need to separate productivity and work from the physical space we do it in. What's more important is being able to form bonds and connections with your team and establish practices that help you become a highly tuned working machine.</p><p>The hard truth is that for some—heck, maybe even most—this happens in a well-designed office that takes all of these ideas into account. There are distractions that you cannot control for when everyone is at home. It's one of the reasons why Range CEO, Dan, advocates for <a href="https://www.cmswire.com/collaboration-productivity/why-flexible-working-will-be-the-new-normal/?utm_source=cmswire.com&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=cm&amp;utm_content=all-articles-rss" rel="noopener">flexible and windowed work</a>, which gives people and teams permission to create the schedules and environments that work best for their productivity and sense of belonging. It could mean working exclusively at home for some, and in the office for others. Or maybe it's a little of both. The point is that 9-5 work is outdated and outmoded, and runs counter to the way modern work life functions.</p><p>While this is a rant about the joys of the office, this is a +1 for anywhere you want to be!</p><p><strong>7. It's okay to step away from your desk (ICYMI while working from home)</strong></p><p>There have been reports recently about how people are <a href="https://zapier.com/blog/remote-work-challenges/" rel="noopener">overworking themselves</a> during this critical time when they should be finding balance. They figure they don't have a commute now so they can just work more and later. Not only is sitting non-stop in front of your computer terrible for your physical health, it's bad for your mental health as well.</p><p>Traditionally, going into the office and coming home was a nifty marker to wind down one part of your life and engage with another. Eliminate the office, and you need to create new ways to do this. Unfortunately, this is tricky and will look different for everyone and their situation. And not enough teams are thinking critically about this. The result is burnout and complete obliteration of productivity. As <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydmPh4MXT3g" rel="noopener">Sweet Brown</a> has infamously remarked, "ain't nobody got time for that!"</p><p>The office is a super useful shorthand for this type of switching that helps us maintain a sense of balance and happiness.</p><p><strong>8. I promise, you're not an alien for wanting human contact outside of your living unit</strong></p><p>Last, but certainly not least, being in the office means you interact with real-life humans, not just digital, video versions of them.</p><p>While you can schedule social time, and it can work well, there's just no way to replace the spontaneity of running into people and sparking up a great conversation. This style of connecting isn't for everyone. But, remotely-only offices and cultures take this popular, age-old way of building relationships off the table from those who value it. Not so good. You have to be much more intentional about how you build and maintain relationships, which can feel like, well, work.</p><p>Remote work certainly has its perks: no commutes, more time with people close to you, family and friends, and privacy. But it doesn't mean that the office has no value.</p><p>There are countless reasons to miss the office that are quite specific to you, your workplace, and the community you've built. It's about more than singing the praises of remote work—it's about acknowledging what makes people productive.</p><p>Oh!

		When the digital iron curtain came down, both those locked inside and those locked outside experienced setbacks.	</p><div>
		
<p><strong>This article was originally writen by&nbsp;the Chinese media&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzIwMTY1NDg4Nw==&amp;mid=2247494926&amp;idx=1&amp;sn=d19d726903ad3293a003f5a169f1262c&amp;scene=0#wechat_redirect" target="_blank"><em>Tencent</em> <em>DeepNet</em></a>&nbsp;(腾讯《深网》) and translated by PandaYoo.com after it was licensed.&nbsp;Copyright belongs to the original author and it is forbidden to reprint without permission.</strong></p>



<p><em>Authors: Luo Ruiyi, An Ran<br>Chinese editor: Xiao Kang<br>DeepNet, A news column presented by Tencent Xiaoman News Studio.</em></p>



<p>On the fifth day after being banned by the Indian government, TikTok was still lying quietly in Bhavana Srivastava’s mobile phone.&nbsp;She was reluctant to delete it.</p>



<p>Bhavana, 28, works as a teacher at a public primary school in the northern Indian city of Lucknow.&nbsp;The school is on the outskirts of Lucknow. She commutes nearly 100 kilometers to work every day. The facilities of the school are poor. She is good at painting, so she and other teachers decorate the walls with paintings.&nbsp;Because of her love for students, she has been doing this for almost three years, and more and more students come to school.</p>



<p>But thanks to the short video platform, her talent began to be seen by more people.</p>



<p>Bhavana started using TikTok three years ago and joined VMate app last September, to create some counterpart performances videos and DIY drawing videos.&nbsp;She has a total number of nearly 1 million followers on the two short video platforms, which belong to Bytedance and Alibaba, respectively.&nbsp;This number means that she has changed from an ordinary primary school teacher to a respectable Internet “star”.</p>



<p>“A lot of people around me, including my family, can recognize my face (from the video), and it feels really good.”&nbsp;Bhavana told Tencent Deepnet.</p>



<p>It all came to an abrupt end on June 29th.&nbsp;Shortly before 9 p.m., the Indian government announced that 59 Chinese apps, including TikTok and VMate, were blocked. From the next day, these apps began to be removed from the app store, and downloaded apps were also suspended.</p>



<p>Bhavana felt very lost.&nbsp;Luckily, she downloaded more than 2, 000 videos she had uploaded before the service stopped, opened a new account on YouTube, posted them one by one, and occasionally opened TikTok and VMate app to take a look.</p>



<p>“I miss them very much.&nbsp;But what can I do? I have no other choice. ”&nbsp;She said.</p>



<p>In addition to TikTok and VMate, a number of products such as Tencent’s Wechat, Bytedance’s Helo and Vigo Video, Kuaishou’s Kwai and U Video, Alibaba’s UC browser and VMate, JoYY’s Likee and Bigo Live, cross-border e-commerce platforms SHEIN and Club Factory, and SHAREit with 400m installation users in India are also banned.</p>



<p>Bytedance was quickly suspended after the ban, and apps were removed from Google and Apple’s App Store.&nbsp;The next day, some network operators restricted the use of Wechat and some Tencent products, and the use of Weibo was abnormal.&nbsp;According to Zhu Dao Capital, as of July 6, only mobile games “Clash of Kings” and ES file browsers were fully functional among the 59 banned apps, and 51 apps had been completely removed or discontinued.</p>



<p>UC browser officials told Tencent Deepnet that the company would make further adjustments in response to policy changes.&nbsp;In June 2020, UC ranked second in the market share of mobile browsers in India at 14.46 per cent, behind chrome (75.56 per cent), according to Statcounter.&nbsp;According to UC, at least 70 per cent of, UC Browser’s employees in India last year were local Indians and are currently on rest.</p>



<p>Nikhil Gandhi, head of TikTok India, once said on Twitter, “We have been invited to meet with concerned government stakeholders for an opportunity to respond and submit clarifications.”&nbsp;India is TikTok’s largest foreign market, with about 120 million active users, according to public data.</p>



<p>Indian companies and venture capitalists are harvesting the blank market in the absence of Chinese Internet applications, but whatever the outcome of the 59 Chinese App in India, the change and value they bring to Indians will never be erased.</p>



<h2><strong>Dream factory</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>Mumbai, the financial center of India’s west coast, attracts millions of young people to make a living every year, many of whom are famous dreamers in Bollywood.&nbsp;For millions of young people with artistic dreams, Bollywood is a “dream factory”.</p>



<p>Like all Indian girls who grew up watching Bollywood movies, Bhavana has a dream of becoming a star.&nbsp;But her “dream factory” is not Mumbai, but a short video app on her phone.</p>



<p>Three years ago, Bhavana downloaded TikTok as soon as it was launched in India.&nbsp;She saw the girls dancing in beautiful sari and matching their performances to the soundtracks of Bollywood movies.&nbsp;She began to try to make videos herself.&nbsp;Every time she finds popular background music and special effects, she will actively participate in creating videos.</p>



<p>“I usually don’t have much free time as a teacher, but as long as I’m free, I always make a video or two before I dress up and go out.”&nbsp;Bhavana said that after three years of accumulation, she has 750,000 followers on TikTok.</p>



<p>In addition to performing and dancing, Bhavana will also send some videos of daily life and DIY painting.&nbsp;Bhavana teaches language and science at school, but she also likes creative painting.&nbsp;She will start with a number or a letter, and a few strokes will turn it into a simple stroke, such as the popular Indian elephant god Ganesha, or some small animals to teach and have fun.</p>



<p>This made star scout of the short video platform notice her.&nbsp;Last year, an online celebrity agency contacted her, invited her to join the VMate platform to create, and promised that she would be paid for it.</p>



<p>She joined the VMate platform in September 2019.</p>



<p>In May of that year, Alibaba injected hundreds of millions of dollars into the product, which was incubated by a UC team that has been crawling and rolling in India for many years.&nbsp;At that time, VMate, which had just over 30 million monthly active users, began to make efforts in the creators’ ecology, taking the initiative to identify potential talent.&nbsp;Bhavana is good at painting and is positioned as an expert in painting.&nbsp;She mainly publishes DIY paintings on the VMate platform and attracts 25,000 followers in a month.</p>



<p>TikTok and VMate brought her not only a sense of achievement, but also tangible economic benefits.</p>



<p>Bhavana told Tencent Deepnet, that she receives about ten ads a month on TikTok, including products and APP ads.&nbsp;The average price of an advertisement is 1250 rupees ($16.70), while the higher price is 1500 rupees ($20.04).</p>



<p>The competition on VMate is not as fierce as that of TikTok, and her income can reach a higher level.</p>



<p>An industry insider familiar with VMate told Tencent Deepnet that VMate has two incentive systems for celebrity, either calculated according to the number of likes and views, or set a certain number of videos up to the standard, and as long as celebrity achieves this goal, it can get fixed income.</p>



<p>In general, celebrity earns a fixed income of 20, 000 rupees ($267) a month if only 10 videos are up to standard in terms of quality and viewing.&nbsp;This means that celebrity, which is a part-time creator like Bhavana, can also earn a considerable amount of money.</p>



<p>In addition, VMate has set up the reward function a long time ago, and users can reward it in virtual currency, and celebrity can withdraw cash directly to e-wallets and bank cards.&nbsp;Bhavana said she once had a video that earned more than 5000 rupees in a week.</p>



<p>“Every month, I can earn at least 30,000 rupees (about $400) on these two platforms.”&nbsp;According to her, primary school teachers earn 45000 rupees ($601.33) a month, and when the market is good, she earns almost the same amount of money from short videos.&nbsp;According to World Bank statistics in 2016, India’s per capita monthly income has just exceeded 10,000 rupees.</p>

<h2><strong>Return to zero</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>VMate also let Bhavana go out of his hometown to the capital New Delhi and the holy city of Varanasi to participate in the celebrity public welfare activities organized by the platform.&nbsp;At a public welfare children’s shelter in New Delhi, Bhavana taught children to draw on the spot, and the onlookers cheered with surprise.&nbsp;“I like to teach children, and I will be very happy.”&nbsp;She told Tencent Deepnet.</p>



<p>Under the shadow of the Covid-19 epidemic, the short video has become a channel for her to communicate with the outside world.&nbsp;At the end of March, because of the novel coronavirus epidemic in India, Bhavana began to have more free time.&nbsp;She spends four or five hours every afternoon carefully designing and shooting painting DIY videos, each of which takes 40 to 50 minutes.&nbsp;The school has not started for a long time, and the students also learn and amuse themselves by watching her videos.</p>



<p>The news that Tiktok and VMate had been banned came all of a sudden.&nbsp;At the end of June, people on the VMate team informed her that the platform might be blocked, and she downloaded more than 1200 videos she had uploaded overnight.&nbsp;She downloaded more than 2300 videos on TikTok.&nbsp;A few days later, she heard the news of the ban.</p>



<p>This was followed by a job-hopping invitation from agent.&nbsp;Local competitors such as Roposo, ShartChat and MICO Chat are taking advantage of the opportunity to poach online celebrities. She receives calls from different agents every day, but she is still hesitant to join any local platform except YouTube.</p>



<p>“These apps are different, and they don’t have a lot of features on TikTok and VMate.” Bhavana said, “even if I switch to other platforms, I will always be grateful to TikTok and VMate apps from China, which have made me an independent content creator, and I started here because they let me be seen by others,”</p>



<p>Wryib Khan, who works for an online celebrity agency in Gurgaon, told Tencent Deepnet, that creators on TikTok had spent money to buy fans from him to increase their influence.&nbsp;Now that the platform is banned, …</p></div></div>

				<p>Subsurface is a technical conference tailored for data architects and data engineers like you: the data teams on the front lines building next-generation cloud data lakes. Subsurface will also be relevant for data warehouse (e.g., Snowflake, Redshift, Teradata) administrators, infrastructure engineers and even technically minded key decision-makers.<br></p>			</div>

			<p>You’ll get the latest on important open source projects driving innovation in cloud data lakes, such as Apache Arrow, Iceberg, Parquet, Arrow Flight and Superset; you’ll learn from peers who are building cloud data lakes to solve for a wide range of use cases from data warehousing and BI to data science and advanced analytics; and you’ll join a cloud data lake community that continues on after the conference to help you network and discover tips, tricks and best practices for making your own cloud data lake a success. As an added benefit, studies show that a vast majority of guests attending events by Dremio have been known to leave more elated than visitors to Santa's Workshop, The Lost Continent of Atlantis, and the Fountain of Youth. :)</p>

			<p>Subsurface will be streaming LIVE. We know live events are just inherently more interesting, after all, anything can happen! We also know technology and network issues sometimes occur, so we’ll have pre-recorded backups that we can cut over to just in case. Assuming all goes well, we won’t need them at all.</p>

			<p>Yes. You’ll get live audio Q&amp;A at the end of each session as well as Slack-based Q&amp;A with speakers during “office hours” following each session. And once office hours are over, you can still continue the conversation on Slack with other attendees. Even better, all of the Slack channels will persist after the conference as part of the ongoing cloud data lake community we’re building. So you’ll be able to come back anytime and continue to engage with peers and industry experts.</p>

<h3>What the future for Concorde and passenger travel could have been like today</h3>
</div><p>Some of the details on this page are thanks to Gordon Roxburgh of Concordesst</p><div title="" data-is-responsive="false" data-display-mode="fill" data-content-padding-horizontal="0" data-content-padding-vertical="0" data-exact-height="450" id="i2kyjoix"><div id="i2kyjoixlink"><wix-image data-has-bg-scroll-effect="" data-image-info="{&quot;imageData&quot;:{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;Image&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;c1n0m&quot;,&quot;metaData&quot;:{&quot;pageId&quot;:&quot;c8aw&quot;,&quot;isPreset&quot;:true,&quot;schemaVersion&quot;:&quot;2.0&quot;,&quot;isHidden&quot;:false},&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;uri&quot;:&quot;b9d472_125bd05bf73542e2a322904f89d52267.png&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;height&quot;:768,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;displayMode&quot;:&quot;fill&quot;},&quot;containerId&quot;:&quot;i2kyjoix&quot;,&quot;displayMode&quot;:&quot;fill&quot;}" data-has-ssr-src="true" data-is-svg="false" data-is-svg-mask="false" id="i2kyjoiximg"><img id="i2kyjoiximgimage" alt="" data-type="image" itemprop="image" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/b9d472_125bd05bf73542e2a322904f89d52267.png/v1/fill/w_281,h_211,al_c,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,blur_2/b9d472_125bd05bf73542e2a322904f89d52267.png"></wix-image></div></div><div data-packed="false" data-vertical-text="false" id="i2kyk47c"><p>The Concorde production sadly ended with airframe number 216 (G-BOAF).</p>



<p>This is particularly frustrating as the Concorde ‘B’ model was already designed and the engines were available for incorporation into the next airframe number 217.</p>



<p>This was the aircraft the airlines really needed and the aircraft the manufacturers wanted to build. Unfortunately political pressure intervened and the will to proceed with it simply evaporated.</p>



<p>The new engine (the Olympus 610 +25%) had, as its name suggests, more thrust and eliminated noisy, fuel-guzzling afterburners.</p>



<p>The wing was redesigned, had leading edge ‘droop’ and carried more fuel. With better lift/drag, specific fuel consumption and more fuel the range of the Concorde Model ‘B’ increased over the original Concorde ‘A’ Model.</p>
</div><div data-packed="false" data-vertical-text="false" id="i2kylena"><p>Just four months after Concorde began her scheduled services in 1976, a Concorde ‘B’ model was first discussed and designed with slightly larger fuel capacity and slightly larger wings with leading edge slats to improve aerodynamic performance at all speeds.</p>

<p>It featured more powerful engines with sound deadening and without the fuel-hungry and noisy reheat. It was speculated that it was reasonably possible to create an engine with up to 25% gain in efficiency over the Rolls-Royce/Snecma Olympus 593.This would have given 500&nbsp;mi (805 km) additional range even with greater payload, and would have made new commercial routes possible. This was cancelled due in part to poor sales of Concorde, but also to the rising cost of aviation fuel in the 1970s.</p>



<p>During 1976 Jacques Mitterrand, the Chairman and Managing Director of Aerospatiale, submitted a proposal to investigate an improved version of Concorde – the “Version B” to Mr. Cavaille, French Secretary of State to Transport a similar letter was submitted to the British government at that time.</p>



<p>The letter that he sent elaborated on the quality of the work which had been carried out and the know-how that had now been acquired by the four French and British engineering companies (Aerospatiale, BAe, Rolls Royce and SNECMA). In this letter he also stressed the importance of the role that the manufacturers of Concorde could have in the development of a second-generation supersonic aircraft, that would be foreseeable during the 1990’s, could lead to probably in some form of a collaboration between Europe and the United States.</p>



<p>An exploratory study was actually already underway during this time, looking into upgrading the capabilities of the current Concorde design for the early 1980’s. The letter submitted also gave the official go ahead for this exploratory study and proposed a full feasibility study for a Concorde ‘B’ design.</p>



<p>Due to the manufactures having great difficulty selling the remaining five Concorde airframes that were built during the initial production run, Concorde 216 (G-BOAF) was to be the last Concorde ‘A’ built, and 217 was planned to be a Concorde ‘B’ version. Had Concorde ‘B’ been built, what type of future would we be living in now? If the additional range and performance had been available then many more airlines might have purchased Concorde and passenger air travel as we know it today might have been completely different.</p>



<p>She was planned to have a range approaching and even exceeding 5000 miles. But it is easy to imagine the potential range of Concorde ‘B’ design, when you consider that the Concorde “A” model used by British Airways had a design specification range of 3690 miles, had to regularly fly 4250 miles on a route between London Heathrow and Barbados. This was made possible due to operational improvements that pushed the range of Concorde ‘A’ to nearly 4500 miles. The improvements have included small changes to the aerodynamics of the original model’s specifications. One interesting fact is that the take-off weight was made very low and close to the figures estimated for the Concorde ‘B’ design.</p>



<p>The Concorde ‘B’ design would of also benefited from increased subsonic performance and reduced noise emissions.</p>

<p>The cost of the Concorde Project was massive and with the poor sales of Concorde, and cancelled options from airlines, adding to that the rising cost of aviation fuel during the 1970s, the development of the Model ‘B’ version was considered too expensive and cancelled. Although the study carried out was a pretty comprehensive one and could of given Concorde a real future in during the years to come right into the 1990s and even on into the 2000s, after this time it was generally expected that a new generation SST with a new type of variable cycle engines would enter into service (BAe AST3 or Aerospatiale Alliance)</p>



<h3>Exploratory and feasibility study for a Concorde ‘B’ design.</h3>



<p>The study into a Concorde ‘B’ design had two aims:</p>



<p>1. To ensure the expansion and future demand for supersonic transport (SST), where the Anglo-French group was now and into the future as the main and only player,</p>



<p>2. To maintain the high knowledge level gained by the manufacturers in Britain and France, and to provide a solid position for the participation in a future program of a second-generation SST.</p>





<p>This feasibility study, was planned to last 9 months and was estimated to cost 9 million French francs, it was to comprise three areas:</p>



<p>1. Engineering</p>



<p>2. Development costs</p>



<p>3. Markets</p>



<p>If this exploratory and feasibility study was to confirmed an economic interest for the manufacturers, and then led to the decision of the launch of an improved version of Concorde, such an improved version (allowing for a 5 year development programme) could be ready by spring 1982 for the 17th production Concorde 217</p>



<p>Civil aviation history shows that almost all new aircraft constituted a base point for the start of improved versions (The Boeing 747-100 evolved into today’s 747-400) and at this stage this was the plan for the Concorde program.</p>



<p>The interest in this development process would have been beneficial to both the airlines and the manufacturers of Concorde:</p>



<p>1. For the airlines, it would have offered performance improvements (lower direct operation costs, extension of the operating range, and reduction of environmental effects) while conserving the existing investments in crew training, maintenance procedures, etc.</p>



<p>2. For the manufacturers, it would have made it possible to carry out these improvements at a minimum capital cost. Indeed the development of the initial production version generally revealed aerodynamic areas where gains could be made along with structural margins, but these could not be exploited due to the time constraints in getting Concorde into passenger service successfully.</p>



<p>3. If the decision to build the B model would have been taken, the modifications would have been relatively inexpensive as they were just some minor changes to the existing production process, allowing the majority of the tooling to be maintained. The high level of knowledge that was gained during the certification of the current model would have greatly reduced time and costs during the certification of the B model.</p>



<p>These considerations should have applied particularly to the case of Concorde, considering the exceptional degree of innovation obtained and the great amount of technical knowledge accumulated during the twelve years of development of the initial production version.</p>



<p>The broad objectives of the Concorde ‘B’ version were to ensure the expansion of the network of routes that supersonic aircraft could use.</p>



<p>The following improvements were considered to be necessary:</p>



<h3>The Reduction of&nbsp; harmful acoustic effects on the airport environment:</h3>



<p>Although the level of noise produced by Concorde at takeoff and landing is equivalent to that of the first generation long haul aircraft in service (B 707, DC8), only the second generation of long haul aircraft (B747, DC10, L1011) equipped with high-bypass jet engines satisfied the new international noise rules. With the reaction of the United States, which had at the start of scheduled Concorde services not accepted the use of Concorde on their territory, it would be important to reduce the level of noise generated by the aircraft.</p>

<p>Concorde’s fuel consumption accounts for a third of the direct operating cost (DOC).

<p>This would also help in the above objective of increasing the operating range.</p>



<p>This modification must respect two constraints: to preserve – if not improve – the supersonic smoothness of flight, and to limit the effects from modifications or additions on the central core structure of the wing, in order to re-use the majority of the tooling currently used in manufacture and assembly.</p>

The story of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiro_Ono_(chef)" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Jiro’s</a> pursuit of perfection, his sons, how passionate he is about his craft and his product is amazing. I strongly recommend it.</p><p>During the documentary I found myself noticing some interesting parallels between Jiro’s business and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Software as a Service</a> (SaaS), and I thought Jiro had some very good lessons for the SaaS world.</p><p><img src="https://yenkel.dev/media/2020-07-07/jiro.jpg"></p><p>Much like Software as a Service (SaaS) <a href="https://www.sushi-jiro.jp/dining-at-jiro/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Jiro’s restaurant</a> has a clear product core that he and his team have spent years perfecting. Years ago Jiro decided his restaurant would only serve Nigiri(s), no other food (some visitors find this odd). This ensures he and his team can focus on perfecting their product offering over time.</p><p>However, even when he has this simple menu Jiro adapts his customer service to specific customer needs, using insights he has gathered from his customers over the years. </p><p>A meal at Jiro consists of ~20 pieces of Sushi. Jiro serves the first piece to all customers at the same spot on their plate, and Jiro watches what hand each customer uses to pick up their food. If they pick up the sushi with their left hand, Jiro makes a mental note and from that point on starts serving left-handed diners at a different position in their plate, making it easier for them to pick the pieces up.</p><p>Another thing Jiro to prevent diners from getting full before trying all pieces is serve different size pieces to men and women, serving smaller pieces to women (whether that’s correct or not is not the point 🤷‍♂️, it seems to work for him after years of being in the business).</p><p>Jiro and his team also make a point of having a repeatable and efficient way of  putting sushi in diners plates twice a day. One could say Jiro’s team deploys multiple times a day (lunch and dinner) 😋:
<img src="https://yenkel.dev/media/2020-07-07jiro-schedule.png"></p><p>They have established relationships with specific market merchants to purchase a particular fish type from each. Each vendor is a specialist in their fish type. Jiro trusts merchants to know their craft, and merchants, in turn, feel pride in providing Jiro. The process to prepare ingredients and even the process to hand make each piece of Sushi is repeated day in and day out the same way, which allows predictability and continuous improvement of their technique.</p><p>Finally, Jiro’s place has <a href="https://www.sushi-jiro.jp/dining-at-jiro/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">very comprehensive and simple to understand documentation</a> on how to use the product.</p><p>These are the lessons I gathered from Jiro’s documentary that I believe to be greatly applicable to SaaS companies, especially startups.</p><h2 id="focus"><a href="#focus" aria-label="focus permalink"></a>Focus</h2><p>Do one thing well and perfect that. You might be tempted to <em>“add more dishes to your menu”</em> aiming to please some extra customers, especially in the beginning. Resist that temptation if you have the runway, and you’ll likely be more successful in the long run.</p><p>Multiple reasons can cause a company to “lose focus”. One that’s is fairly common is that while you and the team are building your SaaS product, you might run into situations when big customers want to pay you a lot of $$ for your product, only if you agree to build a certain set of features. What to do in this case depends on many factors, there are no easy criteria to say “yes” or “no”. But over time these decisions accumulate, so you need to be intentional about them!</p><p>The more “one-offs” (features that are only valuable for one or a few customers) you do:</p><ol><li>The more complex your product and codebase become, making development slower</li><li>The longer it takes to get to your original vision because you are spending time doing other things and because of the impact of #1</li><li>As a consequence of #1 and #2, the less motivated a team that believes in the vision will get.</li></ol><p>As much as possible, once you have found product/market fit, try to resist the short term $$ temptation.</p><h2 id="buy--build"><a href="#buy--build" aria-label="buy  build permalink"></a>Buy &gt; build</h2><p>Initially at a startup you are trying to minimize cash burn. This means you might build some rudimentary things instead of buying. </p><p>If you get to a point when your company sees some success, changing mindsets and differentiating what your core is and what it is not is fundamental to grow and scale.</p><p>Jiro makes sushi. He does not fish his prawns. Unless it is your core business you too should prefer “buy over build”. This helps increase <a href="#focus">focus</a>.
Creating your container orchestrator, running your observability stack, or implementing your login 😛 are things to avoid as they reduce focus and increase cost in the long run.</p><p>For example: investing in observability (metrics, logs, tracing) is something all SaaS companies have to do, regardless of their industry. Unless you are extremely large and have particular needs (e.g. <a href="https://eng.uber.com/distributed-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Uber and Jaeger</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/under-the-hood-data-diving-with-scuba/10150599692628920/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Facebook and Scuba</a> or <a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/practical-alerting/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Google and Borgmon</a>) you shouldn’t be implementing an observability stack (and ideally not running it either).</p><p>Many OSS projects and SaaS companies exist so you don’t have to, and projects like <a href="https://prometheus.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Prometheus</a> and companies like <a href="https://www.honeycomb.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Honeycomb</a> are respectively inspired by Borgmon and Scuba.</p><p>Pick your vendors and/or projects and use them. Don’t spend time implementing observability tools from scratch unless that’s your core business value.</p><p>Today at Auth0 we use <a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Datadog</a> for metrics, <a href="https://www.elastic.co/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Elastic and Kibana</a> for logs, <a href="https://lightstep.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Lightstep</a> for distributed tracing and <a href="https://sentry.io/welcome/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Sentry</a> for error tracking.</p><h2 id="always-learn-from-customers"><a href="#always-learn-from-customers" aria-label="always learn from customers permalink"></a>Always learn from customers</h2><p>Even when you have a SaaS product, all customers are unique. Learn from them, listen to them and over time you’ll be able to figure out what things you can do to provide a better service to all your customers. Take every opportunity to improve!</p><p>At Auth0 we constantly strive to learn from customers and prospects: early access programs, monthly or quarterly customer reviews, specific feature discovery sessions, and support tickets are some ways customers provide feedback.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Open source maintainers donâ€™t often spend time thinking about their projectâ€™s
trademarks, and with good reason: between code contribution, documentation,
crafting the technical direction, and creating a healthy contributor community,
thereâ€™s plenty to do without spending time considering how your projectâ€™s name
or logo will be used. But trademarks – whether a name, logo, or badge – are an
extension of a projectâ€™s decision to be open source. Just as your projectâ€™s open
source license demonstrates that your codebase is for free and fair use, an open
source project trademark policy in keeping with the <a href="https://opensource.org/osd">Open Source
Definition</a> gives everyone – upstream contributors
and downstream consumers – comfort that they are using your projectâ€™s marks in
a fair and accurate way.</p>
<p>We created the Open Usage Commons because free and fair open source trademark
use is critical to the long-term sustainability of open source. However,
understanding and managing trademarks takes more legal know-how than most
project maintainers can do themselves. The Open Usage Commons is therefore
dedicated to creating a model where everyone in the open source chain – from
project maintainers to downstream users to ecosystem companies – has peace of
mind around trademark usage and management. The projects in the Open Usage
Commons will receive support specific to trademark protection and management,
usage guidelines, and conformance testing.</p>
<p>The Open Usage Commons will also provide the community with education regarding
trademarks. Many people may not realize that the permission to use the projectâ€™s
trademark is distinct from the projectâ€™s license for its source code. If you
look at various open source licenses, you will likely find a line that says that
the license does not grant trademark use. These are separate, because while
anyone may use or distribute the source code, when someone sees a projectâ€™s name
or logo, they assume certain qualities about what they are consuming based on
their trust in the project. While a license is not actually required for
accurate references to a projectâ€™s name, a well-defined trademark policy removes
ambiguity and provides certainty about acceptable uses.</p>
<p>Accordingly, a trademark, while managed separately from the code, actually
<em>helps</em> project owners ensure their work is used in ways that follow the <a href="https://opensource.org/osd">Open
Source Definition</a> by being a clear signal to users
that, â€œThis is open source.â€�</p>
<p>To start, <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a>, a web application framework for
mobile, and desktop; <a href="https://www.gerritcodereview.com/">Gerrit</a>, web-based team
code collaboration tool; and <a href="https://istio.io/">Istio</a>, an open platform to
connect, manage, and secure microservices, will be joining the Open Usage
Commons, giving their trademarks a neutral, independent home that manages
trademarks in line with the <a href="https://opensource.org/osd">Open Source
Definition</a>. If you currently use one of these
trademarks, you can continue to use these marks, following any current guidance
from the project. If you think your project may benefit from joining the Open
Usage Commons, email <a href="mailto:info@openusage.org">info@openusage.org</a>.</p>
<p>The Open Usage Commons is something wildly new in open source, and in the spirit
of the transparency that propels open source, weâ€™ll be the first to tell you
that the Commons intends to start small and walk before it runs. There will be
plenty of questions we donâ€™t have answers to yet. Weâ€™re guided by our commitment
to open use, passion for open source, and dedication to being an organization
that is in service to open source projects.</p>

Ward</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-4350307291348237272" itemprop="description articleBody"><p>
Almost ten years ago <a href="https://www.reflectionsofthevoid.com/2011/03/how-to-install-soft-iwarp-on-ubuntu.html" target="_blank">I wrote about installing SoftIwarp on Ubuntu</a> 10.04. Today I will be revisiting the process.&nbsp;First, what is SoftIwarp: <a href="https://github.com/zrlio/softiwarp" target="_blank">Soft-iWARP</a>&nbsp;is a software-based <a href="http://www.iol.unh.edu/services/testing/iwarp/">iWARP</a> stack that runs at reasonable performance levels and seamlessly fits into the <a href="http://www.openfabrics.org/">OFA RDMA</a> environment provides several benefits. SoftiWARP is a software RDMA device that attaches with the active network cards to enable RDMA programming. For anyone starting with RDMA programming, RDMA-enabled hardware might not be at hand. SoftiWARP is a very useful tool to set up the RDMA environment, and code and experiments with.</p>
<p>
To install SoftIwarp you have to go through 4 stages: Setting up the environment, Building SoftIwarp, Configuring Softiwarp, Testing.</p>

<p><span><u>Setting up RDMA environment</u></span></p><p>

Before you start you should prepare the environment for building a kernel module and userspace library.<br>
<a href="https://github.com/animeshtrivedi/blog/blob/master/post/2019-06-26-siw.md#basic-building-environment"></a>Basic building environment</p><div>
<br>
<div>
<pre>sudo apt-get install build-essential libelf-dev cmake
</pre>

<p><a href="https://github.com/animeshtrivedi/blog/blob/master/post/2019-06-26-siw.md#installing-userspace-libraries-and-tools"></a>Installing userspace libraries and tools</p></div>

<div>
<pre>sudo apt-get install libibverbs1 libibverbs-dev librdmacm1 \</pre>
<pre>librdmacm-dev rdmacm-utils ibverbs-utils
</pre>

<p><a href="https://github.com/animeshtrivedi/blog/blob/master/post/2019-06-26-siw.md#insert-common-rdma-kernel-modules"></a>Insert common RDMA kernel modules</p><pre>sudo modprobe ib_core</pre>
</div>
<pre>sudo modprobe rdma_ucm</pre>
<div>


<p>
Check if everything is correctly installed :&nbsp;</p>

<pre>sudo lsmod | grep rdma&nbsp;</pre>

<p>
You should see something like this :&nbsp;</p>

<div>
<pre>rdma_ucm&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;28672&nbsp; 0
ib_uverbs&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;126976&nbsp; 1 rdma_ucm
rdma_cm&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 61440&nbsp; 1 rdma_ucm
iw_cm&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 49152&nbsp; 1 rdma_cm
ib_cm&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 57344&nbsp; 1 rdma_cm
ib_core&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;311296&nbsp; 5 rdma_cm,iw_cm,rdma_ucm,ib_uverbs,ib_cm</pre>
<pre></pre>
</div>
<p>
Now set up some library for the userspace libs :&nbsp;</p>

<pre>sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake gcc libudev-dev libnl-3-dev \</pre>
<pre>libnl-route-3-dev ninja-build pkg-config valgrind</pre>

<p><span><u>Installing SoftiWARP</u></span></p><p>

10 years ago you had to clone the SoftiWARP source code and build it (https://github.com/zrlio/softiwarp.git). Now you are lucky, it is by default in the Linux kernel 5.3 and above!</p></div>

<p>
You just have to type :&nbsp;</p>

<pre>sudo modprobe siw</pre>

<p>
verify it works :&nbsp;</p>

<pre>sudo lsmod | grep siw</pre>
<p>
you should see :&nbsp;</p>
<pre>siw&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;188416&nbsp; 0
ib_core&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;311296&nbsp; 6 rdma_cm,iw_cm,rdma_ucm,ib_uverbs,siw,ib_cm
libcrc32c&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 16384&nbsp; 3 nf_conntrack,nf_nat,siw</pre>
<div>

<p>
moreover, you should check if you have an Infiniband device present :&nbsp;</p>

<pre>ls /dev/infiniband&nbsp;</pre>

<p>
Result :&nbsp;</p>

<pre>rdma_cm</pre>


<p>
You also need to add the following file in your&nbsp;/etc/udev/rules.d/90-ib.rules directory containing the below entries :&nbsp;</p>

<div>
<p><span>&nbsp;####&nbsp; /etc/udev/rules.d/90-ib.rules&nbsp; ####</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;KERNEL=="umad*", NAME="infiniband/%k"</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;KERNEL=="issm*", NAME="infiniband/%k"</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;KERNEL=="ucm*", NAME="infiniband/%k", MODE="0666"</span></p>
<p><span lang="FR">&nbsp;KERNEL=="uverbs*", NAME="infiniband/%k", MODE="0666"</span></p>
<p><span lang="FR">&nbsp;KERNEL=="uat", NAME="infiniband/%k", MODE="0666"</span></p>
<p><span lang="FR">&nbsp;KERNEL=="ucma", NAME="infiniband/%k", MODE="0666"</span></p>
<p><span lang="FR">&nbsp;</span><span>KERNEL=="rdma_cm", NAME="infiniband/%k", MODE="0666"</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;########</span></p>
</div>
<p>

If it doesn't exist you need to create it.</p><p>


I would suggest you add also the module to the list of modules to load at boot by adding them to /etc/modules file</p><p>

You need now to reboot your system. </p>

<p><span><u>Userspace library</u></span></p>
</div>
<div>

<p>
Normally, recent library support softiwarp out of the box. But if you want to compile your own version follow the step bellow. However, do this at your own risk... I recommend to stick with the std libs.</p>

<p><b>Optional build SIW userland libraries:&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>
All the userspace library are in a nice single repository. You just have to clone the repo and build all the shared libraries. If you want you can also just build <b>libsiw</b> but it's just easier to build everything at once.&nbsp;</p>

<pre>git clone https://github.com/zrlio/softiwarp-user-for-linux-rdma.git
cd ./softiwarp-user-for-linux-rdma/
./buid.sh</pre>
<div>
<p>
Now we have to setup the $LD_LIBRARY_PATH so that build libraries can be found.&nbsp;</p></div>
<div>
<pre>cd ./softiwarp-user-for-linux-rdma/build/lib/
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$(pwd):$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
</pre>
<p>

or you can add the line in your .bashrc profile:</p></div>
<pre>export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=&lt;&lt;PATHTOTHELIBRARIES&gt;&gt;:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH</pre>
<pre></pre>
<p><b>End of optional section</b></p><pre></pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre></pre>
<p><span><u>Setup the SIW interface : </u></span></p><p>


Now we will be setting up the loopback and a standard eth interface as RDMA device:</p></div>
<div>
<br>
<pre>sudo rdma link add &lt;NAME OF SIW DEVICE &gt; type siw netdev &lt;NAME OF THE INTERFACE&gt;</pre>
<p>

In this case for me :&nbsp;</p></div>
<div>
<br>
<pre>sudo rdma link add siw0 type siw netdev enp0s31f6
sudo rdma link add siw_loop type siw netdev l0</pre>
<pre></pre><p>
You can check the two devices have been correctly set up using <b>ivc_devices</b> and <b>ibv_devinfo</b> command<br>
result of <b>ibv_devices</b>&nbsp; :</p><pre>    device              node GUID</pre>
<pre><pre>    ------           ----------------
    siw0             507b9ddd7a170000
    siw_loop         0000000000000000</pre>

   sm_lid:   0
   port_lid:  0
   port_lmc:  0x00
   link_layer:  Ethernet</pre>
</pre>

<p><span><u>Testing with RPING:&nbsp;</u></span></p>

<p>
Now we simply test the setup with rping :&nbsp;</p>

<p>
In one shell :&nbsp;</p>
<pre>rping -s -a &lt;serverIP&gt;&nbsp;</pre>

<p>
in the other :&nbsp;</p>

<pre>rping -c -a &lt;serverIP&gt; -v&nbsp;</pre>


<p>
And you should see the rping working successfully!&nbsp;</p>

<p>
You are now all set to use RDMA without the need for expensive hardware.&nbsp;</p>

This piece will provide some tips on optimizing your cache and help you avoid some common pitfalls that can tank your performance. By looking at examples of what isn’t cache friendly, we will learn what is.</p>

<p>This post is aimed at developers familiar with lower-level languages like C++ and assumes some exposure to concepts like dynamic memory allocation and pointers.</p>

<p>As with everything performance related, there is no one-size-fits-all solution that will work for every problem, so always profile before and after changes. Likewise, I’m a human first and programmer second so apologies if I got something wrong here, this is a very complex topic!</p>

<p>Part one of this extended piece will cover the basics such as how much cache you have, the granularity of the cache and the limits of the compiler's ability to help you.</p>
									
<h2>Cache sizes &amp; cache lines</h2>

<p>Memory gets increasingly more expensive the faster you need to access it. The amount of cache you have is tied to your specific CPU and has no relation to the amount of RAM you have. Even if you have 16GB of RAM, your CPU likely has less than 16MB of cache; and unless you have server or workstation grade CPU, less than 1mb of L1 cache split across all cores.</p>

<p>CPU-Z says the following about my CPU:</p>

<figure>
	<img src="https://www.inorris.com/Blog/CacheCrashCourse/cpuz.png" alt="Output from CPU-Z for the author's CPU">
	<figcaption>A high end desktop CPU with 32KB of cache per core.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The “cache line” on a modern processor is typically 64 bytes. The cache line is the minimum granularity of a fetch from main memory into any cache. Only need 10 bytes? Tough! The processor is fetching 64. Want 65 bytes? The CPU is now fetching you 128! Those 64 byte blocks are “aligned”, so if your data structure falls across a boundary, you may pay the cost for several cache lines.</p>

<p>When data is fetched from main memory you pay a penalty called a cache miss. If you’re loading a lot of data sequentially, the CPU may be able to predict what you’ll need next by loading it in advance. If you’re reading a large data structure but the data you need is spread out or accessed erratically, you might have several cache misses until all the data is loaded.   In this scenario you’re paying a high cost for every byte read. Some cache misses are unavoidable, our goal is to eliminate the avoidable ones.</p>

<h2>Compiler optimizations</h2>

<p>Compilers are fantastic at identifying dead code and reorganizing to maximize the CPU pipeline, hiding cache latency and much more. However, there’s one thing compilers won’t do – optimise your structures.</p>

<p>It is up to the programmer to identify dead data within structures and classes. The compiler can’t know if you’re going to use the structure for something later (like reading from disk), or if the programmer knows something about memory layout that the compiler doesn’t (for example embedded hardware). As a result, it won’t change your layout beyond the alignment rules we discuss later.</p>

<p>Note, this applies to classes and structures only and not local variables, function parameters and so on. The compiler will happily eliminate those for you, and all the code associated with it if it knows the value is never used.</p>

<h2>Big N, Big :O</h2>

<p>The saying goes that you shouldn’t prematurely optimize, however the larger your N, the more care you need to take with the design of a system. Some design consideration now can pay dividends later when system designs are harder to optimize for performance.</p>

<p>Here are a few rules to make your life easier:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Design your external interface to be agnostic of the internal data organization. Avoid exposing internal structures.</li>
	<li>If your system can take ownership (or control creation of) for data it inherits, this will give you more flexibility.</li>
	<li>The fewer places you are allocating the better. Less allocations means less indirection.</li>
	<li>Minimize inheritance and prefer composition. A lot of interfaces on an object means it is over-generalized and will suffer from poor data locality.</li>
	<li>Your classes and structures should do as few things as possible with as little data as possible.</li>
</ul>

    <div>
      
            
      <p>June 19th 2020 EU introduced the new <a href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/303600_303699/303645/02.01.01_60/en_303645v020101p.pdf" target="_blank">Cyber Security standard</a> for Consumer Internet of Things products. Following the rapid growth in connected devices combined with the increased risks associated with insecure devices, the EU hopes the new standard will lead to better security practises and more vendors adopting a security by design principle when developing new connected consumer products.</p>

<h3>Why this new standard?</h3>
<p>The IoT market behaves like the wild-west. The lack of regulation, abundance of cheap technology and the promise of enormous markets and profits have evolved into a scary and unfortunate reality.  Vendors of connected devices have little to no incentive to make their products secure. Technologically illiterate consumers who barely know how to configure their home router fail to use their purchasing power to command security in the products. The result is a marketplace where neither the demand nor the supply side value security. Hence, a world of highly insecure and fragile connected devices have emerged.</p>
<p>For some years, the EU realized potential risks following the digital revolution, and therefore decided to put forward standards to set the bar with regards to what is to be expected from connected devices. A standard is the first important step towards eventual regulation.</p>
<h3>The new standard in brief</h3>
<p>The EU sought to make the standard outcome oriented, as opposed to prescriptive. This allows vendors to comply without any stifling of innovation. The bar was set to establish a baseline of minimum security measures to protect against the most fundamental and elementary cyber security attacks.</p>
<p>The standard consists of 13 provisions. We are happy to report that our own Mender product comes with so many security features that almost half of these provisions will be covered if Mender is being used to secure an IoT device.</p>
<p>The 13 provisions are:</p>
<ol>
<li>No universal default passwords </li>
<li>Implement a means to manage reports of vulnerabilities </li>
<li>Keep software updated </li>
<li>Securely store sensitive security parameters </li>
<li>Communicate securely </li>
<li>Minimize exposed attack surfaces</li>
<li>Ensure software integrity</li>
<li>Ensure that personal data is secure </li>
<li>Make systems resilient to outages</li>
<li>Examine system telemetry data</li>
<li>Make it easy for users to delete user data </li>
<li>Make installation and maintenance of devices easy </li>
<li>Validate input data </li>
</ol>
<p>Each of these provisions have easy to understand and tangible sub provisions. An example would be: <em>“Provision 5.3-1: All software components in consumer IoT devices should be securely updateable”</em>. </p>
<p>Further, each sub provision comes with examples equally easy to understand and tangible. An example would be:<em> “The first stage boot loader on a device is written once to device storage and from then on is immutable.”</em></p>
<p>Jump to <a href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/303600_303699/303645/02.01.01_60/en_303645v020101p.pdf" target="_blank">page 13</a> in the standard to read more about each of the provisions and its sub provisions and examples.</p>
<h3>Expected implications of the new standard</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, this standard does not address the fundamental marketplace problem (illiterate consumers and profit seeking vendors). Consumers will remain ignorant to their insecure devices and the vendors continue to push for profit and view security as an extra unnecessary cost. Only naive politicians should expect a change in behavior following a standard like this.</p>
<p>The main implication of the new standard lies in its referenceable value. The EU finally has a recommended way to secure the world’s connected devices. </p>
<p>This standard already serves as the basis for UK’s law to require security labelling on connected devices (read more about that <a href="https://mender.io/blog/united-kingdom-to-introduce-security-labelling-on-connected-devices" target="_blank">here</a>). </p>
<p>Security auditing and consulting companies now possess a practical check-list to use in client work. By complying with the EU standard, devices will be orders of magnitude more secure than the typical IoT product of today.</p>
<p>If we don’t see a drastic improvement in the security of connected devices, the EU will impose regulations. When this happens this standard can be expected to form the basis for such regulation.</p>
<h3>GDPR for IoT is one big disaster away</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, a standard will not fix the fundamental demand-supply problem related to the security of IoT products. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, it seems like a big disaster following insecure IoT devices must occur before politicians step up and use their legislation sledge hammer. </p>
<p>Hopefully, such a big disaster comes in the form of geopolitical defense/military realizations that will not impact the life or health of humans. Worse case, somewhere in the world, we will witness some sort of critical infrastructure blow-up. Such an incident will serve as a huge wake-up call for everyone. When it happens, in the same way Facebook and social media brought us GDPR, such disaster will bring us strict IoT regulations.</p>

</span></code></pre></section></section><section><h2 id="what-are-foreign-data-wrappers">What are foreign data wrappers?</h2><p>The easiest way to describe foreign data wrappers is by considering UNIX files. A UNIX file isn't always pointing to a local file on your disk. It could be a file stored on NFS, in a remote S3 bucket or even a shim that lets you manipulate a device on your machine.</p><p>In UNIX, a file is a pretty strong abstraction that doesn't get broken. An IDE doesn't need to know that the file it's editing is on a remote filesystem. It can work with it by issuing the same ordinary read and write calls. Someone who writes a new filesystem doesn't need to make sure that it's compatible with all existing tools. Instead, they can write a driver that mounts the filesystem to a mountpoint.</p><p>PostgreSQL FDWs resemble mounting in that respect. Foreign tables mostly behave like normal tables and can receive the same <code>SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE</code> queries. Behind the scenes, the wrapper's only job is to emit tuples.</p></section><section><h2 id="why-should-i-use-fdws">Why should I use FDWs?</h2><p>Foreign data wrappers are a great alternative to ETL. Instead of loading data into your warehouse that you might never use, you can mount the remote database and query it on demand.</p><p>Because they integrate with the PostgreSQL query planner, FDWs have a decent performance. The FDW can push down qualifiers and even aggregations to the remote database. FDWs can report the rough costs of starting a scan and fetching a tuple back to the query planner. This lets the query planner choose, for example, whether running multiple small single scans or one big one is a better strategy for satisfying a JOIN.</p><p>It's straightforward to write your own FDW and the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/fdwhandler.html" as="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/fdwhandler.html">PostgreSQL documentation</a> covers it extensively. The <a href="https://github.com/wikrsh/hello_fdw/" as="https://github.com/wikrsh/hello_fdw/">hello-world FDW</a> that returns "Hello, World" in a table is only a couple hundred lines of C code. If you prefer to focus on development simplicity, you can use Multicorn instead of raw C.</p><p>There are plenty of open-source foreign data wrappers available. They let you query other RDBMSs, NoSQL databases, CSV files or column stores. The <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Foreign_data_wrappers" as="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Foreign_data_wrappers">PostgreSQL wiki</a> lists some of them.</p><p>Using a foreign data wrapper for your database or data source gives you access to a huge ecosystem of software that works with PostgreSQL. We can almost call this a network effect. A new data source that is accessible via an FDW enhances everything that works with PostgreSQL.</p></section><section><h2 id="why-use-fdws-with-splitgraph">Why use FDWs with Splitgraph?</h2><p><a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/ingesting-data/foreign-data-wrappers/introduction" as="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/ingesting-data/foreign-data-wrappers/introduction">Foreign data wrappers</a> are one of the ways that Splitgraph aims to make data engineers' and data scientists' work easier.</p><p>Splitgraph's <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/sgr/data-import-export/mount" as="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/sgr/data-import-export/mount"><code>sgr mount</code></a> command handles the boilerplate around FDW initialization.

                        <h2>0x04 Running Protocol</h2>
                        <p>
							Once installed, Protocol can be run from the command line. The syntax is
							the following:
							</p><p>
								protocol &lt;EXISTING_PROTOCOL_NAME(S)&gt;
							</p>
							or
							<p>
								protocol &lt;CUSTOM_PROTOCOL_SPECIFICATION(S)&gt;
							</p>
							The following subsections describe each approach.
							
							<h3>0x04.1 Displaying Existing Protocols</h3>
							
						<p>
							The first approach lets users print ASCII headers for existing network
							protocols. In particular, the following protocols are available.
</p><div>
<pre>"ethernet"            : Ethernet
"8021q"               : IEEE 802.1q
"dot1q"               : IEEE 802.1q
"tcp"                 : Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
"udp"                 : User Datagram Protocol (TCP)
"ip"                  : Internet Protocol (IP), version 4.
"ipv6"                : Internet Protocol (IP), version 6.
"icmp"                : Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)
"icmp-destination":   : ICMP Destination Unreachable
"icmp-time"           : ICMP Time Exceeded
"icmp-parameter"      : ICMP Parameter Problem
"icmp-source"         : ICMP Source Quench
"icmp-redirect"       : ICMP Redirect
"icmp-echo"           : ICMP Echo Request/Reply
"icmp-timestamp"      : ICMP Timestamp Request/Reply
"icmp-information"    : ICMP Information Request/Reply
"icmpv6"              : ICMP for IPv6 (ICMPv6)
"icmpv6-destination"  : ICMPv6 Destination Unreachable
"icmpv6-big"          : ICMPv6 Packet Too Big
"icmpv6-time"         : ICMPv6 Time Exceeded
"icmpv6-parameter"    : ICMPv6 Parameter Problem
"icmpv6-echo"         : ICMPv6 Echo Request/Reply
"icmpv6-rsol"         : ICMPv6 Router Solicitation
"icmpv6-radv"         : ICMPv6 Router Advertisement
"icmpv6-nsol"         : ICMPv6 Neighbor Solicitation
"icmpv6-nadv"         : ICMPv6 Neighbor Advertisement
"icmpv6-redirect"     : ICMPv6 Redirect
</pre>
</div>
						One or more of the protocols listed above can be printed. Here are a few
						examples:
<div>
<pre>protocol tcp
protocol dot1q
protocol tcp udp
protocol ipv6 icmpv6 icmpv6-redirect
</pre>
</div>
					   Note that protocol names don't need to be fully specified, as long as there
					   is no ambiguity. For example 'protocol et' is equivalent to 'protocol
					   ethernet'. Whenever there is ambiguity (e.g. 'protocol icmpv6-r', a list of
					   possible options will be displayed.
<div>
<pre>$ protocol icmpv6-r
Ambiguous protocol specifier 'icmpv6-r'. Did you mean any of these?
  icmpv6-radv
  icmpv6-redirect
  icmpv6-rsol
</pre>
</div>
						

						<h3>0x04.2 Displaying Custom Protocols</h3>
						
						<p>
							Apart from already existing protocols, Protocol can represent any arbitrary
							protocol headers. In order to do that, instead of specifying the name of
							an existing protocol, a custom protocol specification may be supplied. Such
							specification must follow a simple but specific syntax:

							</p><p>
								"&lt;LIST_OF_FIELDS&gt;[?OPTIONS]"
							</p>
							
							Where <em>[LIST_OF_FIELDS]</em> is a comma-separated list of protocol field names
							and lengths (expressed in bits), and <em>[?OPTIONS]</em> is an optional part that
							allows users to specify format modifiers for the ASCII header. Note that if
							any of the field names contains spaces, the protocol specification must be
							enclosed in double quotes.
						
						<h4>0x04.1.1 Field Lists</h4>
						<p>

							The most important part of a protocol specification are field lists. This
							is just a comma-separated list of name:length tuples, where name represents
							the text that describes the protocol field and can contain any character,
							except for '?' and length is an integer greater than zero, representing the
							number of bits the field takes in the header. Here are a few examples:

							</p><p>
								Type:8,Code:8,Checksum:16,Message Body:64
							</p>
							<p>
								Source Port:16,Destination Port:16,Length:16,Checksum:16
							</p>

							Note that there is no whitespace after the commas. This is a restriction
							that must be respected.Also, note that field lengths don't need to align
							to the length of the line. If a particular field is too long, Protocol will
							just wrap it to the	next line. Here are some examples:

<div>
<pre>$ protocol "Source:16,TTL:8,Reserved:40"

						<h4>0x04.1.2 Options</h4>
						<p>
							Once the list of fields has been specified, users may optionally pass
							formatting options to control the way the ASCII header is generated.
							Options are supplied as a comma-separated list of label=value elements.
							The first one is preceded by the '?' sign, which lets Protocol figure out
							where the field list ends and where the list of options begins. The options
							currently available are the following:
</p><div>
<pre>bits=&lt;n&gt;       : Number of bits per line. By default it's 32, same as
                 IETF. This is useful for protocols that don't align
                 perfectly to 32-bit words, like Ethernet.
numbers=&lt;Y/N&gt;  : Instructs protocol to print or avoid printing the bit
                 counts on top of the header.
evenchar=&lt;c&gt;   : Instructs protocol to use the supplied character, instead
                 of the default "-" as the character in even positions of
                 the horizontal lines.
oddchar=&lt;c&gt;    : Same as evenchar but for characters in odd positions of
                 the horizontal lines. By default it takes the value '+'
startchar=&lt;c&gt;  : Instructs protocol to use the supplied character instead
                 of the default "+" for the first position of an horizontal
                 line.
endchar=&lt;c&gt;    : Same as startchar but for the character in the last
                 position of the horizonal lines.
sepchar=&lt;c&gt;    : Instructs protocol to use the supplied character instead
                 of the default "|" for the field separator character.
</pre>
</div>
							The following diagram shows the character modifiers described above.

							each option available.

</p><div>
<pre>Usage: protocol {&lt;protocol&gt; or &lt;spec&gt;} [OPTIONS]

<p>CloudCommerce Inc. A provider of digital marketing services has seen increased interest as SWARM continues to find its place in commercial establishments. Their stock is now teetering the 52wk highs. We’ve consolidated some of their highlights and recent operations in this report for our readers.</p>

<p>CloudCommerce currently trades at about a <strong>5.5m market cap</strong>. <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cloudcommerce-provides-full-guidance-071510608.html">Recent guidance statements</a> predict</p>



<ol type="1"><li><strong>Net operating income over 1 million</strong></li><li><strong>Pushing over 14 million revenue for 2020. (This number is based on existing and new contracts/backlogs)</strong></li></ol>



<p>The company anticipates, but makes no guarantees of issuing less convertible equity (dilution) as a result of their current financial health, see below-</p>



<p>Mr. Andrew Van Noy, CEO of CloudCommerce recently stated, “The Company further announced that its improved financial performance will allow it to create greater shareholder value by continuing its efforts to reduce future equity dilution by retiring certain highly dilutive convertible notes.”</p>



<p>On June 26<sup>th</sup> the company released an <a href="https://www.otcmarkets.com/filing/html?id=14242431&amp;guid=OVgFUHZNE9Dilth">8k</a> announcing the final conversion on the remainder 2019 loans.</p>



<p>We believe this 8k is having a positive impact on the company’s shareholder relations because It’s always good to see debts getting paid without accruing too much interest. Especially on convertible financing. We far too often come across companies that can’t meet their deadlines and are often filled with 2-3 year old notes. People want to see the money come in and go towards projects.</p>

<p>CloudCommerce was recently enlisted by Desert Mountain for marketing services pertaining to golf membership and real estate sales. Desert Mountain is a multi-function resort featuring golf, dining, real estate and more in Scottsdale, Arizona. The entire resort spans 8,000 acres. </p>



<p>This client is a notable one for CLWD. Desert Mountain attracts members from many countries and backgrounds. If CloudCommerce Inc. software, SWARM can perform well with Desert Mountain diversity, this might open up more business channels in the future. The resort garnishes a lot of attention from media relating to their golfing operations and other attractions. </p>

    </span></p><p>“You should improve your variable names,” a programmer told me bluntly after reviewing a program of mine. His comment stopped me in my tracks. The writer in me thought I should have naming down. But I didn’t. It’s still something I’m working on. </p><p>His comment got me thinking how I could do things better. In fact, I think many of us could name variables better. Anyone who’s been stuck trying to decipher a program knows what I’m talking about.</p><p>And that’s what this post is about: how to write better variable names. It’s something that programmers often neglect for other “more important” things. But variable names matter—a lot. </p><p>What I’m finding is this: if you want to improve your code, improve your variable names. Here are three ideas to try.</p><p>I have a “variable name” checklist. It hangs on the wall to the left of my computer monitor.</p><p>It’s hard to forget about a checklist when it’s in your line of vision. That’s why I rely on a physical copy, not a file on my computer. Now writing clear, meaningful variable names top of mind—no excuses. </p><p>At the top of my checklist contains a naming gem:</p><p>“State in words what the variable represents. Often that statement itself is the best variable name.”</p><p>I have Steve McConnell’s book, <em>Code Complete</em>, to thank for that bit of advice. The key here is nailing down the <em>what</em>. Now I constantly ask myself: “what does this variable represent?” And, to McConnell’s point, the answer is in fact usually “the best variable name.” </p><p>My checklist also includes these important points when thinking about naming:</p><ul><li><strong>Be clear</strong>. Is your variable referring to one <em>pizza</em> or many <em>pizzas</em>?</li><li><strong>Be specific</strong>. Is <em>employee</em> better than <em>person</em>?  </li><li><strong>Be meaningful</strong>. Will <em>c</em> make sense to someone else reading your code? Or is <em>customer</em> better?</li></ul><p>There’s more advice from McConnell’s book worth mentioning: use positive variable names for booleans. “Negative names like <em>notFound</em>...are difficult to read when they are negated—for example, <em>if not notFound</em>” (emphasis mine). That’s hard to read and understand. </p><p>As a writer, the last step in my writing process is to read my article out loud to myself. It’s something I’ve started to do as a programmer, too. </p><p>If it sounds awkward, wordy, or unclear, it probably is. This is a very simple step that’ll catch errors, opportunities for refactoring, and naming.</p><p>Awareness can be a great teacher, which is how I came to learn that I needed to work on my own variable naming. It’s easy to assume that our thinking is clear to others. Don’t assume; find out for yourself.</p><p>Ask another programmer to read your code and provide feedback. Simply ask: is my code easy to read? If not, have them point out why and where they’re getting hung up. </p><p>“You shouldn’t need to figure out code,” explains McConnell. “You should be able to read it.”</p><p>And that brings us to the larger point. You know you’re reading a well-written book when reading is effortless. The same is true for reading code: aim for effortless reading. Naming variables properly is a critical step in that process.</p><p><a href="https://amymhaddad.com/"><br>← back to all posts</a></p></div></div></div>]]>

Joining Slack is a special opportunity to accelerate Rimeto’s mission and impact with greater reach, expanded resources, and the support of Slack’s impressive global team.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div>
<div><div>
<p>July 1st, 2020</p>



<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Increased foreign investments</strong></li><li><strong>Improve safety and reduce corruption</strong></li><li><strong>Establish a modern mining system</strong></li></ul>



<p>Kazakhstan has been striving to appeal to foreign investors aggressively since 2016. And it appears they are still pushing with strong momentum in 2020.</p>



<p>Foreign direct investment (FDI) flows to Kazakhstan are among the highest of countries in Central Asia. The largest inflow investments continue going into the mining industry.</p>



<p><strong>What have they have accomplished since 2016…?</strong></p>



<p><strong><em>New Subsoil Resource guidelines updated in 2017 and again in 2018.</em></strong></p>



<p>Key takeaways:</p>



<ul><li>Ease of entry regulations</li><li>Formal classification rules amended</li><li>“First Come, First Served” licensing procedure</li></ul>



<p><strong>International arbitration liberalized</strong></p>



<p>Arbitration was not always the go-to method for handling disputes in Kazakhstan. In the case that arbitration is not pursued, the settlement usually occurred in a local Kazakhstan court. This was worry some for foreign investors due to biased settlements that resulted in favor of the localities.</p>



<p>The remedy was the formation of the International Arbitration Center of Astana International Financial Center (IAC AIFC). This entity launched in 2017 and handles all dispute classes regarding local and foreign parties.</p>



<p>The huge impact behind the AIFC is the legal models and procedures. They have adopted the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) model. This creates a level playing field for foreign investors worried about various forms of corruption and bias.</p>



<p>The UNCITRAL law also gives way to more investments and business formations with legal guides for productive and safe countertrades and contract building. This opens the possibility of larger import/export deals between the U.S. and Kazakhstan.</p>



<p><strong>Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in Kazakhstan</strong></p>



<figure><img src="https://stockifymedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/FDI-Kazakhstan.png" alt=""></figure>



<p><img width="624" height="307" src="">Source: <a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/">Trading Economics</a></p>



<p>In October 2018, 16 major U.S. businesses visited Kazakhstan seeking trade deals. The outcome of the trade pursuit resulted in agreements across many industries. Most businesses are names American’s are familiar with. Here are a few… Coca Cola (KO), Parker Drilling (PKNY), Exxon Mobil (XOM).</p>



<p>The establishment of these multinational enterprises has been tremendous in recent years. Currently, over 700 American companies are operating within Kazakhstan.</p>



<p>The U.S. has been one of the biggest inflow contributors to the Kazakhstan economy. However, It’s important to note the trade deficit with Kazakhstan has been continuous. The trade deficit according to the census calculations was 485.7 million for the year of 2019.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>U.S. FDI in Kazakhstan rose nearly 45% in 2018 most likely due to the attractive legal framework changes.</p>



<p><strong>International Relations:</strong></p>



<p><a href="http://www.akorda.kz/en/events/international_community/telegram_of_congratulations/president-of-kazakhstan-kassym-jomart-tokayev-received-a-letter-of-congratulation-from-us-president-donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">On June 23, 2020</a>, U.S. President, Donald Trump praised Kazakhstan’s president on his first term anniversary. He also extended arms in hopes of strengthening a partnership between the U.S. and Kazakhstan.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>June 22, 2020, the Minister of Ecology, Geology, and Natural Resources of the Republic of Kazakhstan, Magzum Mirzagaliev tweeted,</p>



<p>“We discussed the development of a marketing strategy with IHS Markit, a leader in the development of independent expertise and a strong strategy for the organization of roadshows to attract large foreign investors in the field of exploration, to demonstrate the investment and geological potential of the country.” (Google Translation)</p>



<p>Kazakhstan’s engagement with IHS Markit could go a long way. Especially after the positive sentiment revolving the safety measures by the government throughout the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>



<p>March 9, 2020, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev enacts a Presidential Decree on a new concept of foreign policy for Kazakhstan over the next 10 years.</p>



<p>This Decree concept expresses concern and reparation commitments for the following, but not limited to,</p>



<ol type="1"><li>Multilateral security and communication.</li><li>Physical and cyber terrorism and threats.</li><li>Closing the modernization gap in global growth.</li></ol>



<p><strong>Risk Factors:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Foreign Policy changes</li><li>Geographic disadvantages</li><li>Lacking infrastructure (water &amp; electricity)</li><li>Landlocked (Negative effect on profit margins)</li></ul>



<p><strong>Quick Take: Kazakhstan Gold</strong></p>



<p>The Engineering and Mining Journal (E &amp; MJ) released an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.e-mj.com/features/kazakhstan-intent-on-becoming-a-top-10-gold-producer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">outline</a>&nbsp;on Kazakhstan’s intentions of becoming a major Gold producer. One notable statement that is unfolding in truth is their commitment to holding a top 10 gold producing rank within a decade.<strong></strong></p>



<figure><img src="https://stockifymedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Quarterly-Gold-Reserves.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://stockifymedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Quarterly-Gold-Reserves.jpg 1200w, https://stockifymedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Quarterly-Gold-Reserves-768x425.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"></figure>



<p>Source: <a href="https://www.gold.org/goldhub">Gold.org</a></p>



<p>Now claiming the number 13 spot according to <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/04/02/countries-that-control-the-worlds-gold/111459474/">USA today’s</a> top 25 countries with the largest gold reserves. Kazakhstan holds a total of 386.5 tonnes as of World Gold Council’s January 2020 audit. This increase is likely deriving from the bullish gold trend. Kazakhstan being a landlocked country and many high-potential reserves and promising deposits benefit tremendously with mineral price increases. We hope to them start reinvesting into more telecommunication and infrastructure project into distressed regions.</p>



<h2>Kazakhstan ETF’s</h2>



<p>In 2018, Moscow kicked off their first Kazakhstan focused ETF, FinEx FFIN Kazakhstan ETF (FXKZ).</p>



<p>For U.S. investors, Kazakhstan’s exposure through ETFs has been limited. Currently, the only Kazakhstan exposure exists in <strong>North Shore Global Uranium Mining (NYSE: URNM)</strong> and <strong>Global X Uranium (NYSE: URA)</strong> ETF’s. With relevant stakes in companies such as Rio Tinto and NAC Kazatomprom AO.</p>



<h2>Kazakhstan miners of interest:</h2>



<p><strong>Glencore (OTCPK: GLNCY)-</strong> UK based multinational mining firm. Producing a large portion of zinc along with lead, copper, silver, and gold.</p>



<p><strong>Rio Tinto (OTCPK: RTNTF)</strong>– UK and Australian multinational mining firm. Interest in copper exploration with JV partner Kazgeology, to explore areas of interest in the Karaganda region.</p>



<p><strong>Kaz Minerals (OTCPK: KZMYY)-</strong> Kazakhstan/UK headquartered, operating the largest copper mine in Kazakhstan, Aktogay. In 2019, Kaz expressed the commitment of another $1.2b in expansion to the open-pit mine.&nbsp;&nbsp; Palayan </p>



<p><strong>Palayan</strong> <strong>Resources Inc. (OTCPK: PLYN)-</strong> Recently announced a <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/06/19/2050763/0/en/Palayan-Resources-Acquires-Certain-Mineral-Rights-in-Kazakhstan.html">share agreement with Scythian Mining Group</a>, over the&nbsp;<em>Kokkus Au Project</em>. The Kokkus project is a significant potential play with positive indications (inferred and indicated) sharing geological similarities with Russian giant gold deposit Sukhoi Log. The Kokkus project is also zoned in the Karaganda region.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><p>Newsletters are great, but too much of a distraction if they end up straight in your inbox with no predictable schedule.</p>
<p><a href="https://hey.com/">Hey</a> — the email service by the Basecamp folks — solves this by creating a separate space for newsletters, "The Feed". Here newsletters are shown in a timeline UI without read states. You can casually scroll through newsletters whenever you feel like it, and you do not see them in your main inbox. For most newsletters, this is a great experience.</p>
<p>I liked this concept so much that I decided to integrate it in <a href="https://mailbrew.com/">Mailbrew</a>, my SaaS that lets people receive an email digest from their favorite sources (even DHH himself <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1214356945932435457?s=20">uses it</a>).</p>
<p>My implementation works like this: when signing up for Mailbrew, you get your own email address to receive newsletters: <code>&lt;username&gt;@inbox.mailbrew.com</code>. </p>
<p>All emails sent to that address end up in daily digest with the schedule you decided. We also created a Hey-style feed browsable at <code>app.mailbrew.com/inbox</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://frankdilo.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/blog/mailbrew-inbox.gif" alt="Mailbrew Inbox in action"></p>
<p>We built all of this in a couple of weeks and it was easier to setup than I originally predicted. The tooling around email is great these days.</p>
<h3>Backend</h3>
<p>Amazon SES handles our inbound emails with some help from Lambda.</p>
<p>Here's how it works:</p>
<ul>
<li>When an email arrives at an <code>@inbox.mailbrew.com</code> address, SES uploads the raw email message to S3 and launches a lambda function. Configuring this from the AWS console was 5-10 minutes work.</li>
<li>The lambda function calls Mailbrew's backend (a majestic Django monolith), webhook-style, with recipient address, sender address, and message id.</li>
<li>If we don't recognize the recipient address (no user with that username) we send a special response to the lambda that causes the email to bounce.</li>
<li>If the recipient address matches, then we use the message id to retrieve the raw message content from S3 and process it.</li>
<li>Processing the message consists in extracting the <code>text/html</code> version of the email, applying some basic CSS styles, uploading this processed version to S3 and saving the message metadata in Postgres for easy retrieval.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Frontend</h3>
<p>In the frontend, emails are presented in a CRA React app. We embed the content of each email in a dedicated <code>iframe</code>. </p>
<p>A cool trick that we used was to create the <code>iframe</code> in JavaScript and set its content programmatically instead of settings its <code>src</code> property. This granted us an higher degree of customization and allowed us to do things like having all links inside newsletters open in new tabs.</p>
<p>The HTML of the emails in the S3 bucket is private, so we generate signed urls backend-side to show them. </p>
<p>One last cool thing we wanted to do was to have a link that allowed to read a single newsletter without the hassle of authentication. When opening a newsletter from the links in the daily email digest that we send users, we didn't want them to have to authenticate each time (almost a certainty with multiple devices and the in-app browsers of email clients).</p>
<p>We achieved this by using JSON Web Tokens. Each linked newsletter email in the digest has a token in the URL allowing read-only access to just that message. These links don't look great, but they work, are sharable, and don't require me to keep any state in the backend.</p>
<hr>
<p>This update brings the product closer to my vision of <strong>the single email you read everyday</strong> to stay on top of your game without wasting time. </p>
<p>You can now create a daily digest with Newsletters, Hacker News posts, RSS feeds, Reddit links, <a href="http://dev.to/">Dev.to</a> posts, YouTube videos and much more. The best part is that you receive this just once per day, on your own schedule. </p>
<p>Mailbrew is how I have stayed informed for the past 6 months and here is my <a href="https://app.mailbrew.com/frankdilo/morning-brew-fsKPZhXeFabm">daily digest</a> if you want to check out what the product is capable of.</p>
<p>I am <a href="https://twitter.com/frankdilo">@frankdilo</a> on Twitter if you have any feedback about Mailbrew or this post.</p>

<p>Over the last decade, identity federation has unquestionably played a central role in raising the bar for authentication on the web, in terms of ease-of-use (e.g. passwordless single sign-on), security (e.g. improved resistance to phishing and credential stuffing attacks) and trustworthiness compared to its preceding pattern: per-site usernames and passwords.</p>

<p>The standards that define how identity federation works today were built independently of the web platform, and their designers had to work <strong>around</strong> its limitations rather than extending them. Because of that, existing user authentication flows rely on general web capabilities such as top-level navigation, link decoration, window popups and cookies.</p>

<p>Because these general purpose primitives can be used for an open ended number of use cases (some of them increasingly allowing users to be tracked), browsers have to apply policies that capture the <strong>lowest common denominator</strong>, at best applying cumbersome permissions (e.g. popup blockers) but at worst entirely <a href="https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-privacy/privacy-sandbox">blocking</a> them.</p>

<p>If the low level primitives are being abused for tracking purposes and browsers are applying stricter policies around them, how do we keep identity federation around?</p>

<h2 id="the-classification-problem">The classification problem</h2>

<p>Some of the problem starts with what we have been calling the classification problem.</p>

<p>When federation was first designed, it was rightfully designed <strong>around</strong> the existing capabilities of the web, rather than <strong>changing</strong> them. Specifically, federation worked with callbacks on top of <strong>redirects</strong> or <strong>popup windows</strong>, which didn’t require any redesign, redeployment or negotiation with browser vendors.</p>

<p>These <strong>general purpose</strong> primitives enabled a variety of use cases, which include, among other things, federation. However, they also enable cross-site communication, which isn’t always consented or acknowledged by users, namely via <a href="https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-privacy/privacy-sandbox">decorating links</a>.</p>

<p>Because the cross-site communication takes place in a general purpose medium, it is hard for browsers to tell the difference between cross-site communication that is used for exchanging identity data or other cases where intervention is needed.</p>

<p>The classification problem is the problem of taking the existing federation mechanisms built on top of general purpose primitives and classify them such that they can be told apart.</p>

<p><img src="https://code.sgo.to/WebID/static/mock9.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>For example, IDPs use full page redirects which take the user out of context of the site they were trying to use. IDPs also try to use the general purpose pop-up window, but often because browsers are unaware of the use federation makes of popups, it has to apply a general rule across all usages, often blocking an IDP popup that would be otherwise helpful.</p>

<p><img src="https://code.sgo.to/WebID/static/mock11.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>To solve the classification problem, the following needs to hold:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The user agent should be able to distinguish between authentication and tracking</li>
  <li>The affordance should be applicable/meaningful if and only if it is used for authentication (i.e. cannot be abused outside of its scope)</li>
</ul>

<p>If the classification problem was solved alone it would delineate the boundaries and applications of the affordances, but it wouldn’t necessarily move the needle in making sure that the users are making safer choices.</p>

<p>In order to prevent tracking in federation, one has to solve what we’ve been calling the <a href="#the-rp-tracking-problem">RP tracking problem</a> in federation and the <a href="#the-idp-tracking-problem">IDP tracking problem</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-rp-tracking-problem">The RP Tracking problem</h2>

<p>Relying party tracking is enabled through federation when services that the user signs in to <strong>collude</strong> with each other and other entities to deterministically or probabilistically <strong>link</strong> their user’s accounts to build and get access to a richer user profile (e.g. one site selling data on browsing history for ads targeting to another service). While this could be enabled without federation per se (user could manually provide a joinable email address or phone number), federated identity providers have an opportunity to address this problem by providing the user with service-specific data and directed identifiers.</p>

<p><img src="https://code.sgo.to/WebID/static/mock3.svg" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="the-idp-tracking-problem">The IDP Tracking problem</h2>

<p>Even if identity providers were to provide site-specific data and directed identifiers, IDPs and RPs can exchange data without the user explicitly being aware of what information is flowing between the parties, and that the IDP may have insight into the user’s activity across sites. Federation is implemented via parameters on redirects / top level navigation, which allow for arbitrary data exchange, without insight or controls by the user’s browser.</p>

<p><img src="https://code.sgo.to/WebID/static/mock10.svg" alt=""></p>



<p>By far, the closest analogy to this work is the great work of <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/id-specs/blob/prod/browserid/index.md#web-site-signin-flow">BrowserID</a> during the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Archive/Mozilla/Persona/The_navigator.id_API">Mozilla Personas</a> effort (postmortem <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Identity/Persona_AAR">here</a>). In many ways, the goals that BrowserID was trying to achieve as well as the mechanisms that were created are a lot alike what’s being proposed here. There are significant differences in strategy and design, but let’s start with the similarities first because there are many.</p>

<p>First, BrowserID was clearly trying to solve similar problems, namely IDP Tracking and friction. The mechanisms that were created clearly had <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHpFwdQw2wQ">strong builtin privacy components</a> to prevent IDPs from knowing about RPs and vice versa, via the chain of signatures gathered from IDPs (mainly email providers) and certificates generated by the browser.</p>

<p>Second, from a mechanism perspective, there was clearly a separation between an RP to Browser API as well as a Browser to IDP API.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>navigator</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>((</span><span>assertion</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{},</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>backgroundColor</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>#606B72</span><span>"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>siteName</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>My Example Site</span><span>"</span>
<span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/id-specs/blob/prod/browserid/index.md#web-site-signin-flow">RP calls a browser native API</a> to fetch an assertion which gets mediated by the <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/id-specs/blob/prod/browserid/index.md#identity-provisioning-flow">browser in coordination with the IDP</a>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// set up UI</span>
<span>navigator</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>.</span><span>beginAuthentication</span><span>(</span><span>function</span><span>(</span><span>email</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// update UI to display the email address</span>
<span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The postmortem analysis <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Identity/Persona_AAR">here</a> is very insightful in understanding what were the challenges faced and gives this proposal a solid place to work from. In many ways, we think some of these insights are rooted in the observation we made earlier about backwards compatibility with RPs and user’s current behavior, which we are deliberately trying to avoid.</p>



<p>There is a wide set of privacy and usability goals for identity sharing on the web, but early on we ran into better understanding the structural deployment of federation on the web, specifically the properties that make different strategies more or less plausible.</p>

<p>For example, it is clear that there are relatively few public <a href="#idp">IDPs</a> in use (say, tens), particularly in comparison to the number of <a href="#rp">RPs</a> (say, millions) and their users (say, billions). A structural change that only requires adoption by IDPs and no changes or engagement on the part of RPs and users is significantly easier compared to redeploying millions of RPs or retraining billions of users.</p>

<p>Fortunately, in more cases than not, RPs implement federated identity importing a script provided by - and under the control of - IDPs, giving us a major deployment vehicle: IDP SDKs loaded into RPs.</p>

<p><img src="https://code.sgo.to/WebID/static/mock7.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>Nonetheless, while much of the client side code is under the (few) IDPs to control (e.g. we can replace redirects by other means), all of the server side code is under the (many) RPs to control, meaning that that is significantly harder to change (say, years). The cases where RPs implement federated identity without a dynamically loaded SDK will have a longer deployment window and will be discussed separately.</p>

<p>Likewise, changing user behavior and norms is hard because of the number of people involved (say, billions). Unfamiliar login flows could result in users declining to use federated options, and instead opting for username/password credentials during RP account creation. To address that, this proposal aims to provide an experience that minimizes the divergence from existing federated identity user experience as much it possibly can (e.g. introducing new user decisions to be made).</p>

<p>So, with this deployment constraint in mind, let’s look at what could be done.</p>

<h2 id="status-quo">Status Quo</h2>

<p>Currently, sign-in flows on websites begin with a login screen that provides the user options to use federated identity, as illustrated in the mock below. Today, clicking the button for an IDP relies on general purpose primitives (typically <a href="#low-level">redirects or popups</a>) to an IDP sign-in flow.</p>

<p><img src="https://code.sgo.to/WebID/static/mock1.svg" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="design-principles">Design Principles</h2>

<p>In this proposal, we provide a <a href="#high-level">high-level</a>, identity-specific API that allows browsers to <a href="#the-classification-problem">classify</a> the otherwise <strong>opaque</strong> transactions that are enabled by <a href="#low-level">low-level</a> APIs.</p>

<p>By classifying as an identity data exchange, browsers are now in a position to provide domain specific guidance to users regarding the consequences of the specific identity transaction.</p>

<p>Some of the guiding principles we identified early on intermediating the data exchange are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Principle of Least Disclosure</strong>: The data exchange should disclose as little as possible for a use that is as constrained as possible, incrementally increasing the scope of disclosure with additional explicit consent when that’s relevant contextually. For example, unbundling overly broad scopes (e.g. unbundling authentication from authorization) into multiple granular steps that are asked independently and incrementally.</li>
  <li><strong>Principle of Least Surprise</strong>: the data exchange should never have consequences that exceeds the level of consent and user understanding (including second-order consequences). For example, enforcing the use of <a href="#directed-basic-profile">directed profiles</a> for the majority of the cases prevents unnecessary release of correlation handles.</li>
  <li><strong>Path Dependence Principle</strong>: the set of design options we have is limited by the decisions that have been made in up to this point, regardless of whether they are relevant or not. For example, it seems clear …</li></ul></div></div>

<p>Bashing the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) seems to have become one of American activists’ favourite hobbies in the tech field. Some criticism is entirely justified. But many claims that the GDPR is “counterproductive” or “misses the point” are based on misconceptions, rather than an accurate understanding of European data protection laws.</p>
<p>As a result, several US privacy advocates have therefore suggested alternative principles or rules… many of which, actually, have been part of EU data protection law since 1995.</p>
<p>So, <a href="https://twitter.com/hugoroyd/status/1246024493144911873">as promised</a>, here is:</p>
<p><strong>The GDPR as accidentally explained by people in the US who criticize the GDPR for its pitfalls, while calling for what’s actually in the GDPR</strong></p>
<p>If you have other examples to illustrate this, let me know so I can add them to this post. I may update this post from time to time, so <a href="https://hroy.eu/tags/gdprExplainedByUS/index.atom">subscribe to the feed</a> to get notified!</p>
<p><em>A short note:</em> My intention with this post is to help you, my reader from the US or elsewhere, understand better what’s actually in the GDPR. I have great respect for many of the people mentioned below (some of whom I consider or have considered personal heroes). I hope they are fine with a bit of teasing ;-)</p>
<h2 id="collection">1. The problem starts not with “data use” but with “data collection”</h2>
<h3 id="snowdenwu">Edward Snowden and Tim Wu (November 2019)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Snowden also directed some criticism at data privacy authorities that have tried to step up regulation on companies over how they handle user data. He said the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation […] “misplaces the problem.”</p>
<p>“The problem isn’t data protection, the problem is data collection,” Snowden said. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/04/edward-snowden-warns-about-data-collection-surveillance-at-web-summit.html">Source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Edward Snowden said this at the Web Summit: “I think GDPR is not the solution, but the problem is with data collection not data use. It gives a false sensation of reassurance.” What are your thoughts on this?</em></p>
<p>[Tim Wu:] I think he has a point…that’s what my criticism of GDPR is. It doesn’t actually stop anyone from doing anything. Collect all you want…and I think that’s where the problem starts. I think he’s onto something. <a href="https://gdpr.report/news/2019/11/18/privsecny-tim-wu-on-gdpr-and-data-privacy-practices-in-the-us/">Source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Edward Snowden and Tim Wu argue that regulations on data use are not sufficient to protect people. For them, a good regulation should start with data collection.</p>
<p>That is why, since 1995<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, EU data protection law regulates not only data use, but also the collection of personal data.</p>
<p>More specifically, the GDPR covers the processing of personal data. Processing is defined in the GDPR as “<em>any operation</em>” performed on personal data. <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32016R0679#d1e1489-1-1">Article 4(2) of the GDPR</a> includes data “<em>collection</em>” explicitly.</p>
<p><a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32016R0679#d1e1797-1-1">Article 5(1)</a> sets the principle of “<em>data minimisation</em>”, and also provides that personal data must be “<em>collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes</em>.”</p>
<p>If personal data is collected in breach of these rules, the company responsible for the infringement may be fined up to 4 % of their global annual turnover (or EUR 20,000,000 if higher). Authorities may also order the company to destroy the data collected in breach – regardless of whether the data was ever used or not.</p>
<h3 id="richard-stallman-april-2018-or-december-2019">Richard Stallman (April 2018 or December 2019)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>There are so many ways to use data to hurt people that the only safe database is the one that was never collected. Thus, instead of the EU’s approach (in the GDPR) of mainly regulating how personal data may be used, I propose a law to stop systems from collecting personal data.</p>
<p>The robust way to do that, the way that can’t be set aside at the whim of a government, is to require systems to be built so as not to collect data about persons. The basic principle is that a system must be designed not to collect certain data, if its basic function can be carried out without that data. Improving efficiency must explicitly not count as a justification for collecting more data. <a href="https://stallman.org/articles/real-privacy-laws.html">Source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Richard Stallman argues that laws must prohibit data collection if it is not necessary or not justified, and that systems must be designed not to collect certain data.</p>
<p>That is why, since 1995, EU data protection law regulates not only data use, but also the collection of personal data (see <a href="#snowdenwu">above</a>).</p>
<p>Moreover, since 2018, the GDPR has extended the set of rules with the principles of data protection “by design” and “by default”.</p>
<p><a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32016R0679#d1e3063-1-1">Article 25</a> provides, specifically, that systems must be designed to implement data minimisation effectively. In addition, technical and organisational measures must by default ensure that “<em>only personal data which are necessary for each specific purpose of the processing are processed. That obligation applies to the amount of personal data collected […].</em>”</p>
<p>One last bit: Richard Stallman argues that “improving efficiency” of a system must not be a justification for collecting personal data.</p>
<p><a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32016R0679#d1e1797-1-1">Article 5(1)</a> already provides that personal data must be “<em>collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes</em>.” Therefore, it seems that Richard Stallman’s interpretation of this principle means that “improving efficiency” may never be considered legitimate. Do you agree?</p>
<h2 id="consent">2. Individuals’ consent is not the right approach for privacy</h2>
<h3 id="maciej">Maciej Cegłowski (April 2020)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The European approach to privacy legislation has been to add layers of complexity, based on a kabuki dance of individual consent, where all that is needed are some strong legal limits on what data can be collected and how long it can be stored. <a href="https://twitter.com/Pinboard/status/1245699326522712064">Source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maciej argues that basing privacy legislation on individual consent is not the right approach and, instead, regulations should provide strong legal limits on data collection and data retention.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>That is why, since 1995, individual consent is only <em>one</em> among six legal bases that allow lawful collection of personal data. <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32016R0679#d1e1888-1-1">Article 6</a> of the GDPR requires at least one of six legal bases to be applicable. In many circumstances, “consent” is not considered as an adequate basis (e.g.&nbsp;in employee-employer relationships).</p>
<p><span id="consent-conditions">Even where consent may be considered adequate, it must fulfil strong conditions: to be a “<em>freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication</em>” of agreement expressed “<em>by a statement or by a clear affirmative action.</em>” (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32016R0679#d1e1489-1-1">Article 4(11)</a>)</span></p>
<p>If you thought that it’s sufficient to obtain consent to anything by checking a box to read and agree to the terms of service, or that merely browsing a website meant accepting cookies — you’ve been misled by the kabuki dance of people who wished the GDPR was centered around weak individual consent. In spite of GDPR strengthening conditions for consent, the online ad and tracking industry is still trying with their complex cookie banners and settings!</p>
<p>And, where sensitive data is concerned:</p>
<ul>
<li>collection is prohibited as a general rule,</li>
<li>unless explicit consent has been obtained and no EU or national laws rule out consent<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, or</li>
<li>unless one of the nine other exemptions listed in Article 9(2) applies (many of which require a EU or national law).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Additionally, the GDPR provides the principle of “<em>storage limitation</em>” in <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32016R0679#d1e1797-1-1">Article 5(1)(c)</a>.</p>
<p>Pursuant to this principle, personal data must be “<em>kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed</em>” i.e.&nbsp;when data is not necessary any more, it must be destroyed or anonymized.</p>
<p>The GDPR allows, however, for retaining data longer, in particular for archival, research or statistical purposes - subject to certain conditions (see Article 5 and Article 89 among others).</p></li>
<li><p>For the argument on data <a href="#collection">collection</a>, see above.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><small>To be entirely fair, and exhaustive — specific regulations may provide otherwise. The GDPR as its title suggests, is a “general” body of law. In certain circumstances, specific rules may contravene the general principles stated above. For instance, since 2009, the “EU cookie directive” (which modifies the “ePrivacy Directive” of 2002) requires consent as the <em>only</em> available basis for storing information or identifiers on a user’s device, or for accessing such stored information. There are, however, some exceptions, i.e.&nbsp;if necessary to provide services expressly requested…</small></p>
<h3 id="richard-stallman-april-2018-or-december-2019-1">Richard Stallman (April 2018 or December 2019)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The EU’s GDPR regulation is well-meant, but does not go very far. It will not deliver much privacy because its rules are too lax. They permit collecting any data if it is somehow useful to the system, and it is easy to come up with a way to make any particular data useful for something.</p>
<p>The GDPR makes much of requiring users (in some cases) to give consent for collection of their data, but that doesn’t do much good. System designers have become expert at manufacturing consent (to repurpose Chomsky’s phrase). Most users consent to a site’s terms without reading them; a company that required users to trade their first-born child got consent from plenty of users. Then again, when a system is crucial for modern life, like buses and trains, users ignore the terms because refusal of consent is too painful to consider.</p>
<p>To restore privacy, we must stop surveillance before it even asks for consent. <a href="https://stallman.org/articles/real-privacy-laws.html">Source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Richard Stallman argues that it is too easy to trick users into consenting to the collection of their data, and that is it too easy to claim that data is “somehow useful”. Instead, we should stop surveillance before it even asks for consent.</p>
<p>That is why, under EU data protection laws:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Where individual consent is an adequate legal basis (which is not always the case), the GDPR puts strong legal conditions on what valid consent requires (see <a href="#consent-conditions">above</a>), so it cannot be considered “easy” to trick people into giving consent.</p></li>
<li><p>Where data is collected and used in connection with a contract (e.g.&nbsp;terms and conditions of an online service), only data that is “<em>necessary</em>” may be lawfully processed.</p>
<p><a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32016R0679#d1e1888-1-1">Article 6</a> provides that processing in that context must be “<em>necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract</em>” — it is, therefore, not sufficient to consider that the data is “somehow useful”.</p></li>

Inspired by Docker and Git, it works on top of PostgreSQL and integrates seamlessly with anything that uses PostgreSQL. Our <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/explore" as="https://www.splitgraph.com/explore">data catalog</a> already includes over 40,000 datasets from government open data portals, all queryable via SQL.</p><p>The Splitgraph catalog classifies these datasets as <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/splitgraph-cloud/external-repositories">external repositories</a>. These are different from the default <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/concepts/repositories">Splitgraph repositories</a>, which are collections of <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/concepts/images">Splitgraph images</a>. Yet Splitgraph allows you to query them in the same way as you do Splitgraph images. For example, you can use SQL to query any repository or <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/ingesting-data/socrata#using-metabase-to-join-and-plot-data-from-multiple-data-portals" as="/docs/ingesting-data/socrata#using-metabase-to-join-and-plot-data-from-multiple-data-portals"><code>JOIN</code> between multiple of them</a>. Or you can use Splitfiles to <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/ingesting-data/socrata#splitfile" as="/docs/ingesting-data/socrata#splitfile">build reproducible datasets</a> from them. And every external repository includes an <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/splitgraph-cloud/publish-rest-api">auto-generated PostgREST API</a>.</p><p>External repositories allow Splitgraph Cloud to index live data without actually ingesting it. This way, you can use the catalog to discover live data. But you only need to ingest it when you're ready to query it, or snapshot it as part of a Splitgraph image.</p></section><section><h2 id="data-should-be-discoverable-and-composable">Data should be discoverable and composable</h2><p>Many services exist for cataloging data and making it discoverable. For example, <a href="https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/" as="https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/">Google Dataset Search</a> provides a nice interface for searching and discovering datasets (in fact, <a href="https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/search?query=opd%20crimes&amp;docid=jrM9a8yTUXMZaY1QAAAAAA%3D%3D" as="https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/search?query=opd%20crimes&amp;docid=jrM9a8yTUXMZaY1QAAAAAA%3D%3D">it even includes Splitgraph repositories</a>). The problem is, the data is fragmented and siloed across different data portals. It's nice to be able to search for data and download a CSV file. But most datasets are uninteresting in isolation. The real power comes from the ability to combine datasets and query them together.</p><p>Splitgraph does not only provide an index for discovering open data. It also provides the tools for composing open datasets together. For example, mounting the data from the <a href="https://data.cambridgema.gov/" as="https://data.cambridgema.gov">Cambridge</a> and <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/" as="https://data.cityofchicago.org">Chicago</a> data portals is as simple as running two commands:</p><pre><code metastring=""><span><span>$</span> <span>sgr <span>mount</span> socrata chicago -o <span>'{"domain": "data.cityofchicago.org"}'</span></span></span>
<span>Connecting to remote server...
Mounting Socrata domain...

warning: Requests made without an app_token will be subject to strict throttling limits.

</span></code></pre><p>At this point, all the datasets in these two data portals are available for querying. You can query them in isolation, or you can query them together. You can use a Splitfile, <code>sgr sql</code>, or any standard SQL client:</p><p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitgraph/splitgraph.com/master/content/docs/0300_ingesting-data/images/socrata/1_dbeaver_overview.png" as="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitgraph/splitgraph.com/master/content/docs/0300_ingesting-data/images/socrata/1_dbeaver_overview.png"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splitgraph/splitgraph.com/master/content/docs/0300_ingesting-data/images/socrata/1_dbeaver_overview.png" alt="DBeaver overview"></a></p><p>Here's how you can compare daily COVID cases in Chicago and Cambridge (from two separate data portals) with a standard <code>JOIN</code> query:</p><pre><code metastring=""><span>SELECT</span>

</code></pre><p>(For more details and in-depth instructions, see the <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/ingesting-data/socrata">Socrata FDW documentation</a>.)</p><p>Note that this is not limited to combining multiple public datasets. Often, the work of a data analyst includes combining internal data with public or licensed datasets from external vendors. The same semantics of "mounting" data in Splitgraph apply.</p></section><section><h2 id="mounting-vs-cloning-data">Mounting vs. Cloning Data</h2><p>With Splitgraph, there are two primary ways to ingest data: cloning it or mounting it.</p><p><a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/working-with-data/clone-vs-checkout">"Cloning" (and checking-out)</a> an image means downloading a versioned data image, which is a snapshot of a database comprised of delta-compressed diffs. For example, the result of running a Splitfile is an image.</p><p>"Mounting" means establishing a connection to a live data source. The term comes from the idea of "mounting" a filesystem. A mounted table uses a <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/ingesting-data/foreign-data-wrappers/introduction">foreign data wrapper</a> (FDW), and you don't ingest data from it until you query it. For example, the <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/ingesting-data/socrata">Socrata FDW</a> translates SQL queries to <a href="https://dev.socrata.com/docs/queries/" as="https://dev.socrata.com/docs/queries/">SoQL queries</a> and forwards them to the Socrata server.</p><p>(For more details on mounting data, FDWs and custom mount handlers, read our recent <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/blog/foreign-data-wrappers">"foreign data wrappers" blog post</a>.)</p></section><section><h2 id="mounting-data-in-splitgraph-cloud">Mounting data in Splitgraph Cloud</h2><p>Mounting is the key abstraction that allows Splitgraph Cloud to index external repositories with features like an auto-generated REST API. On the backend, the "query API" (a subject for a later post) uses the Splitgraph library and Socrata mount handler to mount repositories on demand. Then it exposes the mounted schemata to a customized version of <a href="http://postgrest.org/" as="http://postgrest.org/">PostgREST</a> which creates the API.</p><p>Separately, a periodic Airflow task queries the Socrata metadata API to discover and index over 40,000 repositories. Conveniently, the same Socrata software powers over 200 government open-data portals, so one mount handler provides a large catalog of useful live data.</p></section><section><h2 id="avoiding-the-pull-of-data-gravity">Avoiding the pull of Data Gravity</h2><p>Mounting is a powerful abstraction because it allows you to interact directly with upstream data sources, avoiding the need for ETL. In 2010, GE Engineer Dave McCrory coined the term "<a href="https://datagravitas.com/2010/12/07/data-gravity-in-the-clouds/" as="https://datagravitas.com/2010/12/07/data-gravity-in-the-clouds/">data gravity</a>." In his blog post, he observed that "data if large enough can be virtually impossible to move."</p><p>Splitgraph, as a data versioning solution, should work with all your data, not just the subsets of it that you can move. Traditional ETL tools force you to ingest or duplicate your data before you can interact with it. With Splitgraph, you only need to pull upstream data into your images at query time. This allows incremental adoption and quick experimentation; there is no need to move your data warehouse to start using Splitgraph. Instead, you only need to setup an FDW.</p><p>Note that the idea of data gravity applies to versioned data images (which you clone) as much as it does to upstream, live data (which you mount). What if you want to import only a subset of data from a large image? This is the use case for <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/large-datasets/layered-querying">layered querying</a>, which allows you to "check out" an image without downloading it. Instead, Splitgraph creates an FDW that queries only the "layers" of the image necessary to satisfy the query. You can think of layered querying like a mount handler for Splitgraph images.</p></section><section><h2 id="looking-to-the-future">Looking to the future</h2><p>At the moment, Splitgraph Cloud only uses the <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/ingesting-data/socrata">Socrata FDW</a> as a mount handler for external repositories, since the <a href="https://www.tylertech.com/products/socrata" as="https://www.tylertech.com/products/socrata">Socrata data platform</a> powers most government open-data portals.  In the future, it could use additional mount handlers to provide access to a wider array of upstream sources. To create an external repository, Splitgraph just needs a suitable FDW and a way to index the upstream data. For example, it's easy to imagine indexing Google BigQuery datasets. More interestingly, an on-premise version of Splitgraph could index private databases or data warehouses behind a firewall.</p><p>Our goal for Splitgraph is to make tools for data science as easy and pleasurable to use as tools for coding. That's why our main philosophy is to "stay out of the way." Mounting data is a great example of this philosophy in action. Why force your data warehouse to talk to Splitgraph, when Splitgraph can talk to your data warehouse?</p><p>In the meantime, make sure to <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/explore">explore data</a> on Splitgraph. If you know SQL, you can <a href="https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/getting-started/five-minute-demo">get started</a> in less than 10 minutes.</p></section></div></article></section></div>]]>

</blockquote>

<p>Growing up and going to school in the 1980s in the cold, sleepy town Ooty, weekends were not very exciting. One activity I looked forward to was poring over the weekly Saturday Sports Special edition that came with the English daily newspaper we got. It had two chess puzzles. And I used to spend a good hour or two that weekend trying to solve. All I remember was I hardly got the solutions right (the solutions were published in the next week’s edition).</p>

<p>My parents had taught me the rules of the game. But strategies, openings, notations were all alien to me. A decent book store, that stocked chess books, was 4 hours away. And chess books were prohibitively expensive. Over time, just studying the games that were published in the newspaper, I learned notations. My interest in chess didn’t wane much. I believe it’s primarily due to the coverage it had in the newspaper. Back then, Kasparov, Anand, and Topalov were my favorite players. But with no organized learning available, I remained extremely mediocre in chess.</p>

<p>Things changed when I moved to the US for my graduate studies in the early 2000s. The world of the internet opened up for me. I got introduced to online chess on Yahoo! Games. Not surprisingly, I lost most of the games. But a playing partner was a click away. My apartment mate at that time had prepared for competitive chess and taught me some common mental models (Don’t leave a lane open, control the center, etc).</p>

<p>In 2005, I made my biggest investment in learning Chess - I bought Fritz engine CD along with Kasparov’s course on Queen’s Gambit Declined. I had no idea about openings, much less about how to analyze games. And over the next few months, I studied Queen’s Gambit Declined opening line. For the very first time, I learned how GrandMasters think and play. It was pure <em>nerdgasm</em>.</p>

<p>A big challenge with Fritz was that there was no way to make it play at my level. I wanted to understand what kind of mistakes people who play at my level do, and how to fix it. But Fritz played only at a GM level. It did have some options to cripple its strength - but it was terrible. For eg: in a position of strength, it will sacrifice the queen. I improved but was still mediocre. I rarely played much for the next 8 years.</p>

<p>About 5 years ago, I discovered two amazing products - that positively impacted my chess-playing ability. One was <a href="https://lichess.org/">Lichess</a>, an online site to play chess. The experience here was significantly superior to the incumbent chess.com. And the other was <a href="https://stockfishchess.org/">Stockfish</a>, an open-source chess engine. Stockfish had solved my biggest gripe with Fritz - a realistic play by a slightly superior player than I. And so, I went about learning it better this time around. In no particular order, the following helped:</p>

<p><strong>Don’t start with rapid games</strong></p>

<p>I started playing games that had 10 minutes(or more) per player. I wrote down every single move. Both mine and the opponents. I also made it a point to remember why I made that move. What was I thinking?</p>

<p><strong>Analyze every game</strong></p>

<p>Lichess has native stockfish integration and allows you to analyze the game. I ran the engine and analyzed my mistakes. Lichess also allows you to play the alternate line for a few moves. That helped me visually see where my thinking on the moves-ahead went astray. Lichess categorizes errors into three buckets - inaccuracies, mistakes, blunders. My goal and metrics are to avoid blunders and reduce mistakes. I am still not good at reducing inaccuracies.</p>

<p><strong>Learn one opening line well</strong></p>

<p>Ok - two. One for white. Two for black. I told you earlier that I didn’t know the opening theory. Right? That’s true even now. My experience is that opening matters far less if you aren’t playing to be a GM. I always play Queen’s Gambit (d4 followed by c4) when I play white. Once you play enough times, you will know the typical variations that opponent could respond with. When I play black, if the opponent starts with d4, then I play Queen’s Gambit line. Well - technically the name of the opening changes depending on what white plays next: but I stick to the same set of first few moves. I learned and play <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_Defence">Sicilian defense</a> if White starts with e4.</p>

<p><strong>Master endgame</strong></p>

<p>I am still no good in this - but learning tradeoffs and strategies to win in the end game is where I spend a lot of time. Every good Chess master will tell you that the first thing you should learn is the endgame. It helps you learn to calculate - an extremely critical skill.</p>

<p><strong>Don’t optimize on solving puzzles</strong></p>

<p>Puzzles are what motivated me to learn chess. Puzzles are addictive and provide a quick high. Lichess has an amazing selection of puzzles. But, over the years of playing, I’ve come to realize that the learnings from puzzles quickly plateau off. A typical puzzle is a mate in 2 or mate in 3. You know that there is a (non) obvious sac (sacrifice) that should get you the win. The problem is, in real play, no one will pause you at that board position and tell you that there is a mate in 2. So, positional analysis is something that you should get good at. Puzzles, unfortunately, don’t go much further along that path.</p>

<p><strong>Learn from GM games: kibitz</strong></p>

<p>Instead of puzzles, the biggest learning for me has come from watching Grandmaster games. Kibitzing is the practice of making comments on a chess game. Post-mortem of the game. Many grandmasters and chess experts kibitz on famous games. Read the analysis to understand what the experts say about the specific line and learn to internalize it. These days, there are several great youtube channels. Heck - Magnus Carlsen is on YouTube.</p>

<p><strong>Learn from GM games: take a side</strong></p>

<p>For a deeper study, I tried doing this: On a game that has good kibitz - I take one side. I replay the game until say move 10 or 15. Then, I think what move should be played: I play - and I check what move was played. And I play the opponent’s move. Rinse. Repeat. The impact was immense. But it was very time consuming and I was clearly out of my league. If there is one thing I wish I had done more, it will be this.</p>

<p><strong>Rapid games</strong></p>

<p>Over time, once I got better, I started playing rapid games. And these days, I only play rapid games. I still analyze most of my games. I am not as good at rapid games as I am at longer timed games - but I now understand my limitations better and enjoy the game.</p>

<p><strong>Fitness</strong></p>

<p>I learned not to neglect mental and physical health. Chess puts serious pressure on mental thinking. Having a clear head is very important. And contrary to the belief that chess is just a mind game, I’ve seen myself perspiring and heartbeats racing during games. I believe that if you are not in great physical and mental shape, improving in chess is probably extremely hard. As I worked on improving my physical and mental shape, I saw myself getting better at playing chess.</p>

<p><strong>What didn’t work: blindfold matches</strong></p>

<p>Blindfold matches are where the players play without a chessboard. They just tell the moves - and for someone watching it, its pure magic. Unfortunately, my visual imagination is terrible and I could never play a blindfold match.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>I believe Chess is a skill and can be mastered. Maybe, one needs to have something special to become a GM. Maybe not. But to be good and enjoy playing chess - it is defintely achievable.</p>

<p>I thought I will steer away from telling how much I improved in the game - but then - why not? Over 3 years, I improved my ratings by about 800 to 1000 points.</p>

<p><em>Motivation to writing this article</em></p>

<p>I read <a href="https://twitter.com/getify/status/1207820907642839040">this thread</a> at the start of the year and I could relate to it a lot. The author shares his journey to get better at Table Tennis.</p>

July 8, 2020 | https://secapps.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-pown-apps/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://secapps.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-pown-apps/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Run SecApps Suite directly from your desktop with the power of pown</p></div><p><img src="https://secapps.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-pown-apps/image10.png"></p></div><div><p><a href="https://pownjs.com/">Pown</a> is part of our open-source initiative. It is a framework of tools we use as part of our applications and service offering. Today we will learn how to install pown and the <a href="https://github.com/pownjs/pown-apps">Pown Apps</a> to access <a href="https://secapps.com/market/suite">SecApps Suite</a> and the rest of the SecApps tools directly from your desktop. With Pown Apps you can do many security testing activities without the need to install additional software, from actively intercepting HTTP traffic with the built proxy, to instrumenting Google Chrome and much more.</p>
<p><img src="https://secapps.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-pown-apps/image10.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>Pown is written in JavaScript and utilises npm as its internal package management system. For this reason you need an environment with Nodejs already installed. Detailed instructions on how to install Nodejs can be found <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s install pown globally so that we can use it in all future projects. We need the following command for this:</p>
<pre><code>$ npm install -g pown</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://secapps.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-pown-apps/image8.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In this tutorial we will use the desktop apps which need to be installed as well. The apps are desktop tools and come with many advanced features that take more space and for these reasons they are not part of the default distribution.</p>
<p>To install the apps we need to use the <code>modules</code> sub-command like this:</p>
<pre><code>$ pown modules install @pown/apps</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://secapps.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-pown-apps/image13.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Now we have everything ready to get started.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use">How to Use</h2>
<p>To list all apps use the <code>pown apps</code> command. Notice that you can find all SecApps tools as sub-commands. For example, the dashboard is available with <code>pown apps dashboard</code> command.</p>
<p><img src="https://secapps.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-pown-apps/image10.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="intercepting-traffic-as-a-http-proxy">Intercepting Traffic as a HTTP Proxy</h3>
<p>In this example we can use <a href="https://secapps.com/market/httpview">HTTPView</a> as a standard proxy. Here is how to do it. First we need to launch httpview:</p>
<pre><code>$ pown apps httpview</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://secapps.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-pown-apps/image6.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Click the record button to get the configuration dropdown. Click the Feed icon. Select only “Proxy Extension”. Ensure that the feed URI is similar to this: <code>internal://extension?flavour=proxy&amp;port=9191</code>. This instructs the tool to capture traffic on port 9191 localhost.</p>
<p><img src="https://secapps.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-pown-apps/image9.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Press “Start Recording” to start intercepting.</p>
<p>In this example, we will configure curl to use a proxy server.</p>
<pre><code>$ <span>export</span> http_proxy=http://localhost:9191
$ <span>export</span> https_proxy=http://localhost:9191
$ curl https://secapps.com -k</code></pre>
<p>If the configuration was successful you should see the request from curl getting recorded in the HTTPView window as seen here.</p>
<p><img src="https://secapps.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-pown-apps/image1.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="intercepting-traffic-with-the-chrome-debug-protocol">Intercepting Traffic with the Chrome Debug Protocol</h3>
<p>At this point, pentesers might decide to use this method with their favourite browser just like they do with other proxy tools. But wait a second! We have a better method, one that directly taps into the networking stack of Chrome itself benefiting from this browser powerhouse.</p>
<p>Open httpview again if you don’t have it up and running:</p>
<pre><code>$ pown apps httpview</code></pre>
<p>This time we will use the “Chrome Debug” builtin feed. The url for the feed is similar to this: <code>internal://extension?flavour=cdb&amp;port=9223</code>. Notice that the main difference between this URI and the previous URI is the flavour parameter.</p>
<p><img src="https://secapps.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-pown-apps/image11.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Before we start recording, we must launch chrome with the correct debug protocol port. We have some pre-configured options in the application menu. Select the one matching the port in the feed URI, i.e. <code>9223</code> as per the example we used earlier.</p>
<p><img src="https://secapps.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-pown-apps/image12.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You should see a brand new instance of Google Chrome ready to go. Ensure that the “Chrome Debug” feed is selected. Press the “Start Recording” button. Now try to access some web sites. You will see the requests are successfully captured in HTTPView ready for our inspection.</p>
<p><img src="https://secapps.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-pown-apps/image7.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This method is much better than using proxies because it is fast, secure and ultimately can deal with any type of transport protocol that is supported by the browser, which basically means everything that is even considered cutting edge.</p>
<h3 id="fuzzing-http-requests">Fuzzing HTTP Requests</h3>
<p>There is so much more we can do. Let’s do a quick fuzz testing exercise with the <a href="https://secapps.com/market/fuzzer">Fuzzer</a>. We start from pown again:</p>
<pre><code>$ pown apps fuzzer</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://secapps.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-pown-apps/image3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>With the app up and running, let’s configure a basic counter generator. This is just for demonstration purposes. In a real scenario we will be spending more time configuring the tool to get the result that we need.</p>
<p><img src="https://secapps.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-pown-apps/image2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Start by typing “counter” at the end of the URL bar. Select the Counter generator. Ensure that the <code>To</code> field is set to <code>100</code>. Press the play button. You will start getting results immediately.</p>
<p><img src="https://secapps.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-pown-apps/image4.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="advanced-http-client">Advanced HTTP Client</h3>
<p>In this use-case we will use <a href="https://secapps.com/market/rest">Rest</a> to play with HTTP requests. Start by launch rest. You can either do that from the command line like the other tools or if you have one of the Pown Apps already running you can select it from the application menu.</p>
<p><img src="https://secapps.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-pown-apps/image5.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Configure the request the same you would do with the online version of the tool. Submit the request and repeat the process as much as required.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>SecApps, Pown and Pown Apps provide a powerful combination of security capabilities. You benefit from the scriptable nature of Pown combined it with the ease of use of Pown Apps. With little practice everything is possible.</p>

<p>Generics are a great feature of Swift that allow you to generalize and reuse code in ways that would not be possible otherwise.</p>
<p>They are also a quite advanced feature and become a roadblock for many developers. The iOS SDK uses generic extensively, something that is especially true in <a href="https://matteomanferdini.com/swiftui/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SwiftUI</a>.</p>
<p>In this article, I will show why generics exist and how to use them in your apps.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="understanding-generics">You can’t understand generics until you find concrete examples that require them</h2>
<p>The Swift standard library and all frameworks in Apple SDKs make heavy use of generics.</p>
<p>Luckily, the type inference performed by the Swift compiler often hides generic behind familiar code. You can go pretty far building your iOS apps without understanding generics or knowing they even exist.</p>
<p>But at some point, you are bound to bump into them.</p>
<p>As I will see you in this article, you won’t be able to reuse parts of your code unless you master Swift generics. Moreover, they are fundamental for <a href="https://matteomanferdini.com/protocol-oriented-programming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">protocol-oriented programming</a>, especially to design a <a href="https://matteomanferdini.com/network-requests-rest-apis-ios-swift/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">solid networking layer</a> in your apps.</p>
<p>In my experience, my students often have a hard time wrapping their heads around Swift generics. The problem is that it’s hard to see why generics are useful until you reach the limitations of code without generics.</p>
<p>You usually need some experience as a developer to get to that point. In the end, beginners and even intermediate iOS developers can make apps without using generics if they accept some repetition in their code.</p>
<p>I have seen many articles explaining what generics are straight away, showing you how to use them from the start. The problem I find in that approach is that it only teaches you how generics work in the language.</p>
<p>What you don’t learn is how to recognize the instances in which your code can benefit from using them.</p>
<p>So, here, I will follow the opposite approach. I will start with simple, specific code and generalize it until we get to the point where we need generics.</p>
<h2 id="type-inference">Most of the code you write uses generics invisibly to make your life simpler</h2>
<p>As an example, let’s build a couple of screens for a social network app like Facebook or Meetup, where people can join events. <a href="https://github.com/matteom/Events" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">You can get the full Xcode project on GitHub</a>.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>As you can see, these two screens look pretty similar. While they display different information, their structure is the same.</p>
<p>Any non-trivial app you build will have code that you want to reuse for different purposes.</p>
<p>Sometimes, it is evident, like in the two app screens above. But that can happen in any part of your code, even the ones that don’t have a clear visual representation.</p>
<p>Let’s start defining some data we can use to fill our app’s interfaces. Such data often comes in JSON format from a remote API, so it’s a good practice to store some of it in .json files in your Xcode project for testing purposes.</p><!-- Crayon Syntax Highlighter v_2.7.2_beta -->

<p>This is a first example of code that invisibly uses Swift generics.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>How 
			<span id="crayon-5f093d48481bd502064583"><span><span>Decodable</span></span></span> uses generics is quite complicated, and you can dig you into it after reading this article if you want.</p>

			<span id="crayon-5f093d48481c1658242510"><span><span>Codable</span></span></span> protocols use generics to make something quite complicated, like the decoding and encoding of JSON data, look simple in your code.</p>
<h2 id="return-type">Generalizing the return type of methods</h2>
<p>We now want to decode our two JSON files and have data ready to test the interface we will build.</p>
<p>That’s pretty straightforward. All we have to do is read the data in each file and feed it to a

<p>We have a lot of duplicated code, so we want to generalize and reuse it as much as possible.</p>
<p>It’s easy to generalize the first line of both methods. All we need is a 
			<span id="crayon-5f093d48481cc674146899"><span><span>String</span></span></span> parameter for the name of each file. The following lines are identical, so we don’t have any problem there.</p>
<p>But the last line it’s not easy to generalize. There, we specify which model type to use, which is also the return type of our methods, i.e., [Event] and [Person].</p>
<p>But how can we generalize the return type of a method?</p>
<p>Swift offers the 
			<span id="crayon-5f093d48481d0160762240"><span><span>Any</span></span></span> type that represents, well, any type. We can try and use that to have a single method that loads both events and participants, that’s not a great solution.</p><!-- Crayon Syntax Highlighter v_2.7.2_beta -->

<p>Here, we try to decode the file using either model types. If we get some data back, then it was the correct type. Otherwise, we try the next one.</p>
<p>The code above works, but it has several problems.</p>
<ul>
<li>We have to expand the conditional statement whenever we add a new decodable model type to our app. (If you are curious, that violates the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open%E2%80%93closed_principle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open-closed principle</a>).</li>
<li>Using 
			<span id="crayon-5f093d48481da047574056"><span><span>Any</span></span></span> as a return type erases the type information. Every time we call the 
			<span id="crayon-5f093d48481dd946357031"><span><span>readFile</span><span>(</span><span>named</span><span>:</span><span>)</span></span></span>, we have to cast its result to our desired type using either 
			<span id="crayon-5f093d48481e0191348234"><span><span>as</span><span>?</span></span></span> or 
			<span id="crayon-5f093d48481e2329597617"><span><span>as</span><span>!</span></span></span>.</li>
<li>The compiler cannot help us. We can cast the result of 
			<span id="crayon-5f093d48481e5446654562"><span><span>readFile</span><span>(</span><span>named</span><span>:</span><span>)</span></span></span> to any type whatsoever. If we make a mistake, we will discover it only when our app crashes (probably, in the hands of a user).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="generic-functions">Using Swift generics to parametrize types in functions</h2>
<p>We have finally got to the limits of traditional approaches.</p>
<p>In our 
			<span id="crayon-5f093d48481e9480193852"><span><span>readFile</span><span>(</span><span>named</span><span>:</span><span>)</span></span></span>, we don’t only need a parameter for a <b>value</b>, i.e., the name of the file to open, but also for a <b>type</b>, i.e., the return type of the method.</p>
<p>We want to be able to say whether the type returned by 
			<span id="crayon-5f093d48481ec108887611"><span><span>readFile</span><span>(</span><span>named</span><span>:</span><span>)</span></span></span> is 
			<span id="crayon-5f093d48481ef609016599"><span><span>[</span><span>Event</span><span>]</span></span></span> or 
			<span id="crayon-5f093d48481f1695618867"><span><span>[</span><span>Person</span><span>]</span></span></span>, like we do for normal parameters.</p>
<p>There is obviously a way of doing that. We are already passing a type parameter to the 
			<span id="crayon-5f093d48481f4538792860"><span><span>decode</span><span>(</span><span>_</span><span>:</span><span>from</span><span>:</span><span>)</span></span></span> method of 
			<span id="crayon-5f093d48481f7385438677"><span><span>JSONDecoder</span></span></span>.</p>
<p>And that’s, in fact, a generic. Again, we are using generics even if you don’t know what they are yet. But now, we see what generics are: they allow us to also use types as parameters and not just values.</p>
<p>In Swift, you declare generics immediately after the name of a function using angular brackets.</p><!-- Crayon Syntax Highlighter v_2.7.2_beta -->

<p>(This code still does not compile. We will see why in a moment.)</p>
<p>Some developers name their generics using single letters, like 
			<span id="crayon-5f093d48481ff380640739"><span><span>T</span></span></span>, 
			<span id="crayon-5f093d4848202911810203"><span><span>U</span></span></span>, etc., but I find that too hard to read.</p>
<p>Try to use a meaningful name whenever possible, which is also the approach of the Swift standard library. In this case, this method deals with model types, so 
			<span id="crayon-5f093d4848205241551562"><span><span>ModelType</span></span></span> is a better name than just 
			<span id="crayon-5f093d4848207763426932"><span><span>M</span></span></span>.</p>
<p>Once you declare a generic in a method, you can use it as:</p>
<ul>
<li>the return type (our case);</li>
<li>the type of any parameter;</li>
<li>the type of any local constant/variable;</li>
<li>the parameter of another generic function.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our

<p>You can see that in the two calls to 
			<span id="crayon-5f093d484820e831933349"><span><span>readFile</span><span>(</span><span>named</span><span>:</span><span>)</span></span></span>. There, we don’t need type casting anymore. The

<h3><span id="Https_Redirection_middleware"></span>Https Redirection middleware<span></span></h3>



<p>In asp.net core <a href="https://pradeeploganathan.com/http/https/">https </a>is enabled by default. The <a aria-label="HttpsRedirection middleware class  (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/aspnet/BasicMiddleware/blob/354cb18d6304b24063d460e0a41c6c1d51ea4000/src/Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpsPolicy/HttpsRedirectionMiddleware.cs#L139" target="_blank">HttpsRedirection middleware class </a>provides the necessary functionality to enforce redirection from http to https. The UseHttpsRedirection extension method in startup is used to enforce this. This extension method issues a 307 temporary redirect response by default. It then uses the configured https port to specify the redirection endpoint. If the https port is not specified in code, this class will get the https port from HTTPS_PORT environment variable or the IServerAddress feature. If either of them is not specified, then the middleware will log a warning and will not redirect. The code below shows an example of adding the https redirection middleware to the services collection and using it. The code below checks the environment and sets a permanent redirect to the HTTPS endpoint in production and a temporary redirect in development environment.</p>



<p><figcaption>Adding HTTPRedirection</figcaption></p>



<h3><span id="Development_certificates"></span>Development certificates<span></span></h3>



<p>To enable the use of HTTPS in the development environment, .net core provides a global tool that creates a self-signed certificate on the local environment. The following command can install this tool</p>



<blockquote><p>dotnet tool install –global dotnet-dev-certs</p></blockquote>



<p>The tool can now be used to generate self-signed certificates with the following command. The -ep flag signifies the export path where the certificate will be exported and the -p flag signifies the password required to generate the certificate. We can use the –trust option to trust the certificate generated.</p>



<blockquote><p>dotnet dev-certs https -ep &lt;path_to_certficate&gt;/certificate.pfx -p &lt;certificate_password&gt; </p><p>dotnet dev-certs https –trust</p></blockquote>



<p>On Linux/Mac OS we can use OpenSSL to generate the certificate for the local environment. Trusting the certificate is however a much more involved process depending on the version and flavor of the Linux OS.</p>



<blockquote><p>openssl req -new -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout dev-certificate.key -out dev-certificate.cer -days 365 -subj /CN=localhost<br>openssl pkcs12 -export -out dev-certificate.pfx -inkey dev-certificate.key -in dev-certificate.cer</p></blockquote>



<p>The certificate path can be specified using the environmental variable  ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Path   &amp; the password using environment variable ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Password </p>



<h3><span id="Kestrel_as_edge_server"></span>Kestrel as edge server<span></span></h3>



<p>Kestrel can be deployed either as an edge server or with a reverse proxy such as IIS, NGINIX or Apache.</p>



<figure><img src="https://pradeeploganathan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Kestrel.png" alt="" srcset="https://pradeeploganathan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Kestrel.png 657w, https://pradeeploganathan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Kestrel-300x115.png 300w, https://pradeeploganathan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Kestrel-610x234.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 657px) 100vw, 657px" data-lazy-srcset="https://pradeeploganathan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Kestrel.png 657w, https://pradeeploganathan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Kestrel-300x115.png 300w, https://pradeeploganathan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Kestrel-610x234.png 610w" data-lazy-src="https://pradeeploganathan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Kestrel.png?is-pending-load=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>Kestrel deployment scenarios</figcaption></figure>



<p>When Kestrel is deployed as a public facing edge server it can be configured to use https and a specific certificate and port using the below code</p>



<p><figcaption>Configuring Kestrel as edge server</figcaption></p>



<h3><span id="Terminating_TLS_at_a_Reverse_proxy"></span>Terminating TLS at a Reverse proxy<span></span></h3>



<p>If a reverse proxy such as Apache or NGNIX is used, then the forwarded headers middleware should be configured and setup before calling the Https redirection middleware. The forwarded headers middleware should set the X-Forwarded-Proto to https. This will enable https offloading at the proxy and a plain http call to the web application with a guarantee that the original call was made over a secure https channel. This is critical especially in non-IIS scenarios such as NGINIX or Apache.  See the code below to configure the forwarded headers middleware</p>



<p><figcaption>Forwarded headers from a reverse proxy</figcaption></p>



<h3><span id="HTTPS_in_containerized_environment"></span>HTTPS in containerized environment<span></span></h3>



<p>In a containerized environment an option is to generate the certificates as part of container creation or startup and specify the same in the docker compose file. The environment files can then be used to configure the necessary environment variables as below</p>



<p><figcaption>Using certificates in a docker volume </figcaption></p>



<p>The corresponding environment files to specify the necessary environment variables are below</p>



<p><figcaption>using environment variables in docker to specify certificate path</figcaption></p>



<h3><span id="HTTPS_strict_transport_security_(HSTS)"></span>HTTPS strict transport security (HSTS)<span></span></h3>



<p>Using HTTPS redirection still presents a minor security risk as the user can make an initial request using HTTP before being redirected to a secure HTTPS connection. To overcome this the HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) Protocol adds a header in responses indicating that only HTTPS should be used when sending requests to the web endpoint. Once an HSTS header has been received, clients that support the HSTS protocol will always send requests to the application using HTTPS even if the user specifies an HTTP URL. In .NET Core 3.1, We can add the HSTS middleware to the pipeline as below.</p>



<p><figcaption>Adding HSTS</figcaption></p>



<p>In the above code we are specifying HSTS preload to be set to true. <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.chromium.org/hsts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HSTS preloading</a> is a function built into the browser whereby a global list of hosts enforces the use of HTTPS ONLY on their site. The domains are hard coded into the browser, which avoids the initial insecure request and ensures that only HTTPS is used. Another crucial point that trips up a lot of folks is that the HSTS header is not set even if you specify the use of HSTS middleware for localhost and the loopback address for IPV6 and IPV4. This is because the ExcludeHosts parameter by default excludes these addresses.</p>



<p>In summary .NET core provides a lot of ways to configure https for web applications with Kestrel as an edge server or through SSL offloading/TLS termination. It also provides for options to configure the same through code or through configuration or using a docker compose file.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Totally automatic email not partial: Beware false Idols. If you are a struggling ecommerce retailer and you see the promise of something being able to make your email marketing “automatic”, how relieved you’d be that you can now include this enormously positive marketing aspect to your efforts. But, many young entrepreneurs falsely believe they are incorporating it when, in reality, they have been sold a pup. Often they don’t have the time or lack of money to invest in email marketing. This prohibits them from making it a high priority on their agenda. Regretfully, without awareness of what else is available, this often leads to the wrong download. Beware that legally, as long as some part of the process is done for you, unscrupulous vendors can use the expression without fearing being reproached. Indeed we have seen examples where clients have been told that a fully automatic system is “impossible”, or that there is “nothing like that out there”. That just isn’t true! We can only imagine how gutted the down-hearted retailer is when what they thought was “automatic” turns out to be just a tiny bit of it, typically when its sent. We despise this practise, and fear how many retailers have gone to the wall as a consequence of such a low trick. Fear not!</p><p>Let us, therefore, set the record straight and introduce you to SwiftERM. It is <span>100% automatic email marketing software for ecommerce</span>. Once installed you never need to touch it, and everything about it is automatic. But it doesn’t stand in isolation. We appreciate we are part of <a href="https://www.swifterm.com/a-profitable-and-necessary-addition-to-your-marketing-mix/">the marketing mix</a>, likewise, a fully comprehensive program applied by the most successful and comprehensive companies in the world would also be remiss to overlook such a powerful addition to complement their existing initiatives. Further details on the distinction we offer between typical email campaigns and what SwiftERM brings to the fold are made in our article on “How to offend your customers”,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.swifterm.com/how-to-offend-your-customers-and-alienate-people/">here</a>.</p><p>First, let us explain the mechanics of this 100% automated email marketing facility. Once you have registered and installed the plugin onto your platform it requires no human input whatsoever, at any stage. You can walk away and do whatever else you need to do forever, reassured that it works perpetually without any need of supervision, regulation, steering or overseeing. Logging in to enjoy reading the stats is indeed an option too. We are careful to emphasise that while it offers, what to some, is a luxury of the <em>release of time</em> otherwise unavailable, we only consider ourselves a part of the marketing mix, and indeed we advocate that we are run alongside standard email software like Mailchimp.</p><p>SwiftERM uses predictive analytics on the buying history and each individual visitors impressions, typically 100 per visit to your site, to calculate the highest buying propensity (a posh way of saying the most likely to be bought) of every SKU on your platform available for sale. It then populates a <a href="https://www.swifterm.com/swifterm-predictive-analytics-for-ecommerce-stylesheet/">stylesheet</a> with details of those products, and sends it, capturing otherwise missed opportunities. There are different varieties of <a href="https://www.adspeed.com/Knowledges/10/Ad-Metrics/Gross-Impression-Unique-Impression.html">impressions</a>, but we capture them all. Impressions are usually captured for advertising purposes to calculate advertising rates. Where you use cookies on your site, they can be used to identify what your existing consumers are looking at, how long for, how many times etc. Combined with what they then buy, or place in their basket, gives a detailed insight to that individual’s personality, buying habits, and but for a little persuasion in the form of an email, will make the purchase with you rather than anyone else.</p><p>So each and every email we send out is unique and personal to each individual consumer on your database. The power of the facility is reflected in certain phenomena SwiftERM users enjoy: firstly the typical ROI when employed is in the thousands, detailed on our statistics page <a href="https://www.swifterm.com/statistics-showing-return-on-investment/">here</a>. An example would be that the average uplift in turnover for the last 5 years for our users has been <strong>10.5%</strong>. Some verticals do far better, Petfoods, for example, do over 15% on average, and Vintners likewise. Secondly, as the products are selected for each consumer based on their own actions, the typically massive returns rate is smashed down to almost negligible, i.e. because these products are something they prefer, they want to keep them. Finally, and bizarrely, the rate of suppressions (the number of people who unsubscribe from your emails) is slashed to over half that of promotional emails software. If you start the year with 10,000 people on your database, chances are you’re going to have kept all of them by the end of it. It is possible under GDPR rules to allow the consumer the preference to keep receiving SwiftERM emails even if they unsubscribe from their flashy provocative cousin.</p><p>This is just a taster to explain there is such a thing as totally automatic, and SwiftERM is it. However, because we love what we do, and understand and respect everyone and their dog out there are saying platitudes many fall for, we are delighted to provide our system for FREE to everyone who wants to try it. You can check out everything we say first without buying in, and without fear of any cost whatsoever. Likewise, we have such confidence in the system we don’t need to tie people into a term contract they must subscribe to. You can come and go whenever you like without fear of any penalty whatsoever. Finally, we also throw in – critical for young start-ups, if it doesn’t make you at least 4x the potential cost,&nbsp;the trial continues for free until it does. Our costs are on a tiered system dependant on the number of people on your database, published <a href="https://www.swifterm.com/email-marketing-software-for-ecommerce/">here.</a></p><p>We look forward to welcoming you on board.</p><p>SwiftERM is certified Microsoft Partner MPN ID&nbsp;6197468.</p></div></div>]]>

<div>
<p>… or it took a while to get here 😀</p>
<h4>Origins</h4>
<p>This project is fully lead by Willy/Lamers with my minor participation.</p>
<p>It all started with an idea to create the most convenient modern USB mouse adapter for as many retro machines as possible.</p>
<p>Willy started working on it in his spare-time six years ago. The project goals were simple.</p>
<ul><li>small, smooth and not expensive design</li><li>reliable</li><li>quadrature encoder mouse support</li><li>easy to use and maintain</li><li>easy to personalize/configure</li><li>quick firmware upgrade</li></ul>
<p>The project came about quite quickly and Willy ordered the first batch. Unfortunately, It met almost all conditions but one – reliability. The design was based on the FTDI Vinculum2 chip. Although the layout is not bad, the toolchain is terribly underdeveloped (at least it was at that time). There were memory leaks all over the place, debugging was almost impossible, mainly due to the processor for which there is no documentation. In addition, the configuration saved from time to time destroyed the config itself …<br>It was too much. The project has been abandoned. If you are a strong-willed person you can try it yourself. All work that was done on it, is accessible <a href="http://jil.guru/16bit/projects/abbannddonnedd/hid2st.rar">HERE</a>. You can view or use it if you have the energy to break through the unfinished, wrong and undocumented code</p>
<h4>The new hope</h4>
<p>In the meantime, the design was repeatedly unearthed from a drawer, but unfortunately without much effect. Some of the original goals turned out to be impossible to fulfill.</p>
<p>Up to <a href="http://sillyventure.eu/pl/">Silly Venture 2019</a> which turned out to be a breakthrough. the demand for a functional Atari ST adapter turned out to be quite large. The mouSTer project was born.</p>
<p>The project received a new name “The mouSTer” and <a href="http://www.ha.art.pl/wydawnictwo/autorzy/5334-piotr-kroll-mietniowski.html">Kroll</a> (translator required) became its godfather. I hope he doesn’t mind :). Kroll is the best tester of an Atari equipment around.</p>
<p>The project has gained a new shape and new strengths.</p>
<p>Some early prototype pics:</p>

<p>At the moment, the current size has been reduced to a minimum – DB9 plug size + USB-A socket</p>
<p>Below some highlights:</p>
<ul><li>it works with every mouse and with every Game USB pad</li><li>PS4 pad support – USB </li><li>config via USB flash drive – INI file + default config</li><li>config transfer via USB flash drive</li><li>firmware upgrade via USB flash drive (takes 3 seconds, of which 2 seconds is the time the bootloader needs to recognize the flash drive)</li><li>tested with flash drives from 32MB to 32GB</li><li>mouse emulation mode defaults – Amiga, Atari ST, joystick/gamepad</li></ul>
<h4>Current state</h4>
<p>Finally, after a few months of testing in laboratory conditions, everything works rock-solid. Changing the firmware and configuration works confidently and is trouble-free.</p>

<p><br>What’s left to be done<mark id="annotation-text-c72ef339-eeed-462d-a5c9-61b4fb1fb90d"></mark>:</p>
<ul><li>making a test batch in the target size – closing the plant due to COVID19 did not help at all 🙁</li><li>configuration file tuning</li><li>creating a poly-urethane case</li><li>adding config options for Commodore 64/128, Spectrum, and every other possible retro machine.</li><li>PS4 pad full support for all platforms.</li><li>8-bit Atari will receive a special mode that will cover all the PS4 pad functions, mouse and other HID class devices</li><li>testing, testing, testing …</li></ul>
<p><strong>What has to be highlighted is that mouSTer started as an ATARI add-on but it aims to be multi-platform adapter!!</strong></p>

		<p>I have a confession to make: I can’t eat spicy food.</p>
<p>As a person of South Asian descent, it’s incongruous, I know. I’m left adrift with the certain type of person who orders food Indian spicy. While my dining companions make an effort to signal their identity as capsaicin-consuming, I wonder if I should order my food white-guy mild. It’s not like I don’t enjoy the stinging heat or the bleary-eyed trip of something made extra hot—it’s just that I can’t digest it.</p>
<div id="attachment_69825"><p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/contingentmagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMAGE03.jpg?resize=771%2C1124&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="771" height="1124" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/contingentmagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMAGE03-scaled.jpg?resize=771%2C1124&amp;ssl=1 771w, https://i2.wp.com/contingentmagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMAGE03-scaled.jpg?resize=336%2C490&amp;ssl=1 336w, https://i2.wp.com/contingentmagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMAGE03-scaled.jpg?w=1756&amp;ssl=1 1756w, https://i2.wp.com/contingentmagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMAGE03-scaled.jpg?w=1542&amp;ssl=1 1542w" sizes="(max-width: 771px) 100vw, 771px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p><p>Sir Joseph Paxton, <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Paxton%27s_Magazine_of_Botany_and_Register_of_Flowering_Plants_(1838)_(14764888245).jpg">“Capsicum ustulatum,”</a> Paxton’s Magazine of Botany and Register of Flowering Plants, 1838.</p></div>
<p>I blame dysentery. A bout of it when I was three left two lasting effects on my life: it introduced me to my oldest friendship through a circuitous game of chance (a story for another time), and it rendered my digestive system subject to pains that feel like someone is reaching into me to wring out my guts like wet laundry.</p>
<p>I’m often told by well-meaning people how much they love Indian food, and then asked if I cook it at home. I never know quite how to respond. Does roti count—especially if it’s the buss-up shut <i>parāthā</i> of Trinidad? Where do Bihari staples like <i>sattū</i> (ground-up roasted gram) or <i>chōkha</i> (mashed and roasted eggplant) fit into this understanding? But their question isn’t an interrogation of the narrowness of national cuisines. Their question isn’t a question at all—it’s a chance to share. The woman who loves her corner Indian restaurant. The man who just took an Indian-cooking class through adult education. The reasons are usually the same: they love the heat, the fieriness, the spice.</p>
<p>All the things I’m doomed to avoid.</p>

<p>This all had me wondering: what’s Indian food without the heat? The historian in me has an answer: spiciness is historically contingent. In 1492, Columbus sailed the ocean blue and the entire world changed: slavery, war, disease, colonization, and an immense transfer of wealth to Europe. And with that wealth too came New World nightshades—potatoes, tomatoes, tobacco, peppers of all kinds. It took some time for these fruits and vegetables to plant themselves into European cuisine. The tomato, for example, wasn’t widely used in Italian cuisine until the eighteenth century.<span id="easy-footnote-1-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-69820" title="David Gentilecore, <i>Pomodoro! A History of the Tomato in Italy</i> (New York: Columbia University Press, 2010), 45–68."><sup>1</sup></a></span> But what about food further out from Europe? What about India?</p>
<p>Soon after Columbus’ first expedition, the treaties of Tordesillas and Saragossa divided the oceans of the newly-known world. The Portuguese effectively took the Atlantic and Indian oceans, while the Spanish took the Pacific. With that, the Portuguese established forts and trading posts along India’s Malabar coast. In time, <i>aloo</i> (potato), <i>tamātar</i> (tomato), and <i>mirchī</i> (chilies) were available on the western coast of the Indian subcontinent. Later, the English set up their first trading posts in India in the eastern Gangetic plain, bringing these same staples into North India.<span id="easy-footnote-2-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-2-69820" title="K.T. Achaya, <i>Indian Food: A Historical Companion</i> (Delhi: Oxford University Press, 1998), 225–27."><sup>2</sup></a></span></p>
<p>So what was curry like before Columbus? Well, <i>curry</i> didn’t exist.</p>
<p>In these cases, I find it useful to consult my <i>Hobson-Jobson</i>, the nineteenth-century dictionary of Anglo-Indian loan words. According to that source, curry comes from the Portuguese word <i>karil (caril)</i> via the Tamil word <i>kari</i> (sauce, relish for rice). In the sixteenth century, this was transliterated into English as caril, but by the 1680s entered English as <i>carrees</i>, perhaps from <i>caris</i>, an Anglicized plural form of the Portuguese.<span id="easy-footnote-3-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-3-69820" title="Sir Henry Yule, “Curry,” in <a href=&quot;https://dsalsrv04.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/app/hobsonjobson_query.py?page=281&quot;><i>Hobson-Jobson: A Glossary of Colloquial Anglo-Indian Words and Phrases, and of Kindred Terms, Etymological, Historical, Geographical and Discursive</i></a>, ed. William Crooke, B.A (London: J Murray, 1903), 281."><sup>3</sup></a></span> It’s a circle: I’m back to Tordesillas and Saragossa.</p>
<p>It looks like the curry too came after Columbus. And not only that: it’s a meaningless word in the context of daily life. Indian food is cipher, built upon a matrix of regionalism, religion, and caste. A Dalit from Mararashtra’s Marathwada region might mix bovine blood with <i>yesur</i> (a local spice mix) to make <i>lakuti</i>, while a Tamil Brahmin might mix eight spices with <i>tur dāl</i> and onions to make a <i>sambar</i>.<span id="easy-footnote-4-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-4-69820" title="Shahu Patole, <a href=&quot;http://www.expressfoodie.com/main-course/why-i-wrote-a-book-on-dalit-food/&quot;>“Why I Wrote a Book on Dalit Food,”</a> <i>Express Foodie</i>, September 10, 2016."><sup>4</sup></a></span> Beyond the hyper-regionalism is a blunt truth as well: there are actual words for the plethora of regional dishes that can be reduced to a curry.</p>
<p>Still, curry can be a somewhat useful concept. It’s an outsider’s perspective, a shorthand glossing over an entire subcontinent’s worth of food. It’s the type of concept that takes what it wants from the original, and mixes in whatever else is ready-to-hand.</p>
<p>I went to the source: the first example of a curry recipe found in a Western cookbook. Hannah Glasse’s 1747 <i>The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy</i> featured a recipe “To make a Currey the Indian way” alongside one “To make a Pellow the Indian way.”<span id="easy-footnote-5-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-5-69820" title="Hannah Glasse, <i>The Art of Cookery, New</i> (London: L. Wangford, 1777), 74."><sup>5</sup></a></span></p>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/contingentmagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ArtofCookery.png?resize=771%2C372&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="771" height="372" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/contingentmagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ArtofCookery.png?resize=771%2C372&amp;ssl=1 771w, https://i2.wp.com/contingentmagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ArtofCookery.png?resize=336%2C162&amp;ssl=1 336w, https://i2.wp.com/contingentmagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ArtofCookery.png?resize=768%2C370&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/contingentmagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ArtofCookery.png?resize=1536%2C741&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/contingentmagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ArtofCookery.png?resize=2048%2C987&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i2.wp.com/contingentmagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ArtofCookery.png?resize=1170%2C564&amp;ssl=1 1170w" sizes="(max-width: 771px) 100vw, 771px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>Upon first glance, I can’t tell how this recipe differs from a fricasseed chicken. But it’s there: “an ounce of Turmerick [turmeric], a large spoonful of ginger and beaten pepper.” What makes this curry in an Indian way is not the chicken or the cream, but these three spices taken mixed together and served.</p>
<p>Before spicy came spice: the history of curry before Columbus is a history of spice. And so I wonder: what spices were used? In what quantities?</p>
<p>The best spice to help answer these questions might be asafetida (also spelled asafetida). Known in Hindi as <i>hīng</i>, it’s the dried resin taken from the root of the Ferula herb, and is used throughout Indian cuisine in nearly all Indian regions. When fried in oil, it adds a lovely umami flavor to any dish, one reminiscent of garlic or onions.</p>
<p>I’ve also known it as an extremely smelly spice.</p>

<p>I had never heard of it until I was an adult. Family lore says that my father hated the smell so much, he told my mother early in their marriage to keep it out of the spice cabinet forever. But it wasn’t just him—the smell has a noxious reputation across the world, going back centuries. The Portuguese physician and naturalist Garcia de Orta wrote in his sixteenth-century <i>Colóquios</i> that “the nastiest smell in the world for me is Assa-fetida [sic].” But he also wrote that “the thing most used throughout India, and in all parts of it, is that Assa-fetida.”<span id="easy-footnote-6-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-6-69820" title="Garcia da Orta, <i>Colloquies on the Simples and Drugs of India</i>, ed. Conde de Ficalho, trans. Sir Clements Markham, New Lisbon Edition (London: Henry Sotheran and Co, 1913), 44–45."><sup>6</sup></a></span></p>
<p>This was as true in the twelfth century as it was in the sixteenth. One of the earliest South Asian texts that featured non-medicinal recipes was the Sanskrit <i>Mānasollāsa</i>. Written in 1129 CE by Someshvara III, king of the Western Chalukya Empire in the western Deccan and South India, the book is an encyclopedic treatise on all aspects of life in his kingdom. One of those most common ingredients found in its chapter on the enjoyment of food is asafetida.<span id="easy-footnote-7-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-7-69820" title="Colleen Taylor Sen, <i>Feasts and Fasts: A History of Food in India</i>, Overdrive (eBook) edition (London: Reaktion Books, 2015), chap. 7."><sup>7</sup></a></span></p>
<p>For example, his general practices or preparing meat dishes called for the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>For getting good smell, dry coriander seeds, jeera, and hingu; for giving colour haridra; for good taste the powder of saindhvam, visvamarichim are sprinkled over the food and covered with a clean cloth and mixed slightly with oil.<span id="easy-footnote-8-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-8-69820" title="P. Arundhati, trans., <i>Royal Life in Mānasôllāsa</i> (New Delhi: Sundeep Prakashan, 1994), 120."><sup>8</sup></a></span></p></blockquote>
<p>Various other recipes, including those for <i>dāl</i>, meat dishes, and fish were also spiced with asafetida.<span id="easy-footnote-9-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-9-69820" title="Sen, chap. 7."><sup>9</sup></a></span> My first inclination when I saw this was to question it: of course a king would spice his food. Spices were a luxury, and it goes without saying that a king could afford to command his kitchen to use whatever spices were available to him.</p>

<p>But a century prior to the publication of the <i>Mānasollāsa</i> came the <i>Lokopakara</i> (roughly translates to “For the benefit of the people”). Written in 1025 by the Jain scholar Chavundaraya II, the<i> Lokopakara</i> featured a section on cooking with a recipe for <i>dāl </i>that recommended a garnish of mustard, cumin seeds, asafetida, and curry leaves.<span id="easy-footnote-10-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-10-69820" title="Sen, chap. 7."><sup>10</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Asafetida too made an appearance in recipes dating from the Sultanate era. From 1206 to 1526, a succession of Islamic dynasties known as the Delhi Sultanate ruled northern India. Nasir ud-Din Shah, a ruler of the Malwa Sultanate (a breakaway state from one of the Delhi Sultanate dynasties) produced the <i>Ni’matnama</i> (“The Book of Delights”). The book contained some of the recipes loved by his father, the Sultan Ghiyath Shah. Interestingly enough, the book contains a handful of recipes considered rustic or common—food for the common folk.</p>
<p>One recommends to:</p>
<blockquote><p>take root vegetables and boil them well, then take them off and fry them in ghee flavoured with sesame and asafetida.</p>
<p>Add lime juice, salt and burned vegetable oil and mix it as explained above. Take some of it, flavor it and cook it.<span id="easy-footnote-11-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-11-69820" title="Norah M. Titley, ed., <i>The Ni’matnama Manuscript of the Sultans of Mandu: The Sultan’s Book of Delights</i> (London: Routledge, 2004), 44–45."><sup>11</sup></a></span></p></blockquote>
<p>I’m not sure how burned vegetable oil would taste, but I’m sure the asafetida would make up for it. Maybe.</p>
<p>Humble <i>hīng</i> too made an appearance in the royal accounts of the Mughals. The Mughal Emperor Akbar reigned from 1556 to 1605. His court historian, Abu’l-Fazl ‘Allami, dutifully chronicled his reign in <i>Ain-i-Akbari</i> (“Administration of Akbar”). The work remains a quintessential source for the workings of Akbar’s government. It also contains a repertoire of recipes. For example, a recipe for <i>bādinjān</i> (eggplant) asks for:</p>
<blockquote><p>10 s. [<i>sīr</i>, approximately 640 grams] rice; 1 ½ s. g’hí [ghee], 3 ¾ s. onions; ¼ s. ginger and lime juice; pepper and coriander seed, 5 m. [misqal, approximately 6 grams] of each; cloves, cardamums [cardamom], and assafoetida, each ½ m.<span id="easy-footnote-12-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-12-69820" title="Abu’l-Fazl ’Allami, <i>The Ain I Akbari</i>, trans. Henry Blochmann, vol. 1 (Calcutta: Rouse, 1873), 59."><sup>12</sup></a></span></p></blockquote>
<p>Strangely enough, the recipe for eggplant lacks any mention of eggplant. But regardless, there it is: a half <i>misqal</i> of asafetida.<span id="easy-footnote-13-69820"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-13-69820" title="A unit of mass equal to 4.25 grams. Misqal is sometimes written as mithqāl."><sup>13</sup></a></span> Even the kitchens of the Mughal court were filled with the wondrous odors of <i>hīng</i>.</p>
<p>The history of curry before Columbus is truly a history of spice. There are, of course, more spices to find in the archives: turmeric, coriander, and cumin come to mind. These are spices that cross region and class, the staples thrown into the pot in meal after meal. But ubiquitous, smelly, resinous <i>hīng</i> gives a chance to take a peek into the flavors of Indian food prior to the Columbian exchange. Perhaps there should be a new way to order something, not Indian spicy, but Indian spiced, with plenty of asafetida. I’ll hold my nose and ask for a generous portion, just like all those food chroniclers over the past millennium.</p>

                    <p>One of the most enviable and rare traits is the ability to consistently produce work that is unique and immediately recognisable as to who made it. If you think of the people who inspire you most in the spatial community, they all probably demonstrate this trait to some degree. Not many people can claim this, and many strive to achieve it.</p><p>Craig Taylor has this trait in abundance — his approach to spatial visualisation being both unique and incredibly beautiful. His body of work is growing by the day (I'm starting to think he never sleeps), and you've probably already seen it even if you didn't realise he was behind it. He firmly stands between the two realms of art and spatial data analysis, expertly taking complex spatial data and communicating it in a way that is both beautiful and insightful.</p><p>I've been a big fan of Craig and his work for a while now — he's had a huge impact on my own work and how I want to approach spatial visualisation — so it was a delight to finally meet him in person at an event at Ordnance Survey last year. It also turns out we have a lot in common, like both living in the arse-end of nowhere in the North West of the UK.</p><p>I recently had the pleasure of interviewing him for Spatial Awareness; learning about his journey with spatial visualisation, getting insight into his work and technique, and finding out just how he manages to consistently churn out so many amazing visualisations.</p><p>So please, grab yourself a panad (Welsh slang for a cup of tea), relax and enjoy this insight into the mind and technique of Craig Taylor. I'm certain you will find it as interesting as I have.</p><hr><p><em>Do you have a burning question for Craig? Add a comment at the end of the interview. Also, let me know who else you'd like to see interviewed and I'll try and make it happen.</em></p><p><em>What did you think of the format of this interview? Would you like to see more free-form discussions in a podcast or video format? I'd love to hear your thoughts.</em></p><p><em>— Robin</em></p><hr><p><strong>First of all I'd like to thank you Craig for taking the time out to do this interview, I know these things take a lot of time and energy.</strong></p><p><strong>Can you begin by introducing yourself for anyone who isn't already aware of who you are?</strong></p><figure><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/spatialawareness/image/upload/w_1000/v1593859644/ghost/manual/i02lvtaktbbwwk5exruk.jpg" alt=""></figure><p>Well I am the Data Viz Design Manager at <a href="https://www.itoworld.com/">Ito World</a> and run our service sector which delivers bespoke 3D cinematic animations to clients. Generally these visualisations revolve around the use of transit data and are used by our clients to tell a story or derive some insight.</p><p>Outside of Ito World I run my <a href="https://mapzilla.co.uk/">Mapzilla website</a> and spend too much of my free time finding new ways of visualising 3D data. Houdini has been a great outlet for me at the moment as it mirrors my node-based workflows I utilise in Ito World.</p><p>Oh and I have two wonderful spaniels Bryn and Toby who wanted a shoutout!</p><figure><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/spatialawareness/image/upload/w_1000/v1593859644/ghost/manual/tlm7p8e4itzouyuppzbm.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>Craig's adorable spaniels 😍</figcaption></figure><p><strong>You can also follow Craig and his work through his Twitter and Instagram feeds.</strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><figure>

<!--kg-card-end: html--><p><strong>I've always found it fascinating to hear the different journeys people go on to get where they are today.</strong></p><p><strong>How did you first get into spatial visualisation?</strong></p><p>I have always been interested in the design side of cartography after being introduced to GIS through university however the emphasis here was on the spatial analytics, which was great, but design never seemed to be as important. It wasn’t until I started working with Landscape Architects that I appreciated how important design was.</p><p>Ever since that I have tried to position myself in roles that see spatial design as a must and not just a nice to have.</p><p><strong>And what was your first job in the field?</strong></p><p>GIS Technician with Mouchel Engineering in 2008, I was lucky to get a job in GIS right after my MSc in Environmental Informatics. It was a great role but a completely different ‘GIS’ to what University taught us. There was a lot of plan production, a lot of digitising and the inevitable ’CAD to GIS’ wrangling, which back in 2008 wasn’t a whole load of fun!</p><hr><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Master mapman GIS weirdo</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><hr><p><strong>So fast-forwarding to the present day. Where do you work now, and what do you do there?</strong></p><p>DataViz Design Manager at Ito World for the past 3 years. Well according to my family in a recent quiz I'm an ‘illustrator of pointless flight and commuter data’ or ‘master mapman GIS weirdo.’ There is probably a bit of truth in both but I am in charge of delivering our 3D cinematic visualisations to a variety of clients. As I mentioned earlier usually these clients have transit data they want visualising in new or exciting ways.</p><p>Recently I have been working a lot with our internal archived data at Ito World whether that is finding new ways to visualise GTFS feeds or looking at visualising our prediction systems. I am lucky it’s such a creative role and also have access to an amazing toolset developed by our CTO <a href="https://twitter.com/halbertram">Hal Bertram</a>.</p><hr><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>It’s the manipulation and animation of data to create something people might not have seen before that drives me to constantly seek new ways of visualising geo data</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><hr><p><strong>You mention that you've always been interested in the design side of cartography.</strong></p><p><strong>What are the driving factors in why you make maps? And what excites you about working with spatial visualisation?</strong></p><p>I think everyone resonates with ‘place’ in one way or another and I find visualising geography fascinating but I love it when a ‘place’ comes to life through animation.</p><p>Take airport runways for instance, visualising the plane activity throughout a day is mesmerising and deriving the patterns and digital contrails the aircraft leave is something that you can’t appreciate until you see it animated. Or bus journeys and how the daily patterns of activity can create an urban heartbeat, or maybe turning drive-time catchments into coral formations.</p><p>It’s the manipulation and animation of this data to create something people might not have seen before that drives me to constantly seek out new ways of visualising geo data.</p><p><strong>If you look back over your career so far, what would you say is your favourite piece of work? There's a lot to choose from!</strong></p><p><a href="https://mapzilla.co.uk/work/coral-cities">Coral Cities</a>! It was the first major project which I thought could be classed as art, or at least close to art! I started looking at ways of manipulating drive-time catchments into 3D geometry and eventually came up with the Coral City concept.</p><figure><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/267964121?app_id=122963" width="1280" height="720" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="" title="UK Coral Cities"></iframe></figure><p>From there the project grew and grew, we created small multiple posters and visualisations which got used on huge screens at the LA Autoshow! They were featured in fast company and even made it into Andy Kirks latest edition of Data Visualisation.</p><p>It’s the only project I’ve worked on where my wife asked for a custom poster to go in the house!</p><p><strong>Your <a href="https://mapzilla.co.uk/work/plotmypaws">PlotMyPaws</a> project is definitely one of my favourites, it's both visually compelling and also a fascinating insight into the crazy world of dogs.</strong></p><p><strong>Do you plan to revisit it?</strong></p><p>I loved PlotMyPaws — it epitomised why I love working with spatial data but also the value in creating your own unique datasets. The insight that came from visualising where my dogs were running and eventually lots of other peoples dogs in my village was amazing and super interesting, even if I took the concept a bit far with 3D heatmaps and such the like!</p><figure><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/289237729?app_id=122963" width="1280" height="720" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>I did begin a PlotMyPup sequel when our second puppy arrived, Toby, but I felt I was repeating a lot of what I did the first time round with a slightly bigger dog. I’d love to expand the project and get more people tracking their dogs, but it’s tricky unless people invest in trackers themselves.</p><p><strong>Your work at Ito World is always inspirational. Tell me some more about your favourite projects there.</strong></p><p>We recently delivered three data visualisations to TomTom for a number of cities showcasing their mobility products. They wanted to showcase how their data could be used to understand mobility within a city.</p><p>Each visualisation was split into three parts, a general heartbeat of traffic during the day, a comparison of traffic on a specific day with a public bank holiday and an insight into how congestion accumulates on a number of busy roads and intersections within a city.</p><figure><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/358101779?app_id=122963" width="1280" height="720" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="" title="TomTom: Visualising Probe Data in Amsterdam"></iframe></figure><p>It was fascinating how detailed their GPS traces are and they were happy for us to explore a few new visualisation styles including ‘congestion explosions’ which show traffic build up on key streets.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@craig.taylor_72813/tomtom-visualising-amsterdams-heartbeat-7939e9b60d66">I wrote a blog on the evolving design</a> we iterated through throughout the project.</p><p><strong>We've seen so far that a lot of your visualisations are animated and 3D. What hardware and software do you use to create them?</strong></p><p>All of our service work at Ito World is produced using our ‘Designer’ tool, it’s built on OpenGL and it optimised for fast rendering and designing on the fly meaning we can be really flexible when it comes to clients requirements.</p><figure><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/334480610?app_id=122963" width="1280" height="720" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="" title="Ito World Showreel 2019 4k"></iframe></figure><p>Outside of Ito I am a huge fan of Cinema4D and the <a href="https://cinemaplugins.com/c4d-plugins/dem-earth/">DEM Earth plugin</a> and have dabbled in Blender during my early foray into 3D. As of late I am finding myself hooked on Houdini which feels as close to our Ito tool in terms of node based workflows as anything I have used. It’s incredibly powerful for animating 3D spatial data and is really fun to use.</p><p>Most of my projects are spatially orientated so I flip between QGIS and ArcMap depending on my mood!</p><p>Finally most projects are compiled and edited in After Effects and I am a huge fan of most of the Adobe Creative Suite really, back when I was making static maps Illustrator was my go-to-tool!</p><p><strong>You also tend to focus on pre-rendered visualisations over realtime. Do you feel there are benefits of rendered output over realtime?</strong></p><p>I suppose with rendered outputs you get the ability to hook into 3rd party renderers like Octane or Redshift etc. Octane has some great tools for rendering particles or hair on the fly without creating geometry so can be really beneficial when it comes to creating complex spatial scenes.</p><p>However looking …</p></div></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Principal components analysis (PCA) is one of a family of techniques for taking high-dimensional data, and using the dependencies between the variables to represent it in a more tractable, lower-dimensional form, without losing too much information. It has been widely used for data compression and de-noising. However, its entire mathematical process is sometimes ambiguous to the user.</p>



<p>In this article, I would like to discuss the entire process of PCA mathematically, including PCA projection and reconstruction, with most of the derivations and proofs provided. At the end of the article, I implemented PCA projection and reconstruction from scratch. After reading this article, there should be more black box in PCA anymore.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<h4 id="orthogonal-matrix">Orthogonal Matrix</h4>

<p>In linear algebra, an orthogonal matrix is a real square matrix whose columns and rows are orthogonal unit vectors (orthonormal vectors).</p>



<p>Equivalently, the mathematical expression is</p>



<p>By <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertible_matrix">the definition of invertible matrix</a>, this means matrix $A$ is invertible and $A^{-1} = A^{\top}$.</p>



<p>We could also view this from the perspective of determinant.</p>



<p>Because $A$ and $A^{\top}$ are square matrices and using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant#Properties_of_the_determinant">the properties of determinant</a></p>



<p>Since $\det(A) \neq 0$, matrix $A$ is invertible. We multiply $A^{-1}$ on both side of the orthogonal matrix definition.</p>



<p>We have also derived the conclusion that $A^{-1} = A^{\top}$.</p>



<p>Similarly, a complex square matrix $A$ is unitary if its transpose conjugate $A^{\dagger}$ is also its inverse.</p>



<p>Equivalently, the mathematical expression is</p>



<h4 id="symmetric-matrix">Symmetric Matrix</h4>

<p>Real symmetric matrix has the following useful properties:</p>



<p>If $A$ is a real symmetric matrix, all of its eigenvalues are real numbers.</p>



<p>Because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_conjugate#Generalizations">the conjugate properties</a> and $\overline{A} = A$ since $A$ is a real value matrix,</p>



<p>We got $A \overline{v} = \overline{\lambda} \overline{v}$.</p>



<p>Let $\lambda \in \mathbb{C}$ be an eigenvalue of the symmetric matrix $A$. $Av = \lambda v$ and $v \neq 0$. We multiply $v^{\dagger}$ ($v^{\dagger} = \overline{v}^{\top}$) to the both sides, and because of $A^{\top} = A$ and the property we have just derived $A \overline{v} = \overline{\lambda} \overline{v}$,</p>



<p>We have $\lambda v^{\dagger} v = \overline{\lambda} \overline{v}^{\dagger} v$, thus $\lambda$ is real.</p>



<p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h4 id="positive-semi-definite-matrix">Positive Semi-Definite Matrix</h4>

<p>The $n \times n$ symmetric matrix $A$ is defined to be positive semi-definite, if $x^{\dagger} A x \geq$ for $x \in \mathbb{C}^n$.</p>



<p>The positive semi-definite matrix has the following important property:</p>



<p>The eigenvalues of positive semi-definite matrix are non-negative.</p>



<p>Because $x^{\dagger} A x \geq$ for $x \in \mathbb{C}^n$, suppose $x$ is an eigenvector of $A$ and $Ax = \lambda x$ where $x \neq 0$,</p>



<p>Because $x^{\dagger} x$ must be real number and $x^{\dagger} x &gt; 0$, we have $\lambda \geq 0$.</p>



<p>This concludes the proof.</p>

<h4 id="covariance-matrix">Covariance Matrix</h4>

<p>The covariance matrix has the following important property:</p>



<p>Covariance matrix is positive semi-definite. This means that the eigenvalues of covariance matrix is non-negative.</p>



<p>The proof of that covariance must be positive semi-definite could be found in my previous post on <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Multivariate-Gaussian-Covariance-Matrix/">Multivariate Gaussian and Covariance Matrix</a>.</p>

<h4 id="singular-values">Singular Values</h4>

<p>The singular values, $\sigma_1$, $\sigma_2$, $\cdots$, $\sigma_r$, of an $m \times n$ matrix $A$ are the square roots, $\sigma_i = \sqrt{\lambda_i}$, of non-negative eigenvalues of the associated Gram matrix $K = A^{\dagger}A$. The corresponding eigenvectors of $K$ are known as singular vectors of $A$.</p>



<p>Note that the associated Gram matrix $K = A^{\dagger}A$ is real and symmetric, so the eigenvalues of $K$ are all real.</p>



<p>$K = A^{\dagger}A$ is also positive semi-definite.</p>



<p>For any vector $x$</p>



<p>Because $Ax$ is also a vector,</p>



<p>Therefore, all the eigenvalues of $K = A^{\dagger}A$ are non-negative and they all have a corresponding singular values of $A$.</p>

<h4 id="singular-value-decomposition">Singular Value Decomposition</h4>

<p>In linear algebra, the singular value decomposition (SVD) is a factorization of a real or complex matrix that generalizes the eigendecomposition of a square normal matrix to any $ m\times n$ matrix via an extension of the polar decomposition.</p>



<p>Specifically, the singular value decomposition of an $m \times n$ real or complex matrix $M$ is a factorization of the form $U \Sigma V^{\dagger}$, where $U$ is an $m \times m$ real or complex unitary matrix, $\Sigma$ is a $m \times n$ rectangular diagonal matrix with non-negative real numbers on the diagonal, and $V$ is an $n \times n$ real or complex unitary matrix.</p>



<p>The diagonal entries $\sigma_{i}=\Sigma_{ii}$ of $\Sigma$ are known as the singular values of $M$. The number of non-zero singular values is equal to the rank of $M$.</p>



<p>In particular, for any matrix $A \in \mathbb{C}$,</p>



<p>We will skip the proof for why every matrix has SVD and the algorithm for SVD.</p>

<h4 id="singular-value-decomposition-for-norm-matrix">Singular Value Decomposition for Norm Matrix</h4>

<p>For any matrix $A \in \mathbb{C}$, $A^{\dagger} A$ could be expressed as</p>



<p>We multiply $V$ at both side of the equation.</p>



<p>Note that $\Sigma^{\dagger} \Sigma$ is a square diagonal matrix. Based on the definition of eigenvalue and eigenvectors, the diagonal values of $\Sigma^{\dagger} \Sigma$, including the zeros, are the eigenvalues of $A^{\dagger} A$. All the columns of $V$ are the corresponding eigenvectors of $A^{\dagger} A$.</p>



<p>Similarly, $A A^{\dagger}$ could be expressed as</p>



<p>Note that $\Sigma \Sigma^{\dagger}$ is a square diagonal matrix. Based on the definition of eigenvalue and eigenvectors, the diagonal values of $\Sigma \Sigma^{\dagger}$, including the zeros, are the eigenvalues of $A A^{\dagger}$. All the columns of $U$ are the corresponding eigenvectors of $A A^{\dagger}$.</p>

<h3 id="mathematics-of-principal-components-analysis">Mathematics of Principal Components Analysis</h3>

<p>We start with $p$-dimensional vectors, and want to summarize them by projecting down into a $q$-dimensional subspace, where $q \leq p$. Our summary will be the projection of the original vectors on to $q$ directions, the principal axes, which span the subspace.</p>

<h4 id="minimizing-projection-residuals">Minimizing Projection Residuals</h4>

<p>Given a dataset $X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times p}$ whose row is the centered data vectors $x_i \in \mathbb{R}^p$ for $0 \leq i \leq n-1$ ($\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} x_{i} = 0$), if we have a unit vector $w \in \mathbb{R}^p$ ($|w| = 1$) and we project the all the data vectors to this unit vector $w$.</p>



<p>The length of projection for data vector $x_i$ on $w$, by definition, is</p>



<p>where $\langle x_i, w \rangle$ is the inner product of $x_i$ and $w$.</p>



<p>The projection vector for data vector $x_i$ on $w$ is $\langle x_i, w \rangle w$.</p>



<p>The residual, which is the distance from data vector $x_i$ to $w$, is the length of vector $x_i - \langle x_i, w \rangle w$.</p>



<p>Let’s check what the residual square $| x_i - \langle x_i, w \rangle w | ^2$ is.</p>



<p>The optimization goal of projection is to minimize mean squared error $\text{MSE}(w)$, which is the mean of the residual sum of squares.</p>



<p>Remember the relationship between variance and expected value, $\mathbb{V}(X) = \mathbb{E}(X^2) - \mathbb{E}(X)^2$, we have</p>



<p>So $\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}  \langle x_i, w \rangle ^2$ is actually the variance of the inner product between data vector and the projection unit vector $\mathbb{V}\big(\langle x, w \rangle\big)$.</p>



<p>We further have another expression of $\text{MSE}(w)$.</p>



<p>Because $\mathbb{E}\big(\langle x, x \rangle\big)$ is not dependent on $w$, minimizing the mean of the residual sum of squares $\text{MSE}(w)$ turns out to be equivalent to maximizing the variance of the inner product between data vector and the projection unit vector.</p>



<p>The variance of the inner product between data vector and the projection unit vector could also be expressed using the dataset matrix $X$.</p>



<p>where $\frac{X^{\top} X}{n}$ is the covariance matrix of $X$.</p>



<p>If we project the data vectors to $q$ orthogonal unit vectors $w_0$, $w_1$, $\cdots$, $w_{q-1}$. These unit vectors assembled as columns to a matrix $W \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times q}$. Then our optimization goal becomes maximizing the residual sum of squares on all these projection vectors.</p>



<p>subject to</p>



<h4 id="maximizing-variance">Maximizing Variance</h4>

<p>Suppose we are projecting the data to $p$ orthonormal unit vectors $w \in \mathbb{R}^{p}$. These unit vectors assembled as columns to a matrix $W \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times p}$, and $W$ is a orthonormal matrix.</p>



<p>subject to</p>



<p>Let’s try to maximize one $\mathscr{L}(w) = w^{\top} X^{\top} X w$ first, and the constrain is $w^{\top} w = 1$. We would use Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$ to help us solve the optimization problem.</p>





<p>We set $\frac{\partial \mathscr{L}}{\lambda} = 0$ and $\frac{\partial \mathscr{L}}{w} = 0$, we get</p>



<p>So by definition, $\lambda$ and $w$ are the eigenvalue and eigenvector of matrix $X^{\top} X$.</p>



<p>Because $X^{\top} X$ is real symmetric matrix and positive semi-definite, all the eigenvalues of $X^{\top} X$ are non-negative.</p>



<p>$X^{\top} X$ has exact $p$ eigenvalues $\lambda_0, \lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_{p-1}$ and their corresponding eigenvectors $w_0, w_1, \cdots, w_{p-1}$. The matrix $W$, which consists of the eigenvectors $w_0, w_1, \cdots, w_{p-1}$, happens to be the global maximum solution for $\mathscr{L}(W)$. The global maximum value for $\mathscr{L}(W)$ is the sum of non-negative eigenvalues.</p>



<p>Because these eigenvalues are non-negative, and their contribution to the global maximum could be sorted by their values.</p>



<p>We call the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue the first principal axis, the eigenvector corresponding to the second largest eigenvalue the second principal axis, and so on.</p>



<p>Suppose we are projecting the data to $q$ orthonormal unit vectors $w \in \mathbb{R}^{p}$, and $q \leq p$. These unit vectors assembled as columns to a matrix $W \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times q}$. The optimization problem becomes maximizing the following equation.</p>

<p>However, the solution is obvious. We just have to pick the $q$ largest eigenvalues and …</p></div></div>

July 7, 2020 | https://lord.io/blog/2020/usernames/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://lord.io/blog/2020/usernames/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>In 2006, Robert Andersen sent <a href="https://twitter.com/rsa/status/55281">the first tweet that @mentioned another user</a>, and an internet convention was born.</p>
<p><img alt="A screenshot of a tweet reading &quot;@ buzz - you broke your thumb and youre still twittering? that's some serious devotion&quot;" src="https://lord.io/images/2020/usernames_1.png"></p>
<p>In a world without smartphones, Twitter’s primary interface was SMS. There were no threads, no @username autocomplete. If a user said something and you wanted to reply, your only option was to compose a new text to 40404, manually typing the @mention into your phone’s SMS text box. SMS was also the origin of Twitter’s original <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/counting-characters">140 character</a> limit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Twitter began as an SMS text-based service. This limited the original Tweet length to 140 characters (which was partly driven by the 160 character limit of SMS, with 20 characters reserved for commands and usernames).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also a holdover from the SMS days, Twitter does not allow any formatted or rich text. Users today work around this limitation by using the wide array of possibilities that Unicode affords. <a href="https://technastic.com/bold-text-twitter-mobile-web/#List_of_Online_Text_Generators">Text generators</a> convert ASCII characters into 𝔲𝔫𝔲𝔰𝔲𝔞𝔩 𝔘𝔫𝔦𝔠𝔬𝔡𝔢 𝔠𝔥𝔞𝔯𝔞𝔠𝔱𝔢𝔯𝔰. Memes take advantage of repeated spaces to position text, or to draw Unicode houses. (All of that is, of course, completely inaccessible to screen readers.) Emoji modifiers allow expressing a wide range of emotions with modifiers for skin tones and gender.</p>
<p><img alt="two screenshots, one of a unicode house reading &quot;in this house we worship unicode&quot; and another with a tweet from @helllzgirl that say &quot;cashiers 🤝 ariana grande ... thank u, next&quot;" src="https://lord.io/images/2020/usernames_5.png"></p>
<p>Critically, this “plain” text is fully copy-pastable into any app with Unicode support. While many Twitter users from 2006 were likely limited to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSM_03.38#GSM_8_bit_data_encoding">GSM-7 encoding</a>, the limitations of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T9_(predictive_text)">T9 keyboard</a>, and their phone’s limited text rendering and shaping, modern users have found new ways to express themselves using the full Unicode character space. Nowadays, tweets, names, URLs, hashtags, basically <em>everything</em> can contain Unicode characters. Of course, everything except the @mention.</p>
<p>Usernames on Twitter have more or less the same requirements as during the SMS era — up to 15 letters from <code>a-z</code>, numbers from <code>0-9</code> and the underscore <code>_</code>. This requirement is similar to many other websites: GitHub only allows alphanumeric characters and non-repeating hyphens, and Facebook allows just alphanumeric characters and the period.</p>
<p>As we will see, this limitation is one of several problems with usernames.</p>
<h2>Unicode Usernames</h2>
<p>Imagine if instead of alphanumerics, GitHub allowed usernames to only be made up of the numbers <code>0-9</code> and Chinese characters. It would be pretty frustrating, right? If forced to use a system like this, we would likely ignore the Chinese characters, and just use the numbers as usernames. This is often what happens on social media platforms in countries that don’t use Latin script. In China, the QQ instant messaging service (originally started in 1999) completely got rid of usernames used by similar services like AOL. Instead, each user is assigned a unique number, their QQ ID. This number cannot be chosed by the user, and is immutable. WeChat similarly assigns users a random number when they sign up, although it does allow each user exactly one opportunity to change it to an alphanumeric string of their choice. Typing long numbers isn’t particularly ergonomic, which could help explain the widespread use of QR codes in China.</p>
<p>Even in Latin-speaking countries, AOL-style usernames had issues. By requiring a username when logging in, and <em>also</em> requiring usernames to be unique among all users, users are often forced to use different usernames on different services, creating a second password that they had to memorize. Thankfully, most services have fixed at least this small problem by having login be email- instead of username-based.</p>
<p>Throughout the world, usernames are alphanumeric only. Why can’t we just allow Unicode, so that usernames could contain Chinese, Cyrillic, or other non-Latin alphabets? Unfortunately Unicode usernames have their own issues — just look at the largest username system in the world, the domain name system and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalized_domain_name">extension that allowed non-ASCII characters</a>. This was an essential upgrade, and yet it has inperfections, allowing the <a href="https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2017/04/chrome-firefox-unicode-phishing/">registration of websites</a> such as this one:</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot of browser window, URL bar reads &quot;epic.com&quot;" src="https://lord.io/images/2020/usernames_2.png"></p>
<p>This is latest Firefox, as of July 2020, displaying what appears to be “epic.com”, the website of a large healthcare company. However, as you can see, the content is actually some random blog reminding people to drink water. How is this possible? If we stick the code into a Unicode character inspector, we can see what’s going on:</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot of unicode character inspector revealing &quot;epic&quot; to actually be &quot;еріс&quot;. of course you, a screen reader user, aren't fooled." src="https://lord.io/images/2020/usernames_3.png"></p>
<p>Byte-wise, the real “epic.com” and the false website “еріс.com” are completely different. But visually, they’re indistinguishable from each other in the URL bar, allowing phishing problems to run amock. Unicode <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_equivalence">canonicalization and normalization</a> can help with certain cases of this problem, but does nothing for our epic.com example.</p>
<p>This particular example isn’t visible in Chrome, which instead shows <code>https://xn--e1awd7f.com/</code>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punycode">“punycode”</a> representation of the domain name. This is thanks to Chrome’s complex, <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/76be97d896f266d6b73b2fe0af5d6d479ca31306/docs/idn.md">13 step process</a> for detecting if a domain name is likely to be a Unicode phish or not. “Well, it may be complex,” you tell me, “but at least it solves the phishing problem!” Unfortunately it does not.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Specific instances of IDN homograph attacks have been reported to Chrome, and we continually update our IDN policy to prevent against these attacks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Unicode spec is apparently too large to solve this problem 100% perfectly, and so their “solution” is to pay $2000 to anybody who finds new edge cases. This also doesn’t actually solve the problem for non-Latin alphabets — if for example, I own a Chinese domain name, it will never show punycode, and attackers can phish my site using duplicate encodings for those Chinese characters. Chrome just attempts to solve the much smaller problem of the numerous Unicode characters that visually look like the Latin alphabet.</p>
<p>This is probably frustrating to read, and you may want to point fingers at Unicode, for failing to provide canonical encodings for a series of graphemes. Or perhaps we can blame the domain name registrars, for allowing visually identical registrations. But I think the real culprit here is the incorrect assumption we Latin script users have when we build usernames into our systems. We assume that two visually-identical printed text tokens will have the same bytewise encoding. This is simply not true for a huge portion of computer users, and is a root failing with username-based systems today. The only solution is to develop systems that don’t have usernames.</p>
<p>Even in a trusted system with no bad actors, there is no guarantee a user retyping a non-Latin username from a printed document will end up with the same bytes as the original document.</p>
<h2>Changing Usernames</h2>
<p>Let’s say you’re building a site for English use only, and so even after reading all of this, you think perhaps it’s ok to have usernames. After all, you’ll probably find, like Twitter did, that this makes text entry for @mentions <em>much</em> simpler to implement. You get to use just a plain text field, instead of building an input field that can insert custom @mention objects.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you will still run into the issue of somebody <em>changing</em> their username. This is often an extremely complex problem. Take <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/changing-your-github-username">GitHub</a> for example. Changing your username there will redirect your old repository links to new ones. However, somebody else can come in and use your old username. What happens if they create a repo with the same name as your old one?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the new owner of your old username creates a repository with the same name as your repository, that will override the redirect entry and your redirect will stop working.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>URLs aren’t the only place GitHub usernames are used. Using the web interface, in some cases, will create commits with the email <code><a href="https://lord.io/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="204d59555345524e414d456055534552530e4e4f5245504c590e4749544855420e434f4d">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></code>. These commits will permanantly be disconnected from your account, unless you somehow are able to force push edited commit headers to every repository you’ve ever contributed to. Good luck with that.</p>
<p>Instagram has issues with changing usernames, too. Up until 2015, updating your username would cause you to lose all your previous @mentions. They’ve since fixed this; old @mentions eventually update. Twitter supposedly will also preserve your replies, although my testing shows this is an unreliable feature at best. Updating the actual @mention as it’s listed in the Tweet would have other issues, since if a user mentioned in a 280-character tweet adds 5 characters to their username, you’d suddenly get a 285-character tweet. Hope your Twitter clients can all support that.</p>
<p>The final example of username switching pains I have is from my year at Google. I was fortunate enough to never switch my username, perfectly satisfied every morning when I opened my laptop and saw <code><a href="https://lord.io/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="543835263014333b3b3338317a373b39">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></code> on the login screen. But countless internal systems used by engineers there assume usernames are immutable, making a username switch a multi-day process that is never really complete.</p>
<p>There is one easy “solution” to all of this, of course, which is to make it impossible to change your username. This is <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/19870?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&amp;hl=en">what gmail does</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If your account’s email address ends in @gmail.com, you usually can’t change it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I love the “usually”. I guess in certain, mysterious cases it’s possible to change it? In any case, making a random, numeric user ID immutable is fine. But if that user ID contains letters and is user-selected, making it immutable is an unacceptable solution for real-world situations. Whether it contains a user’s deadname, or an old nickname they don’t go by any longer, or even for those of us who, in sixth grade, decided “lordjubjub” would be an excellent and professional email address (just a hypothetical example, of course), usernames need to be editable. If they’re editable, why not avoid all these username troubles and just go for a fully-Unicode, non-unique display name instead?</p>
<h2>Username Alternatives</h2>
<p>250 million people have registered for Discord, a chat app similar to Slack or IRC. However, unlike Slack and IRC whose usernames are local to a particular server, Discord has just one server, and usernames are universal. With 250 million users in a single username …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>The popular anti-cheat <a href="https://battleye.com/">BattlEye</a> is widely used by modern online games such as <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/">Escape from Tarkov</a> and is considered an industry standard anti-cheat by many. In this article I will demonstrate a method I have been utilizing for the past year, which enables you to play any BattlEye-protected game online without even having to install BattlEye.</p><p>BattlEye is dynamically loaded by the respective game on startup to initialize the software service (“BEService”) and kernel driver (“BEDaisy”). These two components are critical in ensuring the integrity of the game, but the most critical component by far is the usermode library (“BEClient”) that the game interacts with directly. This module exports two functions: <code>GetVer</code> and more importantly <code>Init</code>.</p><p>The <em>Init</em> routine is what the game will call, but this functionality has never been documented before, as people mostly focus on BEDaisy or their <a href="https://secret.club/tags#battleye">shellcode</a>. Most important routines in <em>BEClient</em>, including <em>Init</em>, are protected and virtualised by <a href="https://vmpsoft.com/">VMProtect</a>, which we are able to devirtualise and reverse engineer thanks to <a href="https://github.com/vtil-project">vtil</a> by secret club member <a href="https://secret.club/author/can1357">Can Boluk</a>, but the inner workings of <em>BEClient</em> is a topic for a later part of this series, so here is a quick summary.</p><p><em>Init</em> and its arguments have the following definitions:</p><pre><code><span>// BEClient_x64!Init</span>

</code></pre><p>As seen, these are quite simple containers for interopability between the game and <em>BEClient</em>. <code>becl_game_data</code> is defined by the game and contains functions that <em>BEClient</em> needs to call (for example, send_packet) while <code>becl_be_data</code> is defined by <em>BEClient</em> and contains callbacks used by the game after initialisation (for example, received_packet). Note that these two structures slightly differ in some games that have special functionality, such as the recently introduced packet encryption in <em>Escape from Tarkov</em> that we’ve already <a href="https://secret.club/2020/06/19/battleye-packet-encryption.html">cracked</a>. Older versions of BattlEye (DayZ, Arma, etc.) use a completely different approach with function pointer swap hooks to intercept traffic communication, and therefore these structures don’t apply.</p><p>A simple <em>Init</em> implementation would look like this:</p><pre><code><span>// BEClient_x64!Init</span>
<span>__declspec</span>(dllexport)
battleye<span>::</span>instance_status Init(std<span>::</span><span>uint64_t</span> integration_version,

    <span>return</span> battleye<span>::</span>instance_status<span>::</span>SUCCESSFULLY_INITIALIZED;
}
</code></pre><p>This would allow our custom BattlEye client to receive packets sent from the game server’s <em>BEServer</em> module.</p><p>The function <code>received_packet</code> is by far the most important routine used by the game, as it handles incoming packets from the BattlEye server component. BattlEye communication is extremely simple compared to how important the integrity of it is. In recent versions of BattlEye, packets follow the same general structure:</p><pre><code><span>#pragma pack(push, 1)
</span><span>struct</span> <span>be_fragment</span>
{
    std<span>::</span><span>uint8_t</span> count;
    std<span>::</span><span>uint8_t</span> index;
};

<span>struct</span> <span>be_packet_header</span>
{
    std<span>::</span><span>uint8_t</span> id;
    std<span>::</span><span>uint8_t</span> sequence;
};

<span>struct</span> <span>be_packet</span> <span>:</span> be_packet_header
{
    <span>union</span> 
    {
        be_fragment fragment;

        <span>// DATA STARTS AT body[1] IF PACKET IS FRAGMENTED</span>
        <span>struct</span>
        {
            <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>uint8_t</span> no_fragmentation_flag;
            std<span>::</span><span>uint8_t</span> body[<span>0</span>];
        };
    };
    <span>inline</span> <span>bool</span> fragmented()
    {
        <span>return</span> <span>this</span><span>-&gt;</span>fragment.count <span>!=</span> <span>0x00</span>;
    }
};
<span>#pragma pack(pop)
</span></code></pre><p>All packets have an identifier and a sequence number (which is used by the requests/response communication and the heartbeat). Requests and responses have a fragmentation mode which allows <em>BEServer</em> and <em>BEClient</em> to send packets in chunks of <code>0x400</code> bytes (seemingly arbitrary) instead of sending one big packet.</p><p>In the current iteration of BattlEye, the following packets are used for communication:</p><h3 id="init-00"> <a href="#init-00">INIT (<code>00</code>)</a></h3><p>This packet is sent to the <em>BEClient</em> module as soon as the connection with the game server has been established. This packet is only transmitted once, contains no data besides the packet id <code>00</code> and the response to this packet is simply <code>00 05</code>.</p><h3 id="start-02"> <a href="#start-02">START (‘02’)</a></h3><p>This packet is sent right after the ‘INIT’ packets have been exchanged, and contains the server-generated guid of the client. The response of this packet is simply the header: <code>02 00</code></p><h3 id="request-04--response-05"> <a href="#request-04--response-05">REQUEST (<code>04</code>) / RESPONSE (<code>05</code>)</a></h3><p>This type of packet is sent from <em>BEServer</em> to <em>BEClient</em> to request (and in rare cases, simply transmit) data, and <em>BEClient</em> will send back data for that request using the <code>RESPONSE</code> packet type.</p><p>The first request contains crucial information such as service- and integration version, not responding to it will get you disconnected by the game server. Afterwards, requests are game specific.</p><h3 id="heartbeat-09"> <a href="#heartbeat-09">HEARTBEAT (<code>09</code>)</a></h3><p>This type of packet is used by the <em>BEServer</em> module to ensure that the connection hasn’t been dropped. It is sent every 30 seconds using a sequential index, and if the client doesn’t respond with the same packet, the client is disconnected from the game server. This heartbeat packet is only three bytes long, with the sequential index used for synchronization being incremental and therefore easily emulated. An example heartbeat could be: <code>09 01 00</code>, which is the second heartbeat (sequence starts at zero) transmitted.</p><p>With this knowledge, it is possible by emulating the entire BattlEye anti-cheat with only two proprietary points of data: the responses for request sequence one and two. These can be intercepted using a tool such as wireshark and replayed as many times as you want for the respective game, because the packet encryption used by BattlEye is static and contextless.</p><p>Emulating the <code>INIT</code> packet is as stated simply responding with the sequence number five:</p><pre><code><span>case</span> battleye:<span>:</span>packet_id<span>::</span>INIT<span>:</span>
{
    <span>auto</span> info_packet <span>=</span> battleye<span>::</span>be_packet{};
    info_packet.id       <span>=</span> battleye<span>::</span>packet_id<span>::</span>INIT;
    info_packet.sequence <span>=</span> <span>0x05</span>;

    battleye<span>::</span>delegate<span>::</span>o_send_packet(<span>&amp;</span>info_packet, <span>sizeof</span>(info_packet));
    <span>break</span>;
}
</code></pre><p>Emulating the <code>START</code> packet is done by replying with the received packet’s header:</p><pre><code><span>case</span> battleye:<span>:</span>packet_id<span>::</span>START<span>:</span>
{
    battleye<span>::</span>delegate<span>::</span>o_send_packet(received_packet, <span>sizeof</span>(battleye<span>::</span>be_packet_header));
    <span>break</span>;
}
</code></pre><p>Emulating the <code>HEARTBEAT</code> packets is done by replying with the received packet:</p><pre><code><span>case</span> battleye:<span>:</span>packet_id<span>::</span>HEARTBEAT<span>:</span>    
{
    battleye<span>::</span>delegate<span>::</span>o_send_packet(received_packet, length);
    <span>break</span>;
}
</code></pre><p>Emulating the <code>REQUEST</code> packets can be done by replaying previously generated responses, which can be logged with code hooks or man-in-the-middle software. These packets are game specific and some games might disconnect you for not handling a specific request, but most games only require the first two requests to be handled, afterwards simply replying with the packet header is enough to not get disconnected by the game server. It is important to notice that all <code>REQUEST</code> packets are immediately responded to with the header, to let the server know that the client is aware of the request. This is how BottlEye emulates them:</p><pre><code><span>case</span> battleye:<span>:</span>packet_id<span>::</span>REQUEST<span>:</span>
{
    <span>// IF NOT FRAGMENTED RESPOND IMMEDIATELY, ELSE ONLY RESPOND TO THE LAST FRAGMENT</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>auto</span> respond <span>=</span> 
        <span>!</span>header<span>-&gt;</span>fragmented() <span>||</span> 
        (header<span>-&gt;</span>fragment.index <span>==</span> header<span>-&gt;</span>fragment.count <span>-</span> <span>1</span>);

    <span>if</span> (<span>!</span>respond)
        <span>return</span>;

    <span>// SEND BACK HEADER</span>
    battleye<span>::</span>delegate<span>::</span>o_send_packet(received_packet, <span>sizeof</span>(battleye<span>::</span>be_packet_header));

    <span>switch</span> (header<span>-&gt;</span>sequence)
    {
    <span>case</span> <span>0x01</span>:
    {
        battleye<span>::</span>delegate<span>::</span>respond(header<span>-&gt;</span>sequence,
            {
                <span>// REDACTED BUFFER</span>
            });
        <span>break</span>;
    }
    <span>case</span> <span>0x02</span>:
    {
        battleye<span>::</span>delegate<span>::</span>respond(header<span>-&gt;</span>sequence, 
            {    
                <span>// REDACTED BUFFER</span>
            });
        <span>break</span>;
    }
    <span>default:</span>
        <span>break</span>;
    }
    <span>break</span>;
}
</code></pre><p>Which uses the following helper function for responses:</p><pre><code><span>void</span> battleye<span>::</span>d…</code></pre></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>We know that we can use the service of LoadBalancer in the Kubernetes cluster to expose backend workloads externally. Cloud providers often offer cloud LoadBalancer plugins, which requires the cluster to be deployed on a specific IaaS platform. However, many enterprise users often deploy the Kubernetes cluster on bare metal, especially when it is used for the production environment. For the local bare metal cluster, Kubernetes does not provide LB implementation. Porter is an open source load balancer designed specifically for the bare metal Kubernetes cluster, which serves as an excellent solution to this problem.</p><h2 id="kubernetes-service-introduction">Kubernetes Service Introduction</h2><p>In the Kubernetes cluster, network represents a very basic and important part. For large-scale nodes and containers, it entails very complicated and delicate design if it is to ensure the connectivity and efficiency in the network. What’s more, IP addresses and ports need to be automatically assigned and managed in the network, with a user-friendly approach in place for the direct and quick access to applications in need.</p><p>Kubernetes has made great efforts in this connection. With CNI, Service, DNS and Ingress, it has solved the problem of service discovery and load balancing, providing an easier way in usage and configuration. Among them, Service underlies Kubernetes microservices. And services are made possible through kube-proxy in Kubernetes.</p><p>This component runs on each node, monitoring the change in the service object in API Server and achieving network forwarding by managing iptables. Users can create different forms of Services such as those based on Label Selector, Headless or ExternalName. Kube-proxy will create a virtual IP (or cluster IP) for the service for the internal access of the cluster.</p><h2 id="three-methods-to-expose-services">Three Methods to Expose Services</h2><p>If the access is required outside the cluster, or to expose the service to users, Kubernetes Service provides two methods: NodePort and LoadBalancer. Besides, Ingress is also a very common option to expose services.</p><h3 id="nodeport">NodePort</h3><p>If the service type is set to NodePort, kube-proxy will apply for a port for the service which is above 3000 (by default). Iptables rules will be configured for all the hosts in the cluster. In this way, users can access the service through any node in the cluster with the assigned port. Please see the image below:</p><p><img src="https://pek3b.qingstor.com/kubesphere-docs/png/20200611115837.png" alt="NodePort"></p><p>NodePort is the most convenient way to expose services while it also has obvious shortcomings:</p><ol><li>The real IP is not visible in Pod through the access based on SNAT.</li><li>A host in the cluster is used as a jumper server to access the backend service, which means all the traffic will go to the server first. This can easily lead to performance bottlenecks and a single point of failure, making it difficult to be used in the production environment.</li><li>Generally, NodePort uses large port numbers which are hard to remember.</li></ol><p>Initially, NodePort is not designed for the exposure of services in the production environment which is why large port numbers are used by default.</p><h3 id="loadbalancer">LoadBalancer</h3><p>LoadBalancer is a preferred solution by Kubernetes to service exposure. However, this cannot be done without the load balancer offered by cloud providers, which means the Kubernetes cluster has to be deployed in the cloud. Here is how LoadBalancer works:</p><p><img src="https://pek3b.qingstor.com/kubesphere-docs/png/20200611115859.png" alt="LoadBalancer"></p><p>The LoadBalancer service is achieved through the LB plugin offered by cloud providers. The package Kubernetes.io/cloud-provider will choose the appropriate backend service and expose it to the LB plugin, which creates a load balancer accordingly. That means network traffic will be distributed in the cloud service, avoiding a single point of failure and performance bottlenecks that may occur in NodePort. As mentioned above, LoadBalancer is a preferred solution by Kubernetes to service exposure, but it is only limited to the Kubernetes service offered by cloud providers. For the Kubernetes cluster that is deployed in a bare metal environment or in a non-cloud environment, this approach may not be applicable.</p><h3 id="ingress">Ingress</h3><p>Kubernetes itself does not provide the way to expose services through Ingress. Rather, Ingress exposes multiple services simultaneously with the help of applications just like a router. This plugin identifies different services through domains and uses annotations to control the way services are exposed externally. Here is how it works:</p><p><img src="https://pek3b.qingstor.com/kubesphere-docs/png/20200611115920.png" alt="Ingress"></p><p>Ingress is the most used method in a business environment than NodePort and LoadBalancer. The reasons include:</p><ol><li>Compared with the load balancing way of kube-proxy, Ingress Controller is more capable (e.g. traffic control and security strategy).</li><li>It is more direct to identify services through domains; large port numbers in NodePort are also not needed for Ingress.</li></ol><p>Nevertheless, the following problems need to be solved for Ingress:</p><ol><li>Ingress is used more often for L7, with limited support for L4.</li><li>All the traffic will go to Ingress Controller, which requires a LB to expose Ingress Controller.</li></ol><p>For the first problem, Ingress can be used for L4 but the configuration of Ingress is too complicated for L4 applications. The best practice is to use LB directly for exposure. For the second problem, Ingress Controller can be exposed in a test environment with NodePort (or hostnetwork), while a single point of failure and performance bottlenecks may happen inevitably and the HA feature of Ingress-controller has not been properly used.</p><h2 id="porter-introduction">Porter Introduction</h2><p><a href="https://porterlb.io/">Porter</a> is an open source cloud native load balancing plugin designed by the KubeSphere development team based on Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). It meanly features:</p><ol><li>ECMP routing load balancing</li><li>BGP dynamic routing configuration</li><li>VIP management</li></ol><p><img src="https://pek3b.qingstor.com/kubesphere-docs/png/20200611120450.png" alt="Portter"></p><p>All Porter codes are open source and documents are available in <a href="https://github.com/kubesphere/porter">GitHub</a>. You are welcome to star and use it.</p><h2 id="how-to-install-porter">How to Install Porter</h2><p>Porter has been deployed and tested in two environments so far as below. You can see more details in GitHub about the deployment, test and process by clicking the link below. It is recommended to have a try:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/kubesphere/porter/blob/master/doc/deploy_baremetal.md">Deploy Porter on Bare Metal Kubernetes Cluster</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/kubesphere/porter/blob/master/doc/simulate_with_bird.md">Test in the QingCloud Platform Using a Simulated Router</a></li></ul><h2 id="principle">Principle</h2><h3 id="ecmp">ECMP</h3><p>Equal-Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) means the package forwarding to a same destination can occur along multiple paths of equal cost. When the device supports ECMP, the three-layer traffic that is sent to the target IP or network segment can be distributed by different paths, achieving network load balancing. Besides, once a certain path malfunctions, other paths can finish the forwarding process instead, serving as the routing redundant backup. Please refer to the image below:</p><p><img src="https://pek3b.qingstor.com/kubesphere-docs/png/20200611115936.png" alt="ECMP Principle"></p><p>With the help of the virtual router, ECMP can select the next hop (Pod) according to Hash algorithm from the existing routing paths for a certain IP (the corresponding VIP of the service). This is how load balancing is achieved. As virtual routers support ECMP in general, Porter only needs to check the Kubernetes API server and deliver the corresponding information of backend Pod of a service to the router.</p><h3 id="bgp">BGP</h3><p>A Pod may be scheduled to other nodes in Kubernetes. For a router, the next hop of a service VIP is not fixed as the equal-cost routing information will often be updated. Calico, for example, uses BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) to advertise routes. BGP is a commonly used essential decentralized protocol to exchange routing information among autonomous systems on the Internet. Unlike other routing protocols, BGP uses L4 to ensure the update security of routing information. As BGP is decentralized, it is very easy to establish a routing layer of high availability to ensure network continuity.</p><p><img src="https://pek3b.qingstor.com/kubesphere-docs/png/20200611120800.png" alt="BGP"></p><p>The image above briefly demonstrates how BGP works in Porter. At the bottom left, it is a two-node Kubernetes cluster with two routers (Leaf1 and Leaf2) above it. These two routers are connected to two kernel switches (Spine layer). Users are on the right side, whose routers are Border1 and Border2 (also connected to Spine).</p><p>The three layers of users and Kubernetes server are reachable. Services are created in the Kubernetes cluster and Porter is also used. A VIP (or other manually assigned IP) 1.1.1.1 is assigned by Porter, which sends the information to Leaf1 and Leaf2 through BGP. The next hop to access 1.1.1.1 can be Node1 or Node2. Meanwhile, the Leaf layer also sends the message to the Spine layer, which also knows the next hop to access 1.1.1.1 can be Leaf1 or Leaf2 based on its BGP.</p><p>According to the same logic, the routing information will also be updated on Border, meaning the path for users to access 1.1.1.1 is complete. At the same time, as each layer in the image features HA, a total of 16 (<code>2*2*2*2</code>) paths are available to use for external access. Traffic can be distributed across the network and any downtime that occurs in the router in any layer will not affect user’s access.</p><h2 id="architecture">Architecture</h2><p><img src="https://pek3b.qingstor.com/kubesphere-docs/png/20200611120827.png" alt="Porter Architecture"></p><p>Porter has two components: a core controller and an agent deployed on each node. The main functions of the controller include:</p><ol><li>Monitor cluster Services and corresponding endpoints; acquire the Scheduling information of Pods</li><li>VIP storage and assignment</li><li>Establish BGP and advertise routes</li></ol><p><img src="https://pek3b.qingstor.com/kubesphere-docs/png/20200611120857.png" alt="Porter Logic"></p><p>The image above shows the working principle of Porter’s core controller.</p><p>Agent is a lightweight component to monitor VIP resources and add Iptables rules for external access to the VIP. By default, the kernel Forward table will drop any external access to VIP.</p><h2 id="designed-for-cloud-natives">Designed for Cloud Natives</h2><p>All resources in Porter are CRD, including VIP, BGPPeer and BGPConfig. Users who are used to Kubectl will find Porter very easy to use. For advanced users who want to customize Porter, Kubernetes API can be called directly for tailor-made development. The core controller of Porter will soon support high availability (HA).</p><h2 id="cautions">Cautions</h2><p>The VIP traffic of user access will go to a node in the Kubernetes cluster under BGP. This is because the routes advertised by Porter are also nodes instead of Pod IP which is inaccessible externally. The path from a node to a pod is maintained by kube-proxy as below:</p><p><img src="https://pek3b.qingstor.com/kubesphere-docs/png/20200611120948.png" alt="Cautions"></p><p>The traffic will be sent to a pod randomly after the SNAT …</p></div></div></div>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Recently I came across Einstein’s Special Relativity again and found I was very confused about the knowledge I once learned in college, so I think I would be better document it in case I forgot again in the future.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would discuss the Special Relativity and mainly focus on the Lorentz transformation.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<p>This is a collection of the definitions of some of the fundamental concepts in physics that are key to understanding Special Relativity.</p>

<h4 id="spacetime">Spacetime</h4>

<p>In physics, spacetime is any mathematical model which fuses the three dimensions of space and the one dimension of time into a single four-dimensional manifold.</p>

<h4 id="event">Event</h4>

<p>A position in spacetime is called an event, and requires four numbers to be specified: the three-dimensional location in space, plus the position in time. An event is something that happens instantaneously at a single point in spacetime, represented by a set of coordinates $x$, $y$, $z$ and $t$.</p>

<h4 id="frame-of-reference">Frame of Reference</h4>

<p>In physics, a frame of reference (or reference frame) consists of an abstract coordinate system and the set of physical reference points that uniquely fix (locate and orient) the coordinate system and standardize measurements within that frame.</p>

<h4 id="inertial-frame-of-reference">Inertial Frame of Reference</h4>

<p>An inertial frame of reference in classical physics and special relativity possesses the property that in this frame of reference a body with zero net force acting upon it does not accelerate; that is, such a body is at rest or moving at a constant velocity.</p>

<h3 id="postulates-of-special-relativity">Postulates of Special Relativity</h3>

<p>Einstein’s Special Relativity is derived based on the following two postulates or assumptions. Although they are postulates, there have not been too many problems for them as suggested by the experimental evidence.</p>

<h4 id="first-postulate-principle-of-relativity">First Postulate (Principle of Relativity)</h4>

<p>The laws of physics take the same form in all inertial frames of reference.</p>

<h4 id="second-postulate-invariance-of-light-speed">Second Postulate (Invariance of Light Speed)</h4>

<p>As measured in any inertial frame of reference, light is always propagated in empty space with a definite velocity $c$ that is independent of the state of motion of the emitting body. It is also equivalent to say, the speed of light in free space has the same value $c$ in all inertial frames of reference.</p>



<p>The experiments we have conducted so far, such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson%E2%80%93Morley_experiment">Michelson-Morley experiment</a>, all support the invariance of light speed.</p>

<h3 id="lorentz-transformation">Lorentz Transformation</h3>

<p>With the two postulates of Special Relativity only, Einstein was able to derive the Lorentz transformation, which is the core of special relativity. The Lorentz transformation was named after Hendrik Lorentz because he and his coworkers happened to find the exact same transformation to explain the invariance of light speed although based on the conjecture of the existence of aether which later turns out not exist.</p>



<p>I would write another article on how to derive Lorentz transformation based on the two postulates for special relativity in the future.</p>

<h4 id="definitions">Definitions</h4>

<p>In the spacetime, we have two reference frames, a reference frame $S$ and another reference frame $S’$ moving at a velocity $v$ with respect to it. So the two reference frames in this scenario are inertial reference frame. The coordinate axes in each reference frame are parallel, i.e., the $x$ and $x’$ axes are parallel, the $y$ and $y’$ axes are parallel, and the $z$ and $z’$ axes are parallel, and remain mutually perpendicular. We assume the relative motion is along the coincident $xx’$ axes. At $t = t’ = 0$, the origins of both coordinate systems are the same, $(x,y,z) = (x’,y’,z’) = (0, 0, 0)$.</p>



<p>An event in the time space could be observed and recorded by the observers on the two reference frames using spacetime coordinates $(t,x,y,z)$ in the reference frame $S$ and $(t’,x’,y’,z’)$ in the reference frame $S’$, respectively.</p>

<h4 id="lorentz-boost">Lorentz Boost</h4>

<p>The Lorentz transformation is linear transformation. It may include a rotation of space; a rotation-free Lorentz transformation is called a Lorentz boost. We are only focusing on the Lorentz boost in this article.</p>



<p>where</p>



<p>and it is the Lorentz factor.</p>



<p>The Lorentz boost could also be thought as transforming the event coordinate observed from the rest reference frame to the motion reference frame. It is consider considered as tensor transformation.</p>



<p>where</p>



<h4 id="inverse-lorentz-boost">Inverse Lorentz Boost</h4>

<p>It is also straightforward to get the inverse Lorentz boost from the Lorentz boost.</p>



<p>We could also write the inverse Lorentz boost using tensor transformations.</p>



<p>Note that the transformation matrices used in the Lorentz transformation and the inverse Lorentz transformation are inverse to each other.</p>



<h4 id="lorentz-coordinate-differences">Lorentz Coordinate Differences</h4>

<p>Suppose we have two events, one event has coordinates $(t_1,x_1,y_1,z_1)$ observed in the reference frame $S$ and coordinates $(t’_1,x’_1,y’_1,z’_1)$ observed in the reference frame $S’$, another one has coordinates $(t_2,x_2,y_2,z_2)$ observed in the reference frame $S$ and coordinates $(t’_2,x’_2,y’_2,z’_2)$ observed in the reference frame $S’$. Note that because reference frame $S’$ is moving along the $xx’$ axes, $y_1 = y’_1$, $z_1 = z’_1$, $y_2 = y’_2$, $z_2 = z’_2$.</p>



<p>We could calculate the coordinate differences between these two events in both the reference frame $S$ and $S’$.</p>



<p>We define the difference between coordinates $t’$ and $x’$ in the reference frame $S’$ are as follows.</p>



<p>Similarly, the difference between coordinates $t$ and $x$ in the reference frame $S$ are as follows.</p>



<p>We plug in the Lorentz boost and the inverse Lorentz boost into the coordinate differences in the reference frame $S’$.</p>



<p>Similarly, the coordinate differences in the reference frame $S$ are</p>



<h3 id="lorentz-transformation-consequences">Lorentz Transformation Consequences</h3>

<p>The equations for $\Delta y$, $\Delta y^{\prime}$, $\Delta z$, and $\Delta z^{\prime}$ are not interesting because it matches our “conventions”. However, from the equations for $\Delta t$, $\Delta x^{\prime}$, we would find some non-trivial consequences. Relativity of simultaneity, time dilation, and length contraction are the most famous ones.</p>

<h4 id="relativity-of-simultaneity">Relativity of Simultaneity</h4>

<p>Because of the following coordinate difference we have just derived</p>



<p>If the two events are observed to happen simultaneously in the reference frame $S$, i.e., $\Delta t = 0$, these two events might not be seen simultaneously in the reference frame $S’$, i.e., $\Delta t^{\prime}$ might not be 0.</p>



<p>When $\Delta t = 0$,</p>



<p>In most cases, $\Delta t^{\prime} \neq 0$ unless the two events were observed to happen on the same $x$ coordinates in the reference frame $S$, i.e.,  $\Delta x = 0$. $\Delta y$ and $\Delta z$ do not have to be zero though.</p>



<p>Here is a concrete example. If you are traveling on an extremely fast rocket, and there are two events (on two locations along the direction you are traveling) that are seen simultaneously by the people on earth. However, in your eyes, these two events did not happen simultaneously.</p>

<h4 id="time-dilation">Time Dilation</h4>

<p>Because of the following coordinate difference we have just derived</p>



<p>If the two events are observed to happen on the same $x$ coordinates from the reference frame $S$, the time between the two events observed from the reference frame $S’$ is longer than what is observed from the reference frame $S$.</p>



<p>When $\Delta x = 0$,</p>



<p>Note that because the velocity of everything which has mass could not be greater or equal than $c$, for things that have mass, $\gamma &gt; 1$. Then we have</p>



<p>Here is a concrete example. If you are traveling on an extremely fast rocket, and there is a guy jumping on the early (no change in $x$ before he jumped and after he landed). It is measured 0.1 seconds for this jump on earth. However, you would measure probably 1 year for this jump. Then you would think, wow this jump is so slow.</p>



<p>In addition, because of the following coordinate difference we have just derived</p>



<p>If the two events are observed to happen on the same $x’$ coordinates from the reference frame $S’$, the time between the two events observed from the reference frame $S$ is longer than what is observed from the reference frame $S’$.</p>



<p>When $\Delta x^{\prime} = 0$,</p>



<p>Then</p>



<p>Here is a concrete example. If you are traveling on an extremely fast rocket, and you are jumping in the spaceship (no change in $x’$ before you jumped and after he landed). It is measured 0.1 seconds for this jump in your spaceship. However, the people on earth would measure probably 1 year for this jump. Then the people on the earth would think, wow this jump is so slow.</p>



<p>This is the interesting part. You on the spaceship see the people on the earth are moving extremely slow and their clock moving is slower than yours, whereas the people on the earth see you on the spaceship are moving extremely slow and your clock moving is slower than theirs. You on the spaceship would think you would die much earlier than the people on the earth, whereas the people on the earth would think they would die much earlier than you on the spaceship.</p>

<h4 id="length-contraction">Length Contraction</h4>

<p>We can use a measuring rod to determine the distance between two events along the $xx’$ axes ($\Delta x$ or $\Delta x^{\prime}$) simultaneously ($\Delta t = 0$ or $\Delta t^{\prime} = 0$) from any reference frame.</p>



<p>Suppose a measuring rod is at rest and aligned along the $x$-axis in the reference frame $S$. The length of the rod is $\Delta x$. To measure $\Delta x^{\prime}$ in the reference frame $S’$, the events of the two rod ends have to be measured simultaneously in the reference frame $S’$, which means $\Delta t^{\prime} = 0$.</p>



<p>We plug in $\Delta t^{\prime} = 0$ into</p>



<p>We get</p>



<p>Therefore,</p>



<p>and</p>



<p>The length of the rod measured in the reference frame $S’$ is shorter than the length of the rod measured in it resting reference frame $S$.</p>



<p>Suppose a measuring rod is at rest and aligned along the $x’$-axis in the reference frame $S’$. The length of the rod is $\Delta x’$. To measure $\Delta x$ in the reference frame $S$, the events of the two rod ends have to be measured simultaneously …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><p>Match expression syntax is one of the nicest features in PHP 8 that improves the <code>switch</code> syntax in multiple ways. </p>
<pre><code>$status = match($request_method) {
    'post' =&gt; $this-&gt;handlePost(),
    'get', 'head' =&gt;  $this-&gt;handleGet(),
    default =&gt; throw new \Exception('Unsupported'),
};</code></pre>
<p>Functionality from the <code>match</code> expression above, compared to a <code>switch</code> block:</p>
<pre><code>- switch ($request_method) {
+ $status = match($request_method) {
-   case 'post':
-       $status = $this-&gt;handlePost();
-       break;
+   'post' =&gt; $this-&gt;handlePost(),
-   case 'get':
-   case 'head':
-       $status = $this-&gt;handleGet();
-       break;
+   'get', 'head' =&gt;  $this-&gt;handleGet(),
-   default:
-       throw new \Exception('Unsupported'); 
+   default =&gt; throw new \Exception('Unsupported'),
- }
+ };</code></pre>
<h2><a id="return" href="#return"></a><code>match</code> expressions can return a value </h2>
<p>The return value of the expression used in each "arm" (similar to each <code>case</code> in <code>switch</code> blocks) is can be assigned to a variable.</p>
<pre><code>$name = match(2) {
    1 =&gt; 'One',
    2 =&gt; 'Two',
};

echo $name; // "Two"</code></pre>
<p>It is not necessary to assign the return value to anything, the return value of the matched arm will be returned from the <code>match</code> expression. </p>
<h2><a id="multiple-conditions" href="#multiple-conditions"></a>Multiple matching conditions allowed </h2>
<p>It is possible for a <code>match</code> expression to contain one or more matching conditions, and they will behave similar to multiple cascading <code>case</code> keys in a <code>switch</code> block. </p>
<pre><code>match($request_method) {
    'post' =&gt; $this-&gt;handlePost(),
    'get', 'head' =&gt;  $this-&gt;handleGet(),
};</code></pre>
<p><code>$request_method === 'get'</code> and <code>$request_method === 'head'</code> both conditions will be handled with <code>$this-&gt;handleGet()</code>. </p>
<h2><a id="expression-only" href="#expression-only"></a>Each matching case must only contain one expression </h2>
<p>Unlike <code>switch</code> blocks that can contain any number of expressions, a <code>match</code> arm can only contain only one expression. </p>
<pre><code>match($name) {
    'foo' =&gt; 
        initFoo();
        processFoo();
};</code></pre>
<p>Syntax above is <strong>not allowed</strong>. Each arm must contain only a single expression.</p>
<h2><a id="break" href="#break"></a>Implicit <code>break</code> </h2>
<p>Each matched "arm" of a <code>match</code> expression only allows a single expression, and it will not fall-through, as it does in a <code>switch</code> block. </p>
<pre><code>switch ('test') {
    case 'test':
        $this-&gt;sendTestAlert();
    case 'send':
        $this-&gt;sendNuclearAlert();
}</code></pre>
<p>It is easy to overlook the missing <code>break</code> call in each of the <code>switch</code> <code>case</code>, which allows the code to fall-through to the next case. In the <code>switch</code> block above, missing <code>break;</code> statement makes the code fall-through and execute <code>$this-&gt;sendNuclearAlert()</code> as well, although it is unlikely the outcome you expect. </p>
<pre><code>match ('test') {
    'test' =&gt; $this-&gt;sendTestAlert(),
    'send' =&gt; $this-&gt;sendNuclearAlert(),
};</code></pre>
<p><code>match</code> expressions work without explicit <code>break</code> statements. It only  executes one matching arm, and immediately returns the value, making it imply a <code>break</code> call right after the expression the matched arm executes. </p>
<h2><a id="default" href="#default"></a><code>default</code> case </h2>
<p><code>match</code> statement supports a <code>default</code> arm that will work similar to the <code>default</code> case in <code>switch</code> blocks. </p>
<p>A <code>default</code> arm will catch all expressions if none of the other conditions matched. </p>
<pre><code>match ('Qux') {
    'foo' =&gt; ...,
    'bar' =&gt; ...,
    default =&gt; echo 'Unknown: ' . $name,
};

// "Unknown: Qux"</code></pre>
<h2><a id="must-match" href="#must-match"></a><code>match</code> expression MUST match a condition </h2>
<p><code>switch</code> blocks silently proceeds the code flow if there are no matching <code>case</code> keys. <code>match</code> expressions do not. </p>
<p>In a <code>match</code> expression, there <strong>must</strong> be condition that matches the expression, or a <code>default</code> case to handle it. If there are no matches, <code>match</code> expression throws an <code>\UnhandledMatchError</code> exception.</p>
<pre><code>$value = 3;
match($value) {
    1 =&gt; 'One',
    2 =&gt; 'Two',
};</code></pre>
<p><code>match</code> expression above throws error:</p>
<pre><code>Fatal error: Uncaught UnhandledMatchError in ...</code></pre>
<h2><a id="UnhandledMatchError" href="#UnhandledMatchError"></a><code>UnhandledMatchError</code> exception </h2>
<p><code>match</code> expressions throw an <code>\UnhandledMatchError</code> exception if there are no matches in within the expression.</p>
<p><code>\UnhandledMatchError</code> is a new exception class in PHP 8, and it extends <code>\Error</code>. For a full hierarchy of all PHP core exception classes, including the ones added in PHP 8, see <a href="https://php.watch/articles/PHP-exception-hierarchy">Hierarchy of PHP exceptions</a></p>
<p>This class can be easily poly-filled:</p>
<pre><code>class UnhandledMatchError extends \Error {}</code></pre>
<h2><a id="strict" href="#strict"></a>Strict matches without type coercion </h2>
<p>One of the most important design choices in <code>match</code> expression is that it matches without type coercion. </p>
<pre><code>function read(mixed $key): string {
    return match ($key) {
        1 =&gt; 'Integer 1',
        '1' =&gt; 'String 1',
        true =&gt; 'Bool true',
        [] =&gt; 'Empty array',
        [1] =&gt; 'Array [1]',
    };
}

read(1); // "Integer 1"
read('1'); // "String 1"
read(true); // "Bool true"</code></pre>
<p>In a typical <code>switch</code> block, its cases are matched loosely, i.e with <code>==</code>. In <code>match</code> expressions, all matching arms are matched with strict comparison (<code>===</code>), leaving possible bugs in <code>switch</code> blocks out. </p>
<p>In the snippet above, each individual arm will be matched for the value <em>and</em> type. </p>
<h2><a id="expressions" href="#expressions"></a>Match against arbitrary expressions </h2>
<p><code>match</code> expression allows a given value to be matched against an expression. </p>
<pre><code>match($foo){
    404 =&gt; 'Page not found',
    Response::REDIRECT =&gt; 'Redirect',
    $client-&gt;getCode() =&gt; 'Client Error',
    $response-&gt;getCode() =&gt; 'Response Error',
    default =&gt; 'Unknown error'
};</code></pre>
<p>The expressions will be evaluated in the order they are laid out. </p>
<p><code>match</code> expression will try to match <code>$foo</code> against in this order:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>$foo === 404</code></li>
<li><code>$foo === Response::REDIRECT</code></li>
<li><code>$foo === $client-&gt;getCode()</code></li>
<li><code>$foo === $response-&gt;getCode()</code></li>
<li><code>default</code></li>
</ol>
<p>If it finds a positive match, the rest of the code will not be evaluated. </p>

The government allowed restaurants, gyms, shops, playgrounds and most schools to remain open. By contrast, Denmark and Norway opted for strict quarantines, banning large groups and locking down shops and restaurants.</p><p>More than three months later, the coronavirus is blamed for 5,420 deaths in Sweden, according to the <a href="https://covid19.who.int/region/euro/country/se" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">World Health Organization</a>. That might not sound especially horrendous compared with the more than 129,000 Americans who have died. But Sweden is a country of only 10 million people. Per million people, Sweden has suffered 40 percent more deaths than the United States, 12 times more than Norway, seven times more than Finland and six times more than Denmark.</p></div></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/06/business/06sweden-02/merlin_171728283_4312516e-eec8-4ff7-bbce-5e06f49445dc-articleLarge.jpg?quality=90&amp;auto=webp" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/06/business/06sweden-02/merlin_171728283_4312516e-eec8-4ff7-bbce-5e06f49445dc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/06/business/06sweden-02/merlin_171728283_4312516e-eec8-4ff7-bbce-5e06f49445dc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/06/business/06sweden-02/merlin_171728283_4312516e-eec8-4ff7-bbce-5e06f49445dc-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"><img alt="Per million people, Sweden has suffered 40 percent more coronavirus-related deaths than the United States." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/06/business/06sweden-02/merlin_171728283_4312516e-eec8-4ff7-bbce-5e06f49445dc-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/06/business/06sweden-02/merlin_171728283_4312516e-eec8-4ff7-bbce-5e06f49445dc-articleLarge.jpg?quality=90&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/06/business/06sweden-02/merlin_171728283_4312516e-eec8-4ff7-bbce-5e06f49445dc-jumbo.jpg?quality=90&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/06/business/06sweden-02/merlin_171728283_4312516e-eec8-4ff7-bbce-5e06f49445dc-superJumbo.jpg?quality=90&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" decoding="async" itemprop="url" itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/06/business/06sweden-02/merlin_171728283_4312516e-eec8-4ff7-bbce-5e06f49445dc-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale"></picture></div><figcaption><span itemprop="copyrightHolder"><span>Credit...</span><span>Jonathan Nackstrand/Agence France-Presse â€” Getty Images</span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div><p>The elevated death toll resulting from Swedenâ€™s approach has been clear for many weeks. What is only now emerging is how Sweden, despite letting its economy run unimpeded, has still suffered business-destroying, prosperity-diminishing damage, and at nearly the same magnitude of its neighbors.</p></div><div><div><p>Swedenâ€™s <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/sweden-cenbank-forecast/table-swedish-cbank-forecasts-key-rate-at-0-for-coming-years-idUSS3N2AC001" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">central bank</a> expects its economy to contract by 4.5 percent this year, a revision from a previously expected gain of 1.3 percent. The unemployment rate jumped to 9 percent in May from 7.1 percent in March. â€œThe overall damage to the economy means the recovery will be protracted, with unemployment remaining elevated,â€� Oxford Economics concluded in a recent research note.</p><p>This is more or less how damage caused by the pandemic has played out in Denmark, where the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-denmark-economy/denmarks-central-bank-sees-economy-shrink-by-41-this-year-idUSFWN2DT0WQ" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">central bank</a> expects that the economy will shrink 4.1 percent this year, and where joblessness has edged up to 5.6 percent in May from 4.1 percent in March.</p><p>In short, Sweden suffered a vastly higher death rate while failing to collect on the expected economic gains.</p><p>The coronavirus does not stop at national borders. Despite the governmentâ€™s decision to allow the domestic economy to roll on, Swedish businesses are stuck with the same conditions that produced recession everywhere else. And Swedish people responded to the fear of the virus by limiting their shopping â€” not enough to prevent elevated deaths, but enough to produce a decline in business activity.</p><p>Here is one takeaway with potentially universal import: It is simplistic to portray government actions such as quarantines as the cause of economic damage. The real culprit is the virus itself. From Asia to Europe to the Americas, the risks of the pandemic have disrupted businesses while prompting people to avoid shopping malls and restaurants, regardless of official policy.</p></div></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/06/business/06sweden-03/merlin_171448116_dc72db1b-94a8-4bf3-89c9-4ae78673174b-articleLarge.jpg?quality=90&amp;auto=webp" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div></div></div><figcaption><span itemprop="copyrightHolder"><span>Credit...</span><span>Jonathan Nackstrand/Agence France-Presse â€” Getty Images</span></span></figcaption><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/06/business/06sweden-03/merlin_171448116_dc72db1b-94a8-4bf3-89c9-4ae78673174b-articleLarge.jpg?quality=90&amp;auto=webp"></figure></div></div><div><div><p>Sweden is exposed to the vagaries of global trade.

This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;state=default&amp;module=styln-coronavirus-markets&amp;region=MAIN_CONTENT_3&amp;context=storylines_faq">Itâ€™s unclear how often the virus is spread</a> via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes, or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts, who <a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798">have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World Health Organization</a>.</p>

<p>It all began with a scratchy throat on Friday, March 13. A colleague had brought the novel coronavirus back with him from the Austrian ski resort <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/the-ischgl-outbreak-families-of-covid-19-victims-seek-justice-a-bbf9aa92-dfed-42d0-870c-ff9d17125d45" data-link-flag="english">Ischgl</a>. Shortly thereafter, Alexander Riesch, 26, whose name has been changed for this story, also tested positive for the virus.</p>


<div>
<p>"At first I thought, well, at least now you'll have gotten it over with," Riesch says. His doctors also had no doubt: The body of a young, healthy person wouldn't take long to vanquish the virus. They sent Riesch home to recover. But a few days later, he felt so miserable that he had to call an emergency doctor. He spent a week in the hospital.</p><p>Officially, Riesch has been recovered for nearly three months. He has antibodies against the virus in his blood. Yet he still goes through spells in which he feels very sick. So far, none of his doctors have been able to explain why.</p>

<p>In addition to suffering from sore throats that range from mild to severe and seem to come and go at random, his lungs are also still affected. The symptoms didn't begin until after the doctors released him from the hospital and he returned home. A respiratory physician prescribed him an asthma inhaler and advised him to be patient. The cortisone does help a little, Riesch says, but his cough and the tightness in his chest return as soon as he stops taking it.</p>

<div>
<p>There's also the sudden muscle pain. Sometimes the left half of Riesch's body becomes numb, other times he feels so weak that he has to lay down immediately. And that's not even to mention the abdominal pain and nausea, skin rash and severe fatigue.</p><p>Riesch was on sick leave for 10 weeks. Meanwhile, he's back at work as a real estate agent. But every now and then, he has to cancel appointments because he simply feels too exhausted. Most of the time, he tries to live a normal life. "I've come to accept the pain I'm in now."</p><h3>A Very Strange Disease</h3><p>Half a year since the pandemic began, doctors are now observing an increasing number of coronavirus patients like Riesch who are officially recovered but in reality are far from healthy.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>"COVID-19 is very unpredictable," says Timothy Spector of King's College London, who is tracking the course of the disease in more than 200,000 COVID-19 patients over a longer period of time, with the help of a mobile app, as part of a major research project. "I am trained as a rheumatologist, so I am used to strange diseases. But COVID-19 is the strangest disease I know."</p><p>Roughly one in 10 people with the disease continue to suffer from unexplainable symptoms for more than a month, many for more than two months. The most common are exhaustion, headaches, a loss of smell, trouble breathing, dizziness, diarrhea and skin rashes. "And some of our participants still have a fever after three months," Spector says.</p>
</div>

<section>

</section>
<div>
<p>Severe damage to the lungs, heart and nervous system in some people is also of concern. The disease can cause cardiac arrhythmia or even trigger diabetes mellitus. Some patients suffer from severe concentration and memory disorders, much like dementia. Even young people can be affected. More than 1,000 children around the world have contracted multisystem inflammatory syndrome in connection with a SARS-CoV-2 infection, which can lead to myocarditis and circulatory failure.</p><h3>Nothing To Be Done</h3><p>"Many patients say: 'Before the coronavirus infection, I was a different person,'" says the Swiss heart surgeon Paul Vogt. Doctors now fear that the pandemic will leave behind an army of chronically ill people. Some hospitals in Germany are already beginning to set up outpatient clinics for the follow-up care of COVID-19 patients.</p><p>"People tend to think: Either you are dead, or you are healthy again," says the British physician Helen Salisbury. "But it does not work like this."</p><p>For weeks, all people talked about was intensive care units and artificial ventilation. "But now there are all these people, that will maybe be ill for a long time."</p><p>Salisbury treats several people who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and still suffer from exhaustion and bouts of fever or coughing and who quickly get out of breath. "All the tests are normal," she says. "There is no therapy I can offer to them." Many of the chronically sick are young -- and desperate. "But I can do nothing but listen to them," Salisbury says.</p><p>It's still a mystery to experts as to why the symptoms are so persistent and severe even after the patients have supposedly recovered from the disease. Doctors suspect it could be due to malfunctions in the immune system caused by an infection. It's also possible that once the virus succeeds in establishing itself somewhere in the body, it can strike repeatedly.</p><p>Or the lasting ailments could be a consequence of a lack of oxygen during the acute phase of the disease. Young COVID-19 patients in particular often don't notice for a long time just how badly their body is doing.</p><h3>Like Other Viruses</h3><p>Doctors see a parallel to another coronavirus disease. After the SARS pandemic in 2003, doctors continued to notice many chronically sick people, for instance in Toronto, Canada, where the worst outbreak outside of Asia took place. "When I heard of the SARS-CoV-2 long-term patients, I thought: Oh, I was waiting for this," says Harvey Moldofsky, a sleep and pain researcher and a professor emeritus at the University of Toronto.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>A physician, Moldofsky has been a specialist in unusual diseases since early on in his career. That's why he was asked to step in and help after the 2003 SARS pandemic had subsided. "There was a group of 50 people that had all survived SARS, but although they had gone through rehab, they could not go back to work full time," Moldofsky says.</p><p>He interviewed 22 of those people in detail, and the stories he heard all sounded similar. "Over one year post-infection, they were still fatigued, weak, had muscle pain, sleeping problems and could not think straight," says Moldofsky.</p><p>All of these grievances are familiar to experts. Patients suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome also complain of muscle, head and neck pain. Many also speak of a "brain fog" that prevents them from being able to concentrate.</p><p>A number of viruses are believed to cause chronic fatigue syndrome. Among them are the influenza and Epstein-Barr viruses, the latter of which is known to cause infectious mononucleosis, or mono. Researchers now suspect that the strange affliction is, in fact, an autoimmune reaction triggered by the viral infection, which can affect the autonomic nervous system. Other symptoms can include heart palpitations, an increased susceptibility to infection and sleep disorder.</p><h3>Neurological Problems</h3><p>Carmen Scheibenbogen, the head of the outpatient clinic for adult immunodeficiencies at Berlin's Charité University Hospital, is one of the few German experts on chronic fatigue syndrome. Many people with COVID-19 are currently turning to the physician for answers about their odd symptoms.</p><p>But even she has to disappoint them for the time being. A reliable diagnosis can only be made six months after infection. "By then, there's a good chance that everything will calm down on its own," Scheibenbogen says. Only symptoms that last longer than six months are considered chronic. And even then, there are few options for treatment.</p><p>Scheibenbogen advises those affected to take good care of their bodies. "Overexerting oneself or doing sports that exacerbate symptoms should definitely be avoided. This can make things worse," she says.</p><p>In addition to chronic fatigue, COVID-19 patients can also suffer from a number of other neurological complications. "The neuroscience research community is slowly waking up to this," says Benedict Michael, a senior clinician scientist and neurologist at the Health Protection Research Unit and the University of Liverpool. He adds that 20 to 30 percent of patients who require hospitalization develop some neurological complication.</p><p>In late June, Michael and some colleagues published a study on the matter in the medical journal <em>The Lancet Psychiatry</em>. In it, they examined 125 patients who developed neurological problems as a result of COVID-19. Around 60 percent of participants, mainly older people, suffered a stroke after being infected. Close to a third of them showed signs of other cognitive or psychiatric changes, including many younger patients.</p><p>In all, 8 percent of the 125 people examined developed a psychosis in connection with their coronavirus infection. Just under 5 percent developed dementia. "Many young people are still living their lives in the pandemic and do not even think about the fact that there is a potential risk of developing problems for them too," warns Michael.</p><p>At least in some cases it's easy to explain what caused the brain damage. Strokes can occur because COVID-19 often causes blood to clot. It's also known that the SARS-CoV-2 virus can sometimes lead to encephalitis.</p><p>In many other cases, however, the cause of the complications is still unclear. "It is quite possible that this is an immune reaction," Michael says. For some, it could also be a result of stress or a lack of oxygen -- or everything altogether.</p><h3>Not the Only One</h3><p>For many patients, there's still hope that the neurological and psychiatric problems, as well as the other persistent complications like exhaustion, will diminish or eventually disappear.</p><p>The case of the general practitioner Stephanie de Giorgio from Kent in the UK is also cause for hope. The 44-year-old was likely infected by one of her patients. A mother of two, de Giorgio had no risk factors other than mild asthma and being a bit overweight could have been cause for concern. "Well, now it has got me, too," she thought. Fifteen days later, her fever subsided.</p>

We don't have a lot data or code locked away in legacy systems, and we don't have the inertia of established workflows.</p><p>One of our experiments in "how to work" has been surprisingly successful, and that is using <a href="https://jupyter.org/" target="_blank">Jupyter notebooks</a> in the wet lab.</p><p>We initially resisted the idea, even though we were already big fans of Jupyter. Instead, we tried to make purpose-built wet lab tools work for us, but we kept feeling like the problems they were solving were less important than the problems they <em>weren't</em> solving.</p><p>What finally pushed us over the edge was our experience developing a protocol to produce a protein from a new construct. In those kinds of situations, you usually have a basic framework for a protocol, but you need to work out the specifics in the lab — which depend on whatever is "new" about what you're doing.</p><p>We think of those specifics, which include things like time, temperature, and concentration as well as more complicated biological variables, as parameters of an abstract protocol. However, our tools didn't allow us to express the problem this way, and every time we adjusted a "parameter" or some assumption of our protocol, we needed to manually rederive the protocol steps.</p><p>Translating this protocol into a Jupyter notebook allowed us express the protocol design and steps as functions of parameters, which more closely matched our conceptual model. This immediately solved our practical pain points, and it also made scaling up production trivial, since the protocol was paramterized over all inputs.</p><p>We've put together a notebook to illustrate some of the concepts behind our Jupyter workflows. You can play around with a live version using <a href="https://mybinder.org/v2/gl/ivynatal%2Fpublic-notebooks/master">Binder</a> or just view it using <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/gitlab.com/ivynatal/public-notebooks/-/raw/master/jupyter-workflows-wet-lab.ipynb">nbviewer</a> . The source is in a <a href="https://gitlab.com/ivynatal/public-notebooks">GitLab repository</a>.</p><p>We've since transitioned all of our lab protocols and notebooks (and some of our analyses) to Jupyter notebooks, and we've discovered that our Jupyter-based workflows increase documentaiton, reduce data duplication, and ease analysis.</p><p>So far, we haven't had any trouble working with partners or collaborators, because a PDF of a well annotated notebook is as good or better than many alternatives.</p><p>We hope over time to share more details of our workflows because we think they could be useful to other labs. Of course, this approach won't be for everyone; it's technology that our team was already comfortable with, and our switching costs were low.</p><p>We'd love to hear what you think — please <a href="https://www.ivynatal.com/contact" target="_blank">drop us a line</a>!</p><p>—Jeff and Colin</p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>Everyone has the same amount of time in a day, except for the day they are born and the day that they die. Those days are started late and ended early, respectively. Every other day is the same, 24 hours. </p>



<p>Most of what happens within our days are the results of choices, concious or otherwise. I may choose to sleep 8 hours while someone else chooses only to sleep 5. I am sure you have often heard people respond to something that they say they want to do with “I don’t have time”. “I know I should work out but I don’t have time … I wish I spent more time with my kids but I don’t have time … I love to read but I just don’t have time anymore.” These people are either lying to you, or more likely, they are lying to themselves. </p>



<p>Most of us feel we do not have time for things but in reality we do not have the relative desire for them. We may want them, but we do not want them as much as the other things we are doing with our time. If we did, we would do them instead. Importantly, I am not referring to a spoken want but an actual one. I can say I want six pack abs but if I am not willing to put in the physical work to get there I don’t really want that more than the other things I spend my time doing during my days.</p>



<p>Most of the time, most people don’t truly want hardly anything as much as they want to check Instagram or Twitter or email. Of course, these are not the things they want directly but a means towards getting them. A dopamine hit from an Instagram like, a bite size piece of information or entertainment from a Tweet, or a sense of purpose through a feeling that one is needed, good at their job, and therefore good at something because they are known to respond to their emails in less than 10 minutes no matter the hour or the day. I know these things from experience.</p>



<p>The fact is that when one truly wants something and wants it more than everything else competing for the time in their day, one will absolutely make the time for that thing. Time does not come out of thin air. It comes from the other things we occupy ourselves doing. Everything is a trade-off. We operate based on a descending list of the things we care about whether we know them are not. </p>



<p>To understand what a real want feels like, it is helpful to think about and experience the fundamentals. Years ago, I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLcJHC9J7l4">an awesome motivational speech by a guy named Eric Thomas</a> where he tells his students they will be successful when they want it as badly as a person who is drowning wants to breathe (if you want to watch the first 3 minutes you will get the gist). Occasionally, I run several miles without a water bottle and I am reminded in the last couple of miles what it feels like to be truly thirsty, to want nothing but water. When you are sick, you usually want nothing but to feel better. When you are starving, all you want to do is eat. You will make time for what you want most. We can only do so much at a time and more distractions than ever are competing for our attention. This is why so many people feel there is not enough time in the day. </p>



<p>Next time you think about something you want to do or know you should do but “don’t have time” for, think again. You have the time, you just don’t care enough. In many cases, you will be content with that realization. In others, you will want to change it. Fortunately, you can. It is not about time. It is about you.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The growth and adoption of web-based APIs is key to the transformational technology journey of any enterprise. Those APIs, whether they are RESTful or not, remain synchronous. They, like the web, utilize the pattern of HTTP to implement a request-response interaction approach.</p>

<p>To illustrate, assume we have a project management API with the following interactions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a project (e.g. POST /projects)</li>
<li>Create a new task (e.g. POST /projects/{projectId}/tasks)</li>
<li>Assign the task to someone on our team (e.g. POST /tasks/{taskId}/assignees)</li>
<li>The assignee marks the task as complete (e.g. PUT /tasks/{taskId})</li>
</ol>

<p>An API following this design works if design of the user interface closely mirrors those endpoints. But suppose an additional application requirement is to ‘automatically’ update a task’s status when marked complete by another user. With a request/response web-API, an option is to incessantly poll a status API on the chance a status might have changed. This is both cumbersome and error-prone.
Instead of polling, we can introduce an <strong>event-driven architecture</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="introduction-to-event-driven-architecture">Introduction to Event-Driven Architecture<a href="#introduction-to-event-driven-architecture" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h2>

<p>In an event-driven architecture (or EDA), an application is composed of independent components that react to events published by other components. EDA is popular for distributed applications, as new components may be introduced into a solution to solve emerging problems — without the knowledge of previously developed components. Message brokers are used as an intermediary for communication, producing a loosely coupled design by preventing components from directly communicating with one another.</p>

<p>If you are familiar with service-oriented architecture (SOA), you have experienced EDA. Most service-oriented architectures used an enterprise service bus (ESB) for service communication rather than a message broker. Events were published to the ESB, where they were then routed to other services to integrate two or more software systems. However, ESBs proved problematic as they were used as “integration glue”, causing integration code to become scattered across services, apps, and the ESB; fragile systems were created. This fragility produced a greater need for coordination between teams, slowing software delivery.</p>

<h2 id="the-emergence-of-a-microservice-and-event-driven-architecture">The Emergence of a Microservice and Event-Driven Architecture<a href="#the-emergence-of-a-microservice-and-event-driven-architecture" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h2>

<p>To overcome this increased coordination, the microservice architecture was introduced as a replacement for traditional SOA. This newer distributed architecture, built on APIs and microservices, encourages “dumb pipes, smart endpoints.” Integration logic is pushed to the consumers and producers. Message brokers, rather than ESBs, are used for message routing, not integration logic. Services and APIs talk to one another while hiding implementation details. This loose coupling makes software more resilient to evolution as new requirements emerge.</p>

<p>As enterprises shift to APIs backed by a microservice architecture, the number of published events has grown considerably. Message brokers are typically transactional in nature, ensuring once-and-only-once delivery of messages. While useful for traditional software development, the transactional nature of message brokers limits the scalability of service communication.</p>

<p>Distributed streaming data platforms, such as Apache Kafka, now offer enterprises higher throughput than traditional message brokers. Kafka removes the need for transactional messaging found in message brokers, opting instead for turning events into message streams. These streams are accessible by any authorized subscriber and may be accessed real-time or processed sequentially from a predetermined location or at the start of the stream.</p>

<h2 id="api-design-with-event-streaming">API Design with Event Streaming<a href="#api-design-with-event-streaming" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h2>

<p>Event streams help software extend beyond the request-response approach common to web API styles such as REST, GraphQL, and gRPC. Software can communicate bi-directionally, removing the need for API consumers to continually poll for state changes. Instead, APIs publish events to an event stream for notification of data changes or important business events to any number of subscribed services for further processing.</p>

<p>Let’s revisit our previous example. We needed to solve two separate requirements:</p>

<ol>
<li>Notification when a task is marked as completed. Our only option without a message-driven architecture is to require interested parties to constantly make API calls to see if the task has been completed (aka polling)</li>
<li>Alerting a project owner when a task has been modified or marked as completed. Our only option is to mix our user interface concerns with our API by making the API send an email. The API is no longer responsible for managing projects and tasks — it is now responsible for the content and look-and-feel for email alerts</li>
</ol>

<p>If we introduce a message-driven architecture to our solution, we can develop an API that delivers project and task resources that offer the necessary capabilities (create, read, update, delete, and mark as complete). Our API doesn’t need to know about how the task completion event notification will be used, including that an email will be sent. All it needs to do is publish event messages when those events occur and allow other services to take action as appropriate. Events this API may publish include:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.asyncapi.com/images/posts/event-streaming-an-additional-architectural-style-to-suplement-api-design/event-examples.webp" alt="Example of API events" title="Example of API events"></p>

<p>Interested parties can then subscribe to the event(s) they are interested in and safely ignore the rest. In our example, we may end up with three components:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Projects API</strong> — Manages the Projects and Project Tasks resources via a REST-based API. The API may be comprised of one or more microservices that implement the capabilities offered by the REST API. When any event, from the list in the table above, occurs then the API publishes an event into the appropriate message stream for consumption by event subscribers</li>
<li><strong>Task Completed Email Microservice</strong> — Subscribes to the Task.Completed event, notifying project manager(s) via email when any task has been marked as completed</li>
<li><strong>Task Modified Email Microservice</strong> — Subscribes to the Task.Updated event, notifying all team members via email when any task has been edited</li>
</ol>

<p>The API has no awareness of the two microservices subscribed to the specific events; it just publishes the events to the appropriate message stream. The solution is considered loosely coupled and therefore capable of evolving over time as new requirements emerge, perhaps with new types of notifications (e.g. SMS, web dashboard alerts) or integrations (e.g. synching to JIRA).</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h2>

<p>The demand for more robust methods of software communication is pushing the limits of today’s interface solutions. Request/response-based APIs are essential. However, today’s technical problems are now demanding event-driven support — in addition to request/response — to improve an API’s capability offerings.</p>

<p>As API designers, we must strive to use all available tools to offer a better developer experience. As you enhance your existing APIs and new APIs emerge, ask yourself:</p>

<ol>
<li>How can my solution architecture be improved by moving beyond standard REST APIs and into a loosely-coupled event-driven architecture?</li>
<li>What events should my API publish that would benefit API consumers?</li>
<li>How will my API consumers benefit from the addition of these events and how do they take advantage of them?</li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s shift our approach from strictly request-response to thinking in terms of how our APIs can not only offer endpoints for requests, but events that enable the API to push to other services. The result will be increased innovation and more transformative APIs both within and across our LOBs.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
                <p>When running your business, you engage with the services of many different suppliers. This can range from your power company to your web hosting service. In all of these arrangements, your business is buying a specific service at an agreed upon price.</p><p>For example, when you pay a web hosting provider, they are managing your server, your website content management system <em>(like WordPress)</em>, backups, availability, and security. This simplifies all of that for your business and the monthly fee you pay them is a fair exchange of value for the services they provide.</p><p>Now let's look at YouTube. Everyone knows the power of embedding marketing videos on their website. YouTube greatly simplifies this, allowing you to easily add videos to help build your business. In return for this life-bettering service, you pay YouTube… <strong>nothing (?)</strong>. </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><mark>Sounds like a great deal, except when you think about it, would <em>your</em> business provide its service for free?</mark></p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Most businesses are built to, ultimately, exchange risk and hard work <em>(what it takes to build a business)</em> for financial return. While it might be nice to give away services for free, most business owners can’t afford to do so and keep the doors open due to all the costs associated with keeping those doors open.</p><p>So when YouTube offers their service to you for free, it doesn't mean they aren't looking to do the same things with their business as you are doing with yours. It just means that <strong>you aren't the customer</strong>.</p><p>So who <em>is</em> the customer? <em>Someone </em>must be paying YouTube for the service that they provide. We know it's not you the business owner embedding videos using their player on your website. Who is paying their bills?</p><p>Here's the answer: <strong>YouTube's customers are the advertisers</strong> who pay for access to the large audience and detailed targeting data that YouTube provides them. This is similar to the way advertisers pay for the ability to show commercials on television networks, or banners on media websites. These advertisers are the <em>real </em>customers, therefore, YouTube's business model is optimized to solve for the problems and needs of these paying customers.</p><p>So what does this mean for you, the web guy or small business owner that embeds videos using YouTube on your website? It means that YouTube is offering that free service to you in order to serve their actual customer the advertisers. Let's go through a couple of the ways that YouTube ends up benefiting from your video embed that you may not have thought about.</p><h3 id="showing-ads-">Showing Ads 👀</h3><p>The simplest, most direct way is that each video embed is a source of your customer/leads’ eyeballs that YouTube can now show ads to. This is in the form of inserting video commercials into your content, banner overlays on top of the video, and suggesting other videos after the user watches your video. </p><p>These are all fairly obvious and they <em>do </em>offer switches to turn some of this off during the embed process. However, the difficulty lies in keeping up with this as <strong>YouTube continually adds new ways to monetize these free video views on your website</strong>. So while you may believe you have ads on your videos turned off <em>today</em>, when YouTube introduces a new banner format, icon, or related videos format <em>tomorrow</em>, you’ll need to figure out how to turn them off all over again. You must continually stay on top of these changes and keep adjusting your embeds, otherwise, what you thought would be a clean video promoting your business ends up showcasing ads for other products. Or worse... ads for <strong>your competitors</strong>.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>At Swarmify, our mission is to bring an accelerated, distraction-free video experience to websites of all sizes. Whether you’re a  <a href="https://swarmify.com/pricing/"><strong>website owner</strong></a>, <a href="https://swarmify.com/agencies/"><strong>an agency</strong></a>, or you just want to get in on <a href="https://swarmify.com/affiliate-program/"><strong>our affiliate program</strong></a>, we have a plan for you!</p><!--kg-card-end: html--><h3 id="user-siphoning">User Siphoning</h3><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>This is a much more subtle cost but one that can have an incredible impact on your business. If you have ever watched a video on YouTube, you’ve most definitely seen related videos appear at the end of the video you watched. These related videos are personalized to each user’s behavior and fine-tuned with the strength of a million Google AI servers to pull them into watching more content. <mark>To be blunt, this is weaponized AI</mark> being used to maximize YouTube's chances of convincing a user on your website who watched your video, to watch additional videos chosen by YouTube. And with each of these videos watched, YouTube is able to serve more ads and make more revenue. That's the payoff on their end. Get your customers/leads to watch more YouTube videos and show them more ads.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><figure><img src="https://buzz.swarmify.com/content/images/2019/05/xtraffic_funnel-1.png.pagespeed.ic.x-xBpQW1fh.png" alt="YouTube costs you customers"></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>In addition to related videos, there's the not-so-subtle YouTube logo shown overtop your video. This means you are contributing to the company’s branding with every single watch of content on your website. By the time a user finishes watching one of your videos, it can be hard to tell who gets more benefit; your business or YouTube with all of the branding they throw on top.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h3 id="secret-weapon-detailed-targeting-">Secret Weapon: Detailed Targeting 🎯</h3><p>As discussed above, part of what YouTube is selling are the eyeballs to watch advertiser videos. But what becomes just as important for advertisers is the ability to target ideal potential customers. <strong>Showing ads for dog food to people without pets would be a huge waste of money</strong>. So YouTube needs to be able to deliver as much detail as possible on the motivations, demographics, and current needs each user has in order to better target ads for their advertisers.</p><p>The latest in AI-powered targeting is called <em>"in-market targeting"</em>. It uses AI to attempt to determine which users are likely to be ready to purchase some category of goods or services. This makes sense as we are all in-market for various goods or services at a given time. We might be tired of fixing our old car and so we are ready to start looking for a new one, but it might also be lunchtime and we are hungry and trying to figure out what food to get delivered. We are constantly <em>"in-market"</em> for purchases both large and small. Allowing an advertiser to show us their ad for a healthy and convenient chicken sandwich when we are ready to head out for lunch can be <em>devastatingly effective</em> at driving our behavior. Whereas showing us that same ad late in the evening when we are about ready to go to sleep would be almost useless.</p><p>Great. So <em>"in-market targeting"</em> is the greatest thing since sliced bread for YouTube's advertisers. How does this matter to your website where you simply embed a video showing off your beautiful dental office and smiling, friendly staff? Maybe it’s hit you how this ties together. <strong>YouTube is tracking the audience that views your website and feeding that into AI servers</strong> to determine what each user is in-market for. What that means, using the example of the dentist, is YouTube now knows these users are in the market for dental services. It learned that because they came to your dental website and watched your office promo video.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Now the value for advertisers kicks in. Those users will start seeing ads for other dental offices nearby as you have just clued YouTube (Google) into very valuable potential leads for your competitors. Every dentist using Google or YouTube ads can now start showing banner and video ads around the web talking about why they should choose their office over yours. <mark>By embedding a simple video on your website, you have just given all of your competitors access to your hard-earned leads</mark> who were highly likely to buy from you since they were already on your website. But now, they start researching or second guessing as they suddenly see ads for other options at every turn. All of us have been the victim of viewing a certain product and then, suddenly, every ad across the Internet seems consumed with selling variations or alternatives to that product. Now you know how it works. Its all enabled by an unassuming, <em>“free”</em> video player.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h3 id="other-options">Other Options</h3><p>At least now you know the <em>actual </em>cost of that video player. Part of the reason YouTube seems like such a great bargain for you is because of the imbalance in understanding the amount of value they get every time a business like yours uses their player. If you are fine trading off some of your leads and customers in return for the free price, then YouTube may work for you.</p><p>On the other hand, if the cost of leads and customers being siphoned away seems too high, then there are other options. Just like your web hosting and other services, there are providers that will give you simple tools to embed videos just as easily as YouTube. You pay a small monthly fee in exchange for a video player that is focused on delivering your video to your customers and keeping those high value leads on your website where they belong. Matching your site’s look, feel, and color scheme, with no obnoxious logos or branding to distract from your message.</p><p>We provide unlimited video hosting at <a href="https://swarmify.com/">Swarmify</a>, but there are many other providers depending on your needs.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><a href="https://swarmify.com/pricing/#pricing-table"><img src="https://buzz.swarmify.com/content/images/2020/06/xbottom-cta.png.pagespeed.ic.l6DzEnm0ti.png" alt="Try SmartVideo today!"></a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>A while ago I wrote <a href="http://metaredux.com/posts/2018/10/27/a-safer-rubocop.html">an article</a> about our recent efforts to make RuboCop safer
in terms of the code changes that it suggests and performs in auto-correct mode.
Today I’ll follow up with a small update on the latest developments in that area.</p>

<p>In preparation for the long-awaited RuboCop 1.0, RuboCop’s team spent a lot of time
recently adding auto-correction to more cops, polishing the internal auto-correction logic,
and marking cops with unsafe auto-correction accordingly. Recently we reached another
important milestone in our quest for safety - we’ve made safe auto-correct the default behavior
of RuboCop! The change essentially makes <code>--auto-correct</code> and <code>--safe-auto-correct</code> the same.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<pre><code>$ rubocop -a
# or
$ rubocop --auto-correct
# or
$ rubocop --safe-auto-correct # deprecated
</code></pre>

<p>I guess you might be wondering can you still have RuboCop run every possible auto-correction.
Yes, you can!</p>

<pre><code>$ rubocop -A
# or
$ rubocop --auto-correct-all
</code></pre>

<p>I think that’s pretty simple - a bigger A means more epic (and more dangerous) auto-corrections. :-)
<a href="https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop/releases/tag/v0.87.0">RuboCop 0.87</a> was released yesterday with these changes. I hope you’ll enjoy them!</p>

<p>I hope the rationale behind this is clear - a lot of people would run auto-correct in bulk and would get surprised that RuboCop made
(some) code changes that are not 100% compatible with the original code. We obviously want to limit such unpleasant surprises.
Originally I was optimistic that most people would be fine with the occasional small breakage here and there, given the overall
savings they’d get from the auto-corrections, but the feedback me and our team got over the years made me reconsider my
stance of the default behavior.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>In general I’ve always felt it’s a bad idea to run all the auto-corrections possible, especially on a big codebase.
Likely you’ll immediately notice some problems, but you might have trouble finding where did they come from and which
correction caused them. That’s why my recipe for (unsafe) auto-corrections has always been less ambitious:</p>

<pre><code># Run auto-correction for a cop at a time
$ rubocop --auto-correct --only Some/Cop
# Review carefully the diff
# Run the specs/unit tests
$ rspec
# All is green. Let's ship it!
# Moving forward with the next cop...
</code></pre>

<p>I encourage more people to operate in this incremental manner, as it makes it much easier to deal with unsafe corrections, which
despite their name work pretty well most of the time, but still require a bit of supervision from a human.</p>

<p>That’s all I have for you today. Keep hacking!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><p>How would you compare the Windows and macOS operating systems? In what ways are they similar? Why do they each take different approaches to solving the same problem? For the last 19&nbsp;years I've developed security software for Windows. Recently, I’ve started implementing similar features on macOS. Since then, people have asked me questions like this. The more experience I gained on these two operating systems, the more I realized they’re very different. Even when the problems they set out to solve are common, their paths differ. In this two-part series, I will focus on the operating system events supported by Windows and macOS, and explain each operating system's approach.
</p><h2>Overview</h2><p>In Part 1, we’ll discuss process events.&nbsp;In Part 2, we’ll discuss file and network events. These events&nbsp;are crucial for endpoint security analysis. Through multiple perspectives in this post, I hope to:
</p><ul><li>Help you better understand the general differences between macOS and Windows on the system level
	</li><li>Help those who want to expand their experiences onto another platform be better prepared and adapted to differences that might seem to be shocking from their past experiences
	</li><li>Help cybersecurity professionals enrich their toolsets for creating innovative security products</li></ul><p>This post is based on some of my own experiences.&nbsp;It does not intend to be an exhaustive list.
</p> <p><strong><h3>Open vs. closed</h3></strong></p><p>Microsoft Windows has traditionally been open. It runs on hardware from different vendors and allows third-party developers to write applications on top of it. macOS is part of Apple’s end-to-end integrated ecosystem, which is quite the opposite of being “open.” This article does not try to take sides on the decades-long “open vs. closed” debate. Apart from end-to-end user experience, developers and researchers usually care about other things.&nbsp;
</p><p>The abundance of APIs and documents provided by Windows really enabled developers to do virtually anything in the cyber world. While on the macOS side, the beauty of simplicity reminds people that Apple takes lots of things as their own responsibility instead of sharing them with third-party developers. If you find something from Apple difficult to use, it’s perhaps because you’re looking at something&nbsp;Apple feels is their own backyard.&nbsp;Take&nbsp;<a href="https://knight.sc/debugging/2018/08/15/macos-kernel-debugging.html">kernel mode debugging</a> or <a href="http://mirror.informatimago.com/next/developer.apple.com/technotes/tn2004/tn2118.html">kernel core dumps</a>&nbsp;as examples. On the upside though, macOS developers can indulge themselves in the open source&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/apple/darwin-xnu">Darwin kernel</a>, whereas Windows’ kernel is closed source&nbsp;and yet Windows developers feel spoiled with an abundance of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/">documentation</a>.
</p> <p><strong><h3>Microkernel vs. monolithic kernel</h3></strong></p><p><img src="https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt0a39b4008faf9cb9/5eea6e7d18cea32a006fba82/macos-windows-kernels-blog-monolothic-kernel-vs-microkernel.png" data-sys-asset-uid="blt0a39b4008faf9cb9" alt=""></p><figcaption>Figure 1: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microkernel">Structure of monolithic and microkernel-based operating systems</a></figcaption><p>Modern macOS and Microsoft Windows both have hybrid kernels, which are neither a pure microkernel, nor monolithic. However, one cannot infer that the two kernels are similarly architectured based on the same kernel type — they actually came from different places.
</p><p>Microsoft Windows, in the Windows 9x days, used a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolithic_kernel">monolithic</a> kernel. macOS <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XNU">XNU</a> consists of several core building blocks, one of which came from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach_(kernel)">Mach kernel</a> that carries the genes of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microkernel">microkernel</a>. Even though both operating systems have evolved into today’s “hybrid” form, their early influences still manifest and affect developers’ daily lives. For example, Apple announced in WWDC 2019 it’s going to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/702/">deprecate kernel extensions (kext) support</a> for third-party developers starting with macOS 10.16. This means they are kicking third-party developers out of the kernel. For some, this may seem shocking. However, thinking from a microkernel point of view, this change sounds just like a logical next step.
</p><p>Over the years, Microsoft created a new <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/">Windows Driver Framework</a>. It also moved lots of traditional kernel mode driver support into user mode, encouraging people to implement <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/getting-started-with-umdf-version-2">drivers in user mode</a>. However, caveats exist. For example, in <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fwp/windows-filtering-platform-start-page">Windows Filtering Platform</a>, even though most of the functionalities can be done in user mode, some of the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23533627/is-it-possible-to-implement-user-mode-callouts-in-wfp-windows-filtering-platfor">crucial functionalities</a> still have to be done in the kernel.&nbsp;
</p> <p><strong><h3>Backward compatibility vs. complete rewrite</h3></strong></p><p>Some people have doubts about Apple's WWDC 2019 kext deprecation announcement, as it means that backward compatibility is broken for any third-party software that includes kexts. People will have to rewrite things in user mode from scratch. It’s understandable that some may want Apple to delay or cancel the deprecation. Regardless, deprecation is&nbsp;happening as <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=g28d5j9l">planned</a>. Because it is a closed ecosystem and Apple retains end-to-end control, backward compatibility is never on its menu and deprecation has been a consistent part of macOS releases. Check out the “Deprecation” sections in a few of the past release notes: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos_release_notes/macos_mojave_10_14_release_notes?language=objc">Mojave</a>, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos_release_notes/macos_catalina_10_15_release_notes?language=objc">Catalina</a>, and the coming release of <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos-release-notes/macos-big-sur-11-beta-release-notes">Big Sur</a>.
</p><p>This means, as a macOS developer, you may frequently find yourself rewriting everything from scratch — even if your software is well-architected and implemented. Windows, on the other hand, has been keeping its promise of backward compatibility. You may find applications created for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_3.1x">Windows 3.1</a> still run on the latest Windows 10. Microsoft does occasionally attempt to deprecate things. For example, it has been trying to deprecate support for <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ifs/about-file-system-legacy-filter-drivers">legacy file system drivers</a> ever since the introduction of its replacement —&nbsp; <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ifs/filter-manager-concepts">file system minifilter</a> — in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_XP">Windows XP SP2</a> on August 25, 2004. But, as of today, it’s still unable to do so. However, this doesn’t mean legacy file system drivers remain a viable choice for third-party developers.
</p> <p><strong><h2>Process events</h2></strong></p><p>Windows and macOS organize process events very differently. Windows provides a single kernel callback, set by <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddk/nf-ntddk-pssetcreateprocessnotifyroutine">PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutine</a>/<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddk/nf-ntddk-pssetcreateprocessnotifyroutineex">Ex</a>, to trace all process creations and terminations. macOS process events are mainly retrieved from two sources:
</p><ul><li>An executable file’s <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vnode.9">vnode</a> operations
	</li><li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/System/Conceptual/ManPages_iPhoneOS/man2/vfork.2.html"><em>fork()</em></a> system call activities</li></ul> <p><strong><h3>Windows</h3></strong></p><p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddk/nf-ntddk-pssetcreateprocessnotifyroutineex">PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutineEx</a> allows developers to register a callback with Windows. Later on when a process is created or exits, Windows will notify the caller by invoking the callback. The callback can be used for both prevention and notification. The parameters passed to the callback contain a rich set of information useful for process events, shown in the following figure:
</p><p><img src="https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt45abfe2a9f2dc473/5eea6ea834f8f30c7cfb289a/macos-windows-kernels-blog-process-events.png" data-sys-asset-uid="blt45abfe2a9f2dc473" alt=""></p><figcaption>Figure 2: Screenshot of a debug session that shows PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutineEx parameters
</figcaption><p>To learn how to use <strong><em>PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutineEx</em></strong>, take a look at Microsoft’s <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-driver-samples/tree/master/general/obcallback">ObCallback&nbsp; Registration Driver</a> sample code.&nbsp;<br></p><p>It’s also worth mentioning the <a href="http://www.tldp.org/LDP/LG/issue23/flower/context.html">context of a process</a>. On Windows, when the callback registered by <strong><em>PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutineEx</em></strong> is invoked, it’s in the context of the creating process for process creations. For process terminations, it’s in the context of the terminating process (see the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddk/nf-ntddk-pssetcreateprocessnotifyroutineex">document</a>). Inside the Windows kernel, most of the time you can find out the actor process by simply calling <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddk/nf-ntddk-psgetcurrentprocessid">PsGetCurrentProcessId</a>, because the kernel service usually shares context with the actor process. However, in the macOS kernel (for <a href="http://mirror.informatimago.com/next/developer.apple.com/technotes/tn2005/tn2127.html#SECLISTENERGOTCHAS">reasons</a>), developers are advised to avoid calling <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/kernel/1488975-proc_self?language=objc">proc_self</a> in the kernel to find out the actor process. This is easier to understand from a microkernel’s point of view, because most of the system services are delegated to other processes on a microkernel system. Particularly, when <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Darwin/Conceptual/KernelProgramming/Extend/Extend.html">kernel extensions</a> are replaced by <a href="https://developer.apple.com/system-extensions/">system extensions</a> (which runs in user mode) in macOS 10.16, the same advice should be strictly followed.
</p> <p><strong><h3>macOS</h3></strong> <strong><h4>Kauth/MACF</h4></strong></p><p><a href="http://mirror.informatimago.com/next/developer.apple.com/technotes/tn2005/tn2127.html">Kauth</a> is a Kernel Programming Interface (KPI) provided by macOS to allow third parties — primarily security software developers — to intercept select operations.<sup>1</sup> As the definition suggests, it can only be used in kernel mode. There’s another KPI, called <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/mac.html">Mandatory Access Control Framework</a> (MACF), which is way more powerful than Kauth, but it’s Apple’s private KPI and not “open” for third-party developers. With the kext deprecation announcement, both Kauth and MACF won’t be available for third-party developers, starting with macOS 10.16. I briefly describe Kauth here to present a continuity view for you to get an idea of macOS's evolution:
</p><p>Kauth defines “scopes,”&nbsp;which Apple describes as “areas of interest” for authorization within the kernel.<sup>1</sup> A couple scopes in Kauth provide means for third-party software to get notified when a process is launched.
</p><ul><li><a href="http://mirror.informatimago.com/next/developer.apple.com/technotes/tn2005/tn2127.html#SECVNODESCOPE">Vnode scope</a>&nbsp;- Vnode scope is capable of preventing a process from being launched. By calling KPI <em>kauth_listen_scope(KAUTH_SCOPE_VNODE,...)</em>, a developer can register a vnode scope listener callback. When an operation on a vnode is about to happen, macOS will invoke the callback. The callback can then block or allow the operation. Vnode operations are not limited to executions. There are other types of vnode operations as well, such as open/close/read/write/etc. By checking <em>KAUTH_VNODE_EXECUTE</em> flag against the vnode operation (<em>action</em>), we know a file is executed — which roughly translates to “a process is launched” in Windows language.</li></ul><ul><li><a href="http://mirror.informatimago.com/next/developer.apple.com/technotes/tn2005/tn2127.html#SECFILEOPSCOPE">File operation scope</a>&nbsp;- Similar to vnode, file operation scope is able to report operations on a file. The <em>KAUTH_FILEOP_EXEC</em> flag in the <em>action</em> parameter indicates that a file is being executed. However, file operation scope works only in listening mode. It can not be used to prevent a file from being executed inline.</li></ul> <p><strong><h4>Endpoint Security system extensions</h4></strong></p><p>macOS <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/endpointsecurity">Endpoint Security</a> (ES) is a kind of System Extension which runs in user mode, and it’s the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/702/">replacement</a> for Kauth. In the new ES framework, event types are better organized in one enum definition 
	<strong><em><a href="#es_event_type_t">es_event_type_t</a></em></strong> defined in XCode’s SDK header file:
</p><p>/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/include/EndpointSecurity/ESTypes.h
</p><p>You can see that process events are just a subset of ES events (more discussion about ES events can be found in the next File Events section). The few types of ES events pertaining to process events are:&nbsp;
</p><ul> <em><li><em>ES_EVENT_TYPE_AUTH_EXEC</em></li></em> <em><li><em>ES_EVENT_TYPE_NOTIFY_EXEC</em></li></em> <em><li><em>ES_EVENT_TYPE_NOTIFY_FORK</em></li></em> <em><li><em>ES_EVENT_TYPE_NOTIFY_EXIT</em></li></em></ul><p>Note that if you find “<strong><em>AUTH</em></strong>” in the event …</p></div></div></div></div></div>

<p>I was wrong to think I needed to appear buttoned-up online.</p>
<p>When I was a teenager, I had a personal website with an <em>About Me</em> page. It read like I’d built a compiler for <span>PHP</span>, sold two companies, and achieved alpha day trading. My email signature was five lines long.</p>
<p>I didn’t realize how much people simply crave raw personalities. Typos. Mistakes. Thinking out loud.</p>
<p>When Churchill was asked to replace Chamberlain in the spring of 1940, he kept the 28-year-old John Colville on staff as his secretary.</p>
<p>Colville didn’t like Churchill. He didn’t want bombs to drop on London. He didn’t want his brother to die in France. He wanted to make a deal with Hitler.</p>
<p>He thought Churchill was rash, erratic, and such a blatantly bad choice that Hitler must have been behind Churchill’s rise:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>“</span>One of Hitler’s cleverest moves has been to make Winston Public Enemy Number One, because this fact has helped to make him Public Hero Number One at home and in the U.S.A.”<a href="#footnote-1DTR" id="ref-1DTR"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Within a few months, Churchill had won him over.</p>
<p>Colville would walk in on Churchill naked in his tub, reading papers and dictating speeches. He’d catch the muttered jokes that came out of his mouth after reading disastrous news. He saw Churchill’s tears when ordering to open fire on the French naval fleet.</p>
<p>The standing ovations in the House of Commons didn’t win Colville over. The demands, the jokes, the light blue bathrobes did.</p>
<p>I’m not saying to get drunk and tell jokes until 2 A.M.</p>
<p>But it’s easier than ever to appear professional online. It’s harder than ever to make people laugh out loud.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Here we are again. Twitter recently released an “audio tweet” feature. The <a href="https://twitter.com/mayagpatterson/status/1273313298117623808">logic behind it</a> was to empower activists, journalists, and storytellers.</p><p>As implemented, Twitter’s audio tweets are totally inaccessible for deaf and hard of hearing people like me, as well as those with auditory processing disorders or difficulty hearing or understanding audio. This isn’t empowering. Deaf and disabled people are activists, journalists, and storytellers, too, and also benefit from access to their work.</p><p>When confronted with this oversight, the head of Design and Research at Twitter wrote a now-deleted tweet, “We formed a design systems team recently that is responsible for accessibility across Twitter. This is a test. Hypothetically a test can go away in a few weeks after we launch. The work you’re describing is important. However that would have meant shipping in 2021/22.”</p><p>Now, <a href="https://twitter.com/davidnoob/status/1273892826980298758">you shouldn’t blame one person</a> for what is an organizational failure. And Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1273794890543935488">apologized for it</a>. However, this is a problem at more than just Twitter. These rebuttals are tired and familiar, so I think it’s important to address them in turn.</p><h2>“We formed a design systems team recently that is responsible for accessibility across Twitter.”</h2><p>A design system cannot be solely responsible for accessibility across a company. A design system is a box of lego bricks for teams to build products with. Those lego bricks ideally have accessibility baked in, yes. But the final product you build with those lego bricks may be inaccessible regardless. Put a bunch of good intentions together and you could still have a bad outcome.</p><p>Sometimes a team rejects a particular lego brick in favor of their own. Often, their own thing is a one-off built according to product needs. But those one-offs need to be accessible, too. Accessibility doesn’t spread organically. In our ableist world, accessibility must be a conscious, intentional choice.</p><p>Furthermore, accessibility cannot be the responsibility of a team with limited scope. Accessibility must pervade all corners of a company, across design and engineering and content strategy. Above all, accessibility compliance cannot be the volunteer work of a group of employees who are paid to prioritize other projects. <a href="https://twitter.com/LittleKope/status/1273673343556653056">Accessibility cannot be a volunteer responsibility</a>.</p><h2>“This is a test. Hypothetically a test can go away in a few weeks after we launch.”</h2><p>A test is typically an experiment wherein a team releases a product to a number of users to see how users interact with it over a set amount of time. While not everyone could <em>make</em> audio tweets, Twitter made it so all users could <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbc/status/1273375349586436097"><em>interact</em> with audio tweets</a>.</p><p>If a product has a showstopper bug that renders a significant percentage of its users unable to interact with it, and there’s no easy way to fix the bug, generally the experiment is pulled. Once the bug is fixed, then the experiment restarts. That didn’t happen here.</p><p>Twitter could have papered over this by posting guidance on how to make accessible audio tweets. This could have been as simple as a suggestion to write a tweet thread with the transcript or link to a transcript. These are band-aid solutions to systemic problems. But they work. People volun-tweet out transcripts to work around other people’s uncaptioned videos all the time.</p><p>Because Twitter did not provide any accessibility guidance when they rolled out this test, early users did not think to transcribe their audio tweets. When accessibility is an afterthought, users develop inaccessible patterns which never get re-examined, which then cause systemic harm.</p><h2>“The work you’re describing is important. However that would have meant shipping in 2021/22.”</h2><p>There are several things wrong with this statement. It turns out the work they were thinking of was <em>automatic</em> captioning (“autocaptioning”) of audio tweets. While occasionally useful, autocaptioning is inaccurate, incomplete, and biased.</p><ol><li>It is inaccurate because an AI, rather than the original source, translates the audio. Even human translators, who perform better than AIs, are inaccurate by virtue of not being the original source.</li><li>Autocaptioning is incomplete because it doesn’t codify non-textual information like tone and voice.</li><li>Autocaptioning bias is well-documented; AIs <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/technology/speech-recognition-bias-apple-amazon-google.html">struggle with Black voices</a> and accented speech. A Black Deaf employee would have caught this immediately.</li></ol><p>The benefit of autocaptioning is that it approaches the problem of users not captioning content systematically—it’s better than nothing. But for the purposes of a test, letting the original source manually caption their content is much easier to implement. There are standard captioning codecs like SRT and VTT with plenty of software to help write them.</p><p>Or, as outlined in the previous section, encourage users to write a transcript in the tweets. Plenty of solutions exist that don’t require shipping 1-2 years later. Nudge your users toward accessible solutions and reward them for doing it.</p><p>Lastly, the Twitter community is full of talent. <a href="https://twitter.com/headlinerclip/status/1274106813479190528">Autocaptioning was implemented</a> by a Twitter bot developed by Headliner. Twitter has more than enough resources to make something of their own or otherwise pay for. Yet Twitter’s culture of inaccessibility led to the release of a product where accessibility was an afterthought.</p><p>Accessibility determines design, user interaction, user experience, and copy decisions, and so must be considered from the start of the product process. Accessibility is critical to a minimally viable product, just like security and data compliance. Accessibility is a civil right.</p><p>Twitter is where a lot of Disabled people can engage with communities and movements. The more inaccessible Twitter gets, the less access we have to those communities and movements.</p><h2>Fixing the culture of inaccessibility</h2><p>Accessibility is <em>fundamental</em> to the work we do. It is part of each ticket we create, part of the technical specs we write, part of the designs we draw. But too often companies (full of overrepresented non-disabled employees) ignore it. Accessibility cannot be a post-release feature. We must make progress where we can and not let perfect be the enemy of good.</p><p>But the problem runs deeper than just inaccessibility. Fixing accessibility issues is an endless game of whack-a-mole. You can’t win. The problem is <a href="https://www.selfdefined.app/definitions/ableism/">ableism</a>, and to win you need to throw out the game.</p><p>I need you to understand something. Ableism isn’t just a vile president mocking Serge Kovaleski on national television. Ableism is people making fun of that same president’s weight and gait, his ability to drink from a glass or read a teleprompter. When you make a value judgment on the president’s body and mind, you aren’t harming the president. He’ll be fine. Instead, you harm disabled people.</p><p><a href="https://jocelyngoldfein.com/culture-is-the-behavior-you-reward-and-punish-7e8e75c6543e">Culture is the behavior you reward and punish.</a> If teams churn out products without accessibility included in the process, and leadership still rewards them for it, that is the company culture. Those are its values. If leadership isn’t actively anti-ableist, it’s ableist.</p><p>Ableism exists in the makeup of popular accessibility companies whose team pages reveal a never-ending stream of white, abled people. Ableism exists in the words of an accessibility specialist who referred to his co-worker twice as “wheelchair-bound.” Ableism exists in how user testing almost singularly excludes disabled people. Ableism exists in developers who are rewarded for their outward support of accessibility, yet stuff disabled people’s needs into a single ticket left to languish in a dusty backlog. Ableism is non-disabled people saying that what we’re talking about is important but not important enough to do anything about.</p><p>We must be actively anti-ableist. Just as we build products with design systems, we must build an anti-ableist culture brick by brick. In an ableist world, <a href="https://webaim.org/projects/million/">abled people make products for abled people</a>.</p><p>To expand the audience for our products, we must actively seek out, retain, and promote disabled people, and not just disabled white cis men. BIPOC disabled people. Trans disabled people. Disabled people of any gender who are drawn to femininity. Work to <a href="https://rewire.news/article/2018/11/19/ableism-is-the-go-to-disguise-for-white-supremacy-too-many-people-are-falling-for-it/">dismantle white supremacy</a>, which exists in (and is perpetuated by) the disability community as well.</p><p>Ensure your physical offices, internal tools, and meetings are accessible. User test with disabled people, not just abled people. Offer more flexible work with respect to hours and location. <a href="https://blog.tenon.io/sample-post">Open a dialogue</a> for disabled users to submit accessibility feedback.</p><p>I am tired of accessibility only being brought up when companies do damage control. No more apologies and empty promises. Disabled people are already here, and we’ve been here a while. We don’t have time to wait for you to wake up and start feeling empathy for disabled people just so you can arrive at the same conclusions we’ve been sharing all this time.</p><p>Listen.</p><h2>Accessibility resources</h2><p>These resources may help you begin your accessibility journey.

		<h3>How to become a Bayesian in eight easy steps: An annotated reading list</h3>
<p><em>(TLDR: We wrote an annotated reading list to get you started in learning Bayesian statistics. <span><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758%2Fs13423-017-1317-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Published version</a></span>. <span><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301981861_How_to_become_a_Bayesian_in_eight_easy_steps_An_annotated_reading_list" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Researchgate</a>. <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/ph6sw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PsyArxiv</a></span>.)</em></p>
<p>It can be hard to know where to start when you want to learn about&nbsp;Bayesian statistics.&nbsp;I am frequently asked&nbsp;to share&nbsp;my favorite&nbsp;introductory resources to Bayesian statistics, and my go-to answer has been to share a dropbox folder with a bunch of PDFs that aren’t really sorted or cohesive. In some sense&nbsp;I was acting as&nbsp;little&nbsp;more than a glorified Google Scholar search bar.</p>
<p>It seems like there is&nbsp;some&nbsp;tension out there with regard to Bayes, in that many people want to know more about it, but when they pick up, say, Andrew Gelman and colleagues’&nbsp;<em>Bayesian Data Analysis</em> they get totally overwhelmed. And then they just think, “Screw this esoteric B.S.” and give up because it doesn’t seem like it is worth their time or effort.</p>
<p>I think this&nbsp;happens a lot. Introductory Bayesian texts usually assume a level of training in mathematical statistics that most researchers simply don’t have time (or otherwise don’t need) to learn. There are actually&nbsp;a lot of accessible Bayesian resources&nbsp;out there that don’t require much math stat background at all, but it just so happens&nbsp;that they are not consolidated anywhere so people don’t necessarily know about them.</p>
<h3>Enter the eight step program</h3>
<p>Beth Baribault, Peter Edelsbrunner (<span><a href="https://twitter.com/peter1328" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@peter1328</a></span>), Fabian Dablander (<span><a href="https://twitter.com/fdabl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@fdabl</a></span>), Quentin Gronau, and I have just finished <span><a href="https://psyarxiv.com/ph6sw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a&nbsp;new paper</a></span> that tries to&nbsp;remedy this situation, titled, “How to become a Bayesian in eight easy steps: An annotated reading list.” We were invited to submit this paper for a special issue on Bayesian statistics for&nbsp;<em>Psychonomic Bulletin and Review</em>.&nbsp;Each paper in the special issue addresses a specific question we often hear about Bayesian statistics, and ours was the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>I am a reviewer/editor handling a manuscript that uses Bayesian methods; which articles should I read to get a quick idea of what that means?</p></blockquote>
<p>So <span><a href="https://psyarxiv.com/ph6sw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the paper</a></span>‘s goal is not so much to teach readers how to actually&nbsp;<em>perform</em> Bayesian data analysis — there are other papers in the special issue for that — but to facilitate readers in their quest to understand basic Bayesian concepts. We think it will&nbsp;serve as a nice introductory reading list for any interested researcher.</p>
<p>The format of <span><a href="https://psyarxiv.com/ph6sw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the paper</a></span> is straightforward. We highlight&nbsp;eight papers that had a big impact on our own understanding of Bayesian statistics, as well as short descriptions of an additional 28 resources in the&nbsp;<em>Further reading </em>appendix. The first four papers&nbsp;are focused on theoretical introductions, and the second four&nbsp;have a&nbsp;slightly more applied focus.</p>
<p>We also give every resource&nbsp;a ranking from 1–9 on two dimensions: Focus (theoretical vs. applied) and Difficulty (easy vs. hard). We tried to provide a wide range of resources, from easy&nbsp;applications (#14: Wagenmakers, Lee, and Morey’s “Bayesian benefits for the pragmatic researcher”) to challenging&nbsp;theoretical discussions (#12: Edwards, Lindman and Savage’s “Bayesian statistical inference for psychological research”) and others&nbsp;in between.</p>
<p>The figure below (Figure A1, available on the last page of <span><a href="https://psyarxiv.com/ph6sw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the paper</a></span>) summarizes our rankings:</p>

<p>The emboldened numbers (1–8) are the papers that we’ve commented on&nbsp;in detail, numbers in light text (9–30) are papers we briefly describe in the appendix, and the italicized numbers (31–36) are our recommended introductory books (also listed in the appendix).</p>
<p>This is how we chose to frame&nbsp;<span><a href="https://psyarxiv.com/ph6sw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the paper</a></span>,</p>
<blockquote><p>Overall, the guide is designed such that a researcher might be able to read all eight of the highlighted articles and some supplemental readings within a few days. After readers acquaint themselves with these sources, they should be well-equipped both to interpret existing research and to evaluate new research that relies on Bayesian methods.</p></blockquote>
<h3>The list</h3>
<p>Here’s the list of papers we chose to cover&nbsp;in detail:</p>

<li>&nbsp;Lindley (1993):&nbsp;The analysis of experimental data: The appreciation of tea and wine. <span><a href="http://tinyurl.com/lindley1993" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PDF</a></span>.</li>

</ol>
<p>You’ll have to check out&nbsp;<span><a href="https://psyarxiv.com/ph6sw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the paper</a></span> to see our commentary&nbsp;and to find out what other articles we&nbsp;included in the&nbsp;<em>Further reading</em> appendix. We provide urls (web archived when possible;&nbsp;<span><a href="http://archive.org/web/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">archive.org/web/</a></span>) to PDFs of the eight main papers (except #2, that’s on the DBDA website), and wherever possible for the rest of the resources (some did not have free copies online;&nbsp;see&nbsp;the <em>References</em>).</p>
<p>I thought this was a fun&nbsp;paper&nbsp;to write, and if you think you might want to learn some Bayesian basics I hope you will consider reading it.</p>
<p>Oh, and I should mention that we wrote the whole paper collaboratively on <span><a href="https://www.overleaf.com/signup?ref=19f671ddd62a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Overleaf.com</a></span>. It is a great site that makes it easy to&nbsp;get started using&nbsp;LaTeX, and I highly recommend trying it out.</p>
<p>This is the fifth post in the&nbsp;<span><em><a href="https://alexanderetz.com/understanding-bayes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Understanding Bayes</a></em></span> series. Until next time,</p>

        <p>It’s a sad read. Almost all the great stuff is from over thirty years ago, and there’s hardly any recent breakthroughs. It reads more as a cautionary example of mismanagement than anything else.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A few months ago we wrote about "<a href="https://formcake.com/blog/our-experience-with-stripe-atlas">Our Experience with Stripe Atlas</a>" and what it was like to use them to start a small internet business (tldr; generally good).</p>
<p>One of the perks of Stripe Atlas is that they offer a heap of credits for multiple cloud platforms. From the Stripe site:</p>
<p>"Stripe Atlas founders can access free credits, exclusive access to free products, and discounted pricing from our partners, including $5,000 in credits from Amazon Web Services and $10,000 in credits from DigitalOcean."</p>
<p>There's always an understanding with services like this that credit offers come with a lot of hand-waving and "caveat emptor"-ing: notice founders "<em>have access to</em>" free credits (emphasis ours), which could imply that some founders have the capacity to call on those funds, but not all. But still, the language does seem very direct and makes it easy to believe signing up includes $5,000 in AWS credits.</p>
<p>We have not received $5,000 in AWS credits. But now the good news: We <em>have</em> still received <strong>$1,000 in AWS credits</strong>.</p>
<p>$1,000 is still very generous, and a great gift from Stripe. No business filing with Stripe Atlas should ever depend on $1,000 of AWS credits as some kind of life-or-death runway, and for everyone receiving it it's more a small bonus than some kind of critical seed money.</p>
<p>But I do think it's useful to note, if you're an entrepreneur considering Stripe Atlas, what general figures you can expect. We're not a high capital-intensive operation of course, so if you're in a similar micro-saas space, then you also probably won't get the full 5k.</p>
<p>We're not sure what path you should take <em>to get</em> that possible $5,000 in AWS credits. There's not much communication about what criteria Stripe uses to arrive at the number they finalize on.</p>
<p>But you heard it from us: Take that 5,000 number with a grain of salt. It's a great gift - just maybe not as great as you think.</p>

It was proposed as a use case for 3G, which didn’t happen at all, and with the growth of consumer broadband we got all sorts of tools that could do it, but it never really became a mass-market consumer behaviour. Now, suddenly, we’re all locked down, and we’re all on video calls all the time, doing team stand-ups, play dates and family birthday parties, and suddenly Zoom is a big deal. At some point many of those meetings will turn back into coffees, we hope, but video will remain.</p><p>Will it still be Zoom, though?</p><p>As a breakthrough product, I think it’s useful to compare Zoom with two previous products - Dropbox and Skype.</p><p>Part of the founding legend of Dropbox is that Drew Houston told people what he wanted to do, and everyone said ‘there are hundreds of these already’ and he replied ‘yes, but which one do you use?’ That’s what Zoom did - video calls are nothing new, but Zoom solved a lot of the small pieces of friction that made it fiddly to get into a call.</p><p>The other comparison, though, is Skype. Just as for video, VOIP had been around for a long time, but Skype solved a lot of pieces of friction, in both engineering and user experience, and by doing so made VOIP a consumer product.</p><p>Two things happened to Skype after that, though. The first is that the product drifted for a long time, and the quality of the user experience declined. But the second is that everything has voice now. Imagine trying to do a market map today of which apps on a smartphone, Mac or PC might have voice - it would be absurd. Everything can have voice. And though there’s still a lot of engineering under the hood, it became a commodity. Whether you buy it from Twilio or someone else, saying ‘our app has free computer voice’ is meaningless - what matters is how you wrap it. Why do you have voice? Hence, Clubhouse is built on ideas about psychology and behaviour, not VOIP, and it’s not trying to win ‘voice’.  Equally, Pindrop looks at every call going into a call centre and tries to work out which might be fraudulent. If you’d looked at Skype in 2004 and argued that it would own ‘voice’ on ‘computers’, that would not have been the right mental model.</p><p>I think this is where we’ll go with video - there will continue to be hard engineering, but video itself will be a commodity and the question will be how you wrap it. There will be video in everything, just as there is voice in everything, and there will be a great deal of proliferation into industry verticals on one hand and into unbundling pieces of the tech stack on the other. On one hand video in healthcare, education or insurance is about the workflow, the data model and the route to market, and lots more interesting companies will be created, and on the other hand Slack is deploying video on top of Amazon’s building blocks, and lots of interesting companies will be created here as well. There’s lots of bundling and unbundling coming, as always. Everything will be ‘video’ and then it will disappear inside.</p><p>An important part of this is that there seem to be few real network effects in a video call per se.  You don’t necessarily need an account to join a call, and you generally don’t need an application either, especially on the desktop - you just click on a link in your calendar and the call opens in the browser. Indeed, the calendar is often the aggregation layer - you don’t need to know what service the next call uses, just when it is. Skype needed both an account and an app, so had a network effect (and lost even so). WhatsApp uses the telephone numbering system as an address and so piggybacked on your phone’s contact list- effectively it used the PSTN as the social graph rather than having to build its own. But a group video call is a URL and a calendar invitation - it has no graph of its own.</p><p>Incidentally, one of the ways that this all feels very 1.0 is the rather artificial distinction between calls that are based on a ‘room’, where the addressing system is a URL and anyone can join without an account, and calls that are based on ‘people’, where everyone joining needs their own address, whether it’s a phone number, an account or something else. Hence Google has both Meet (URLs) and Duo (people) - Apple’s FaceTime is only people (no URLs).</p><p>Taking this one step further, a big part of the friction that Zoom removed was that you don’t need an account, an app or a social graph to use it: Zoom made network effects irrelevant. But, that means Zoom doesn’t have those network effects either. It grew by removing defensibility.</p><p>I compared Zoom with Dropbox and Skype, but another useful comparison is with photo sharing. There have always been hundreds of things that did this, but we saw a succession of companies that worked out something new around user experience and psychology that took them beyond ‘photos’ to some deeper insight - first Flickr, then Facebook and Instagram, and then Snap.</p><p>When Snap launched, there were infinite way to share images, but Snap asked a bunch of weird questions that no-one had really asked before. Why do you have to press the camera button - why doesn’t the app open in the camera? Why are you saving your messages - isn’t that like saving all your phone calls? Fundamentally, Snap asked ‘why, exactly, are you sending a picture? What is the underlying social purpose?’ You’re not really sending someone a sheet of pixels - you’re communicating.</p><p>That’s the question Zoom and all its competitors haven’t really solved. Zoom has done a good job of asking why it was hard to get into a call, but hasn’t really asked why you’re in the call in the first place. Why, exactly, are you sending someone a video stream and watching another one? Why am I looking at a grid of little thumbnails of faces? Is that the purpose of this moment? What is the ‘mute’ button for - background noise, or so I can talk to someone else, or is it so I can turn it off to raise my hand? What social purpose is ‘mute’ actually serving? What should screen-sharing do? What other questions could one ask? And so if Zoom is the Dropbox or Skype of video, we are waiting for the Snap, Clubhouse and Yo. </p><p>Benedict Evans, Venture Partner</p><p><em>Additional research with thanks to Chandar Lal</em></p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>Canonicalization and canonical forms are one dimension of organizing the
work of an optimizing compiler.</p>

<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>

<p>A lot of code constructs can be written in multiple ways. For example:</p>



<p><em>Canonicalization</em> means picking one of these forms to
be the <em>canonical form</em>, and then going through the program and
rewriting all constructs which are equivalent to the canonical
form into the canonical form.</p>

<p>In the case of add, it’s common to pick the form that has a constant
on the right side, so we’d rewrite all
these constructs to <code>x + 4</code>.</p>

<h3 id="why-is-canonicalization-useful">Why is canonicalization useful?</h3>

<p>The goal of canonicalization is <em>to make subsequent optimizations more
effective</em>. This is a key point, and we’ll get into some of the subtleties
below. But there are a lot of cases where it’s just obviously a good thing
to do. It means that subsequent optimizations that look for specific patterns of code
only have to look for the canonical forms, rather than all forms.</p>

<p>Another way of saying this is, having a canonicalization pass is a
way of factoring out the parts in a compiler that know all the different
forms <code>x + 4</code> could take, so that most optimization passes don’t have
to worry about this. They don’t have to look for <code>4 + x</code>, because they
can assume that looking for <code>x + 4</code> covers that. Handy!</p>

<h3 id="how-do-we-choose-a-canonical-form">How do we choose a canonical form?</h3>

<p>Sometimes it’s easy. The canonical form for <code>2 + 3</code> is <code>5</code>, because
that’s clearly simpler in every possible way.</p>

<p>Sometimes it’s an arbitrary choice. It often doesn’t matter than much
whether one picks <code>4 + x</code> over <code>x + 4</code>, but it is helpful to pick one
or the other, so sometimes it’s just human aesthetics.</p>

<p>It’s tempting to pick whatever form would be fastest, or <em>optimal</em>, on
the target machine. And indeed, sometimes what’s fastest aligns with what’s
simplest. <code>2 + 3</code> canonicalizing <code>5</code> is typically such a case. But
sometimes it doesn’t.</p>

<h3 id="yeah-so-what-about-x--2">Yeah so what about <code>x * 2</code>…</h3>

<p><code>x * 2</code> is equivalent to <code>x + x</code>; which of these should be
the canonical form? It might seem like we might want to say: pick whatever’s
optimal for the target architecture. Addition is generally
faster than multiplication, so that would suggest we pick <code>x + x</code> as
the canonical form.</p>

<p>But, <code>x + x</code> can actually make things harder for subsequent
optimizations, because it means that now <code>x</code> has multiple uses. Having multiple uses
makes some optimizations more complex – in terms of the dependence graph,
this is a DAG rather than a tree, and trees are generally simpler to
work with. So maybe <code>x * 2</code> is actually a better canonical form, even if it’s a worse optimal form.</p>

<p>That said, we might consider canonicalizing this to <code>x &lt;&lt; 1</code>, which has only one use of <code>x</code>,
and has the nice property of making it as obvious as
possible that the least significant bit of the result is zero. That way,
we don’t have to have as much random knowledge of multiplication by
powers of two strewn throughout the compiler.</p>

<p>Efficiency on the target machine still matters, but we can defer thinking
about that until codegen, where it’s no longer as important to enable
subsequent optimizations. At that point, we’re going to start caring about picking between <code>+</code>,
<code>*</code>, and <code>&lt;&lt;</code> based on which one executes fastest.</p>

<p>The basic philosophy
of canonicalization says that canonical forms should be translated into
optimal forms toward the back of the compiler, after all mid-level
optimizations which benefit from canonical form are done. It’s also
worth noting that codegen itself benefits from having the
code coming into it be in canonical form, so that it doesn’t have to
recognize all the ways to write <code>x &lt;&lt; 1</code>, and can just recognize one
pattern for that and emit the optimal code for it.</p>

<p>This is often a source of confusion: Is canonicalization
the same as optimization? It’s often done as part of the “optimizer”, and
many of the things it does produce more optimal code directly. But
ultimately, in its purest form, canonicalization just focuses on
removing unnecessary variation so that subsequent optimizations can
be simpler.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Canonical form, canonical form<br>
Canonical form hates optimal form<br>
They have a fight, canonical wins<br>
Canonical form…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(sung to the tune of “Particle Man” by They Might Be Giants)</p>

<h3 id="sometimes-its-ambiguous-redundancy-elimination">Sometimes it’s ambiguous: redundancy elimination</h3>

<p>Is redundancy elimination a canonicalization or an optimization?</p>

<p>It’s certainly simpler to compute a given value once and reuse the value, rather than compute it twice.
But does that aid subsequent optimizations? It depends.</p>

<p>A case where it does aid subsequent optimizations is when it eliminates redundant memory accesses.
That way, it’s essentially saying that no later passes have to even ask what the dependencies are
for a given memory access, because the memory access has been eliminated.</p>

<p>A case where it doesn’t is where it can take expression trees where everything has a single use and
give some values multiple uses. Some kinds of optimization passes are harder to do on DAGs than on
trees, so this can result in pessimizations in some cases, depending on what kinds of things the
rest of the compiler is doing.</p>

<p>However, we typically do think of redundancy elimination as being a canonicalization.
It’s trivial to convert multiple-use values into single-use values by duplicating code,
while going the other direction requires some analysis.</p>

<h3 id="even-more-ambiguous-inlining">Even more ambiguous: inlining</h3>

<p>Inlining can act like canonicalization, especially in cases where the inlined function body can
be optimized away. However, thinking of inlining in terms of canonicalization doesn’t lead to a natural threshold. Should we maximally
inline everything as far as possible? Or should we do the reverse and maximally outline and deduplicate
outlined functions? Neither extreme is particularly practical, so most compilers use heuristics in
practice rather than having a rigid definition of canonical form relative to calls.</p>

<p>That said, even though there’s no clear boundary, we can imagine a rough guideline.
Think of old-school C code, written at a time when “C is a portable assembly language”
was more true than it is today, where calls that were important to inline were
written as macros. In many ways, one of the jobs of compilers for higher-level languages
is to compile them down to roughly this level, so that they can be optimized using
optimization techniques which work well at this level. In theory, we could define the
task of a canonicalizing inliner to just be to inline code down to what it would have
looked like if that same code had been written in old-school C (at least with
respect to inlining). That’s not very pure, and it’s difficult to precisely describe,
but it’s an intuitive and relatively practical compromise between extremes.</p>

<h3 id="canonical-form-isnt-just-for-arithmetic-expressions">Canonical form isn’t just for arithmetic expressions!</h3>

<p>Everything in an IR may be subjected to canonicalization.</p>

<p>For example, a control flow canonicalization might involve sorting the
basic blocks of a program into Reverse Post-Order (RPO). Doing this is
a simple way to ensure that the code is optimized the same regardless
of how the user organizes the code inside their functions.</p>

<p>Dead code elimination is also a kind of canonicalization. The canonical
form for dead code is no code.</p>

<p>In aggressive loop-transforming compilers, another form of canonicalization
is to maximally fission loops into as many parts as possible, and then
assume subsequent passes will fuse them back together into optimal
loops that effectively utilize available registers and cache space.</p>

<h3 id="canonicalization-as-compression">Canonicalization as compression</h3>

<p>It’s often the case that smaller forms are preferred over longer
forms, so canonicalization tends to make code smaller, making it a
form of compression. Also, since it effectively reduces non-essential
entropy, it can make subsequent general-purpose compression more
effective as well.</p>

<p>If we could conceptually perform all theoretically possible
canonicalizations on a program, we’d end up with something related to
its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity">Kolmogorov Complexity</a>
(it may not be identical, since canonicalization puts the needs of
subsequent optimizations first, rather than absolute compression).
Maximal canonicalization is frequently impossible in practice, because
of the halting problem, but also because even in cases where it’s
theoretically possible, it can require impractical amounts of computation.</p>

<p>That said, it is pretty fun to think that for any given program, there
is a theoretical “maximally canonical form” for that program, that
all equivalent ways of writing that program could be reduced to. It
is tempting to think of this as a kind of pure essence of the program.</p>

<h3 id="excessive-canonicalization">Excessive canonicalization</h3>

<p>Canonicalization discards inessential information.
However, sometimes that information can be useful to preserve.</p>

<p>An example arises in instruction scheduling: Say a user writes code like</p>



<p>Assuming there’s no aliasing going on here, there’s no reason why
one of these statements has to be ordered before the other. Their
order in the user’s source code is inessential information.
“Sea of nodes” style compilers may canonicalize to the point where
there is no inherent ordering between these two statements.</p>

<p>The compiler backend ultimately has to produce machine code, which
on conventional architectures requires the compiler to pick <em>some</em>
ordering. Compilers can be pretty smart, and can take into
consideration many things, such as available execution resources
before and after these statements to know what order a 
CPU would prefer to see them in. However, as smart as they can be,
compilers can’t always find the optimal answers. Optimal instruction
scheduling is NP complete, but also, it may come down to runtime
factors that ahead-of-time compilers don’t have. And 
CPU hardware performance characteristics aren’t always fully
documented.</p>

<h4 id="do-no-harm">“Do No Harm”?</h4>

<p>Most software has no idea how it’ll be mapped on to CPU pipelines.
But some does. And it’s these cases where getting the mapping right is
most important.</p>

<p>On such software, optimizations that make actual improvements are fine, however it can be
important that …</p></section></div></div></div>

          <p>After <a href="https://www.endlessmetrics.com/newcovid19cases.html">new confirmed cases</a>, deaths are probably the second most important metric. After all, if no one died from COVID-19, this whole pandemic thing would be a lot less scary.</p>
<p>A seven-day moving average is used to smooth the trend, as the data for new deaths has some seasonality depending on the day of the week (like new confirmed cases). I also include new confirmed cases on this chart (with a one week lag as deaths obviously come a bit after initial diagnosis) to show the relationship and subsequent divergence:</p>


<p>Note: I do exclude one data point from New Jersey that represents about 1,800 deaths as they were backdated deaths applied to one single day. So, it causes some noise to the series and the focus here is the general trend.</p>

The limited control over the files content makes exploitation very hard; perhaps crafting an executable PowerShell script or bat file is plausible, but then there is the problem of getting those executed.</p><p>Instead, I chose to combine my active trace recording with a call to:</p><pre><code>WINRT_IMPL_AUTO(Windows<span>::</span>Foundation<span>::</span>IAsyncAction) SnapCustomTraceAsync(param<span>::</span>hstring <span>const</span><span>&amp;</span> outputDirectory)
</code></pre><p>When supplying an <code>outputDirectory</code> value located inside <code>%WINDIR%\temp\DiagTrack_alternativeTrace</code> (Where the <code>.etl</code> files of my running trace are saved) an interesting behavior emerges.</p><p>The Diagtrack Service will rename <em>all</em> the created <code>.etl</code> files in <code>DiagTrack_alternativeTrace</code> to the directory given as the <code>outputDirectory</code> argument to <code>SnapCustomTraceAsync</code>. This allows destination control to be acquired because rename operations that occur where the source file gets created in a folder that grants non-privileged users write access are exploitable. This is due to the permission inheritance of files and their parent directories. When a file is moved by a rename operation, the DACL does not change. What this means is that if we can make the destination become <code>%WINDIR%\System32</code>, and somehow move the file then we will still have write permission to the file. So, we know we control the <code>outputDirectory</code> argument of <code>SnapCustomTraceAsync</code>, but some limitations exist.</p><p>If the chosen <code>outputDirectory</code> is not a child of <code>%WINDIR%\temp\DiagTrack_alternativeTrace</code>, the rename will not happen. The <code>outputDirectory</code> cannot exist because the Diagtrack Service has to create it. When created, it is created with SYSTEM as its owner; only the READ permission is granted to users.</p><p>This is problematic as we cannot make the directory into a mount point. Even if we had the required permissions, we would be stopped by not being able to empty the directory because Diagtrack has placed the snapshot output etl file inside it. Lucky for us, we can circumvent these obstacles by creating two levels of indirection between the <code>outputDirectory</code> destination and <code>DiagTrack_alternativeTrace</code>.</p><p>By creating the folder <code>DiagTrack_alternativeTrace\extra\indirections</code> and supplying <code>%WINDIR%\temp\DiagTrack_alternativeTrace\extra\indirections\snap</code> as the <code>outputDirectory</code> we allow Diagtrack to create the snap folder with its limited permissions, as we are inside <code>DiagTrack_alternativeTrace</code>. With this, we can rename the <code>extra</code> folder, as it is created by us. The two levels of indirection is necessary to bypass the locking of the directory due to Diagtrack having open files inside the directory. When <code>extra</code> is renamed, we can recreate <code>%WINDIR%\temp\DiagTrack_alternativeTrace\extra\indirections\snap</code> (which is now empty) and we have full permissions to it as we are the owner!</p><p>Now, we can turn <code>DiagTrack_alternativeTrace\extra\indirections\snap</code> into a mount point targeted at <code>%WINDIR%\system32</code> and Diagtrack will move all files matching <code>WPR_initiated_DiagTrack*.etl*</code> into <code>%WINDIR%\system32</code>. The files will still be writeable as they were created in a folder that granted users permission to WRITE. Unfortunately, having full control over a file in System32 is not quite enough for code execution… that is, unless we have a way of executing user controllable filenames - like the DiagnosticHub plugin method popularized by <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/tiraniddo">James Forshaw</a></strong>. There’s a caveat though, DiagnosticHub now requires any DLL it loads to be signed by Microsoft, but we do have some ways to execute a DLL file in system32 under SYSTEM security context - if the filename is something specific. Another snag though is that the filename is not controllable. So, how can we take control?</p><p>If instead of making the mountpoint target System32, we target an Object Directory in the NT namespace and create a symbolic link with the same name as the rename destination file, we gain control over the filename. The target of the symbolic link will become the rename operations destination. For instance, setting it to<code>\??\%WINDIR%\system32\phoneinfo.dll</code> results in write permission to a file the Error Reporting service will load and execute when an error report is submitted out of process. For my mountpoint target I chose <code>\RPC Control</code> as it allows all users to create symbolic links inside.</p><p>Let’s try it!</p><p>When Diagtrack should have done the rename, nothing happened. This is because, before the rename operation is done, the destination folder is opened, but now is an object directory. This means it’s unable to be opened by the file/directory API calls. This can be circumvented by timing the creation of the mount point to be after the opening of the folder, but before the rename. Normally in such situations, I create a file in the destination folder with the same name as the rename destination file. Then …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>In this blog post, I would like to show you a practical example of a “fake it till you make it” approach to product development. To my mind, it basically means that you are trying to stay a few steps ahead of your current situation. You are “faking” the idea that you have progressed more, but you actually haven’t. This approach gave me invaluable answers for my product which were hard to get otherwise.</p><h2 id="here-is-my-story">Here is my story:</h2><p>3 years ago, my former manager came to me and told me to do around 1500 banner ads. The company I worked for got new products and they wanted to market them in different countries. We got 6 products in 5 colors and the aim was to create ad banners for 3 countries. The goal was to create 15 formats of each banner ad. It was a nightmare for the graphic department. And I was its team leader.</p><p>When I imagined myself doing 1500 banner ads, I wanted to cry. This scenario of creating thousands of banners could happen easily every month. It is possible to do manually 1500 ad banners, but it is just… too boring! I wanted to be a creator, not a generator.</p><p>I started immediately googling how I can automate the process of creating banners sets. I found some solutions but they were pretty useless. They weren’t flexible enough.</p><p>I decided to create my own solution. I experimented with Photoshop, more specifically with the “Actions” feature there. Basically, the Actions feature was recording my steps in Photoshop. So, I could record how I manually generated banners, then play it again and&nbsp;generate the banners. It was pretty simple: Yet powerful. With this script I created, I was able to automate some parts of the process and help our department to be faster.</p><p>I was interested in a community of graphic designers who had the same problem. With my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/iChangeTheWay" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Ivan</a>, I created a landing page in a few hours. <a href="https://twitter.com/tmvst" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Tomas</a> sketched the logo in 5 minutes, then we came up with pricing. I created a video of the script and…</p><p>I posted it to a local Facebook designers’ community group.</p><p>And this is what happened:</p><p><span>

<em>My post to a local Facebook designers’ community group.</em></p><p>I was amazed by how many people had the same problem as us. What was more amazing was that 5 people bought the script. It wasn’t cheap, it cost around 110€. Looking back retrospectively, I think it was… a miracle. It showed me that the problem was there and people were willing to pay for the solution.</p><p>At that time I didn’t know anything about building a product, selling, consumer behavior, or SaaS (Software as a Service). Well, I knew the theory, but just from videos, friends, or lectures. But I didn’t have any tangible experience.</p><h2 id="i-started-with-experimentation">I started with experimentation.</h2><p>I created <strong>a free version of a Photoshop ad generator as a Freemium model,</strong> which could automate only 6 banner formats in contrast to the full version which could automate 20 formats. I gave it for free to people in exchange for getting feedback from them.</p><p>To be honest…</p><p>0 people bought the full version after they tried the free version.</p><p>Frankly put, it failed. I was overly optimistic&nbsp;and thought that the product would do better. On the other hand, It motivated me to ask people what was not working for them and how I could get better. I even gave the full professional freelancers version, which cost 110€, for free in exchange for feedback.</p><p>And what happened?</p><p><strong>Nobody wrote me back.</strong></p><p>It sucked. I didn’t know what to do next.</p><p>At that time I let it go. I didn’t have money to build the product and I didn’t feel that I had enough experience to build the software from scratch.</p><h2 id="after-more-than-a-year-break">After more than a year break</h2><p>After a year and a half, I decided to explore this topic again. I learned new things from Product Management, User Experience design, I was closer to friends who were dealing with product development on a daily basis. So I gave it a try.</p><p>The last script didn’t work for all graphics of banners, it worked only for a few specific graphics. It was good, but once you wanted to generate some complicated banner, this script did not work smoothly. Meanwhile, Photoshop developed a few other features, which changed the game. My game.</p><h2 id="little-technical-context">Little technical context</h2><p>Scripts are technically the easiest to do however, they are quite limited. I decided to learn more about what was feasible in Photoshop. I’d learned about plugins, which seemed like the right way to do things. However, to do a plugin, I needed a front end developer, because I couldn’t code on a sufficient level.</p><p>The problem is that building something with a developer is the most expensive thing to do. And I didn’t even know if people were still interested in the solution. The only thing I knew was that I wanted to improve generating ad banners as much as I could, but how it should work? I had no clue.</p><h2 id="just-do-it">Just do it!</h2><p>But I had something that I believed was powerful. Designer superpower. Really, Sam? Superpower?… Yes, superpower. Let me explain.</p><p>If I want to get rid of generating, what should I do? I could&nbsp; just hit some magic button and everything would be set. But how would it work? It’s time for 🥁 designer superpower, (which I believe is a designers’ toolset).</p><p><span>

<em>Preparation for video.</em></p><p>Then I needed somehow to fake the algorithm of generating banners. So I recorded screen videos and I got rid of some parts. I removed these parts where I needed to manually re-organize components in banners. In the end, these screen recordings looked like a great generating algorithm.</p><p>Now the final part. I needed to connect these parts. For this purpose I used Adobe After Effects.</p><p>And this is the final video which took me 2 weeks to do:</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/JWApMjQ3-jE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://youtu.be/JWApMjQ3-jE</a></p><p>I showed this video to friends of mine and they thought that I had learned how to code. At that point, I knew I had done it well.</p><p><strong>🗒Side note:</strong> When you think of that, this is a superpower. With some tools, you can show people (in my case graphic designers) the future them and spark imagination. You can take some ideas and make them look real. Suddenly, all the people can see how your product should behave and what it should do. Isn’t that powerful?</p><p><span>

<em>Facebook post with video which gave me 400 signups</em></p><p>I added my <a href="https://www.bannerium.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">landing page</a> in the post, then I shared it to other groups/forums and I got 400 signups.</p><p>I even got some deal with a design agency, which told me that they would give us some money to develop a plugin. Moreover, I even had 2 meetings with them. Just based on the video.</p><p>In the end, nothing came from this deal. That was reasonable. Here is why: The truth was, that I had just released the video. I didn’t have anything else. Just some parts connected with duct tape. At that time, I had no clue how close we could get with the real code.</p><p><strong>💡Lesson learned</strong></p><p>Showing a “fake” video is powerful for sharing a vision and testing if there is a need for a solution. On the other hand, if the video is too ambitious, people will take it as a norm and will base their expectations on the video. If the real product doesn’t match the video afterward, they will probably be unsatisfied because the product is&nbsp;incomplete. This thing happened to me when I had a call with a user during beta testing. She expected that the complete product should work as it was on the video. So sometimes it is better to be realistic. Otherwise, you will create unhappy initial users. But I believe it is a trade-off and you need to count on that.</p><p>Once I saw that the product was still in demand I found a programmer called Petr and we started with the development of the plugin. The video was also a great tool for how to communicate what I wanted to achieve. Of course, video showed happy path&nbsp;and I needed to design “what if” scenarios, afterwards. But it served my expectations&nbsp;perfectly.</p><p>Then we went through beta testing, which 50 people joined. Nowadays the <a href="https://bannerium.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">product is live.&nbsp;</a></p><h2 id="summary">Summary:</h2><h3 id="a-designer-toolset-is-a-superpower-you-can-easily-create-something-that-was-not-on-the-market-before-and-validate-your-idea-just-in-a-week">A Designer toolset is a superpower.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>Recently I got into Linux <em>again</em> after a long hiatus.</p>
<p>I fell in love with <a href="https://pop.system76.com/">Pop!_OS</a> by <a href="https://system76.com/">System76</a>.</p>
<p>Ubuntu 20.04 also looks gorgeous and made me want to go back to the Linux side.</p>
<p>So I started looking for a worthy laptop for the job, with excellent support for Linux, and these are my findings.</p>
<p>The notebooks are grouped by the following vendors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dell
<ul>
<li><a href="#dell-xps-13-developer-edition">Dell XPS 13 Developer Edition</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Lenovo
<ul>
<li><a href="#thinkpad-x1-carbon-gen-8">ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 8</a></li>
<li><a href="#thinkpad-x1-yoga-gen-4">ThinkPad X1 Yoga (Gen 4)</a></li>
<li><a href="#thinkpad-t490s">ThinkPad T490s</a></li>
<li><a href="#thinkpad-l13">ThinkPad L13</a></li>
<li><a href="#thinkpad-l490">ThinkPad L490</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>System76
<ul>
<li><a href="#lemur-pro">Lemur pro</a></li>
<li><a href="#darter-pro">Darter pro</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Prices are in Euro.</p>
<p>CPU Mark and Values are from <a href="https://www.cpubenchmark.net/">cpubenchmark.net</a></p>
<p>Purposely excluded Purism and their Librem line for their niche product (privacy oriented), value for the buck and potential to later re-sell.</p>
<p><strong>Let me know if you have better alternatives by getting in touch <a href="https://twitter.com/christian_fei">@christian_fei</a></strong></p>
<p>I have put together a publicly available <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12Y0amjbf-YD8pQqdC7QJ04noJcVnQCJj6y3_drhdiPw/edit?usp=sharing">spreadsheet</a> that contains all these information.</p>

        <p><strong>Abstract</strong> This paper proposes a new type of implicit generative model that is able to quickly learn a latent representation without an explicit encoder. This is achieved with an implicit neural network that takes as inputs points in the coordinate space alongside a latent vector initialised with zeros. The gradients of the data fitting loss with respect to this zero vector are jointly optimised to act as latent points that capture the data manifold. The results show similar characteristics to autoencoders, but with fewer parameters and the advantages of implicit representation networks.</p>
        
        <h2>Approach</h2>
        <p>
            Gradient Origin Networks (GONs) are comparable to Variational Autoencoders in that both compress data into latent representations and permit sampling in a single step. However, GONs use gradients as encodings meaning that they have a much simpler architecture:
        </p>
        
        <p>
            In Gradient Origin Networks, unknown parameters in the latent space are initialised at the origin. This zero vector is concatenated with the known coordinate parameters, which becomes the inputs of an implicit representation network <i>F</i> with a prior over the gradients (a <a href="https://vsitzmann.github.io/siren/">SIREN</a> whose gradients are normally distributed). This means we can compute gradients of the data fitting loss with respect to these inputs, and jointly optimise for the new latents:
        </p>

        <p><img alt="Gradient Origin Network" src="https://cwkx.github.io/data/GON/data/gon-eqn.png"></p><p>At inference, the latent vector can be sampled in a single step without requiring iteration. Here are some random spherical interpolations showing this:</p>

        <p>In practice, we find GONs to be parameter-efficient and fast to train. For more details, please watch the YouTube video and read the paper in the links above.</p>

        <p><strong>Conclusion</strong> We have proposed a new type of implicit generative model that captures the dataset without requiring an explicit encoder. By initialising a latent vector of our unknown parameters with zeros, we have shown that it is possible to compute the gradients of the data fitting loss with respect to this origin, and then jointly fit the data while learning this new point of reference in the latent space. The results show this approach is able to represent datasets using a small number of parameters, with the advantage of implicit representation networks being able to model many different types of discrete signals.</p>

        <div id="MainContent">
            <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/submit" onclick="window.location = window.location.protocol + '//www.reddit.com/r/programming/submit?url=' + encodeURIComponent(window.location); return false"> <img src="https://www.thanassis.space/spreddit7.gif" alt="submit to programming reddit"> </a></p><p><em>(July 2020)</em></p>

<p>The COVID19 situation means that like so many other folks, over the last 4 months
I've been working remotely from home. I was told to take my work
laptop <em>(a Windows 10 machine)</em> with me - and use it everyday; connecting via VPN
and going through my tasks.</p>

<p>A lot of work has been done in 4 months. And I am backing it all up in the
encrypted ZFS mirror I built with my <a href="https://www.thanassis.space/atomicpi.html" target="_blank">Atomic PI</a>.</p>

<p>The previous sentence says a lot. Allow me to elaborate:</p>

<div>
<p><img src="https://www.thanassis.space/front-on-hi.jpg" alt="My backup (and Vagrant, and Docker, and many other things...) server"></p><p>
<em>My 35$ backup (and Vagrant, and Docker, and many other things...) server</em>
</p></div>



<ol>
<li><p>I have attached two external 2TB USB drives on this tiny 35$ Linux server.</p></li>
<li><p>I used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS" target="_blank">ZFS</a>, the 
undisputed king of filesystems, <strong>to arrange the drives in a "mirror" configuration</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>You can think of it like so: <em>"if while my master reads his files I detect an error, I will get
that data from the other drive - and I will re-write the data in the "bad" drive
where I detected the error"</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>ZFS can detect errors, because it uses checksums while reading;</strong> and when it
detects errors, it will transparently address them by reading from the spare
storage. <strong>It will also update (rewrite) the storage where the error was detected</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>ZFS would do this even if I had a single USB drive attached, if when creating the
filesystem I used the <code>"copies=2"</code> option ; basically making sure that each data block is kept in
two places on the disk. That wouldn't shield me from the whole disk going
dead, though ; hence why I use two drives.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>ZFS supports compression</strong>, with various algorithms. I have more than 1.9x
compression ratio on everything I store inside it - except two ZFS filesystems
where I explicitly said I don't want that <em>(yes, you can have many filesystems
inside a single ZFS pool)</em>. Why? Because the data I store there were already
compressed (videos) - why waste CPU trying to compress them?</p></li>
<li><p>The spare storage is used by ZFS to speed up reads, too. When multiple processes
read data, <strong>both drives will be used at the same time to serve them.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>To protect the sensitivity of the data, my ZFS pool is built from encrypted
LUKS devices. The mirror is not build on the raw devices of the two disks;
it is instead built on top of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Unified_Key_Setup">LUKS</a>-encrypted
devices that are backed by them.
<strong>Simply put: if someone steals the drives, he won't be able to read anything
from them.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>The encryption uses the AES instructions on the Atom CPU; <strong>I don't experience
any slowdown</strong> when reading data from the ZFS pool.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I could speak about more things; like snapshots, and optimal use of space...
But I'll just stop here.</p>

<p>Nothing beats ZFS. Nothing even comes close.</p>



<p>My work laptop has a 1TB NVMe storage.</p>

<p>I could try to <code>rsync</code> files to the ZFS server while Windows runs; but 
that's not really optimal. For example, Windows doesn't normally allow files opened
for writing to be read by your backup program; the dreaded "sharing violation"
is still there in many cases. And permissions under Windows are sometimes
a mystery - files fail to open for weird reasons <em>(e.g. because
the antivirus daemon decided to wake up and do something with them)</em>.</p>

<p>One thought that comes to mind that covers all angles - by allowing me to recover
from a complete disk failure - is to boot from a Linux USB stick and take a disk
image <strong>of the entire drive</strong>. I can resilver a new drive with the image;
and get back to my pristine OS setup.</p>

<p>But why take a <code>dd</code> image, when you can get a compressed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SquashFS" target="_blank">SquashFS</a>
image instead?</p>

<p>Why indeed.</p>

<p>Boot from a Linux USB stick - I use
<a href="https://www.system-rescue-cd.org/" target="_blank">SystemRescue</a> -
and after mounting your ZFS storage remotely <em>(via <code>NFS</code>, <code>CIFS</code>, etc -
take your pick)</em>, you execute this inside it:</p>

<pre><code>mkdir empty-dir
mksquashfs empty-dir squash.img -p 'nvme0n1.img f 444 root root dd if=/dev/nvme0n1 bs=1M'
rmdir empty-dir
</code></pre>

<p>What this does, is create a SquashFS filesystem that contains a single file:
<code>nvme0n1.img</code>. This file's contents are obtained by the <code>dd</code> command;
basically a bit-by-bit copy of the entire NVMe drive.</p>

<p>After a few hours, I have a <code>squash.img</code> in my ZFS pool. Nicely checksummed
and mirrored in my two USB drives. Even though the original drive was 1TB,
the SquashFS image is just 400GB.</p>



<p>Now, I can mount the NTFS partition inside it:</p>

<div>
<pre><tt><span>$ cat /tank/ESA/Laptop/mount</span><span>.</span><span>sh </span>


<span>df </span><span>|</span><span> grep /iso</span><span>5</span><span> </span><span>||</span><span> {</span>
<span>    echo </span><span>"[-] Mounting SquashFS..."</span>
<span>    mount -o loop squash</span><span>.</span><span>img /iso</span><span>5</span><span>/</span><span> </span><span>||</span><span> </span><span>exit</span><span> </span><span>1</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>df </span><span>|</span><span> grep /iso</span><span>6</span><span> </span><span>||</span><span> {</span>
<span>    echo </span><span>"[-] Mounting NTFS-3G..."</span>
<span>    losetup -f /iso</span><span>5</span><span>/nvme0n1</span><span>.</span><span>img </span>
<span>    partprobe /dev/loop</span><span>0</span>
<span>    mount -o ro -t ntfs-3g  /dev/loop0p3 /iso</span><span>6</span><span> </span><span>||</span><span> </span><span>exit</span><span> </span><span>1</span>
<span>}</span>
</tt></pre>
</div>

<p>After this, I get a read-only mounted copy of my entire Windows drive
on <code>/iso6</code>. Nice.</p>



<p>The only way I can survive under Windows, is by working inside Linux
virtual machines. Which means a lot of my data exist only inside
.vmdk / .vdi files.</p>

<p>Guess what - no problem:</p>

<div>
<pre><tt><span>modprobe nbd</span>
<span>qemu-nbd -r -c /dev/nbd</span><span>0</span><span> /iso</span><span>6</span><span>/path/to/some</span><span>.</span><span>vdi</span>
<span>mount /dev/nbd0p3 /somewhere</span>
</tt></pre>
</div>

<p>...and when you are done:</p>

<div>
<pre><tt><span>...</span>
<span>umount /somewhere</span>
<span>qemu-nbd -d /dev/nbd</span><span>0</span>
</tt></pre>
</div>



<p>OK, but that's a static image - how do you update it?</p>

<p>There are many ways. The one I use is 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OverlayFS" target="_blank">OverlayFS</a>.
Basically, any time I want, I <code>rsync</code> the new state of the data to the ZFS
server, into a path that is served by both the read-only mounted folder
from the SquashFS snapshot, <em>and</em> a writable folder that stores the differences
sent by <code>rsync</code>.</p>

<p>And whenever I want, I can use the OverlayFS-mounted folder, to create
an updated SquashFS image - and recompress everything into a new snapshot.
Just to save some space.</p>



<p>So, overall - we use a compressed version of the entire drive (which in my
case was 400MB instead of the full 1TB), to mount and access the entire
contents, <code>find/grep</code> do anything we want in their contents... and also
mount the virtualized storage contained inside them, and do anything we
want inside those too.</p>

<p>And we can update it - while knowing that behind it, there's rock solid
ZFS-based mirroring. And compression. And checksums.</p>

<p>I challenge you, dear reader - to point me to something that provides all
the functionality described above, and that only costs 2 external USB drives,
and a 35$ Single Board Computer.</p>

<p><em>P.S. My periodic pool scrubs have not found any issue yet. The system
is rock solid - and I use the Atomic PI for other tasks, too - including
booting up Docker containers, and even Vagrant/libvirt ones. I didn't
expect that last part to work, but ZRAM (memory compression) really helps.</em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  
    <p><br>
I’ve been thinking about writing this article for a bit, but have been most prompted by a post grandly titled “<a href="http://calpaterson.com/async-python-is-not-faster.html">Async Python is not faster</a>”. The post was rooted with some good motivations and observations, but also fell somewhat into a polarising mode of discussion that I’d like to see our communities try to move beyond.</p>

<p>Async concurrency necessarily brings with it an element of ecosystem split, and this can mean that it’s a bit of a divisive area to try to have conversations within.</p>

<p>However I think we could probably benefit from a bit more recognition of where there is shared ground. And in areas where there’s less clarity, to be able to have constructive conversations around the relative merits in differing approaches.</p>

<hr>



<h3 id="-why-you-shouldnt-care-about-performance">★ Why you shouldn’t care about “performance”.</h3>

<p>If you’re starting a new project, and choosing a python async framework vs a python sync framework, then any “performance” metrics around the frameworks <em>almost certainly don’t actually matter</em>, and are almost always a nonsense point of debate.</p>

<p>What is <em>actually</em> critical to your business is the development experience and strength of the surrounding ecosystem. What is your time to market going to be? How will the maintenance overhead be? How robust and evolvable is your codebase?</p>

<h3 id="-why-you-might-care-about-performance">★ Why you might care about “performance”.</h3>

<p>Having said that, there <em>are</em> a small portion of cases where the performance characteristics are a valid consideration. Particularly if your web framework makes lots of outgoing HTTP requests or other networking and I/O.</p>

<p>It’s important for the Python ecosystem that it ought to compare favourably to other dynamic languages in domains where async is beneficial. We don’t want to be in a position where “we’re using JavaScript because we believe it’ll scale up better” is a valid market blocker vs. choosing Python.</p>

<h3 id="-what-were-talking-about-when-we-talk-about-performance">★ What we’re talking about when we talk about “performance”.</h3>

<p>Like-for-like a single async function call in isolation will be marginally slower than a plain function call. That’s not contentious.</p>

<p>What we’re actually interested in is how <em>efficiently</em> we can interleave multiple concurrent tasks. In I/O bound systems co-operative concurrency (async) performs more efficiently under high concurrency than threaded concurrency (sync). Again, not contentious.</p>

<p>Again - Async Python is not faster. It <em>is</em> more efficient. Which will <em>tend</em> to mean that on I/O bound systems, the latency will <em>continue</em> to remain low even as the level of concurrency increases.</p>

<h3 id="-there-are-no-good-benchmarks">★ There are no good benchmarks.</h3>

<p>JSON “hello world” benchmarks are junk. Almost all cases of “I’ve created this benchmark myself” are likely to be junk. The prevalence of new frameworks overly focusing on nebulous benchmarking claims is generally junk. An obsession on benchmarking numbers can also sometimes result in poor overall design choices, such as obfuscated or unnecessarily coupled bits of codebase, because some not-very-meaningful metric is being prioritised over the code design itself. None of this should be contentious.</p>

<p>It’s not <em>always</em> true, for example, when Sanic was introduced there was a genuine step forward which was worth talking about, so I can understand why there was a focus there. But there’s still a ridiculous hype-cycle attached as a result, and we need to be really careful about trying to step beyond that.</p>

<p>It’s also reasonable if benchmarking is discussed in a sensible context and placement. For example, to the extent that Uvicorn and Starlette have discussed performance it has only ever been with a view to making a solid case that having a <em>properly specified</em> server/framework boundary API isn’t a negative performance consideration. Prior to the introduction of ASGI, Python’s async web ecosystem had generally bundled together both the low-level HTTP handling and the high level framework, and there was a notion that needed dispelling that introducing a properly specified separation of concerns wasn’t a good approach because <em>“something something performance something”</em>.</p>

<p>If you <em>are</em> going to look at web framework benchmarks for some very rough first-pass ideas about relative efficiency then the TechEmpower benchmarks should almost certainly be your baseline, since they’re at least independent, and have a decent range of test cases. If you’re going to diverge from them have some good argument for doing so.</p>

<p>The “Async Python is not faster” benchmarking is a reasonable example here, since it had clearly applied a decent degree of thoughtfulness. Even so there were still problems with the methodology, as <a href="https://twitter.com/llanga/status/1271719778324025349">Łukasz Langa did a good job of unpicking</a>.</p>

<p>Having said that, the TechEmpower benchmarks only show throughput, and don’t include any <em>meaningful</em> latency information. There’s actually a good reason for that, since
comparing latencies is really difficult. You can’t arrive at a single “95% latency” figure, because the figure you’ll arrive at <em>also depends on what throughput load you’re putting the system under</em> at the time of measuring the latency.</p>

<p>As a result measuring latency is only ever really meaningful if you’re looking at <em>graphs of how the latencies vary over a range of different throughputs</em>. Amber Brown’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxP1I-tm_2c">DjangoCon 2019 keynote talk does a fantastic job of showing some examples here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="-asgi-is-a-really-positive-step-for-the-async-ecosystem">★ ASGI is a really positive step for the async ecosystem.</h3>

<p>Having a decently specified server/framework interface is a <em>really good thing</em>. Andrew Godwin’s design for ASGI fills this gap with a WSGI-like approach. That has a set of trade-offs, but it’s a pretty pragmatic and well rounded choice.</p>

<p>This should not really be contentious.</p>

<h3 id="-its-about-functionality">★ It’s about functionality.</h3>

<p>Async isn’t just about achieving higher levels of concurrency-per-server, it also makes it a bunch of new functionality more feasible, including…</p>

<ul>
  <li>Handling long-lived network connections like Websockets.</li>
  <li>Long-lived HTTP connections and server sent events.</li>
  <li>Dealing with background tasks without necessarily needing a full blown task queue subcomponent.</li>
  <li>Parallelizing outgoing HTTP requests or other high latency I/O.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="-not-everything-is-perfect">★ Not everything is perfect.</h3>

<p>The async ecosystem is far more immature than the existing thread synchronous. There are different challenges there, such as ensuring that <a href="https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2020/1/1/async-pressure/">backpressure is handled consistently throughout the various async APIs</a>, or in <a href="https://vorpus.org/blog/notes-on-structured-concurrency-or-go-statement-considered-harmful/">applying the lessons of structured concurrency</a>.</p>

<p>Nor is the “stdlib asyncio isn’t perfect” line a good argument either against asyncio specifically, or against async/await in general.</p>

<p>It’s okay that there’s still work to do in places. We know.  Let’s get that work done.</p>

<h3 id="-async-is-harder">★ Async is harder.</h3>

<p>Having to <em>think</em> about if a function does or doesn’t make I/O or could otherwise block <em>is unarguably more complex than not having to think about it</em>. It’s also more precise - you’re having to think about that for a reason, and done properly it’s presenting you with more information as a result. Being able to reason more clearly about which parts of your framework stack do or don’t perform I/O has a cost but also brings benefits.</p>

<p>There’s an analogy to make there in that writing Python using explicitly enforced typing is likely to be a harder than writing Python in an untyped style. It’s harder because you’re <em>also being more precise</em>. That’s not necessarily either good or bad, but it is definitively <em>different</em>.</p>

<p>This also gets to the point about why the “<a href="https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2015/02/01/what-color-is-your-function/">What colour is your function</a>” argument isn’t actually a good case against async code, even if it seems to make clear sense on first pass. We’re coloring our functions because we’re <em>enforcing the exposure of some important information all the way throughout the stack</em>. That’s not an inherently bad thing to do.</p>

<p>If those are areas where I think we ought to be able to reach consensus on, then there’s also a few areas where I think that the possible outcomes are less clear…</p>

<h3 id="-you-take-the-high-road-and-ill-take-the-low-road">★ You take the high road, and I’ll take the low road.</h3>

<p>There’s a few different tacks we might take onto introducing async into the Python web framework ecosystem…</p>

<ul>
  <li>Promoting mostly staying with threaded web frameworks. There’s actually a perfectly decent case to make that Python <em>on the whole</em> should eschew a <em>wide move towards async</em>. That the drawbacks of moving large swathes of the ecosystem towards an async model outweigh the advantages. (Pros: Simpler for the end developer. Huge existing ecosystem.)</li>
  <li>Working towards blended approaches. This is being championed within the Django community which is incrementally adding async support, largely off the back of some Herculean work by Andrew Godwin and others. This approach can either be in the form of adding support for async at the server level, while keeping the framework level strictly thread-synchronous. Or it can gradually start to expose optional async capabilities all the way through the stack. (Pros: Brings along the existing ecosystem, while adding async capabilities when they’re needed.)</li>
  <li>Working towards async-native frameworks. (Pros: Lower overall complexity of the stack then blended approach. More efficient since there’s less overhead in marshalling between two style all the way through the stack. If we’re having to write large amounts of new code then it’s not a bad inflection point at which to also rethink and finesse other aspects of how we’re putting together new frameworks.)</li>
</ul>

<p>We can’t really say which of these will yield the best dividends. Personally I <em>happen</em> to be working in the last of those three slices, simply because I can see a bunch of areas where I can contribute meaningfully towards the ecosystem there.</p>

<h3 id="-positioning-asyncio-and-trio">★ Positioning asyncio and Trio</h3>

<p>There another big question mark over the relative positioning of asyncio and Trio in the ecosystem. Trio is a newer approach to a Python async framework, that’s meticulously designed, and based on the principles of structured concurrency, that have been outlined by it’s author, Nathaniel Smith.</p>

<p>The difficulty this brings is that Trio is necessarily incompatible with asyncio, and introduces an ecosystem-split within an ecosystem-split.</p>

<p>There’s a few different …</p></div></div>

Such microbes annually cause more than 2.8 million difficult-to-treat pneumonia, bloodstream and other infections and 35,000 deaths in the U.S. The researchers, including PhD computer science graduate Abu Sayed Chowdhury, Shira Broschat in the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, and Douglas Call in the Paul G. Allen School for Global Animal Health, report on their work in the journal <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41598-020-67949-9&amp;t=ODM5NmQyMzY3MDczM2Y3NDE5OGFjOWIzYmYxZmE2ZTE0ZjNkODIzNixNYXJqRHczZg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F623012287345737728%2Fnew-user-friendly-software-finds-drug-resistant-bacteria&amp;m=0"><i>Scientific Reports</i>.</a></p><p>Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) occurs when bacteria or other microorganisms evolve or acquire genes that encode drug-resistance mechanisms. Bacteria that cause staph or strep infections or diseases such as tuberculosis and pneumonia have developed drug-resistant strains that make them increasingly difficult and sometimes impossible to treat. The problem is expected to worsen in future decades in terms of increased infections, deaths, and health costs as bacteria evolve to “outsmart” a limited number of antibiotic treatments.</p><p>“We need to develop tools to easily and efficiently predict antimicrobial resistance that increasingly threatens health and livelihoods around the world,” said Chowdhury, lead author on the paper.</p><p>As large-scale genetic sequencing has become easier, researchers are looking for AMR genes in the environment. Researchers are interested in where microbes are living in soil and water and how they might spread and affect human health. While they are able to identify genes that are similar to known AMR-resistant genes, they are probably missing genes for resistance that look very unique from a protein sequence perspective.</p><p>The WSU research team developed a machine-learning algorithm that uses features of AMR proteins rather than the similarity of gene sequences to identify AMR genes. The researchers used game theory, a tool that is used in several fields, especially economics, to model strategic interactions between game players, which in turn helps identify AMR genes. Using their machine learning algorithm and game theory approach, the researchers looked at the interactions of several features of the genetic material, including its structure and the physiochemical and composition properties of protein sequences rather than simply sequence similarity.</p><p>“Our software can be employed to analyze metagenomic data in greater depth than would be achieved by simple sequence matching algorithms,” Chowdhury said. “This can be an important tool to identify novel antimicrobial resistance genes that eventually could become clinically important.”</p><p>“The virtue of this program is that we can actually detect AMR in newly sequenced genomes,” Broschat said. “It’s a way of identifying AMR genes and their prevalence that might not otherwise have been found. That’s really important.”</p><p>The WSU team considered resistance genes found in species of <i>Clostridium</i>, <i>Enterococcus</i>, <i>Staphylococcus</i>, <i>Streptococcus</i>, and <i>Listeria</i>. These bacteria are the cause of many major infections and infectious diseases including staph infections, food poisoning, pneumonia, and life-threatening colitis due to C. difficile. They were able to accurately classify resistant genes with up to 90 percent accuracy.</p><p>They have developed a software package that can be easily downloaded and used by other researchers to look for AMR in large pools of genetic material. The software can also be improved over time. While it’s trained on currently available data, researchers will be able to re-train the algorithm as more data and sequences become available.</p><p>“You can bootstrap and improve the software as more positive data becomes available,” Broschat said.</p><p>–&nbsp;</p><p><b>Source: <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.wsu.edu%2F2020%2F07%2F06%2Fresearchers-develop-software-find-drug-resistant-bacteria%2F&amp;t=NDZjNGRjODY3MjY1YWU3ZjU1M2RmZjU1MDUwNTU2OGQ5ZjlmYjk3MixNYXJqRHczZg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F623012287345737728%2Fnew-user-friendly-software-finds-drug-resistant-bacteria&amp;m=0">Washington State University</a></b></p><p><b>Full study:</b>&nbsp;“PARGT: a software tool for predicting antimicrobial resistance in bacteria”, <i>Scientific Reports</i>.</p><p><a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fdx.doi.org%2F10.1038%2Fs41598-020-67949-9&amp;t=ZGJjMDc1MmIyYmY1YmE0MzYxMGJmMTc5NTJmYjg4YzQxNjVhZmZkOCxNYXJqRHczZg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F623012287345737728%2Fnew-user-friendly-software-finds-drug-resistant-bacteria&amp;m=0">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-67949-9</a><br></p><h2><b>Read Also</b></h2><p><a href="https://nuadox.com/post/190540146597/smart-bandages-color-changing">Color-changing ‘smart bandages’ sense and treat bacterial infections</a></p>

<article>
    <p>Have you ever thought how good it would be to have a help message for your shell script
that you wrote a month ago and already forgot what it is supposed to do?</p>
<p>Yeah, there is always a way to show a message using cat (meow) or a bunch of echo
calls.</p>
<p>But there is a neat trick.</p>
<p>Add your message with all the required information on top of your file, just right
after the shebang.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>#!/bin/bash
</span><span></span><span>###</span>
<span>### my-script — does one thing well</span>
<span>###</span>
<span>### Usage:</span>
<span>###   my-script &lt;input&gt; &lt;output&gt;</span>
<span>###</span>
<span>### Options:</span>
<span>###   &lt;input&gt;   Input file to read.</span>
<span>###   &lt;output&gt;  Output file to write. Use '-' for stdout.</span>
<span>###   -h        Show this message.</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Halfway done, now need to get this message in runtime with sed.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">help<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    sed -rn <span>'s/^### ?//;T;p'</span> <span>"</span><span>$0</span><span>"</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p><code>$0</code> means a filename of a file that is being executed.</p>
<p>A bit about the magic that is going here:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>s</code> — stands for substitute the following pattern;</li>
<li><code>/</code> — keyword to define start/end of the pattern;</li>
<li><code>^### ?</code> — match a string starting with ### and an optional space after;</li>
<li><code>//</code> — there could be something between the slashes, but since nothing is here, replace
the pattern with an empty string;</li>
<li><code>T</code> — Jumps to the end of sed-script if no s/// has done a successful substitution;</li>
<li><code>p</code> — Prints the result of the substitution.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now just call the <code>help</code> function if an arg <code>-h</code> or no args passed.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>if</span> <span>[[</span> <span>$#</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span> <span>]]</span> <span>||</span> <span>[[</span> <span>"</span><span>$1</span><span>"</span> <span>==</span> <span>"-h"</span> <span>]]</span><span>;</span> <span>then</span>
    <span>help</span>

<p><a href="https://veloren.net/">Veloren</a> is an open world, open-source voxel RPG inspired by Dwarf
Fortress and Cube World.</p>
<p>In June, Veloren did a big interview with GamingOnLinux, be sure to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/06/interviewed-veloren-an-upcoming-foss-multiplayer-voxel-rpg">check it
out</a>! Veloren's lead artist also started a weekly blog
about his work on Veloren, which you can see <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/weekly-blog-no-1-37819335">here</a>. Veloren recently
reached the <a href="https://gitlab.com/explore/projects/starred">first page</a> of most starred projects on Gitlab! The
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmRjlnKnSRRihWPPNasl_Qw">Veloren Youtube channel</a> also reached 1000
subscribers.</p>
<p>A lot has been done over the last month towards 0.7, which is slated to release
at the beginning of August. Lots of work has been done improving UI and
animations. These will help towards the goal of 0.7 being the "progression"
update. Many improvements have been made to the continuous integration system to
make it more reliable and faster. Mac support was added to Airshipper, the
Veloren launcher. Significant work was done on the world simulation front. This
includes economic simulations that will represent trade and resource pricing in
settlements and cities. Castle generation is also now in the works.</p>
<p><img src="https://rust-gamedev.github.io/posts/newsletter-011/veloren2.jpeg" alt="Work on castle generation"></p>
<p>Test coverage and documentation has started to improve, and a workflow around it
is being developed. The project is now hosting a <a href="https://docs.veloren.net/veloren_voxygen/index.html">proper documentation
site</a> that is updated with each merge. A #ux working group was
created to facilitate discussions on improvements to player interactions in
Veloren. Lots of translations were merged, including Swedish, Polish, and
Brazilian Portugese. The skill system is moving on to implementation, being a
coordinated effort between the game design, art, and combat working groups.</p>

is a Rust implementation of a popular Chinese game.</p>
<p>To win the game, one player must successfully move any animal into
the Den(兽穴) of the opponent or eat all animals of the opponent.
The basic move is just one space either forward, backward, left, or right.
The pieces never move diagonally.
Each player has eight pieces,
<a href="http://ancientchess.com/graphics-rules/dou_shou_qi_jungle_game-pieces-values.jpg">different animals with different degrees of power</a>,
a larger power piece can eat a little power piece, but rat can eat elephant.

and relative powers indicated by a number.

<p>Last Wednesday - Canada Day - I was out for a walk with my wife and daughter at Point Pleasant Park in Halifax; It was a beautiful summer day, sunny and just under 27C - warm without being uncomfortable, the type of day that we crave here in Halifax. We sat down to enjoy coffee when my phone went off. I knew it was just a message, but I instinctively reached into my pocket to check who it was from (my wife rolled her eyes). I stopped to think - why? The only two people who mattered in the moment were sitting right next to me. Why did I need to check my phone?</p>

<p>I've come to the realization that I struggle to be present. Even as I try to write this post, my mind rushes to thoughts about my client deliverables, on what I plan on making for dinner, and the last conversation with a close friend. I know that I'm not alone in this - most of us are not present. We live in a state of constant distraction. You're probably reading this post on your mobile device, and the action is taking away precious time and energy from an activity that is more meaningful.</p>

<p>I've worked with someone who is the epitome of present. Working with that person was like watching Jordan glide effortlessly across the basketball court, always on - always focused. Few problems fazed that individual, and regardless of how hard the problem was, they had the concentration to persist through the problem. Being present meant that the individual was able to brainstorm creative solutions far more effectively than others. The productivity of this individual was easily 3x or 4x that of peers, and it left time in the day for this person to pursue learning or other objectives. </p>

<p>There are many ways to attain focus and mindfulness - meditation, prayer, and even exercise are common methods vouched for by experts. I realized that my phone was my main source of distraction. It is no secret that these devices, and the software that runs on them - are being engineered to get us to crave that next notification, like or scroll. I believe that these powerful <strong>weapons of mass distraction</strong> are impacting our ability to work, be productive, and make the best use of our time. I've made a few changes to my phone habits that are starting to help reduce sources of distraction: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Two months ago - a week into starting my company, I decided to experiment by deleting Slack (a popular messaging app for teams) from my phone. For the first two days, I was constantly worried about missed client and team messages, but then I realized that there was no message that couldn't wait a few hours for a response. My post on LinkedIn about deleting Slack also generated positive feedback from peers in the tech industry. </p></li>
<li><p>After that first success, I turned all notifications off from all messaging apps (WhatsApp, Signal, iMessage).  </p></li>
<li><p>I performed a Marie Kondo style cleanup on the apps on my phone: I removed any app that didn't bring me joy (like the Apple News App), or that I hadn't used in the past 30 days (like the Air Canada app). </p></li>
<li><p>I leave my phone outside of my home office when I'm working - oddly enough, just having my phone on my desk was enough of a distraction, and I found myself reaching for the phone even when a notification hadn't gone off</p></li>
<li><p>Going even further the Marie Kondo path, I decluttered the home screen, and reduced it to four icons in the bottom drawer. My new home screen looks like this:</p></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/7e2b210638385e31783303739490b9efa6ec48e0/images/c99d8388-a3d9-4e9f-b80d-8f9160e00034.jpg"></p>

<p>This is just the start. These minor fixes are already having a positive effect on my mental health, and ability to focus more actively, and be more present for the people in my life.</p>

<p>I'm hoping to continue to report on my progress. </p>

start, or maybe you’ve tried a few times but struggle to make it into a habit.</p>
<p>Journaling is highly personal and everyone does it a little differently.
Eventually, you will develop your own unique way to do it, but until then, we
can help you get started.</p>
<h4>For our intro to journaling and tips on how to begin, continue reading, but if you are looking for a specific topic, here are a few quick links:</h4>

</ul>
<p>Before we get into practical tips on how to start, it is important to clarify
some concepts about journaling itself.</p>
<h2>What is journaling</h2>
<p>Put simply, journaling is the habit of writing about yourself.</p>
<p>Of course, writing about yourself can be very broad! Your journal might be a
simple record of what you do each day, or it might include your mood and
feelings, the weather, introspection, your thoughts about others, or what's
happening in the world.</p>
<p>Just talk to yourself while nobody is watching. Most often, you are talking to
your future self. On occasion, you may opt to share your thoughts with people
you trust. Later in this guide, we’ll discuss what to share and with whom, but
for now, treat your journal as a conversation with yourself.</p>
<h2>Why start journaling</h2>
<p>If you are reading a guide to start journaling, you probably already have an
idea of why you want to do it. Any reason is valid if it works for you, but
knowing why other people do it might strengthen your habit.</p>
<p>You might journal to deepen your understanding of yourself or your emotions, to
heal past hurts, or to cope with current challenges. It can help to organize
your ideas, make sense of what's happening in your life, and build a foundation
to make decisions. You can use it to track activities, develop healthy habits or
eliminate unhealthy ones, and understand how what you do relates to how you
feel. Or you might simply record life events and create memories that you can
revisit in a distant future. You could use your journal to exercise your
creativity, experiment with new ways of self-expression, ramble, or vent. Or, if
none of those reasons strike your fancy, you might choose to start a journal for
a brand new reason altogether.</p>
<h2>How to start journaling</h2>
<p>Developing a new habit is never easy. On one hand, you just have to start. The
problem is, some people are so good at starting, that they just keep starting
and starting and starting...</p>
<p>We hope that with our tips, you will start journaling definitively and not have
to start again!</p>
<h3>Give some thought to the reason you are journaling</h3>
<p>It can be anything, but you have to have a reason. If you can't explain to
yourself why you’re starting this, you probably won't be able to convince
yourself to keep doing it. Once you develop the habit you might discover new
reasons to maintain it, but you must already know at least one good reason to
start.</p>
<h3>The second day you write matters more than the first</h3>
<p>When you start journaling, you might put a lot of thought and time into that
first entry, but one entry doesn’t constitute journaling. Remember, journaling
is a habit, which means it continues for more than just a day. That first
journal entry is just a pre-requisite to what will eventually become a habit if
you do it again and again and again.</p>
<p>You should care a little bit less about what you write on the first day, but do
consider what you are going to write tomorrow. If you start thinking about what
you want to write tomorrow, you’re more likely to actually do it.</p>
<h3>Timebox the first days of writing</h3>
<p>Timeboxing is the technique of allocating a fixed amount of time to an activity.
In the first days of writing your journal entries, timebox your writing so you
don’t get overwhelmed—and keep it short, like 15 minutes.</p>
<p>You might feel inspired and be tempted to pour your heart out for hours to make
up for all the days that you haven’t written anything. Resist that temptation!
No marathon ever started with a sprint. You won't be capable of creating a daily
habit of something if it takes hours out of your day. If you set such a high bar
for yourself, you’ll feel pressure keep writing long and inspired entries, and
the pressure will make you quit.</p>
<p>While you are still forming the habit, don't abuse it. Long entries will
sometimes occur, but let it happen naturally once you have already formed the
habit.</p>
<h3>Set an alarm</h3>
<p>When you are starting a new habit it is not, by definition, part of your
routine. You won't naturally remember to do it, and the day will get away from
you. So set an alarm. Try to predict the time of day when you’re most likely to
do it—it usually fits best as one of the last parts of the day — and set a daily
reminder on your phone. Don't trust your memory tomorrow, take advantage of your
resolve today.</p>
<h3>Tell someone you started journaling</h3>
<p>A public announcement becomes a public commitment. Even if it is just one
person, it is one more person who can hold you accountable for your resolution.
If you can find someone who already has a journaling habit, even better.</p>
<h3>Don't worry if you miss a day, but never miss two in a row</h3>
<p>It is not a big deal to miss a day during that first week, or even two, as long
as they are not consecutive. Be diligent to never miss two days in a row. Having
a flawless streak of daily entries is motivating — so imagine how demotivating a
negative streak can be.</p>
<h3>After a few days, read your early entries</h3>
<p>When you read your first entries after a few days you will feel how rewarding is
to have a personal journal. You will understand much better the value of the
habit of journaling and you will imagine how you would feel reading the same
thing a year from now, then five years from now, or ten, or twenty. It’s
powerful!</p>

<h2><em>It’s Time to Watch the Watchmen – The Diversity Report of TechCrunch, Recode, The Information, Business Insider and Protocol.</em></h2>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/QTSx6MgSrYd5pwZwobk89Xec66X0GkNbYOHlVXsLtIl7k72caVj3WcuYrYU5eWrBc_LqSI2hj7n9-Z-5crONenrK8bPF6nQjAbPYgsXtnAppymJwHTVpYzXR0OR6M7FcKGRnjhwV" alt="" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption><strong>The Big Dogs of Big Tech Media.</strong> <br>Clockwise from top left: Lessin of The Information, Swisher of Recode (Vox), Panzarino of TechCrunch, Shontell of Business Insider and Pierce of Protocol are Editors-in-Chief of the most influential tech publications in the world.</figcaption></figure></div>



<h2>Prelude</h2>



<p><em>I have been writing about </em><a href="https://oonwoye.com/2010/04/05/black-founders/"><em>Diversity in Tech for over a decade now</em></a><em> – a long time. However, my self-published posts have never really got the audience it was targeted at, which is, the Silicon Valley Main Street. This time around, I wanted to do something different with regard to distribution.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>Since I completed this post over two weeks ago, I’ve hawked it as an Op-Ed to </em><strong><em>ALL</em></strong><em> main street US (Tech) media – 22 of them. Sadly, but unsurprisingly and understandably, I’ve had no takers. It is a big request to ask anyone, including journalists, to give a dissenting voice an audience, so I have decided to self-publish again, but this time around, I hope the primary intended audience gets to see it and the conversation happens. <strong>Abeg (please), share it</strong> as you wish me luck holding these very powerful people to account.</em></p>



<h2>Introduction</h2>



<p>No thanks to the brutal execution of George Floyd and more importantly, thanks to the persistence of protesters, the conversation about institutional racism in various parts of American life is back to the fore and has been sustained. The tech industry has not been exempted.</p>



<p>As with previous cycles, it has cast blame towards the typical suspects: Big Tech and Venture Capital. And as with previous conversation cycles, one key player in the diversity deficient tech world is wriggling away unscathed, yet again. Silicon Valley Big Tech Media.</p>



<h2>Pattern Matching in Tech</h2>



<p><em>Pattern matching</em> is a colloquial terminology in the tech industry that refers to the propensity for established players in tech e.g. Venture Capitalists, taking superficial patterns of successful founders (young white boys who have dropped out of Stanford or Harvard) and using them to determine future investment decisions.</p>



<blockquote><p>“I can be tricked by anyone who looks like Mark Zuckerberg”</p><cite><em>Paul Graham (According to The New York Times)</em></cite></blockquote>



<p>Though <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/tricked.html">eventually clarified by Paul Graham</a>, that attributed quote articulately captures the spirit of Pattern Matching. Since how one “looks” is one of the obvious patterns one can observe in a human, it is believed that pattern matching disproportionally affects “people of colour” (why do we use this term?).</p>



<p>I have no problem with pattern matching. In psychology it is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_(psychology)">pattern recognition</a>, which is natural and critical for survival. It is how human beings recognise things and make vital decisions quickly, with little data.</p>



<p>My first memory of Pattern Matching was while playing football (the real one) as a kid. The guys with the bow-legged swagger, wearing boots and a shin guard were always picked first. It was almost automatic because they looked like talented footballers. And that’s how I learned to pick my teams. After missing out on some straight legged barefoot talents and picking several kitted-out clowns, I adjusted and used more sensible parameters.</p>



<p>I learned something from that though: Pattern matching is all well and good until it receives contradicting data. It’s all about the data.</p>



<h2>The Role of Big Tech Media in Pattern Matching</h2>



<p>In the past decade, Big Tech Media has rightfully shone the light on racial inequality in the ranks of Big Corporations and Venture Capital in the tech industry. The Diversity Reports — as they are known, of Big Tech and VC have been published routinely.</p>



<p>The media are very powerful. It is through them we learn and understand the world beyond ourselves. Their importance and power in shaping opinions cannot be overstated as they are very key in providing the data which influences patterns that lead to decisions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Tech, when it comes to personnel, a lot of that data comes in the form of presence. The Big Tech Media controls it all via narrative and coverage in their publications and mega conferences. It is through the media that every player – VCs, Tech Executives, Founders etc learn about the tech world that exists outside of their immediate spheres.</p>



<p>However, when it comes to the diversity in tech debate, I wonder: how have Big Tech Media, the primary opinion shapers of the tech industry, escaped any scrutiny? Then it hit me: when you are busy pointing your torch at others, you forget to point it at yourself.</p>



<p>Since Big Tech Media remains a critical piece if we are to rejig the data to alter diversity-deficient patterns in tech, it’s high-time we shone the light on Big Tech Media.</p>



<p><em>[RANDOM: Watching the film </em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4846340/"><em>Hidden Figures</em></a><em> made me almost cry. I had </em><strong><em>absolutely no idea</em></strong><em> that in the 60s, there were Black women mathematicians and programmers who were good enough to work for the NASA Space Program. Imagine if this was always common knowledge. I can only imagine how many more black folks it would have influenced to take up a career in Computer Science and Technology].</em></p>



<h2>Diversity Report of (Silicon Valley) Big Tech Media</h2>



<p>In 2015, I looked at <a href="https://oonwoye.com/2015/10/15/where-are-the-black-tech-foundersexecutive-speakers-at-major-tech-conferences/">the racial makeup of the largest tech conferences in the world</a>. The results were damning. I wondered how these organisers could be so oblivious. It then occurred to me to check out the people making these decisions, and it was clear why they were colour blind; they didn’t have the right ‘lenses’ i.e., makeup of the editorial/media team, to notice the absence of certain colours.</p>



<p>In this report card, I will look at the racial diversity makeup of both speaker line-ups and the editorial teams of Big Tech Media – who are mostly in Silicon Valley, and contrast their 2015 with today.</p>



<h2>The Candidates</h2>



<h3><strong>TechCrunch</strong></h3>



<p>TechCrunch, owned by AOL/Verizon has been the Big Dog of tech startup chronicling and commentary since 2005. More so, they host arguably the largest and most influential startup conference called Disrupt. I have followed TechCrunch since 2007 and experienced the startup evolution through them.</p>



<h3><strong>Recode</strong></h3>



<p>In the past decade, Recode has evolved from being All Things Digital at WSJ to being Independent to now being a unit at Vox Media. One constant throughout its evolution has been the very formidable Kara Swisher, who is arguably the single most influential person in Big Tech Media.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>The Information</strong></h3>



<p>This subscription-based tech publication is high up the list in shaping opinion among Venture Capitalists in Silicon Valley. It was started by Jessica Lessin who is a formidable reporter and an Alumnus of WSJ. They have a <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/vc-diversity-index">VC Diversity Index</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Business Insider</strong></h3>



<p>Based in New York and founded by the great Henry Blodget, Business Insider is a top 3 tech voice in the tech industry.</p>



<h3><strong>Protocol</strong></h3>



<p>Backed by a bunch of heavyweights, this publication launched this year with a lot of panache.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How well have they done?</p>



<h2>Racial Diversity Report Card of Major US/Silicon Valley Tech Media</h2>

<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1l6Bmj3M1sgqCR3PijCsyoYF5OrovGUDFEEujYSItZb0/edit?usp=sharing">Here is the data for this table</a> in spreadsheet format and links to sources.</p>







<p>It is good to highlight problems but better to proffer solutions. But first, do these people recognise that there is a problem? Do they want to solve it?&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2015 when I wrote my previous post, I had the impression some did. In my <a href="https://twitter.com/OoTheNigerian/status/738076047539896321">Twitter engagement with Kara Swisher</a> after my first post, Aunty Kara gave the patronising response by referencing “the adept use of social media” as a representation of Black in Tech, I offered to engage privately (I threw in my<a href="https://twitter.com/OoTheNigerian/status/802151006754795520"> beer diplomacy</a> for good measure). It came to nought.</p>



<p><em>[Shalaye (Explanation): Aunty Kara took me up on the offer. As agreed, I reached out on 3 subsequent trips to the US and Silicon Valley. After sending about half a dozen emails, initially replied with excuses, Kara went cold and stopped responding. She is not the first Silicon Valley person whose Twitter (public) position contrasts with their private ones, so I haven’t taken it personally. I’d be more than happy to grab that beer if she’s open to it]</em></p>



<p>If Big Tech companies especially the media wish to change things, they have to first stop being colour-blind and get competent people who have eyes for the blind spots. A deliberate, sincere effort will yield good fruit.</p>



<p><strong>If you are a privileged person in the tech industry who wants to be a true “ally” and see things improve, here are some actionable things to do:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<ol><li>If you are on yet another panel and you notice the absence of accomplished Black tech players, speak up. Make recommendations. I am happy for you to ask me if your black network isn’t that vast. See Appendix (<strong>Note:</strong> Black folks have great competence about things outside the diversity topic).</li><li>If you are a VC and you are in on a good deal, try to work with the founder and carve out an allocation for those good black investors that aren’t as opportune to have your network. We all know the deal flow is the <em>koko (main thing).</em> If you want to help, share the deal.</li><li>If you are recruiting for a senior role in your executive team or board, you can take a book from the NFL beyond Colin Kaepernick’s brave kneeling protest; the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rooney_Rule">Rooney Rule</a>. Just make sure you have a qualified black person in your interview shortlist. That’s not too much of an ask.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p>I wrote in an email to my white founder friend recently: <em>I see many organisations “fighting” systemic racism by opening their cheque books. A donation here, a freebie there. It makes them feel good, perhaps. It’s like a retweet but with money.</em></p>



<p>So, decide if you want to show concern or effect change. I prefer both.</p>







<ol><li>Every company (including Big Tech Media) has the prerogative to invite or cover anyone they like. However, the proprietors of Tech Media cannot play watchmen and feign concern about the diversity in tech debate while their actions are in direct contrast.</li><li>In this post, I focused on these …</li></ol></div></div>

<p>Around 1.5 years ago, I did an <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/ammar111/youtube-trending-videos-analysis">analysis of YouTube trending videos</a> in US. That analysis was performed on trending videos of some months in 2017 and 2018. The analysis received a lot of interest on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/ammar111/youtube-trending-videos-analysis">Kaggle</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/9kpmcn/i_analyzed_more_than_40000_youtube_trending/">Reddit</a>; I also received some emails praising the work done. That was 1.5 years ago.</p>

<p><strong>Today</strong>, I present an improved and expanded version of that analysis. This analysis is more advanced and contains new interesting elements. In this analysis, <strong>All trending videos for the whole year of 2019</strong> were analyzed (More than <strong>70,000</strong> videos).</p>

<p>Titles, descriptions, thumbnails, tags, views, likes/dislikes, and comments were all analyzed to produce the results shown in this post. Continue reading to know more about the analysis and the data or you can <a href="#analysis-res">jump directly to the results section</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-youtube-trending-videos">What are YouTube Trending Videos?</h2>

<p>YouTube, as you know, is the most popular and most used video platform in the world today. YouTube has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/feed/trending">a list of <strong>trending videos</strong></a>. I’ll quote the description of trending videos from <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7239739?hl=en">YouTube itself</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Trending helps viewers see what’s happening on YouTube and in the world. Trending aims to surface videos that a wide range of viewers would find interesting. Some trends are predictable, like a new song from a popular artist or a new movie trailer. Others are surprising, like a viral video. Trending isn’t personalized and displays the same list of trending videos in each country to all users.</p>

  <p>The list of trending videos is updated roughly every 15 minutes. With each update, videos may move up, down, or stay in the same position in the list.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="summary-of-some-key-results-of-the-analysis">Summary of Some Key Results of the Analysis</h2>

<p>The main goal of the analysis is to find interesting facts and patterns by exploring the data and by using effective visualizations.</p>

<p><strong>If you don’t have time</strong> to read the full analysis, here are some of the insights that were extracted from the data along with links to their sections in the analysis:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Linus Tech Tips (a technology channel) was the channel that <a href="#trending-channels">produced most trending videos in 2019</a>. It is a technology (not entertainment nor music) and personal (not corporate) channel. More than that, the 2nd and 3rd channels after Linus Tech Tips were cooking channels.</li>
  <li>While a video might stay on the trending list for one day or less, there are 6 videos that appeared on the list <a href="#trending-for-30-days">for 30 days</a>.</li>
  <li>BTS’ song “Boy With Luv” was the most <a href="#trending-videos-and-views">viewed</a>, <a href="#trending-videos-and-likes-and-dislikes">liked</a>, and <a href="#trending-videos-and-comments">commented</a> video. However, it was also the 5th most <a href="#trending-videos-and-likes-and-dislikes">disliked</a> video.</li>
  <li>Some videos appeared on the trending list <a href="#how-many-views-videos-had-when-they-first-became-trending">when they had only around 50,000 views</a>.</li>
  <li>Words like “official”, “video”, “2019”, “vs”, “trailer”, “music”, “game”, “new”, “highlights”, “first”, and “challenge” were among the <a href="#what-are-the-most-common-words-in-video-titles">most common in trending video titles</a>. So if you include the current year in your title, does that increase trending chances?</li>
  <li>🔥 was the <a href="#what-are-the-most-common-words-in-video-titles">most common emoji</a> in trending video titles.</li>
  <li>While the minimum was 3 and the maximum was 100, most trending videos <a href="#titles-lengths">have titles lengths between 36 and 64 characters</a>.</li>
  <li>There was a video that became trending when it had <a href="#how-many-comments-videos-had-when-they-first-became-trending">only 7 comments</a>.</li>
  <li>YouTube Rewind videos of 2018 and 2019 were the 1st and 2nd <a href="#trending-videos-and-likes-and-dislikes">most disliked videos</a>.</li>
  <li>On average, <a href="#how-long-does-it-take-a-video-to-become-trending">videos take 1.5 days</a> to appear on the trending list for the first time.</li>
  <li>While the allowed maximum is 5,000 character, most trending videos have their <a href="#how-long-is-the-description">descriptions length between 500 and 1500 characters</a>.</li>
  <li>A lot of trending videos put <a href="#most-common-words-in-trending-videos-descriptions">social media links</a> in their descriptions.</li>
  <li>Almost all trending videos <a href="#trending-videos-tags">use tags</a>. On average, 21 tags.</li>
  <li>By running an object-detection algorithm on the thumbnails of trending videos, <a href="#whats-inside-trending-videos-thumbnails">it turned out that a person is the most common object</a> in the thumbnails. So you might consider adding a person photo in your next video.</li>
  <li>Do you want to see the <a href="#what-are-the-most-used-colors-in-trending-videos-thumbnails">most common colors</a> in video thumbnails that were extracted after a lot of processing?</li>
</ul>

<p>The analysis covers <strong>much more</strong> as you will see soon…</p>



<p>This analysis was performed using Python and a powerful group of Python libraries including Pandas, Matplotlib, NLTK, ImageAI, WordCloud, and more.</p>

<p>The analysis were performed in a Jupyter Notebook.</p>

<h3 id="code-used">Code Used</h3>

<p>You can find all the code used for this analysis in a Jupyter notebook <a href="https://github.com/ammar1y/YouTube-Trending-Videos-Analysis-2019">on this link</a>. Feel free to read the code and re-use it however you want. Also note that the notebook contains more analyses than the ones shown here in this post, so if you want to see everything, refer to the notebook after you finish reading this post.</p>

<h2 id="data-source">Data Source</h2>

<p>The data used in this analysis was retrieved using YouTube API. A script was scheduled to run <strong>each day throughout 2019 and fetch data from YouTube API about the trending videos of that day</strong>. The script would then process the data received from YouTube and store them in text files.</p>

<p>The scraping script is not my work. It can be found on Github: <a href="https://github.com/mitchelljy/Trending-YouTube-Scraper"> Trending-YouTube-Scraper</a>. I put the script on a AWS EC2 instance and scheduled it—using Crontab—to run every day at a specific time.</p>

<p>After 2019 ended, I connected to the AWS instance using FileZilla application and downloaded all the data produced by the script. There was a file for each day of 2019. To perform the analysis, I needed to process the data in order to merge the files into a single CSV file.</p>

<p>If you want to <strong>download the data used in this analysis</strong> which describes 2019's trending videos in the United States, you can buy it securely on Gumroad <u><strong><a href="https://gum.co/qEzKK" target="_blank">on this link</a></strong></u> or by using the button below. Along with United States, you'll also get trending-videos data for United Kingdom, Canada, Denmark, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, and other countries as well.</p>

<h2 id="data-size-and-description">Data Size and Description</h2>

<p><strong>In this post, United-States trending videos will be analyzed</strong>, which constitute a total of <strong>72,994</strong> videos. YouTube usually place 200 videos in the trending list each day which would mean that we should have 73,000 (365 x 200) videos. We have 72,994. This is probably because on a few days, the number of Trending videos was slightly less than 200.</p>

<p>So we have data on 72,994 trending videos to analyze. On YouTube, <strong>the same video might appear on the trending list for many days. This means that the 72,994 videos are not unique videos</strong>. In fact, among the 72,994 videos, <strong>we have 11,177 unique videos</strong>.</p>

<p>In other words, 11,177 videos showed on the trending list throughout 2019. Some of them might have stayed on the list for 10 days, some for 20 days, etc. We will see later in the analysis more info about this.</p>

<p>The following table shows an example of <strong>the data that we have for each video</strong>:</p>



<p><img src="https://ammar-alyousfi.com/assets/images/2020/yta2-data.png" alt=""></p>

<p><br>
As we can see, we have the ID of the video which is a unique value for the video across YouTube (No two videos have the same ID). We also have the title of the video, its publishing date and time, the channel that published it, its category, and its description and tags. We also have the number of the views, likes, dislikes, and comments of the video. There are also a few more data shown in the table.</p>

<p>We can see that there is a field named “trending_date”. This field specifies the date on which this video was trending. As we said earlier, the same video might appear on the trending-videos list for more than one day. This means that we might find another record in the data for the same video ID but with different “trending_date” and maybe different number of views, comments, likes, etc. (because those numbers are likely to increase from one day to another).</p>



<h2 id="analysis-results">Analysis Results</h2>

<p>Now let’s start the best part of this post, let’s see the analysis results.</p>

<p><span id="note-uniq"></span><strong>Please note</strong> that for the following analyses, <strong>unless otherwise stated</strong>, we applied the analysis on all of the <strong>72,994</strong> trending videos, <strong>not</strong> on the unique trending videos only. The reasoning behind this is that we are interested in videos considered trending by YouTube. So if a video is considered trending for 3 days, then we believe that it has more trending power and more trending characteristics than a video that was trending for 1 day only; thus, it should have more weight. So <strong>we include the 3 occurrences of that video in the analysis</strong>.</p>

<p>For some analyses, considering only unique videos is more appropriate. When that is the case, you will see a note telling you about that.</p>

<h3 id="trending-videos-and-views">Trending Videos and Views</h3>

<p><strong>The Trending Video with the Highest Number of Views</strong> is a song by BTS band named “Boy With Luv”. The video was published on 12/April/2019 and on 23/04/2019, it appeared on the trending list with 195,376,667 views which is the highest number of views a trending video had in 2019.</p>

<p>In the table below, you can see <strong>the top 3 trending videos based on the number of views</strong>. These trending videos had views when they appeared on the trending list more than any other trending video. This table was produced by considering unique trending videos only (<a href="#note-uniq">For more</a>).</p>



<p><img src="https://ammar-alyousfi.com/assets/images/2020/yta2-top-views.png" alt=""></p>



<p>And now we will look at the distribution of views for trending videos. The histogram below shows this distribution:</p>



<p><img src="https://ammar-alyousfi.com/assets/images/2020/yta2-view-dist.png" alt=""></p>



<p><em>Notice that the y-axis is <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/definitions/logarithmic-scale.html">log scaled</a>. It is 10, 100, 1000… not 10, 20, 30…</em></p></div></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I am going to see some friends in a few days that I have not seen since March due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>I have worn a mask in public and sanitized my hands as often as possible whenever I leave my home. Despite these efforts, I felt some minor flu-like symptoms. I called the COVID-19 hotline (811) and they told me where the nearest drive through testing location was.</p>
<p>I spent about 20 minutes in-line. A nurse took my personal health card number, and ushered me through. A second nurse, also very nice, asked me a few questions about my symptoms, and then administered the test.</p>
<p>It feels like a q-tip being pushed way too far into your nose. The nurse also swirled around this q-tip thingy for 15 seconds. Not comfortable, but not horrible.</p>
<p>After that I was free to go. Very easy.</p>
<p>Exactly 24 hours later, my test results were available online.</p>
<p>Fortunately, they came back negative. I think I just have allergies or some other minor illness (I already feel much better only one day later).</p>
<p>Overall this experience was quick, efficient, and made me feel very secure about British Columbia's response to testing for COVID-19.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>If you’re looking for a hack that will put you on the fast track to success at work, I have something for you.</p>



<p>You might not like it.</p>



<p>You might hate it.</p>



<p>You might even despise it so much that you do the opposite.</p>



<p>But sometimes we all must take our medicine and do what it takes to move onward and upward.</p>



<h3><strong>Going Against the Grain of Going Against the Grain</strong></h3>



<p>I know, I know. Since I started this blog, I’ve been doing a lot of railing against the idea of working for someone else. While I do not back down from my stance one bit, I do realize that not everyone <em>wants</em> to work for themselves. I’ve been doing a lot of thinking and a lot of studying on the topic of work, and I feel confident enough to divide the workforce into three camps:</p>



<p><strong>Group A: The small percentage of people who love their jobs</strong>. People in this camp find meaning and enjoyment in the work they do, and their salary is comfortable enough to support their preferred lifestyle. Kudos to these people! They have found the nexus between their version of meaningful work and financial freedom. To achieve this outcome is the ultimate purpose of why I write about <em>work</em>.</p>



<p><strong>Group B: People who hate their jobs and are looking for an alternate path</strong> to meaningful work and financial freedom. Finding suitable answers for these folks is my primary objective, and I find myself in the unique position of creating my own answer to this problem in the process.</p>



<p>There is a third and under-represented camp: <strong>Group C, the silent majority</strong>. These are people who don’t like one or more aspects of their job, but simply don’t feel the need or the urge to venture out on their own. If you find yourself in this camp, this article is for you.</p>







<h3><strong>The Status Quo Is Unacceptable</strong></h3>



<p>If you read <a href="https://joebalcom.blog/2020/06/05/ordinary/">How to be Extraordinarily Ordinary</a>, you’ll see my disdain for the status quo on full display. That post was a bit tongue in cheek, but I will not mince words in this post.</p>



<p>There are a million and one reasons for someone not to like their job. Ranging from pay rates to petty office politics. From specific job functions to Pam from three cubicles way receiving preferential treatment. From not enough hours to too many hours. The list never ends. But one thing is for certain: <em>very few grievances are ever made known to those with the power to change it.</em></p>



<p>The rest are suppressed, hidden from sight, slowly growing into intense misery. This intense misery subsides after a while into dull indifference and acceptance. Selfishness and the “what’s in it for me” mindset sets in, and newer employees are quickly influenced to follow the same path. This is the life cycle of status quo acceptance.</p>



<p>What I learned as an employee is that arranging a work environment conducive to happiness and success is not as hard as you would think. If you simply take the time to sit down with management to lay out your grievances, most of the time you can work something out. And in the rare instance they are not willing to work with you, then it’s a clear sign that you probably should move on.</p>



<p>What I learned from <em>leading</em> 80+ restaurant employees is that disgruntled employees are an inevitable part of managing such a complex system. There are so many moving parts in a large organization that you won’t be able to please everyone all the time. But the astonishing part is that most grievances will go undiscussed, no matter how open the door is. Employees who do not speak up will be condemned to their displeasure, and will inevitably poison the well. For those employees, this becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>



<p>In order to give success and happiness at work a fighting chance, you cannot accept a status quo that does not work for you. But <a href="https://joebalcom.blog/2020/06/08/12-lessons/">if you find that you cannot extract yourself from the situation</a>, your only choice is to lean into your work.</p>



<h3><strong>How to Get Ahead at </strong><strong>Work</strong></h3>



<p>I’ve been on both sides of the fence and have experienced both perspectives of what is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal%E2%80%93agent_problem#:~:text=The%20principal%E2%80%93agent%20problem%2C%20in,entity%3A%20the%20%22principal%22.">Principal-Agent Problem</a>. To put it simply, the principal (the owner or boss) has the incentives to do what is best for the good of the firm. The agent (the employee) often only has incentives to do what is best for themselves.</p>



<p>The norms of mediocrity have made this dichotomy an unfortunate reality. Most agents just don’t care enough about what the principal cares about. Different incentives, different goals.</p>



<p>As an agent who is committed to the firm, your best path forward is to <strong>think like the owner</strong>. It is the one thing you can do to guarantee getting ahead. When your aspirations are aligned with those of the owner, you instantly put yourself on the fast track to success.</p>



<h3><strong>Think Like an Owner and You Will Become the Owner</strong></h3>



<p>On the spectrum of happiness, those people closest to maximal happiness tend to be the ones in control of their own destiny. This simple fact is why I have repeatedly advocated for you to take an alternate path, take ownership of every aspect of your life, and leave the crowd behind.</p>



<p>If working for yourself is not an option in your mind, then your only option for true success and happiness at work is to lean into your work and <em>be excellent</em>. To be excellent in your workplace:</p>



<ul><li>Never say “that’s not my job.”</li><li>“How can I help” needs to become an instinct.</li><li>Become a leader within the organization, regardless of your title.</li><li>Don’t wait for someone to tell you to do the work that needs to be done.</li><li>Avoid petty workplace politics.</li><li>Take ownership of everything you do. No excuses.</li><li>Be consistent. The principal has to show up every day, and so should you.</li></ul>



<p>To illustrate this, I’ll tell you about an employee, who worked for me at the restaurant I managed, named Mike. Mike personified every single item on the above list. He was a college student and a busser, but he was so meticulous, so consistent, and so reliable that he earned the nickname “Cap,” as in Captain America.</p>



<p>I was so impressed by his work ethic and attitude, that I offered to promote him on more than one occasion. He turned down my offer every time because he believed what he was doing was the most effective way for him to help the restaurant.</p>



<p>The job wasn’t glamorous, but he leaned into his responsibilities in a way that earned him freedom, trust, and a sense of meaning in his work.</p>



<p>I’m confident that because he thinks like an owner, Mike will one day become an owner.</p>



<h3><strong>The Clear Path Ahead</strong></h3>



<p>There is a clear path to controlling your destiny within the confines of working for someone else. This path is not easy, you might not like it initially, but it will yield the most satisfying results over the long run.</p>



<p>By operating from a position of abundance, by going the extra mile to help others look good, by inspiring and lifting others around you, you will stand out above the rest over time.</p>



<p>I’ll finish with a quote from Naval Ravikant, who sums it up nicely: “If you think like the owner, and you act like the owner, it’s only a matter of time until you become the owner.”</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="react-as-a-framework">React as a framework<a href="#react-as-a-framework" aria-label="react as a framework permalink"></a></h2>
<p>React has been out in the world of web development for quite some time now. Its position as a tool for agile web development has steadily strengthened in recent years. Especially after the announcement and release of the <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html#hooks-and-function-components">new hook api/concept</a>, writing components has never been easier.</p>
<p>Although the team behind react and the huge community have tried to train and explain the concepts of the framework in an impressive way, I still see some pitfalls and common mistakes that were made while working with it.
I kept a list of all the mistakes I saw over the last years related to react especially with using hooks. In this article I want to show you the most common ones. I will also try to explain in detail, why I think they are mistakes and a suggestion for doing it in a cleaner way.</p>
<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
<p>Before we start with the list, I have to say that most of the following things are not fundamental mistakes or don't look wrong at first glance. Most of them are unlikely to affect the performance or apperance of the application.
Probably nobody would notice, except for the developers working on the product, that something is wrong here, but I still believe that good quality code can lead to a better developer experience and thus to a better product.</p>
<p>As with any software framework or library, there are millions of different opinions about it. Everything you see here is based on my personal opinion and should not be considered a general rule.
If you have a different opinion about her, I would love to hear it 🌟</p>
<h2 id="1-using-usestate-when-no-rerender-is-needed">1. Using useState when no rerender is needed<a href="#1-using-usestate-when-no-rerender-is-needed" aria-label="1 using usestate when no rerender is needed permalink"></a></h2>
<p>One of the core concepts of react is dealing with state. You can control your entire data flow and rendering through state. Each time the tree is rendered again, it is most likely tied to a change in state.</p>
<p>With the <code>useState</code> hook you can now also define your state in function components. Which is a really neat and easy way how to handle states in react. But it can also be misused as we see in the following example.</p>
<p>For the next example we need a bit of explanation, suppose we have two buttons, one button is a counter and the other button sends a request or triggers an action with the current count. However, the current number is never displayed within the component. It is only required for the request when you click the second button.</p>
<h3>This is dangerous ❌</h3>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>ClickButton</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>count<span>,</span> setCount<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>const</span> <span>onClickCount</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>setCount</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>c</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> c <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>;</span>

  <span>const</span> <span>onClickRequest</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>apiCall</span><span>(</span>count<span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
      </span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>button</span> <span>onClick</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>onClickCount<span>}</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>Counter</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>button</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
      </span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>button</span> <span>onClick</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>onClickRequest<span>}</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>Submit</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>button</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
    </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h3>The problem ⚡</h3>
<p>At first sight, you might ask what exactly is the problem with that? Isn't that what state was made for?
Sure you are right, this will work just fine and probably there will never be a problem with that. However in react every state change will force a rerender for that component and most likely its children. But in the above example since we never use that state in our render part, this will end up being an unnecessary render every time we set the counter, which can impact the performance or could have unexpected side effects.</p>
<h3>The solution ✅</h3>
<p>If you want to use a variable inside your component which should keep its value between rendering but also don't force a rerender, you can use the <code>useRef</code> hook. It will keep the value, but doesn't force the component to rerender.</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>ClickButton</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> count <span>=</span> <span>useRef</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>const</span> <span>onClickCount</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    count<span>.</span>current<span>++</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>;</span>

  <span>const</span> <span>onClickRequest</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>apiCall</span><span>(</span>count<span>.</span>current<span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
      </span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>button</span> <span>onClick</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>onClickCount<span>}</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>Counter</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>button</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
      </span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>button</span> <span>onClick</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>onClickRequest<span>}</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>Submit</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>button</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
    </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>

<h2 id="2-using-routerpush-instead-of-a-link">2. Using router.push instead of a link<a href="#2-using-routerpush-instead-of-a-link" aria-label="2 using routerpush instead of a link permalink"></a></h2>
<p>This might be a very easy and obvious one and not really related to react itself, but I still see it quite a lot when people writing react components.</p>
<p>Let's say you will write a button and with clicking the button the user should be redirected to another page. Since its a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application">SPA</a>, this action will be a client-side routing mechanism. So you will need some kind of library for doing that.
In react the most popular one is <a href="https://reacttraining.com/react-router/">react-router</a> and the following example will use that library.</p>
<p>So adding a click listener will redirect the user to the desired page right?</p>
<h3>This is dangerous ❌</h3>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>ClickButton</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> history <span>=</span> <span>useHistory</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>const</span> <span>onClick</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    history<span>.</span><span>push</span><span>(</span><span>'/next-page'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>button</span> <span>onClick</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>onClick<span>}</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>Go to next page</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>button</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h3>The problem ⚡</h3>
<p>Even though this would work just fine for most of the users, there is a huge problem when it comes to accessibility here. The button will not be marked as linking to another page at all, which makes it nearly impossible to be identified by screen readers.
Also could you open that in a new tab or window? Most likely not.</p>
<h3>The solution ✅</h3>
<p>Linking to other pages with any user interaction should, where possible, be handled by the <code>&lt;Link&gt;</code> component or a normal <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag.</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>ClickButton</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>Link</span></span> <span>to</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>/next-page<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
      </span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>span</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>Go to next page</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>span</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
    </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Link</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p><strong>Bonus points:</strong> it also makes the code a lot more readable and shorter!</p>
<h2 id="3-handling-actions-via-useeffect">3. Handling actions via useEffect<a href="#3-handling-actions-via-useeffect" aria-label="3 handling actions via useeffect permalink"></a></h2>
<p>One of the best and most thoughtful hooks introduced by React is the "useEffect" hook. It enables the processing of actions related to <code>prop</code> or <code>state</code> changes.
Despite its helpful functionality, it is also often used in places where it may not be needed.</p>
<p>Imagine a component that fetches a list of items and render them to the dom. In addition, if the request is successful, we would like to call the "onSuccess" function, which is passed on to the component as a prop.</p>
<h3>This is dangerous ❌</h3>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>DataList</span><span>(</span><span><span>{</span> onSuccess <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span>loading<span>,</span> error<span>,</span> data<span>,</span> onSuccess<span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>Data: </span><span>{</span>data<span>}</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h3>The problem ⚡</h3>
<p>There are two <code>useEffect</code> hooks, the first one is handling the api call on the initial render and the second one will call the <code>onSuccess</code> function, by assuming when there is no loading, no error, but data in the state, it must have been a successful call. Makes sense right?</p>
<p>Sure for the first call this is true and probably will never fail. But you also loose the direct connection between the action and the function that needs to be called. There is no guarantee that this case will only happen if the fetch action has succeeded and this is something we as developers really don't like.</p>
<h3>The solution ✅</h3>
<p>A straight forward solution would be to set the "onSuccess" function to the actual place where the call was successful:</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>DataList</span><span>(</span><span><span>{</span> onSuccess <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>loading<span>,</span> setLoading<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>false</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>error<span>,</span> setError<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>null</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>data<span>,</span> setData<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>null</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>const</span> <span>fetchData</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>setLoading</span><span>(</span><span>true</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>callApi</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
      <span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>fetchedData</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>setData</span><span>(</span>fetchedData<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>        <span>onSuccess</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span>      <span>}</span><span>)</span>
      <span>.</span><span>catch</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>err</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>setError</span><span>(</span>err<span>)</span><span>)</span>
      <span>.</span><span>finally</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>setLoading</span><span>(</span><span>false</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>;</span>

  <span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fetchData</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>{</span>data<span>}</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now it is quite clear at first sight when the onSuccess is called, exactly in the success case of the api call.</p>
<h2 id="4-single-responsibility-components">4. Single responsibility components<a href="#4-single-responsibility-components" aria-label="4 single responsibility components permalink"></a></h2>
<p>Composing components can be hard.
When is it time to split a component into several smaller components?
How do you structure the component tree?
All of these questions arise every day when working with a component-based framework.
However, a common mistake in designing your components is to combine two use cases into a single component.
Let's take an example of a header that shows either a burger button on mobile devices or tabs on desktop screens. (The condition will be handled the the magical <code>isMobile</code> function, which is not part of this example 🧙‍)</p>
<h3>This is dangerous ❌</h3>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>Header</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>header</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
      </span><span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>HeaderInner</span></span> <span>menuItems</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>menuItems<span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span><span>
    </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>header</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>function</span> <span>HeaderInner</span><span>(</span><span><span>{</span> menuItems <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>isMobile</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>?</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>BurgerButton</span></span> <span>menuItems</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>menuItems<span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span> <span>:</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>Tabs</span></span> <span>tabData</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>menuItems<span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h3>The problem ⚡</h3>
<p>With this approach the component HeaderInner is trying to be two different things at once and we all learned from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_Case_of_Dr_Jekyll_and_Mr_Hyde">Mr. Jekyll</a>, being more than one thing at a time isn't really ideal.
Also it makes it even harder to test or to reuse the component in other places.</p>
<h3>The solution ✅</h3>
<p>Bringing the condition one level up, makes it easier to see what the components are made for and that they only have one responsibility, being a <code>Header</code>, <code>Tabs</code> or a <code>BurgerButton</code> and not trying to be two things at once.</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>Header</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>header</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>{</span><span>isMobile</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>?</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>BurgerButton</span></span> <span>menuItems</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>menuItems<span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span> <span>:</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>Tabs</span></span> <span>tabData</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>menuItems<span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span><span>}</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>header</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="5-single-responsibility-useeffects">5. Single responsibility useEffects<a href="#5-single-responsibility-useeffects" aria-label="5 single responsibility useeffects permalink"></a></h2>
<p>Remember the times when we only had the <code>componentWillReceiveProps</code> or <code>componentDidUpdate</code> methods to hook into the rendering process of a react component? It is bringing back dark memories and also realizing the beauty of using the <code>useEffect</code> hook and especially that you can have as much as you want of them.</p>
<p>But sometimes forgetting and using a "useEffect" for several things brings back those dark memories. For example, imagine you have a component that fetches some data from the backend in some way, and also displays breadcrumbs depending on the current location. (Using again <a href="https://reacttraining.com/react-router/">react-router</a> for getting the current location.)</p>
<h3>This is dangerous ❌</h3>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>Example</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> location <span>=</span> <span>useLocation</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

<!-- END OF HEADER FILE -->


<p>A few days ago I posted about <a href="https://www.paritybit.ca/blog/adding-search-to-my-blog">the really simple solution I came up with for searching on my blog</a>. Since then, I’ve had <a href="https://social.paritybit.ca/web/statuses/104451892409302622">a few good replies</a> about ways I could make it better. One suggestion in particular fit with the themes and goals of this website so I went ahead and implemented it to improve the search experience on my site.</p>
<h3 id="evaluating-other-suggestions">Evaluating Other Suggestions</h3>
<p>First, let’s talk about some of the other suggestions made. There was the suggestion from Amolith of <a href="https://secluded.site/">secluded.site</a> that I use a tiny, JavaScript-less, static search engine called <a href="https://endler.dev/2019/tinysearch/">Tiny Search</a> and the suggestion from Kev Quirk of <a href="https://kevq.uk/">kevq.uk</a> who mentioned that DuckDuckGo provides <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/search_box">an embeddable search bar</a> in the form of an iframe. Both were great suggestions, but let’s look at why I think they wouldn’t work for my site.</p>
<p>Tiny Search is a really clever and interesting project, but it achieves its functionality through WebAssembly. WebAssembly is a new web technology created to allow web-native apps to run far faster and far more efficiently than if they were written in JavaScript. Unfortunately, this means that basically only the three big browser engines support it: Gecko (Firefox), Blink (Chrome and its derivatives), and WebKit (Safari and its derivatives). That means anybody browsing my site with an alternative browser such as Lynx or w3m won’t be able to make use of it. I could provide a fallback, but the other reason why I didn’t choose it is because it advertises itself as being between “50kB-100kB gzipped” which is very large when put in context with the average size of one of my pages being 10-20kB for an entire page, or ~6-7kB for just the HTML.</p>
<p>I played around with Kev’s suggestion of the DuckDuckGo iframe and it worked quite well and was very easy to generate and add to my page. However, it had the same issues as Tiny Search where it would balloon the size of the blog page by up to 3x its original size, and it would make 3 third-party requests to load in the necessary assets. Also, iframes are not supported by Lynx or w3m but it was trivial to add a fallback for those browsers. The main issues that I had with this method were the third party requests and large size of the loaded assets.</p>
<p>To summarize, I didn’t go with the above two suggestions because of the use of unsupported technology in browsers which I target and because of the size of the assets which would be required to make them functional. Both are trivial in the context of many contemporary sites, but I like to keep my site as slim as possible and I like to maintain compatibility with alternative browsers.</p>
<h3 id="the-solution-i-chose">The Solution I Chose</h3>
<p>However, <a href="https://oscarbenedito.com/">Oscar Benedito</a> suggested something which caught my eye and which I didn’t even know was possible: a form that makes a request to DuckDuckGo. This solution uses technology that has been supported in every web browser for decades and adds a mere 300 bytes to the size of the page since it’s just a plain HTML form. This is what I have which now powers my site’s search:</p>

<p>That’s it! Instead of a link to a DuckDuckGo search where users would have to type their search query in after clicking it, users can now type their query into this form and they will be sent to a DuckDuckGo page with the results. This still improves the UX while keeping the page small and using features supported in browsers like Lynx and w3m.</p>
<p><em>This is my sixty-second post for the <a href="https://social.paritybit.ca/tags/100DaysToOffload">#100DaysToOffload</a> challenge. You can learn more about this challenge over at <a href="https://100daystooffload.com/">https://100daystooffload.com</a>.</em></p>

  <stylepoint title="Note: Displaying Hidden Details in this Guide">
     <summary>
       This style guide contains many details
       that are initially hidden from view.
       They are marked by the triangle icon, which you see here on your left.
       Click it now. You should see "Hooray" appear below.
     </summary>
     
       <p>
        Hooray!  Now you know you can expand points to get more details.
        Alternatively, there's an "expand all" at the top of this document.

<category title="Background">
  <p>
    Common Lisp is a powerful multiparadigm programming language.
    With great power comes great responsibility.
  </p>
  <p>
    This guide recommends formatting and stylistic choices
    designed to make your code easier for other people to understand.
    For those internal applications and free software libraries that
    we develop at Google,
    you should keep within these guidelines when making changes.
    Note however that each project has its own rules and customs
    that complement or override these general guidelines;
    the speed-oriented QPX low fare search engine notably
    has a very different style and feel from the QRes reservation system.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you're writing Common Lisp code outside Google,
    we invite you to consider these guidelines.
    You may find some of them useful
    where they don't conflict with other priorities you have.
    We welcome remarks and constructive feedback
    on how to improve our guide, and
    on what alternate styles work for you and why.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This guide is not a Common Lisp tutorial.
    For basic information about the language, please consult
    <a href="http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/">Practical Common Lisp</a>.
    For a language reference, please consult the
    <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Front/index.htm">Common Lisp HyperSpec</a>.
    For more detailed style guidance, take (with a pinch of salt)
    a look at Peter Norvig and Kent Pitman's
    <a href="http://norvig.com/luv-slides.ps">style guide</a>.

<category title="Meta-Guide">
  <stylepoint title="Must, Should, May, or Not">
    <summary>
      Each guideline's level of importance is indicated

  <stylepoint title="Permission and Forgiveness">
    <summary>
      There are cases where transgression of some of these rules
      is useful or even necessary.
      In some cases, you must seek permission or obtain forgiveness
      from the proper people.
    </summary>
    
      <p>
        Permission comes from the owners of your project.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Forgiveness is requested in a comment
        near the point of guideline violation,
        and is granted by your code reviewer.
        The original comment should be signed by you, and
        the reviewer should add a signed approval to the comment at review time.
      </p>
      
    
  </stylepoint>
  <stylepoint title="Conventions">
    <summary>
      You MUST follow conventions. They are not optional.
    </summary>
    
      <p>
        Some of these guidelines are motivated by universal principles of good programming.
        Some guidelines are motivated by technical peculiarities of Common Lisp.
        Some guidelines were once motivated by a technical reason,
        but the guideline remained after the reason subsided.
        Some guidelines, such those about as comments and indentation,
        are based purely on convention, rather than on clear technical merit.
        Whatever the case may be, you must still follow these guidelines,
        as well as other conventional guidelines
        that have not been formalized in this document.
      </p>
      <p>
        You MUST follow conventions.
        They are important for readability.
        When conventions are followed by default,
        violations of the convention are a signal
        that something notable is happening and deserves attention.
        When conventions are systematically violated,
        violations of the convention are a distracting noise
        that needs to be ignored.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conventional guidelines <em>are</em> indoctrination.
        Their purpose is to make you follow the mores of the community,
        
        so you can more effectively cooperate with existing members.
        It is still useful to distinguish the parts that are technically motivated
        from the parts that are mere conventions,
        so you know when best to defy conventions for good effect,
        and when not to fall into the pitfalls that the conventions are there to help avoid.
      </p>
    
  </stylepoint>
  <stylepoint title="Old Code">
    <summary>
      Fix old code as you go.
    </summary>
    
      <p>
        A lot of our code was written before these guidelines existed.
        You should fix violations as you encounter them
        in the course of your normal coding.
      </p>
      <p>
        You must not fix violations en masse
        without warning other developers and coordinating with them,
        so as not to make the merging of large branches
        more difficult than it already is.
      </p>
    
  </stylepoint>
  <stylepoint title="Future Topics">
    <summary>
      There are many topics for additional standardization
      not covered by current version of this document,
      but deferred to future versions.
    </summary>

<category title="General Guidelines">
  <stylepoint title="Principles">
    <summary>
      There are some basic principles for team software development
      that every developer must keep in mind.
      Whenever the detailed guidelines are inadequate, confusing or contradictory,
      refer back to these principles for guidance:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Every developer's code must be easy for another developer
          to read, understand, and modify
          â€” even if the first developer isn't around to explain it.
          (This is the "hit by a truck" principle.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Everybody's code should look the same.
          Ideally, there should be no way to look at lines of code
          and recognize it as "Fred's code" by its style.
        </li>
        <li>
          Be precise.
        </li>
        <li>
          Be concise.
        </li>
        <li>
          KISS â€” Keep It Simple, Stupid.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use the smallest hammer for the job.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use common sense.
        </li>
        <li>
          Keep related code together.
          Minimize the amount of jumping around
          someone has to do to understand an area of code.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </summary>
    
    
  </stylepoint>
  <stylepoint title="Priorities">
    <summary>
      <p>
        When making decisions about how to write a given piece of
        code, aim for the following -ilities in this priority order:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Usability by the customer
        </li>
        <li>
          Debuggability/Testability
        </li>
        <li>
          Readability/Comprehensibility
        </li>
        <li>
          Extensibility/Modifiability
        </li>
        <li>
          Efficiency (of the Lisp code at runtime)
        </li>
      </ul>
    </summary>
    
      <p>
        Most of these are obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
        Usability by the customer means that the system has to do what the
        customer requires; it has to handle the customer's transaction
        volumes, uptime requirements; etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the Lisp efficiency point,
        given two options of equivalent complexity,
        pick the one that performs better.
        (This is often the same as the one that conses less,
        i.e. allocates less storage from the heap.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Given two options where one is more complex than the other,
        pick the simpler option and revisit the decision only if
        profiling shows it to be a performance bottleneck.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, avoid premature optimization.
        Don't add complexity to speed up something that runs rarely,
        since in the long run, it matters less whether such …</p></stylepoint></category></div></div>

You need a <a href="http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/cluster-overview.html#cluster-manager-types">cluster manager</a> (also called a <em>scheduler</em>) for that. The most commonly used one is <a href="https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/YARN.html">Apache Hadoop YARN</a>. Support for running Spark on Kubernetes was added with version 2.3, and Spark-on-k8s adoption has been accelerating ever since.</p><p>If you're curious about the core notions of Spark-on-Kubernetes, the differences with Yarn as well as the benefits and drawbacks, read our previous article: <a href="https://www.datamechanics.co/blog-post/pros-and-cons-of-running-apache-spark-on-kubernetes">The Pros And Cons of Running Spark on Kubernetes</a>. For a deeper dive, you can also watch our session at Spark Summit 2020: <a href="https://databricks.com/session_na20/running-apache-spark-on-kubernetes-best-practices-and-pitfalls">Running Apache Spark on Kubernetes: Best Practices and Pitfalls</a>.</p><p>In this article, we present benchmarks comparing the performance of deploying Spark on Kubernetes versus Yarn. <strong>Our results indicate that Kubernetes has caught up with Yarn - there are no significant performance differences between the two anymore</strong>. In particular, we will compare the performance of shuffle between YARN and Kubernetes, and give you critical tips to make shuffle performant when running Spark on Kubernetes.</p><h2>The TPC-DS benchmark</h2><p>We used the famous <a href="http://www.tpc.org/tpcds/">TPC-DS</a> benchmark to compare Yarn and Kubernetes, as this is one of the most standard benchmark for Apache Spark and distributed computing in general. The TPC-DS benchmark consists of two things: data and queries.</p><ul role="list"><li>The data is synthetic and can be generated at different scales. It is skewed - meaning that some partitions are much larger than others - so as to represent real-word situations (ex: many more sales in July than in January). For this benchmark, we use a <strong>1TB</strong> dataset.</li><li>There are around 100 SQL queries, designed to cover most use cases of the average retail company (the TPC-DS tables are about stores, sales, catalogs, etc). As a result, the queries have different resource requirements: some have high CPU load, while others are IO-intensive.</li></ul><h2>What do we optimize for?</h2><p>The performance of a distributed computing framework is multi-dimensional: cost and duration should be taken into account. For example, what is best between a query that lasts 10 hours and costs $10 and a 1-hour $200 query? This depends on the needs of your company.</p><p>In this benchmark, we gave a fixed amount of resources to Yarn and Kubernetes. As a result, the cost of a query is directly proportional to its duration. This allows us to compare the two schedulers on a single dimension: duration.</p><h2>Setup</h2><p>This benchmark compares Spark running <a href="https://www.datamechanics.co/">Data Mechanics</a> (deployed on <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine">Google Kubernetes Engine</a>), and Spark running on <a href="https://cloud.google.com/dataproc">Dataproc</a> (GCP's managed Hadoop offering).</p><p>Driver: n2-standard-4 instance</p><ul role="list"><li>4 vCPUs</li><li>16GB RAM</li></ul><p>5 executors on n2-highmem-4 instances</p><ul role="list"><li>4 vCPUs</li><li>32GB RAM</li><li>375GB local SSD</li></ul><p>We ran each query 5&nbsp;times and reported the median duration.</p><p>We used the recently released 3.0 version of Spark in this benchmark. It brings substantial performance improvements over Spark 2.4, we'll show these in a future blog post.</p><p>The plot below shows the performance of all TPC-DS queries for Kubernetes and Yarn. Overall, they show very similar performance. For almost all queries, Kubernetes and YARN queries finish in a +/- 10% range of the other. Visually, it looks like YARN has the upper hand by a small margin.</p><figure id="w-node-da97cd907878-34f13c63"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e72486289a61e0d8c9dbb56/5f036796074ad9ebc49535ee_Local_SSDs_Kubernetes_versus_Yarn_(1).svg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Spark on Kubernetes vs Spark on YARN performance compared, query by query.</figcaption></figure><p>Aggregated results confirm this trend. The total durations to run the benchmark using the two schedulers are very close to each other, with a 4.5% advantage for YARN.</p><figure id="w-node-36859ee549c0-34f13c63"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e72486289a61e0d8c9dbb56/5f0367b9ced1db50ba42647b_Total%20duration.svg" alt=""></p><figcaption>When summing over the duration of all the queries, we get similar results for Kubernets and YARN as well, with a slight advantage for YARN (4.5% faster on average).</figcaption></figure><p>Since we ran each query only 5 times, the 5%&nbsp;difference is not statistically significant.&nbsp;And in general, a 5% difference is small compared to other gains you can make, for example by making smart infrastructure choices (instance types, cluster sizes, disk choices), by optimizing your Spark configurations (number of partitions, memory management, shuffle tuning), or by upgrading from Spark 2.4 to Spark 3.0!</p><p>So Kubernetes has caught up with YARN in terms of performance — and this is a big deal for Spark on Kubernetes! This means that if you need to decide between the two schedulers for your next project, you should focus on other criteria than performance (read <a href="https://www.datamechanics.co/blog-post/pros-and-cons-of-running-apache-spark-on-kubernetes">The Pros and Cons for running Apache Spark on Kubernetes</a> for our take on it).</p><p>In the next section, we will zoom in on the performance of shuffle, the dreaded all-to-all data exchange phases that typically take up the largest portion of your Spark jobs.&nbsp;We will see that for shuffle too, Kubernetes has caught up with YARN.&nbsp;More importantly, we'll give you critical configuration tips to make shuffle performant in Spark on Kubernetes.</p><p>Most long queries of the TPC-DS benchmark are shuffle-heavy. The plot below shows the durations of TPC-DS queries on Kubernetes as a function of the volume of shuffled data. When the amount of shuffled data is high (to the right), shuffle becomes the dominant factor in queries duration. In this zone, there is a clear correlation between shuffle and performance.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e72486289a61e0d8c9dbb56/5f036b4cb6d229325e832531_shuffle.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Duration of each TPC-DS&nbsp;query as a function of the volume of data being shuffled, both in logarithmic scales. The correlation between shuffle volume and query duration is clearly visible ("the performance wall").</figcaption></figure><p>To reduce shuffle time, tuning the infrastructure is key so that the exchange of data is as fast as possible. Shuffle performance depends on network throughput for machine to machine data exchange, and on disk I/O speed since shuffle blocks are written to the disk (on the map-side) and fetched from there (reduce-side).</p><p>To complicate things further, most instance types on cloud providers use remote disks (EBS on AWS and persistent disks on GCP). These disks are not co-located with the instances, so any I/O operations with them will count towards your instance network limit caps, and generally be slower.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e72486289a61e0d8c9dbb56/5f036c1c6dec9c1ab83b6d2f_everyday_shuffling.gif" alt=""></p><figcaption>This has nothing to do with Spark shuffle.</figcaption></figure><p>Here are simple but critical recommendations for when your Spark app suffers from long shuffle times:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Use local SSD disks whenever possible</strong>. Adding local disks on GCP is a simple toggle feature. On AWS, change the instance type from, say, r5.2xlarge to r5d.2xlarge. The higher cost of these disks is usually largely paid back by the overall performance improvement.</li><li>If local disks are not available, <strong>increase the size of your disks</strong>, as disk latency and throughput is almost proportional to disk size.</li></ul><p>In the plot below, we illustrate the impact of a bad choice of disks. We used standard persistent disks (the standard non-SSD remote storage in GCP) to run the TPC-DS. It shows the increase in duration of the different queries when reducing the disk size from 500GB to 100GB. Duration is 4 to 6 times longer for shuffle-heavy queries!</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e72486289a61e0d8c9dbb56/5f036c93c7296190418c92e0_Shuffle_disk_impact.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>This graph shows the normalized TPC-DS&nbsp;queries durations under two setups, one with 500GB and one with 100GB&nbsp;persistent (remote) disks. We can see a 4-6x performance change for shuffle-heavy queries.<br></figcaption></figure><h2>How to mount a local disk in Spark on Kubernetes</h2><p>As we've shown, local SSDs perform the best, but here's a little configuration gotcha when running Spark on Kubernetes.</p><p>Simply defining and attaching a local disk to your Kubernetes is not enough: they will be mounted, but by default Spark will not use them.&nbsp;On Kubernetes, a hostPath is required to allow Spark to use a mounted disk. </p><p>Here's an example configuration, in the <a href="https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/spark-on-k8s-operator">Spark operator</a> YAML manifest style:</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>⚠️ Disclaimer: <a href="https://www.datamechanics.co/">Data Mechanics</a> is a serverless Spark platform,&nbsp;tuning automatically the infrastructure and Spark configurations to make Spark as simple and performant as it should be.&nbsp;Under the hood, it is deployed on a Kubernetes cluster in our customers cloud account.</p><p>So we are biased in favor of Spark on Kubernetes — and indeed we are convinced that Spark on Kubernetes is the future of Apache Spark. In this article we have demonstrated with a standard benchmark that the performance of Kubernetes has caught up with that of Apache Hadoop YARN. We have also shared with you what we consider the most important I/O and shuffle optimizations so you can reproduce our results and be successful with Spark on Kubernetes.</p><p>We hope you will find this useful! While running our benchmarks we've also learned a great deal about the performance improvements in the newly born Spark 3.0 — we'll cover them in a future blog post, so stay tuned!</p><p>‍</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

<p>Computer graphics as a field is <strong>broad, deep, complex, and intimidating</strong>. More than half a century of rapid progress driven by academic research and industry practices underly it. Parts delve pretty far into physics, math, signal processing, systems programming (and more). And performance is always at a premium—so simple, straightforward techniques are often not possible, and high-level programming abstractions not usable.</p>
<p>Despite all this—or perhaps because of it?—it’s so rewarding to get better at graphics. As a kid, what drew me to graphics (and game programming) was the promise of creating vast, beautiful, dynamic, interactive worlds from nothing, to my exact specifications, just by flipping bits in computer memory.</p>
<p>Besides the creative aspect, there’s also beauty in building a deeper connection to the physical world by learning how to simulate it—and in a sense rebuild it—yourself. And just knowing you can make magical things with only your hands and a keyboard is very satisfying. (<em>Note: large, expensive GPU may also be required.</em>)</p>
<p>Many graphics experts have stated they love the field’s tendency to combine the artistic with the technical and scientific. In graphics there is rarely a “right” answer, but rather thousands of tradeoffs between correctness, performance, and aesthetics. And as the field evolves—hardware improves, and new techniques build atop and replace old ones—these tradeoffs continually change.</p>
<p>So graphics is great, but hard. Let’s talk some more about that.</p>

<p>I’ve recently gone through the process of diving much deeper into graphics—particularly real-time graphics—so I’m in a good place to offer advice to others who are on this journey. About six months ago I released a VR app (<a href="https://miketuritzin.com/particulate/">PARTICULATE</a>) that I built on a custom engine over the course of several years.</p>
<p>I was not starting from scratch by any stretch—I’ve programmed for decades and did a significant amount of graphics work in college as a bachelor’s and master’s student (including co-authoring a <a href="https://graphics.stanford.edu/papers/protected/">SIGGRAPH 2004 paper</a>). But I did take many years time off graphics to do <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-turitzin-b005928/">other things</a>, and I had missed a ton of progress when I came back so I had an enormous amount to learn. (And it’s not like I knew everything earlier, of course—ha!)</p>
<p><strong>I’m writing this article primarily for people who’ve already started their graphics journey.</strong> If you’re an absolute beginner—which is also great!—this article will likely be an interesting read, but I’d recommend starting with one or two beginner books or tutorial series before spending too much time getting lost in the wider world of graphics.</p>
<p>If you are already on the path of growing your graphics knowledge, you may be feeling like you’ve bitten off more than you can chew. That’s normal. It’s common to delve into a new graphics sub-area only to be confronted by a mountain of long and dense books, journal articles, PowerPoint presentations, and PhD theses. (Perhaps you would like to quickly peruse all 432 formula-filled pages of <a href="http://graphics.stanford.edu/papers/veach_thesis/">this seminal work in path tracing</a>? Or some light afternoon reading on <a href="https://seblagarde.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/course_notes_moving_frostbite_to_pbr_v32.pdf">physically based rendering in the Frostbite engine</a>? (122 pages))</p>
<p>I’m writing this article to offer tips and advice that I’ve found helpful in the last few years. I’m focusing on general principles rather than specific resources (books, tutorials, etc.), but I will mention some of those at the end. (Because what would an article on learning graphics be without a bunch of references and links that are out-of-date or dead in a couple years? ;) )</p>
<p>Let’s get started.</p>

<p>First, at the risk of sounding flippant, I recommend being extremely motivated to learn more about graphics. This may sound unnecessary (or alternatively, obvious) but it’s an important factor—the more motivated you are, the more time you will put in, and the less likely you’ll be to give up when things get difficult, which they will.</p>
<p>It’s possible to do some quick weekend-style graphics projects (like writing a simple ray tracer using <a href="https://raytracing.github.io/">Peter Shirley’s books</a>), but more serious projects will involve a lot of learning and grinding to make significant headway. It’d be great if things weren’t this way, but that’s been my experience.</p>
<p>For me, the best way to get motivated is to start building a real product that I plan to release eventually (which is what I did with <a href="https://miketuritzin.com/particulate/">PARTICULATE</a>). Some people are happy to work on multiple small “toy” projects, or to build a personal engine to learn about different techniques. There’s nothing wrong with those approaches—and taking them may even be best for learning many techniques as quickly as possible. But I’m most obsessively motivated when I have a vision of a finished product people can use. This vision helps guide me toward what to learn and do next (and motivates me when I’m feeling discouraged). Your mileage may vary—find what works!</p>
<p>Second, <strong>it’s important to cultivate a tolerance to feeling dumb</strong>. It’s easy to have a simple goal (say, rendering text) turn overwhelming as you encounter an avalanche of articles, alternative approaches, unfamiliar math, and dense PPTs and PDFs. (For the example of text rendering—there’s a reason Eric Lengyel has made a business out of selling his <a href="https://sluglibrary.com/">library for high-quality text rendering</a> to companies that already employ rendering specialists. Text rendering is way more complex than it initially appears.)</p>
<p>If you hate feeling dumb—and I can’t say I love it, but I’ve gotten better at <em>tolerating</em> it—you’re much more likely to give up and return to more familiar pastures. Being extremely motivated also helps at persevering through the pain of feeling dumb :)</p>
<p>It will often take multiple passes over the same material to fully understand it (or even approach that). I like to read different resources so I can absorb different explanations of the same concepts, as every author has their own angle. Further, even after multiple passes, you may still not feel like you fully understand a new topic. This is something I had to acclimate to—as a seasoned programmer I was used to feeling comfortable with new concepts in computer science fairly quickly.</p>

<p>I recommend aiming not for full understanding but rather to understand a topic a bit more each time you read a new resource on it. Look it as peeling off the layers of an onion. (I mentioned this idea in <a href="https://twitter.com/miketuritzin/status/1198075785887641600">Laura Reznikov’s Twitter thread about learning graphics</a>, which contains other good tips.)</p>
<p>Sometimes you will need to implement things that you feel like you don’t fully understand yet. A common example of this is typing in mathematical formulas that still seem a bit cryptic. This can be a dangerous road to go down (as it makes debugging extremely difficult, among other issues), but sometimes going into a bit of “debt” in this regard is necessary to keep things moving.</p>
<p>Make a list of things you’ve implemented that you don’t fully understand, and aim to learn more about them as you continue moving forward. (On a related note, <a href="https://twitter.com/RubaMoh/status/969608563311091712">this Twitter thread</a> contains some useful tips on understanding math used in graphics papers.)</p>
<p>It’s really important in graphics to embrace building off the work of others. In programming more generally, it’s often possible to devise your own algorithms without doing much background research. Of course there are exceptions—better to use quicksort than reinvent bubble sort yourself—but I’ve found in some other areas it’s easier to program by the seat of your pants. You’ll waste a lot of time coming up with sub-par solutions if you try to do this a lot in graphics. As you get more experienced, you’ll be able to develop new techniques yourself, but even then you’ll be heavily relying on prior work.</p>

<p>To learn graphics deeply—especially on your own or with limited supervision—you need to become a master of finding resources, combing through them quickly, and assimilating different approaches to the same problem (or even different takes on the same approach). Expect to be reading a lot of articles, blog posts, course notes, conference papers, forum posts, Twitter threads, PowerPoint presentations, PhD and Master’s theses, and books (and watching a lot of videos of conference presentations).</p>
<p>Paging through cryptic PowerPoint presentations—especially ones without speaker notes—is a special kind of “fun” that is sometimes necessary due to lack of videos and articles on the topic you’re interested in.</p>
<figure>

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Sometimes you will waste a lot of time trying to decipher a particular resource only to figure out later that the author wasn’t explaining things well. Eventually you’ll develop a sixth sense for when a resource feels overly obtuse (even when you don’t yet understand the topic). Once you detect this, you can quickly move on to other resources on the same topic—which hopefully exist—and waste less time trying to decipher an unclear explanation.</p>
<p>Expect to encounter this type of scenario often: You have a new graphics problem to solve (for a project you’re working on), and you need to learn the landscape of that problem to determine how to proceed. What are the state-of-the-art solutions? What are the trade-offs between quality, efficiency, and ease-of-implementation?</p>
<p>Just answering these questions can take quite a while—the web is littered with older approaches that are now rarely used (stencil shadows?) and experimental approaches that never quite panned out. Then in some cases you’ll find an approach that looks great but has terrible performance (e.g., many of the takes on order-independent-transparency).</p>
<p>Things are so complex in part because tradeoffs change over time as graphics hardware and APIs evolve and new …</p></div></div></div>

<h2><span>Introduction</span></h2>
<p><span>In cybersecurity, news regarding new vulnerabilities appears </span><span>continuously every day</span><span> through an array of various sources, be it news networks, social networks, blogs, security advisories, etc. These fall under the umbrella of open-source intelligence (OSINT). Yet not all vulnerabilities generate the same level of interest and length of discussion.</span></p>
<p><span>As such, one interesting aspect of vulnerability prioritization is to consider what types of vulnerabilities are currently trending in these OSINT sources, in order to establish the types of vulnerabilities an attacker might favor.&nbsp; For example, if discussions in public sources and underground networks currently mention reflected XSS attacks on particular frameworks more often than usual, then other attackers reading these discussions could be tempted to attack other similar XSS vulnerabilities, or find similar inflection points in other frameworks. Attackers, just like cybersecurity experts, are very much influenced by trends in exploitation methods.</span></p>
<p><span>This blogpost explains in part how </span><a href="https://delvesecurity.com/delves-vulnerability-threat-intelligence-feed/"><span>Delve's Vulnerability Threat Intelligence Feed</span></a><span> identifies the top trending vulnerabilities on a daily basis.</span></p>
<p><span>The goal of the approach presented in this blog is to identify the patterns or trends underlying online discussions. These are what we aim to model in order to generalize which vulnerabilities might receive more attention from attackers, regardless of the vulnerability’s direct mentions (e.g., its CVE number) in online discussions. The goal is the identification of the underlying concepts associated with online cybersecurity discussions, first to assess the importance of existing vulnerabilities, and second to use this representation as input to future predictive models. To extract this information, a natural language approach is employed, which uses machine learning, and more specifically,</span><i><span> topic modeling</span></i><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>In short, it is possible to build a representation of a vulnerability that captures both its intrinsic features as well as its relationship with the external world.</span></p>
<p><span>This framework aims to:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Create a representation that encodes the semantic meaning of vulnerabilities, i.e., topics from the textual descriptions of all disclosed vulnerabilities to date.</span></li>
<li><span>Crawl online infosec discussions and apply them to a topic model, so as to obtain a weighted list of topics, which we call </span><i><span>trends</span></i><span>.</span></li>
<li><span>Combine the previously-built trends to their respective topics in a vulnerability, in order to indicate its importance to current infosec discussions.</span></li>
<li><span>Use these trends and topics in future machine learning projects as input features</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span>Methodology</span></h2>
<p><span>In order to accomplish these goals, we can use topic modeling, which is an unsupervised machine learning technique where a number of topics are automatically extracted from a text corpus, along with each one’s probability to appear in any of the texts. A </span><i><span>topic</span></i><span> consists of one or more weighted words, where a higher weight indicates a higher importance to the topic. A topic represents an underlying concept extracted from the text through statistical analysis.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For example, there are a great number of disclosed buffer overflow vulnerabilities out there, each with a different but similar description. This technique can capture a generic topic representing the words associated with buffer overflow vulnerabilities, looking somewhat like this:</span></p>
<div id="attachment_4694"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4694" src="https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Image-1.png" alt="" width="596" height="450" srcset="https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Image-1.png 596w, https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Image-1-300x227.png 300w, https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Image-1-100x76.png 100w, https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Image-1-550x415.png 550w" sizes="(max-width: 596px) 100vw, 596px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-4694"><strong>Figure 1: An example of a buffer overflow topic</strong></p></div>
<p><span>A prominent topic modeling technique is Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), which is a generative model that computes the probability of a word being associated with a topic[1]. LDA has been proven effective in previous research and applications[2,3], and is one of the most common topic modeling methods.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>Creating the Topic Model&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p><span>First, let’s extract the textual definition of all vulnerabilities in the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) of the NIST, each associated with a CVE number. These texts are then processed, as depicted by Figure 2. In step 1, URLs and common words are removed, the text is split into tokens (single words), and the words are lemmatized</span><span> (<a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/stemming-and-lemmatization-1.html">Stanford</a>) to group together different inflections of a word.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><img src="https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Image-2.png" alt="" width="591" height="101" srcset="https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Image-2.png 591w, https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Image-2-300x51.png 300w, https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Image-2-100x17.png 100w, https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Image-2-550x94.png 550w" sizes="(max-width: 591px) 100vw, 591px"></p>

<p><strong>Figure 2: Filtering of a description’s words, and splitting into tokens</strong></p>
<p><span>These lists of tokens can then be transformed into a numerical representation using the bag-of-words model, as depicted in Figure 3. In this new representation, each token is identified by an ID and its number of occurrences, where the ID is chosen based on its first appearance in the definitions. This transformation is necessary since LDA requires numerical inputs.</span></p>
<p><img src="https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Image-3.png" alt="" width="512" height="82" srcset="https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Image-3.png 512w, https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Image-3-300x48.png 300w, https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Image-3-100x16.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"></p>
<p><strong>Figure 3: Transformation of a description’s tokens into a numerical representation</strong></p>
<p><span>These are then used as input to LDA, as shown in Figure 4, which generates a set of topics identified by a series of words and an importance factor between 0 and 1. This model is implemented using online learning, where new published vulnerabilities are fed to the model daily and the model is updated incrementally.</span></p>
<p><img src="https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Feature-Image.png" alt="" width="531" height="292" srcset="https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Feature-Image.png 531w, https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Feature-Image-300x165.png 300w, https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Feature-Image-100x55.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 531px) 100vw, 531px"></p>

<p><strong>Figure 4: Association of words in numerical form to their topics through LDA</strong></p>
<h3><span>Building Trends from Online Discussions</span></h3>
<p><span>Once we have learned a suitable model for vulnerabilities, one that understands the specifics of language in the description of vulnerabilities, we gather online discussions of vulnerabilities and exploitations from various public sources. While a number of previous works have extracted information from online discussions in order to build models[4,5,6,7], none applied them to a topic model in the same way this blog details. Now, let’s process text posts from discussions in the same way as specified in Figure 2 and Figure 3, and apply them to the existing topic model.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This results in a vector of weights for each text post, where each topic’s importance to this discussion is expressed by a number between 0 and 1, named a </span><i><span>weight</span></i><span>. By averaging these vectors together across all posts, we obtain a final single vector denoting the relative importance of each of our topics in what we observe in online discussions. We call those “trends”. In the end, by extracting the topics with the highest weights, we obtain the set of current trends. Figure 5 describes the creation of trends:</span></p>

<p><img src="https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Image-5.png" alt="" width="471" height="271" srcset="https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Image-5.png 471w, https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Image-5-300x173.png 300w, https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Image-5-100x58.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 471px) 100vw, 471px"></p>
<p><strong>Figure 5: The creation of a trends score from online discussions</strong></p>
<h3><span>Scoring Vulnerabilities</span></h3>
<p><span>Finally, we look back at the vulnerabilities from the NIST database which were used to build the initial topic model, and identify the ones with topics matching the newly established trends. This is done by applying the dot product to each vulnerability topic vector and the trends vector, or in slightly more human language, by computing the product of each of a vulnerability’s topic weights and its corresponding trend weights, and summing them. This gives us a final Vulnerability Trends Score (VTS).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The higher the VTS is, the more closely this vulnerability matches with online discussions.</span></p>
<p><img src="https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Image-6.png" alt="" width="533" height="301" srcset="https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Image-6.png 533w, https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Image-6-300x169.png 300w, https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Image-6-100x56.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 533px) 100vw, 533px"></p>

<p><strong>Figure 6: The dot product between the vulnerability topics and the trends</strong></p>
<p><span>The framework can be summarized in the figure below. First, the topic model is trained with vulnerability descriptions, and outputs a number of topics:</span></p>
<p><img src="https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Image-7.png" alt="" width="512" height="351" srcset="https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Image-7.png 512w, https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Image-7-300x206.png 300w, https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Image-7-100x69.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"></p>
<p><span>Second, online discussions are run through the same topic model to establish which of the previously obtained topics are most important for these discussions:</span></p>
<p><img src="https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Image-8.png" alt="" width="532" height="365" srcset="https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Image-8.png 532w, https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Image-8-300x206.png 300w, https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Image-8-100x69.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 532px) 100vw, 532px"></p>

<p><strong>Figure 7: Overview of the approach</strong></p>
<h3><span>Example of a Use Case</span></h3>
<p><span>Let’s see how this works in practice: 30 topics (why 30? See the Appendix below) were identified on all of NIST’s vulnerabilities, each identifying a concept observed in vulnerability descriptions. Then, data was gathered from online discussions, such as these tweets from Twitter :</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>We have created the first write-up on the recent Apache Tomcat RCE (CVE-2020-9484), read here: [url] #infosec #javahacking #exploit #tomcat #deserialization #webapplicationhacking #vulnerability</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span>Security Bulletin: Open Source Apache Tomcat vulnerabilities affect IBM Tivoli Application Dependency Discovery Manager (CVE-2020-1938) [url] Multiple vulnerabilities in Open Source Apache Tomcat reported by The Apache Software Foundation [url]</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span>Apache Tomcat AJP Vulnerability (CNVD-2020-10487/CVE-2020-1938)&nbsp; (<a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-1938">NIST</a>) .This vulnerability was discovered by a security researcher of Chaitin Tech . You can read any webapps files or include a file to RCE .JUST A POC-GIF with no DETAILS Tomcat has fix this vulnerability ,UPDATE! [url]"</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>When applying the topic model to these tweets, a weight for every topic of the model is obtained, relative to&nbsp; these specific tweets. This is what we identify as </span><i><span>trends</span></i><span>. Among others, these three topics, in a human-interpretable form, came out as important:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Topic A</b><span>, related to file upload vulnerabilities</span></li>
<li><b>Topic B</b><span>, related to applications having default settings and making HTTP requests&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><b>Topic D</b><span>, related to code execution vulnerabilities</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Finally, we can use the trends and the vulnerabilities’ topics to obtain a VTS for each vulnerability, using the method described previously.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The top-ranked vulnerability comes out as CVE-2020-1938</span><span>, which identifies an Apache Tomcat vulnerability, code-named Ghostcat, enabling attackers to upload files through a default connection, and potentially obtain a remote code execution. The following figure illustrates the evolution of this specific vulnerability over the month of June 2020:</span></p>
<p><img src="https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Image-9.png" alt="" width="392" height="300" srcset="https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Image-9.png 392w, https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Image-9-300x230.png 300w, https://delvesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/VTS-Blog-Image-9-100x77.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 392px) 100vw, 392px"><strong>Figure 8: The evolution of CVE-2020-1938’s VTS score over the month of June</strong></p>
<p><span>This vulnerability appearing as the most important is expected, given that many tweets mention Tomcat vulnerabilities, and some directly speak of this vulnerability. More interestingly, other vulnerabilities matching with topics A, B and D will also have a high trending score, while not necessarily being the most mentioned online.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>Results</span></h2>
<p><span>With a model trained in early June 2020, the top trending topics obtained are shown in Figure 9 as word clouds. The model is trained everyday to observe the evolution of trends.</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>How should you do concurrency in an embedded <code>no_std</code> application? There's no built-in support for time-sliced threads in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/index.html"><code>core</code></a>; that abstraction is only available in <code>std</code> (see <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/thread/index.html"><code>std::thread</code></a>). The latest stable release brought the async/await feature to <code>no_std</code> thanks to <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/stable-async-on-embedded/">our compiler work</a>. Should you <em>always</em> use that instead? Is cooperative scheduling appropriate for <em>all</em> kind of embedded applications? What about applications with soft or hard real-time requirements?</p>

<p>If you have asked yourself these questions before then this post is for you! We'll look into a few commonly used embedded concurrency patterns and then into some less common ones. We'll compare their runtime characteristics in practical terms so you get a better feel for which one is appropriate for your application.</p>



<p>This is by far the most widely known and used concurrency pattern. If you have written a concurrent <em>hosted</em> application, an application that runs on top of an Operating System (OS), then you have directly or indirectly use time-sliced threads as they are a concurrency / multitasking construct that virtually all OSes provide.</p>

<p>In embedded applications threads are commonly used for multitasking with one task mapped to one thread. Embedded devices usually have only one CPU so adding threads does not result in parallelism (parallel execution of threads). Example usage below:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// thread / task 1 uses the radio interface</span>
<span>let</span> <span>(</span><span>mut</span> <span>rtx</span><span>,</span> <span>mut</span> <span>rrx</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>radio</span><span>::</span><span>claim</span><span>();</span>
<span>thread</span><span>::</span><span>spawn</span><span>(</span><span>move</span> <span>||</span> <span>loop</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>buffer</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>64</span><span>];</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>n</span> <span>=</span> <span>rrx</span><span>.recv</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>buffer</span><span>);</span>
    <span>// omitted: prepare a response</span>
    <span>rtx</span><span>.send</span><span>(</span><span>buffer</span><span>[</span><span>..</span><span>m</span><span>]);</span>
<span>});</span>

<span>// thread / task 2 uses the serial interface</span>
<span>let</span> <span>(</span><span>mut</span> <span>stx</span><span>,</span> <span>mut</span> <span>srx</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>serial</span><span>::</span><span>claim</span><span>();</span>
<span>thread</span><span>::</span><span>spawn</span><span>(</span><span>move</span> <span>||</span> <span>loop</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>buffer</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>64</span><span>];</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>n</span> <span>=</span> <span>srx</span><span>.read</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>buffer</span><span>);</span>
    <span>// omitted: prepare a response</span>
    <span>stx</span><span>.write</span><span>(</span><span>buffer</span><span>[</span><span>..</span><span>m</span><span>]);</span>
<span>});</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>In this example two independent tasks are executed concurrently by running each one in a separate thread. In the example the threads do not need to communicate but inter-thread communication is possible via atomics, mutexes or channels.</p>

<p>Apart from familiarity the other big advantage of threads is that you can use existing blocking APIs in threads without modification and still end up with a concurrent / multitasking application.</p>

<p>Currently, most of the existing Hardware Abstraction Layers (HAL) in the embedded crate ecosystem have only blocking APIs. One would then think that threads are the preferred way to do concurrency as those blocking HALs can be used "as they are" in threaded applications. However, that's not the case; there aren't pure-Rust thread runtimes and although there are Rust bindings to embedded OSes written in C that do provide a thread abstraction they are not that widely used.</p>

<p>This lack of use of threads in embedded Rust may have to do with their main disadvantage: inefficient stack usage due to each thread having its own separate call stack.  A chunk of RAM must be allocated to each thread as call stack space; the chunk must be large enough so that the call stack does not grow beyond its reserved space and ends up colliding with the call stack of a different thread.</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
<em>Memory layout of a multi-threaded program</em>
</p>

<p>The above image depicts the memory layout of multi-threaded program that uses the whole RAM available on an embedded device. At the bottom (smallest memory address) you'll see the <code>.bss+.data</code> section; this section contains statically allocated variables. Right above that section you'll see the heap. The memory allocator uses the heap space to dynamically allocate data like vectors (growable arrays) and (growable) strings. Dynamic memory allocation is optional in embedded applications so the heap may not always be present; when it is present, it is usually assigned a fixed amount of memory. The rest of the memory is used for the call stacks of the threads. In this example the call stacks grow downwards, towards smaller addresses. As you can imagine the stack of T1 could grow large enough to collide with the stack of T2; likewise the stack of T3 could grow too large and collide with the heap. Some architectures provide runtime mechanisms to detect these collisions but when collisions are not runtime checked corruption of memory can occur.</p>

<p>Embedded devices have limited amounts of RAM, usually in the order of tens of KBs. This greatly limits the amount of threads can be spawned if allocated stack space is fixed to a large number like 4 KB. If alternatively, all the RAM is equally split among N threads this can lead to each thread having too little stack space which increases the risk of stack overflows.</p>

<p>In summary:</p>

<p>Pros of threads:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Popular concurrency model with a familiar API (<code>std::thread</code>)</li>
  <li>Existing blocking code can be made run concurrently without modification</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons of threads:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Inefficient stack usage: one separate call stack per thread. Having more threads results in greater risk of a stack overflow (collision between call stacks)</li>
</ul>



<p>Another approach to concurrency is to directly use the interrupt handlers. Interrupt handlers are callback functions that are executed by the hardware when some event, internal or external, occurs. Due to their callback nature – the handler runs from start to finish on each new event – interrupt handling code usually ends up containing explicit state machines.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// these functions are interrupt handlers</span>
<span>fn</span> <span>on_usb_events</span><span>(</span><span>state</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>UsbHandlerState</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>event</span> <span>in</span> <span>pending_usb_events</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>// advance the state machine according to current state and</span>
        <span>// the incoming event</span>
        <span>match</span> <span>(</span><span>state</span><span>,</span> <span>event</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>// ..</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>on_radio_events</span><span>(</span><span>state</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>RadioHandlerState</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// ..</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The main advantage of using interrupt handlers is fast response times. This is because interrupt handlers are prioritized over code that's not running from interrupt context. This results in <em>preemption</em>: the lower priority code gets suspended while the interrupt handler code runs; once the handler returns the execution of the lower priority code is resumed.</p>

<p>With interrupt handlers external events like USB events can be handled within a few clock cycles of the event occurring. On the other hand, using a thread to handle USB events can result in higher processing latency if the thread needs to compete with other threads for CPU time.</p>

<p>Some architectures support prioritization of interrupt handlers; this means that higher priority interrupt handlers can preempt lower priority ones. This is particularly useful in real-time applications where multiple events need to be handled within a certain amount of time, a <em>deadline</em>, but some of them have tighter deadlines – those event handlers with tighter deadlines need to be prioritized.</p>

<p>After preemption there's no context switching from the higher priority context to the lower priority one. This means that the call stack of the lower priority context remains frozen during the whole execution of the higher priority interrupt handler. Due to this fact, the call stacks of interrupt handlers are laid next to each other in memory – this happens automatically at the hardware level. Compared to the call stack layout of threads, this results in a much more efficient use of RAM as there are no gaps between the call stack of each interrupt handler. The next image illustrates the idea.</p>

<p>
  <img alt="Memory layout of a program that uses prioritized interrupts" src="https://ferrous-systems.com/images/concurrency-interrupts.svg">
</p>
<p>
<em>Memory layout of a program that uses prioritized interrupts</em>
</p>

<p>This is the memory layout of a program using prioritized interrupt handlers. The <code>.bss+.data</code> and heap sections remain the same as in the multi-threaded program. Call stacks also grow downwards in this case. <code>main</code> is the non-interrupt context; its call stack starts at the top (highest address) of the RAM region. In the snapshot we observe that interrupt handler I1 has preempted <code>main</code> and that interrupt handler I2 has preempted I1. In this state the call stack of I2 is allowed to grown downwards but the stacks of I1 and <code>main</code> remain frozen in size until interrupt handler I2 returns and interrupt handler I1 is resumed.</p>

<p>Frameworks like <a href="https://rtic.rs/0.5/book/en/">RTIC</a> (Real-Time on Interrupt Circuits) – previously known as RTFM (Real Time For the Masses) – are built on the idea that applications can be made completely reactive if they consist only of interrupt handling code. RTIC maps its tasks to interrupt handlers allowing prioritization of tasks with efficient stack usage. RTIC is a multitasking alternative to threads that features task prioritization and low latency handling of events.</p>

<p>In summary:</p>

<p>Pros of interrupt handlers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Minimal processing delay between the occurrence of an event and its event handler thanks to prioritization</li>
  <li>Hardware level support for prioritization (the number of priority levels is device dependent)</li>
  <li>Efficient stack usage: the call stacks of interrupt handlers are laid out next to each other ("compacted")</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons of interrupt handlers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Non-linear code: explicit state machines</li>
</ul>



<p>The newest concurrency model available in <code>no_std</code> code is async/await. The async/await feature enables the construction of <em>cooperative</em> tasks: tasks that yield control back to the scheduler at determined points; it is only at these points where context switching between tasks occurs. This is quite different from threads; in threaded systems the scheduler can context switch from one thread to another at any time.</p>

<p>async code looks quite similar to threaded code. Task executors, the schedulers that run async tasks, will usually provide an API that resembles the <code>std::thread</code> API. This eases the effort required to switch from working with threads to working with async tasks.</p>

<p>Here's the multi-threaded example we saw before ported to async tasks:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// async task 1 uses the radio interface</span>
<span>let</span> <span>(</span><span>mut</span> <span>rtx</span><span>,</span> <span>mut</span> <span>rrx</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>radio</span><span>::</span><span>claim</span><span>();</span>
<span>executor</span><span>::</span><span>spawn</span><span>(</span><span>async</span> <span>move</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>//          ^^^^^ async block</span>
    <span>// the `.await` operator can be used within this block</span>

    <span>loop</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>buffer</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>64</span><span>];</span>
        <span>let</span> <span>n</span> <span>=</span> <span>rrx</span><span>.recv</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>buffer</span><span>)</span><span>.await</span><span>;</span>
        <span>//                       …</span></code></pre></div></div></div>

<p>As of the 5th July 2020, there are 1357 Tor bridges available for users in countries who censor the Tor network to use. Having just over 1,000 IP addresses is not a lot for such a big privacy network as Tor is, especially considering that the number of Tor Bridges peaked at 4,227 on the 4th January 2015. That means since then the network has lost more than two-thirds of its bridges.</p>
<p>The lack of bridges only makes it harder for people in oppressive countries to take advantage of both the anti-censorship and anonymizing power of the Tor network. In light of this, many people including the Tor project themselves have been trying to convince more people to become bridge operators.</p>
<p>This article will go over some ultra-cheap VPS hosts that will allow anyone to become a bridge operators without having to spend a sizeable amount of money;</p>

In the US, QR codes and NFC were often viewed as a <a href="https://adage.com/article/digital/marketer-love-qr-codes-shared-consumers/231854" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nice-to-have or novelty</a>. Now, you’d be hard-pressed to walk down a street full of businesses and not see QR codes on storefront windows offering core business interactions as new, contactless experiences.</p> <p>It’s early-days, though, and solutions of varying sophistication are popping up all over the place. I thought I’d document some of the traditionally physical and person-to-person interactions we’ve observed getting the touchless treatment, and highlight some of the emerging hallmarks of good, contactless interaction design (Spoiler: general <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/840.The_Design_of_Everyday_Things" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interaction design guidelines</a> still apply).</p> <p>Let’s get started.</p> <h2 id="check-ins-and-wait-lists"><a href="#check-ins-and-wait-lists">#</a> Check-ins and wait-lists</h2> <p><img src="https://blog.routegy.com/images/posts/rethinking-interactions-touchless-world/check-in-wait-list.jpg" alt="A tablet at a restaurant prompting customers to check in by entering a name and phone number" width="40%"></p><p>What’s the first thing you encounter when you walk into a hotel, restaurant, or office? It’s likely a check-in flow. Do you have a reservation? Who are you here to see? How many are in your party? These interactions often involve talking to a receptionist and using a pen on paper or a shared tablet.</p> <p>This interaction can be relatively easy to automate. In fact, pre-COVID, tablets were appearing in all sorts of businesses, from restaurants to corporate offices, that allowed check-in without the need for human interaction. While the concept is sound, customers are now hesitant to touch a surface shared with countless others.</p> <p>Now, these tablets are beginning to use QR codes that can be scanned by a kiosk, allowing people to sign in from their own device. Unfortunately, many solutions require an app and oftentimes an account or exchange of personal information to use them. We’ll get into why this is bad a bit later.</p> <h2 id="curbside-pickup"><a href="#curbside-pickup">#</a> Curbside pickup</h2> <p>Curbside pickup isn’t new, but it has certainly expanded during the pandemic. Put simply, a customer should be able to order and pay electronically, get notified when their order is available, and provide some notification for the order to be delivered to their vehicle.</p> <p><img src="https://blog.routegy.com/images/posts/rethinking-interactions-touchless-world/curbside-pickup.jpg" alt="Buckets with posts and signs in a retailer's parking lot instructing customers to call when they arrive"></p><p>It’s now common to see reserved parking spaces and signage with instructions to call a number with the order ID and parking space or tap a button in an app to type the information in. <a href="https://blog.routegy.com/2020/06/30/examination-curbside-pickup-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As we wrote previously</a>, these experiences require unnecessary overhead, burden customers by requesting redundant information, and tie up phone lines, resulting in lost orders and revenue.</p> <p>Some solutions use geofencing to track when customers leave for the location and arrive, but this too has issues, as they require customers to have an app and allow access to fine-grained location information. Besides battery and privacy concerns, this can be confusing. Do customers open the app and let you know when they’re leaving? Do they have to keep the app open? Who else can access their location information? The goal is to make it easy for customers, not instill uncertainty and doubt.</p> <h2 id="menus-table-service-and-payments"><a href="#menus-table-service-and-payments">#</a> Menus, table service, and payments</h2> <p><img src="https://blog.routegy.com/images/posts/rethinking-interactions-touchless-world/contactless-pos-gas-station.jpg" alt="A QR code on a fuel pump at a gas station offering a link to install an app for payment instead of using the keypad" width="60%"></p><p>We’re all familiar with handling physical menus (the condition of which can vary wildly, from pristine to yikes) and talking to servers throughout a meal, from ordering to asking for refills to paying the check. It’s easy to think of menus and service as specific to restaurants and retail, but the high-level concepts apply more broadly. Basically, any interaction that allows people to select options and pay for goods or services is being rethought. Think stadiums, theme parks, theaters, and so on.</p> <p>Restaurants are now placing QR codes on tables that point to their webpages or install a 3rd party app to enable a virtual menu and ordering system. A restaurant webpage isn’t likely to be interactive or allow for selection, so human interaction is still required. Apps provide interactive menus and POS functionality, but require a download, account creation, and the overhead that comes along with it.</p> <h2 id="requests-and-issue-reporting"><a href="#requests-and-issue-reporting">#</a> Requests and issue reporting</h2> <p>Where do people go when they need something or want to report a facility issue? Before, even in large companies with ticketing systems, it was often easiest to just tap someone on the shoulder. This particular interaction was already pretty bad (imagine being the someone whose shoulder is constantly getting tapped), and now it comes with a health risk.</p> <p>Besides requiring social distancing or using Slack/email/voice, the interaction is still problematic in terms of efficiency, just as it was pre-COVID. Ideally, people would make requests and report issues in a contextual way with their own devices without the need to navigate a ticketing system or go find someone to help. Need something or see something? Scan or tap this sign to let us know!</p> <h2 id="surveys-and-feedback"><a href="#surveys-and-feedback">#</a> Surveys and feedback</h2> <p><img src="https://blog.routegy.com/images/posts/rethinking-interactions-touchless-world/customer-feedback-survey.jpg" alt="A sign in a doorway asking for customer feedback with a QR code" width="50%"></p><p>How do we know how we’re doing and how we can improve? One of the best ways is to simply ask. Customer and employee feedback is invaluable, and it’s typically gathered via paper forms, shared tablets, or other physical interactions (E.g. the Happy or Not kiosks you encounter at airport restrooms).</p> <p>Contactless ways of gathering feedback via email and text already exist, of course, but those require personal information and also lack context, typically showing up when it’s convenient for us, not when it’s relevant to them. Ideally we would collect feedback in the moment, and do so in a safe way.</p> <p>Some basic solutions have begun to show up, like QR codes that point to Google forms. While you may get the data you need, you’ll still need to figure out how to format and import that information into your workflow.</p> <h2 id="so-what-makes-a-good-touchless-interaction"><a href="#so-what-makes-a-good-touchless-interaction">#</a> So, what makes a good, touchless interaction?</h2> <p><img src="https://blog.routegy.com/images/posts/rethinking-interactions-touchless-world/routegy-request-qr-nfc.jpg" alt="A QR code and NFC tag are mounted to a wall, prompting visitors to interact via their phone to make requests"></p><p>People are used to face-to-face interactions when they need something. Introducing technology into the equation is inevitably going to complicate things, especially at first. So what should we consider to minimize the impact, increase safety and comfort, and ease folks into this new world?</p> <h4 id="low-friction"><a href="#low-friction">#</a> Low friction</h4> <p>Requiring apps and accounts is a burden. Unless you’re confident that a large percentage of your customers already have your app installed (and actually like it vs. installing it begrudgingly), avoid requiring an app installation. Similarly, unless absolutely necessary, do not require account creation or sign-in. Oftentimes the information you need to serve and communicate with your customers can be achieved without the extra hurdles.</p> <h4 id="intuitive"><a href="#intuitive">#</a> Intuitive</h4> <p>Most people are not used to pulling out their phone to accomplish traditionally touch-heavy tasks, let alone using it to scan QR codes and tap NFC tags. Despite most modern devices supporting these functions natively, we must educate customers. Clear signage and instruction works wonders here. But the experience doesn’t end there, does it? We also need to be mindful to offer data entry that is <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/web/policies-and-standards/hhs-web-policies/accessibility/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">accessible</a>, easy to navigate on a phone, and that doesn’t collect unnecessary information we can collect contextually and automatically.</p> <h4 id="fast"><a href="#fast">#</a> Fast</h4> <p>Talking to someone typically has instant feedback and gratification. With a touchless experience, it’s difficult to know who or what is on the receiving end of the communication, so it’s important to set expectations and deliver on them. Is this going to contact staff inside? Do we expect that this might take a few minutes? Tell people up front and eliminate confusion.</p> <h4 id="long-term-design"><a href="#long-term-design">#</a> Long-Term design</h4> <p>It’s tempting to slap something together as a temporary stop-gap until a vaccine is discovered, but that’s doing a disservice to your customers and to your business. Many, if not all, of the interactions we’ve discussed have benefits that go beyond limiting the spread of the virus. Done right, touchless interactions deliver better experiences because they streamline interactions and enable staff to focus on more important things while respecting your customers’ time and privacy.</p> <h4 id="automated"><a href="#automated">#</a> Automated</h4> <p>Consider whether the interaction can be accomplished without any data input at all (E.g. requesting a bellhop or flight attendant, reporting a bathroom in need of attention, or marking a desk as occupied), and make the interaction as simple as possible. We’ll explore this topic in more detail in an upcoming article.</p> <h2 id="wrapping-up"><a href="#wrapping-up">#</a> Wrapping up</h2> <p>As you can see, there’s a lot of work to do, but these are problems that can and will be solved. It’s amazing to see the ingenuity and creativity on display. While there is much to refine, it’s clear that in just a short time we’ve already begun to adjust to this new, contactless world, and these experiences will only get better.</p> <p>If you have some thoughts on how contactless, touchless interactions are evolving, I'd love to hear about them in our <a href="https://community.routegy.com/t/an-examination-of-the-curbside-pickup-experience/20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">comments section</a> for this post.</p> <h2 id="need-help"><a href="#need-help">#</a> Need help?</h2> <p>If you’re looking for help in adapting your business to offer intuitive, contactless integrations, please <a href="https://www.routegy.com/connect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reach out for a demo</a> of our product, Routegy, or <a href="https://web.routegy.com/auth/join/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">try it for yourself</a>.

      <p>“What would you say if I asked you to design me a service capable of responding to millions of user requests every second and latency was critical?”</p>

<p>“Umm…that you have to solve this problem at work. But you’re out of ideas, and are looking to interviewees for suggestions”</p>

<p>That’s the actual response I gave the interviewer the first time I was asked a design question. He had a good laugh. But then still made me design the service.</p>

<p>In the decade since I’ve lost track of how many hours I’ve spent in the interview room, on both sides of the table. I’ve worked at Microsoft, Google, and Stripe, and received offers from many other companies. As I interviewed, I realized one thing: standard interviewing advice falls woefully short.</p>

<p>What good does it do to practice coding problems for weeks if your mind goes blank in an interview room? How can you show your “best self” if you’re too afraid to let it out? Everyone says to be wary of the recruiters, but what if you weren’t?</p>

<p>I tested the answers to these questions multiple times (sometimes by accident). Turns out conventional wisdom gets you conventional results. But you can do better. Interviewing is a skill and anyone can learn it.</p>

<p>For some reason no one talks about these challenges with interviewing. But I’ve found some principles that help me over and over again:</p>

<p>We’ll cover:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Using recruiters to your advantage</li>
  <li>Going to real interviews for practice</li>
  <li>Being open to learning during interviews</li>
  <li>Keeping those skills sharp even when you’re not job hunting</li>
</ul>



<p>Their voice sounds so friendly and helpful when you chat with them on the phone. “Zain, I’m looking forward to seeing you when you come for your interview!” Clearly it’s all an act, past-me assumed. I was sure they were secretly judging me, deciding if I was good enough to work at the company.</p>

<p>And they do judge. But not in the way I was expecting.</p>

<p>Recruiters aren’t evaluating you technically, not by the time you pick up the phone anyways. Their decision on whether you have the technical chops to be worth interviewing was made well before that call. If you’re being offered an interview: Congratulations, you’ve already passed that bar</p>

<p>Now the recruiter wants to work with you. Their whole job is to, you know, recruit. They know that you statistically have poor interview prep skills, and they’re happy to help fix that flaw. Why discard a strong candidate who can’t interview well? They’ll level the playing field by helping everyone show their best selves when interviewing.</p>

<p><strong>How can you take advantage of this?</strong></p>

<p>Ask them questions! Things like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>“What are the company values that would be good to highlight during the interview?”</li>
  <li>“I’m interested in X, Y, &amp; Z. What other companies are hiring?” (Only try this if the recruiter reached out to you first, they work for a recruiting agency, and you haven’t had your interview yet)</li>
</ul>

<p>And you can be forthright about any problems you run into:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you get sick the day before the interview, call up the recruiter and ask to reschedule. They want to test you when you’re at your best!</li>
  <li>Work pressures left you with no time to prepare? You can still try rescheduling. At worst they’ll say “sorry, we can’t do that”. It will not hurt your chances of getting in</li>
</ul>

<p>Your mad technical skills no longer matter to them. If anything, humility and an openness to learning will show you in the best light.</p>



<p>You need to build up your interview skills. LeetCode is great, but it doesn’t come close to the real thing. Try to interview at actual companies as much as possible. And don’t limit yourself to the companies you care about.</p>

<p><strong>Learn to deal with pressure</strong></p>

<p>When you’re in a real interview the world changes: You’re locked in a cage with a lion. Every heartbeat is a gorilla bashing to break free. Your mental gears gunk up as your body goes into fight or flight mode. Your clammy hands struggle to write half legible code on the white board. A threat hides behind every shadow. Even an innocuous “Would you like something to drink?” is a nefarious test: do I pick coke or coffee?</p>

<p>You only get that experience in a real interview. And only real interviews teach you how to deal with it. The first interview will kick your ass. So will the second. But once you get a few under your belt you’ll get used to the adrenaline rush. Perhaps enjoy it even. You’ll become a bullfighter, confidently facing down the charging bull. That’s how you get over the fear.</p>

<p>You may even find that these practice interviews are much easier! When the stakes are low that lion doesn’t look so fierce. I’ve found that I perform the best in the interviews where I don’t care about the outcome. I’m much more relaxed and at ease. I can think faster, my brain reaches out to more possibilities. Now, even in important interviews I try to convince myself that I don’t really care. That mindset shift is only possible because I got to experience it in the low stakes games first.</p>

<p><strong>Learn to answer the more ambiguous questions</strong></p>

<p>And what about the questions? After each interview write down all the questions you were asked. The same evening look over the questions while they’re still fresh in your mind. Focus especially on ones which have no clear right answer, such as behavioral and design questions. Think about how you could have responded better. Are there stories from your life you could have referenced? Wait a few days and look at them again. You’ll find better answers.</p>

<p>Each answer you prepare this way becomes a blob of paint on your pallet. Chances are high that you’ll come across similar questions in future interviews. Over time you’ll be able to mix the answers from your pallet to paint a picture demonstrating just how valuable an asset you can be to their company.</p>

<p><strong>Stay open to serendipity</strong></p>

<p>As you do these interviews, you may discover that the “practice” company is actually interesting after all. Recruiters count on that. I’ve had recruiters suggest I interview even when I told them I didn’t care for the company. “Maybe you’ll change your mind after seeing us up close”, they’d suggest.</p>

<p>And I did. More than once.</p>



<p>I learned this one by accident, but boy does it pay off.</p>

<p>I was wandering around the booths with my bag full of swag. My eyes caught a pile of rubik’s cubes being given away by some company I’d never heard of. I wanted one! Of course I couldn’t just go up and ask for it directly, so I went and chatted with the guy manning the booth. His name was Vince. A few minutes later I walked away with my prized rubik’s cube in hand. That evening Vince called me up offering to conduct a full interview loop on campus. I already had a job offer from a company I liked, but I thought “Sure, why not? I could use the experience”</p>

<p>I had no intention of joining the company, they were some boring finance business. There was nothing to lose. So during the interview I felt free to ask any question I wanted. When I thought I got the answer to an interview question wrong, I’d ask “I don’t think I did so great here. What’s the right answer to this problem?” (I wanted to learn the answer for future interviews!). When asked a challenging question I could grin and delight in the problem solving aspect instead of worrying about how badly it would reflect on me. (Remember my smart aleck remark in the intro? That was this interview.)</p>

<p>Turns out they liked that: the next day I had a second job offer. At a significantly higher salary than my first one. Oh, and they wanted to fly me to New York in two weeks for an introduction to the company. I still didn’t want to join, but a free trip to New York? Sign me up! The company’s name: Bloomberg</p>

<p>Bloomberg was a practiced hand at recruiting. They had a full two days of events to leave us starry eyed about the company (I came thiiiiis close to accepting their offer). While there, Vince told me I’d made a great impression by fearlessly asking questions, even when I was stumped.</p>

<p>Since then I’ve stopped hesitating before asking any question in an interview. Let your curiosity run free! Don’t cage it! And as an interviewer, I can attest: sincere interest is always a good sign.</p>



<p><a href="https://twitter.com/docjamesw">James Whittaker</a> recommends trying to get a job offer every year, just to make sure you can.</p>

<p>It’s an extremely liberating feeling knowing that even if you lose your job you’ll be able to find another one quickly. That’s a huge stress off your back.</p>

<p>I haven’t been very good about this myself, but every once in a while I’ll accept an invitation from a recruiter (it helps to set up your LinkedIn account). I don’t bother doing any prep for these interviews, at least not initially. Those interviews show me the areas I need to brush up on or where the industry practices are changing.</p>

<p>For example, in a tech screen I did last summer there was some miscommunication and I didn’t realize they expected actual working code. Instead of the usual pseudo code written in a google doc, the interviewer told me to select my language of choice on an online IDE. Now, I don’t have a particular language I consider myself super proficient in. I touch many different tools at work and end up having to use a different language about every 5 months. So even basic things like “create an array” tends to require googling the syntax. Given that, what’s my favorite language of choice? C#, hands down. So I selected that.</p>

<p>What hadn’t occurred to me at the time is that C# is a very verbose language which Visual Studio beautifully automates away the tedious parts of. This online IDE automated nothing. Even for a basic task like creating an array I had to spend precious interview minutes looking up the right package to import and the exact syntax to use. Needless to say, I ran out of time. I crashed and burned there, but it opened my eyes to the way interviews are changing and how I needed to prepare in the future.</p>

<p>Four months later a company called Stripe reached out to me. They also expect you to write working code and even let you use your own IDE. This time I was ready. And …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>In Part 2 of our comparison of Python and go from a Data Engineering perspective, we’ll finally take a look at Apache Beam and Google Dataflow and how the go SDK and the Python SDK differ, what drawbacks we’re dealing with, how fast it is by running extensive benchmarks,and how feasible it is to make the switch.</p><blockquote><p>You can find <a href="https://chollinger.com/blog/2020/06/a-data-engineering-perspective-on-go-vs.-python-part-1/">Part 1 here</a></p></blockquote><h2 id="apache-beam--google-dataflow">Apache Beam &amp; Google Dataflow</h2><p>While we have used <a href="https://beam.apache.org/">Apache Beam</a> on several occasions <a href="https://chollinger.com/blog/2018/06/analyzing-reddits-top-posts-images-with-google-cloud-part-1/#introducing-data-flow">before</a>, allow me to give another short introduction.</p><blockquote><p>Apache Beam is an open source, unified model for defining both batch and streaming data-parallel processing pipelines. Using one of the open source Beam SDKs, you build a program that defines the pipeline. The pipeline is then executed by one of Beam’s supported distributed processing back-ends, which include Apache Flink, Apache Spark, and Google Cloud Dataflow.</p><p><a href="https://beam.apache.org/get-started/beam-overview/">https://beam.apache.org/get-started/beam-overview/</a></p></blockquote><p>Beam can be used for a variety of data use cases, not unlike Apache Spark - ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines, stream analytics, or simple data movement from, for instance, a file system to an RDMBS.</p><h2 id="why-beam-is-interesting">Why Beam is interesting</h2><p>One of the best professional advice I ever got is to ask “So What?". That being said: So what, why do I care about Beam?</p><p>For me, one of the most interesting aspects of Beam’s model is the decoupling of pipeline logic, language, and execution environment. I can design my logic on a piece of paper (i.e., draw a <code>DAG</code> with some <code>Beam</code>-specific terminology - we’ll do that in a second), implement it in any of the major languages - even multiple - and run it on any of the supported <code>Runners</code>.</p><p>The last time we used it on this blog, we used it to write a Pipeline to analyze reddit posts and executed it on the <code>Dataflow</code> runner as such:</p><p><img src="https://chollinger.com/blog/2020/07/a-data-engineering-perspective-on-go-vs.-python-part-2-dataflow/images/dataflow-old.png" alt="dataflow-old.png"></p><p>As this pipeline was written in Python, there is nothing stopping us from running <em>the exact same job</em> on a on-premise Hadoop cluster, on AWS EMR, or just run it locally using the <code>DirectRunner</code>. This level of portability, in combination with a programming model that I happen to find more streamlined than say <code>Spark</code>'s, makes <code>Beam</code> a very interesting framework.</p><p>We’ll actually do exactly that in the example section of this article and design a pipeline, write it in both <code>Python</code> and <code>go</code>, and run it on different <code>Runners</code>.</p><h2 id="core-concepts">Core Concepts</h2><p>Everything in <code>Beam</code> starts with a <code>Pipeline.</code> The <code>Beam</code> programming model works by exposing high-level abstractions through code that allow your <code>Pipeline</code> to execute a graph of <code>PTransforms</code> on a given dataset, which in term is operating on immutable collections, called <code>PCollections</code>, which can be moved to a persistent state through <code>IO</code> operations. Jobs can be executed on different <code>Runners</code> to provide a (distributed) execution environment.</p><p>Let’s dig into those concepts before we look at a real-world example.</p><blockquote><p>This is a condensed version of the <a href="https://beam.apache.org/documentation/programming-guide/">official Apache Beam documentation</a>, which I suggest you read in full for a more in-depth view</p></blockquote><h3 id="pipeline">Pipeline</h3><p>A <code>Pipeline</code> object is the starting point of any job, which is usually initialized with a <code>configuration</code> object that defines <em>how</em> and <em>where</em> your pipeline runs.</p><h3 id="pcollections">PCollections</h3><p>A <code>PCollection</code>, not unlike a Spark <code>RDD</code> or <code>DataFrame</code>, are immutable collections of data that can be modified in-memory through the lifecycle of a pipeline.</p><p>The data within a <code>PCollection</code> can be of any arbitrary type, as long as the elements can be encoded as <code>string</code> for serializing them across the workers.</p><p><code>PCollections</code> can be of any size, but their elements might be worked on by different workers, if the collection is too large to fit into memory on a single worker node.

<h2>The case for cheating</h2>
</p>
</header>
<p>I’m a high school student, and like most students I studied from home for the last 4-ish months. I study in my bedroom which is similar to my future workplace, or maybe it even is. My bedroom is equipped with a computer with an internet connection, same setup as my working parents. Since school is meant to prepare us for our careers, my bedroom seems to be the perfect place to pursue an education.</p>
<p>Not having strict supervision allows for easy cheating. No one will know if you use a dictionary. No one will know if you use a calculator. And no one will know if you collaborate with your peers. This got me thinking. If my bedroom <em>is</em> my workplace <em>and</em> I can cheat so easily, does this mean I get a free ride to being a billionaire?</p>
<p>I don’t believe that is the case. Why not? I have come to the conclusion that cheating at school is nothing like cheating in real life. In fact, this “cheating” thing is actually appreciated by employers. Employers don’t care if you use a calculator or dictionary. Using all available tools to the fullest extent is a positive skill. Furthermore, employers value employees who collaborate and discuss difficult problems with other people.</p>
<p>At school, however, you will likely be disqualified for doing any of those things during a test. Weird, since I’m at school to prepare for my life. And my life just happens to provide all of those tools<sup>1</sup>.</p>
<h2 id="calculators-dictionaries-and-wikipedia">Calculators, dictionaries and Wikipedia</h2>
<p>Why do children spend countless hours doing basic arithmetic, when they will be using a calculator for all serious decisions after they graduate? Seriously, who is going to do taxes from the top of their head when they can easily use a calculator? I’m not advocating to stop teaching children math. On the contrary, I actually do think teaching students <em>why</em> addition exists, <em>what</em> it is and <em>when</em> they should use it are important topics that everyone should know. But I don’t care if they can add up 90234 and 87623 leaving a calculator (phone) in their pocket.</p>
<p>I’m also not advocating to stop teaching languages at school and relying on dictionaries instead. I wouldn’t have been able to write this text if I didn’t know English. But I also believe a dictionary helped me improve this text. It’s a combination of practice and resources that made this text what it is. I’m sure native speakers will find some mistakes, and I would love to know how to improve this text but at least we learned Shakespeare died in 1616.</p>
<p>Everyone has access to almost all of mankind’s knowledge regardless of where they are thanks to websites like Wikipedia. That’s a wonderful thing. This is no excuse, however, to stop education altogether; or humans would have been replaced already. Knowing how to apply something requires context, analytical skills and creativity, things a computer cannot yet do, but we can teach children.</p>
<h2 id="cheating-is-bad">Cheating is bad</h2>
<p>Many people say you only fool yourself by cheating. I agree. Cheating is bad if it will hurt you later on. I don’t believe collaborating will ever hurt me. Nor do I believe using a dictionary will.</p>
<p>“But knowing something is quicker than looking it up.” Absolutely! I wish I knew how to provide first aid in pressing situations. I wish I hadn’t wasted time learning to memorize facts I don’t use. And in the rare event of me needing to know who painted some piece, I have Wikipedia right in my pocket.</p>
<p>It’s not fair to cheat at an exam and earn a certificate tricking people into believing you can do something in isolation, when in fact you cannot. So will I study for that exam? Probably not, but I will make sure I can get things done.</p>
<h2 id="what-school-should-do">What school should do</h2>
<p>Surprisingly, exercises are that impossible to cheat at are, besides the fairest, possibly among the best exercises we can spend time on. Filling out a fancy survey, read exam, may be a way to validate the products in an assembly line, but one would be stupid to believe human qualities can be captured by a number. We shouldn’t test humans the same way we test tools. But most importantly, we are only teaching students facts we know today, and that does not seem to be particularly responsible in a world evolving this rapidly.</p>
<p>An alternative to exams could be asking students to devise something new. After all, how could one cheat at doing something that does not exist yet? Writing a philosophical essay, debating issues in society or writing computer programs seem good places to start. Students should be free to use the tools that are available to professionals in the field, work within common constraints such as deadlines, and above all, be able to collaborate. Using a smart rotation system it would still be possible to extract individual student performance from a shared environment.</p>
<h2 id="final-words">Final words</h2>
<p>Exercises I can cheat at are <em>exercises</em>, for what exactly? I think school should pose exercises I can’t cheat at. If cheating takes time that could be made as a constraint on the exercise. Looking up how to make an argument during a debate won’t sound very convincing. Math requires exact answers and computers often can’t manage that. Fair enough, we will have to do it by hand. There is nothing inherently bad about it.</p>
<p>If I can cheat at something and still get the correct answer or get a project done, I have found a loophole in education. It means education is not prepared for the technological advancements. School today doesn’t really prepare us for the future. Let’s change that.</p>
<hr>
<p><sup>1</sup> I'm not taking the great technology for granted, but I am planning on continuing to enjoy using it.

July 7, 2020 | https://www.lorenzweiss.de/common_mistakes_react_hooks/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.lorenzweiss.de/common_mistakes_react_hooks/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="react-as-a-framework">React as a framework<a href="#react-as-a-framework" aria-label="react as a framework permalink"></a></h2>
<p>React has been out in the world of web development for quite some time now. Its position as a tool for agile web development has steadily strengthened in recent years. Especially after the announcement and release of the <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html#hooks-and-function-components">new hook api/concept</a>, writing components has never been easier.</p>
<p>Although the team behind react and the huge community have tried to train and explain the concepts of the framework in an impressive way, I still see some pitfalls and common mistakes that were made while working with it.
I kept a list of all the mistakes I saw over the last years related to react especially with using hooks. In this article I want to show you the most common ones. I will also try to explain in detail, why I think they are mistakes and a suggestion for doing it in a cleaner way.</p>
<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
<p>Before we start with the list, I have to say that most of the following things are not fundamental mistakes or don't look wrong at first glance. Most of them are unlikely to affect the performance or apperance of the application.
Probably nobody would notice, except for the developers working on the product, that something is wrong here, but I still believe that good quality code can lead to a better developer experience and thus to a better product.</p>
<p>As with any software framework or library, there are millions of different opinions about it. Everything you see here is based on my personal opinion and should not be considered a general rule.
If you have a different opinion about her, I would love to hear it 🌟</p>
<h2 id="1-using-usestate-when-no-rerender-is-needed">1. Using useState when no rerender is needed<a href="#1-using-usestate-when-no-rerender-is-needed" aria-label="1 using usestate when no rerender is needed permalink"></a></h2>
<p>One of the core concepts of react is dealing with state. You can control your entire data flow and rendering through state. Each time the tree is rendered again, it is most likely tied to a change in state.</p>
<p>With the <code>useState</code> hook you can now also define your state in function components. Which is a really neat and easy way how to handle states in react. But it can also be misused as we see in the following example.</p>
<p>For the next example we need a bit of explanation, suppose we have two buttons, one button is a counter and the other button sends a request or triggers an action with the current count. However, the current number is never displayed within the component. It is only required for the request when you click the second button.</p>
<h3>This is dangerous ❌</h3>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>ClickButton</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>count<span>,</span> setCount<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>const</span> <span>onClickCount</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>setCount</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>c</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> c <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>;</span>

  <span>const</span> <span>onClickRequest</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>apiCall</span><span>(</span>count<span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
      </span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>button</span> <span>onClick</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>onClickCount<span>}</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>Counter</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>button</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>

<h3>The problem ⚡</h3>
<p>At first sight, you might ask what exactly is the problem with that? Isn't that what state was made for?
Sure you are right, this will work just fine and probably there will never be a problem with that. However in react every state change will force a rerender for that component and most likely its children. But in the above example since we never use that state in our render part, this will end up being an unnecessary render every time we set the counter, which can impact the performance or could have unexpected side effects.</p>
<h3>The solution ✅</h3>
<p>If you want to use a variable inside your component which should keep its value between rendering but also don't force a rerender, you can use the <code>useRef</code> hook. It will keep the value, but doesn't force the component to rerender.</p>

<p>This might be a very easy and obvious one and not really related to react itself, but I still see it quite a lot when people writing react components.</p>
<p>Let's say you will write a button and with clicking the button the user should be redirected to another page. Since its a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application">SPA</a>, this action will be a client-side routing mechanism. So you will need some kind of library for doing that.
In react the most popular one is <a href="https://reacttraining.com/react-router/">react-router</a> and the following example will use that library.</p>
<p>So adding a click listener will redirect the user to the desired page right?</p>
<h3>This is dangerous ❌</h3>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>ClickButton</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> history <span>=</span> <span>useHistory</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>const</span> <span>onClick</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    history<span>.</span><span>push</span><span>(</span><span>'/next-page'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>button</span> <span>onClick</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>onClick<span>}</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>Go to next page</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>button</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h3>The problem ⚡</h3>
<p>Even though this would work just fine for most of the users, there is a huge problem when it comes to accessibility here. The button will not be marked as linking to another page at all, which makes it nearly impossible to be identified by screen readers.
Also could you open that in a new tab or window? Most likely not.</p>
<h3>The solution ✅</h3>
<p>Linking to other pages with any user interaction should, where possible, be handled by the <code>&lt;Link&gt;</code> component or a normal <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag.</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>ClickButton</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>Link</span></span> <span>to</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>/next-page<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
      </span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>span</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>Go to next page</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>span</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
    </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span><span>Link</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p><strong>Bonus points:</strong> it also makes the code a lot more readable and shorter!</p>
<h2 id="3-handling-actions-via-useeffect">3. Handling actions via useEffect<a href="#3-handling-actions-via-useeffect" aria-label="3 handling actions via useeffect permalink"></a></h2>
<p>One of the best and most thoughtful hooks introduced by React is the "useEffect" hook. It enables the processing of actions related to <code>prop</code> or <code>state</code> changes.
Despite its helpful functionality, it is also often used in places where it may not be needed.</p>
<p>Imagine a component that fetches a list of items and render them to the dom. In addition, if the request is successful, we would like to call the "onSuccess" function, which is passed on to the component as a prop.</p>
<h3>This is dangerous ❌</h3>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>DataList</span><span>(</span><span><span>{</span> onSuccess <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>loading<span>,</span> setLoading<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>false</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h3>The problem ⚡</h3>
<p>There are two <code>useEffect</code> hooks, the first one is handling the api call on the initial render and the second one will call the <code>onSuccess</code> function, by assuming when there is no loading, no error, but data in the state, it must have been a successful call. Makes sense right?</p>
<p>Sure for the first call this is true and probably will never fail. But you also loose the direct connection between the action and the function that needs to be called. There is no guarantee that this case will only happen if the fetch action has succeeded and this is something we as developers really don't like.</p>
<h3>The solution ✅</h3>
<p>A straight forward solution would be to set the "onSuccess" function to the actual place where the call was successful:</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>DataList</span><span>(</span><span><span>{</span> onSuccess <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>loading<span>,</span> setLoading<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>false</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>error<span>,</span> setError<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>null</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>data<span>,</span> setData<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>null</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>const</span> <span>fetchData</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>setLoading</span><span>(</span><span>true</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>callApi</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
      <span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>fetchedData</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>setData</span><span>(</span>fetchedData<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>        <span>onSuccess</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span>      <span>}</span><span>)</span>
      <span>.</span><span>catch</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>err</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>setError</span><span>(</span>err<span>)</span><span>)</span>
      <span>.</span><span>finally</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>setLoading</span><span>(</span><span>false</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>;</span>

  <span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fetchData</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>{</span>data<span>}</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now it is quite clear at first sight when the onSuccess is called, exactly in the success case of the api call.</p>
<h2 id="4-single-responsibility-components">4. Single responsibility components<a href="#4-single-responsibility-components" aria-label="4 single responsibility components permalink"></a></h2>
<p>Composing components can be hard.
When is it time to split a component into several smaller components?
How do you structure the component tree?
All of these questions arise every day when working with a component-based framework.
However, a common mistake in designing your components is to combine two use cases into a single component.
Let's take an example of a header that shows either a burger button on mobile devices or tabs on desktop screens. (The condition will be handled the the magical <code>isMobile</code> function, which is not part of this example 🧙‍)</p>
<h3>This is dangerous ❌</h3>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>Header</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>header</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
      </span><span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>HeaderInner</span></span> <span>menuItems</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>menuItems<span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span><span>
    </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>header</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>function</span> <span>HeaderInner</span><span>(</span><span><span>{</span> menuItems <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>isMobile</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>?</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>BurgerButton</span></span> <span>menuItems</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>menuItems<span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span> <span>:</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>Tabs</span></span> <span>tabData</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>menuItems<span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h3>The problem ⚡</h3>
<p>With this approach the component HeaderInner is trying to be two different things at once and we all learned from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_Case_of_Dr_Jekyll_and_Mr_Hyde">Mr. Jekyll</a>, being more than one thing at a time isn't really ideal.
Also it makes it even harder to test or to reuse the component in other places.</p>
<h3>The solution ✅</h3>
<p>Bringing the condition one level up, makes it easier to see what the components are made for and that they only have one responsibility, being a <code>Header</code>, <code>Tabs</code> or a <code>BurgerButton</code> and not trying to be two things at once.</p>
<div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>Header</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>header</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>{</span><span>isMobile</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>?</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>BurgerButton</span></span> <span>menuItems</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>menuItems<span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span> <span>:</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>Tabs</span></span> <span>tabData</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>menuItems<span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span><span>}</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>header</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="5-single-responsibility-useeffects">5. Single responsibility useEffects<a href="#5-single-responsibility-useeffects" aria-label="5 single responsibility useeffects permalink"></a></h2>
<p>Remember the times when we only had the <code>componentWillReceiveProps</code> or <code>componentDidUpdate</code> methods to hook into the rendering process of a react component? It is bringing back dark memories and also realizing the beauty of using the <code>useEffect</code> hook and especially that you can have as much as you want of them.</p>
<p>But sometimes forgetting and using a "useEffect" for several things brings back those dark memories. For example, imagine you have a component that fetches some data from the backend in some way, and also displays breadcrumbs depending on the current location. (Using again <a href="https://reacttraining.com/react-router/">react-router</a> for getting the current location.)</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>For some weird reason I’ve decided to abandon my insane ZShell
setup for a while and switch to a vanilla Bash. Guess I needed a bit of simplicity in my life.
One thing about my initial Bash experience that drove me nuts is the way it handles the
history out-of-the-box:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Each shell session has its own history and once you terminate a session it history
is dumped to <code>.bash_history</code>, overwriting whatever was there in the past. For me this pretty much kills the value of
persistent shell history. Note that if you
don’t exit cleanly your history will just be lost.</li>
  <li>As a corollary - you can’t really share history between different shell sessions. Each shell loads the history file on startup
and augments it whatever commands were executed in it, after loading the file. If you ran a build command in shell A you can’t
easily recall it in shell B.</li>
  <li>It keeps duplicated entries in the history.</li>
  <li>By default it doesn’t store many history entries (only the last 500 commands).</li>
</ul>

<p>Obviously there’s no right way to do shell history and what you consider right or optimal depends on how exactly are using your shell.
I know many people who hate sharing data between shell sessions, as they want to keep them isolated for various reason.</p>

<p>On the other hand - I don’t know a single person who likes their shell history to be constantly overwritten.
Let’s teach Bash to append to the history file instead
of overwriting it! Just add the following to your <code>.bashrc</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># append to the history file, don't overwrite it</span>
<span>shopt</span> <span>-s</span> histappend
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note that some Linux distros (e.g. Ubuntu) might be enabling this shell option
in the default <code>.bashrc</code> they copy to each user’s home folder.</p>

<p>Now, let’s increase the history size and teach Bash to ignore duplicate entries in the history:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># don't put duplicate lines or lines starting with space in the history.</span>
<span># See bash(1) for more options</span>
<span>HISTCONTROL</span><span>=</span>ignoreboth

<span># for setting history length see HISTSIZE and HISTFILESIZE in bash(1)</span>
<span>HISTSIZE</span><span>=</span>100000
<span>HISTFILESIZE</span><span>=</span>10000000
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can obviously go really big here, but unless you have a very fast SSD I would not recommend
it, as reading the history can add a bit of latency to new shell sessions.</p>

<p>Now, we’re moving to the crux of it - let’s teach Bash to update the history after each
command we invoke and to reload it. The reloading is what ensures that different shell
sessions are synced in terms of history.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># append and reload the history after each command</span>
<span>PROMPT_COMMAND</span><span>=</span><span>"history -a; history -n"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>history -a</code> writes to the history file and <code>history -n</code> reloads the history from the file, but with a twist - it loads only the new entries that were added there. This makes it way more efficient
than another similar (and quite popular) approach - namely using <code>history -a; history -c; history -r</code>. Full
reloads of a huge history file would exhibit themselves as slight delays after each command you run. The solution I’ve
suggested should largely avoid them.</p>

<p>You might also want to remove the use of certain commands from your history, whether for privacy or readability reasons. This can be done with the <code>$HISTIGNORE</code> variable. It’s common to use this to exclude <code>ls</code> (and similar) calls, job control built-ins like <code>bg</code> and <code>fg</code>, and calls to <code>history</code> itself:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>HISTIGNORE</span><span>=</span><span>'ls:ll:cd:pwd:bg:fg:history'</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Feel free to add here any other commands that you don’t want to store in the history.
Note that here you’re specifying exact matches for exclusion - the above config would
exclude <code>ls</code>, but it won’t exclude <code>ls projects</code>. Most of the time you’d be using this
with commands invoked without arguments.</p>

<p>So, putting it all together, that’s my magic recipe to supercharge Bash’s history:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># place this in your .bashrc</span>

<span># don't put duplicate lines or lines starting with space in the history.</span>
<span># See bash(1) for more options</span>
<span>HISTCONTROL</span><span>=</span>ignoreboth

<span># append to the history file, don't overwrite it</span>
<span>shopt</span> <span>-s</span> histappend
<span># append and reload the history after each command</span>
<span>PROMPT_COMMAND</span><span>=</span><span>"history -a; history -n"</span>

<span># ignore certain commands from the history</span>
<span>HISTIGNORE</span><span>=</span><span>"ls:ll:cd:pwd:bg:fg:history"</span>

<span># for setting history length see HISTSIZE and HISTFILESIZE in bash(1)</span>
<span>HISTSIZE</span><span>=</span>100000
<span>HISTFILESIZE</span><span>=</span>10000000
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That’s all I have for you today! Keep hacking!</p>

July 7, 2020 | https://www.blameless.com/blog/benefits-of-cloud-infrastructure | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.blameless.com/blog/benefits-of-cloud-infrastructure">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>CEO Ashar Rizqi had the pleasure of being a guest on Google Cloud OnAir, a Google Cloud Customer Interview Series. Ashar and interviewer Jimmy Sopko discussed how Blameless has extended our runway using Google Cloud and Google Kubernetes Engine and how the team cultivates a culture of site reliability in a changing world.</p><h3>TL;DR</h3><ul role="list"><li><strong>Leaning in to a cloud native strategy: </strong>Software is eating the world and industries are being disrupted. Underneath it all, modern applications have completely changed. It's creating complex interdependencies between these different modules, especially when you're running inside in a hybrid environment. So it really comes down to managing complexity. At the same time, user expectations are increasing exponentially around security, reliability, performance, and availability. But what's not changing is your production resources, such as the people that you have available. You need to have infrastructure on which you run your applications. There needs to be a way in which you deploy those applications, test those applications, monitor them, operate them, roll things back when needed, and manage change at an increasingly rapid pace. Historically, what used to happen is you had specialized teams, which are very expensive, managing infrastructure. That's money and resources that can go towards the core of your business and product innovations. You don't need to go solve the same problems again and again. Cloud native is a must-have in today's day and age to be able to do anything at the speed and scale at which users are expecting today. You just can't exist without it.</li><li><strong>Cloud versus building in house:</strong> The best thing that you can do for your company is to say no to certain things. It elevates your credibility, and it shows focus and commitment to a real problem. For Blameless specifically, when my co-founder and I started, we were fortunate enough to raise some venture money, but it's limited. It's there for a certain period of time and every dollar counts. It takes energy, but you have to think about, “Where's my investment going to yield the highest ROI?”. In the earliest days of the company, it’s about getting product-market fit quickly as quickly as possible, and that requires rapid experimentation. It's a question of how do you move very, very quickly, but still build for this enterprise. That was the guiding principle for us. Making our platform secure and meeting base-level compliance requirements was very important. And what that means is that you're not moving as quickly now that you have limited engineering and product resources. That's effort that's not going to the product.</li><li><strong>Advice to other startups:</strong> The key is SaaS economics. You have to break SaaS economics down into its constituent parts and look at each one of those things very, very closely. For example, our architecture was single-tenant. That’s expensive. So we prioritized this re-architecture effort that we've been planning for two or three quarters to move to multi-tenancy and optimize our spend and consolidate across instead of running in multiple cloud providers. The other thing is, you really have to go back and look at your head count and operating plan to make sure that you're questioning every single one of those. We did a lot of scenario planning on our side. We went back and we looked at essentials; do we want to cut down to the muscle, to the bone? Where do we want to draw the line? The number one thing is that you have to move quickly and you have to make decisions. No decision is likely to be the one that kills you. Not taking any kind of action is really the thing that's going to hurt the most.<br></li></ul><p>See the full transcript of their conversation below, which has been lightly edited for length and clarity. To download the full recording, check it out <a href="https://www.blameless.com/resources/google-cloud-onair-ashar-rizqi">here</a>.</p><p>‍<br></p><p><strong>Jimmy Sopko: Can you tell me a little bit about yourself, your background and what Blameless does as a business.</strong><br></p><p><strong>Ashar Rizqi: </strong>I'm an immigrant. I grew up in the Middle East, and moved to the United States in about 2006 for my undergrad degree in electrical engineering from Texas A&amp;M. After graduating, my first job out of college was working as assistant admin at Fidelity Investments in financial services. And quite frankly, that wasn't really the career path that I wanted to go down, but it was really what was available to someone that's an immigrant, trying to get a job in a post-recession economy that's just trying to recover.&nbsp;<br></p><p>I really wanted to do more things in the semiconductor space because I felt that was real engineering; hardware engineering and all this software stuff was just too fluffy for me.&nbsp;</p><p>The rest is really history. I worked in traditional enterprise IT as a sysadmin for a couple of years, then worked out of a data center. I was very fortunate to see a mix between legacy practices and some of the new DevOps practices coming in. Then the next two roles for me were working at fast growing companies like Box and MuleSoft, and seeing them through some major financing milestones like IPOs. I saw how the sausage gets made from an infrastructure standpoint and was in a SRE role and a platform role in both those companies. Through those experiences I met my co-founder, Lyon, and we decided to start a company because of these macro-level trends that we saw around Blameless.<br></p><p><strong>Jimmy Sopko:</strong> <strong>I always find it fascinating how founders use their different experiences to come up with the concept and eventually the business plan and actual business. But one thing that's always really sparked my interest with Blameless is the name.</strong> <strong>So where did that company name originate?</strong></p><p><strong>Ashar Rizqi:</strong> Credit for the term Blameless; it's been taught prior in literature by folks like John Allspaw and others. But in one experience I saw how having a culture of blamelessness really allows you to move quickly and create this culture of taking risks and making mistakes. The most important aspect of making mistakes is always making sure that you're learning from them. That's really what our mission is at Blameless: to move teams to a culture of resilience. SRE practices and principles are really core to that. It's been around for over a decade, and what we've done is we've created a platform that operationalizes those SRE principles and practices. If a company starts to adopt these practices, they inherently start operating as a blameless culture.</p><blockquote>The most important aspect of making mistakes is always making sure that you're learning from them. That's really what our mission is at Blameless: to move teams to a culture of resilience. SRE practices and principles are really core to that.</blockquote><p><strong>Jimmy Sopko: With that in mind, how did that influence your cloud native strategy as you were starting Blameless and up to now?</strong></p><p><strong>Ashar Rizqi: </strong>It's all about looking at the macro perspective. There's this worldwide trend where software is eating the world and industries are being disrupted, and that's creating this need to move fast and provide fast, reliable experiences. But the challenge is that underneath it all, modern applications have completely changed. And the way that they're built and architected and operated is constantly changing. It's creating complex interdependencies between these different modules, especially when you're running inside in a hybrid environment. So it really comes down to managing complexity. The nature of a complex system is that it's always in a continuous state of brownout, where you can’t get complete visibility into what’s happening, so it's all about your ability to respond and fix issues quickly and prevent those issues from happening in the same place.</p><blockquote>Modern applications have completely changed.

You're not going to be able to hire 3000 SREs tomorrow the way a company like Google does it. They're very fortunate to be able to do that. But if you're just a startup, you're just working with very limited resources, but the expectation your users have is the same expectation that they have from a company like Google, which provides phenomenal uptime and availability. So how do you actually get there?</p><p>Being cloud native is actually a very, very core part of that because you need to have infrastructure on which you run your applications. There needs to be a way in which you deploy those applications, test those applications, monitor them, operate them, roll things back when needed, and manage change at an increasingly rapid pace. As a small company like Blameless, we don't have to worry as much about security&nbsp; or compliance; we can just sign a VA with one of these infrastructure providers and get 30%, 40% of the work required for HIPAA.</p><p>For example, if we're trying to go after healthcare, the underlying cloud companies already have a lot of that built in.

<p>It was a frigid cold day in Des Moines on January 28, 2019.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Like most January days, I was just hoping to hold on a few more weeks until the early signs of Spring would start to thaw things out and give me that yearly boost of energy.</p>



<p>But, it turned out that I was going to get a different kind of jolt.</p>



<p>“<a href="https://www.hellosign.com/blog/a-letter-from-our-ceo-were-joining-dropbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Dropbox Acquires HelloSign for $230mm (opens in a new tab)">Dropbox Acquires HelloSign for $230mm</a>,” the headline read in my push notifications.<br></p>



<p>I stared at it for a long time.</p>



<p>A combination of shock and elation took hold as I bounded out of bed.<br></p>



<p>HelloSign and Optimist had been working together for nearly two years at this point. But I had no idea that the acquisition was in play. The whole deal has been basically kept under wraps. Most of the team only found out about it right before it was finalized.<br></p>



<p>It was a momentous achievement for their team.<br></p>



<p>When we first started working with HelloSign, they had just raised their Series A and were on a path to rapidly expand their eSignature solution, roll out HelloWorks, and move upmarket with HelloSign integrations and API.<br></p>



<p>There was a lot to do and a lot of content and strategy to figure out.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><em>We had our work cut out for us.</em><br></p>



<p>Luckily, our team and the HelloSign team are both full of outrageously smart people. We dug in and put together a strategy.<br></p>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/IcibgJc6j5tpYXEm_m_ik9W_YNLIIrvzZmHTBHmriqbihYkO2NXDz9SogzmE-H203ML1Ju0uP7cRPqUx1tfIZVWA1m96_8xdxPLSvlIP7m05Ej7q9o3kuaEoE_oESJVNPETObhOq" alt="HelloSign's Organic Traffic Growth (October 2017 to January 2019)"></figure>



<p>Over the previous 17 months (and to this day), we worked closely with the HelloSign team to drive 1,308% growth in targeted organic traffic. This growth correlated almost perfectly with the growth of their business and the acquisition that took place in January.<br></p>



<p>Through this process and in working with many other SaaS companies over the years, we have developed and refined some key strategies and tactics that we use to drive growth for all of our clients and other SaaS businesses in particular.<br></p>



<p>From that, we’ve distilled those strategies into a core framework that defines how we achieve specific results and reach key goals.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>This article is about that framework.</p>



<h2>Content Marketing for SaaS: Driving User Signups</h2>



<p>Nearly all SaaS companies have pretty straightforward goals for their content marketing:<br></p>



<ol><li>Drive product sign-ups and trials</li><li>Everything else. (Traffic, brand awareness,&nbsp;leads, emails, etc)</li></ol>



<p>HelloSign is no different.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Although they have a number of market focuses and products that were in play, the ultimate business objective of our work together was–unsurprisingly–to grow users.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>So, that’s what we set out to do.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>The question, of course, is how you use content as a lever for both capturing the right audience, convincing them of the value of the product, and ultimately converting them into customers.<br></p>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/NE0svR6j4qHgtXc2V0wxw-XR_jXTW2e6L1PcoXncPqUFLJJf-5yorAWPbmSo7GTA0rQ1AVPBM5L13O3khI7G6SyuyCWMJdKTaxAHrwyqa1jQ8A24fTUK7JHuZ6iz4crHUrOTLlkI" alt=""></figure>



<p>In most instances, these goals feel at odds with one another. The content that is most valuable to you as a business (most product-focused) is often less valuable to a reader who is trying to learn about a topic or solve a problem broadly.<br></p>



<p>As with most content marketing frameworks, we find that the key is to unpack the specific moving parts and build a strategy that addresses each specific goal as part of a broader strategy.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>In other words, break it down and solve for each piece independently. Then pull everything together into a cohesive framework.</p>



<h2>The SaaS Content Funnel Paradox</h2>



<p>Most SaaS product signups (trials, leads, etc) come from the middle of the funnel.<br></p>



<p>In other words, a prospect has researched their problem, discovered a general solution, and they begin researching products that offer it. In most cases, few prospects read content that’s at the top of the funnel and immediately hop into a product–it’s rare.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>This means that in order for a SaaS content marketing strategy to be successful, you need to put a lot of emphasis on driving solution-aware traffic to content and pages that are in the middle of the funnel.<br></p>



<p><em>But there’s a challenge</em>.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>The pages on your site that are most relevant to a middle-of-the-funnel searcher are your core product pages–features, integrations, solutions, etc.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>These are notoriously difficult pages to rank (especially in a crowded market like esignatures) because there are very few ways for them to naturally accrue links or promote such product-focused content directly to a prospect.&nbsp;<br></p>



<figure><img src="https://mk0yesoptimist0enhkg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/HS-case-study-screenshots-05-1024x544-1.png" alt="HelloSign's Product Marketing site is full of targeted landing pages" srcset="https://mk0yesoptimist0enhkg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/HS-case-study-screenshots-05-1024x544-1.png 1024w, https://mk0yesoptimist0enhkg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/HS-case-study-screenshots-05-1024x544-1-980x521.png 980w, https://mk0yesoptimist0enhkg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/HS-case-study-screenshots-05-1024x544-1-480x255.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw"></figure>



<p>This creates a paradox.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>The pages that you care most about ranking and generating traffic to are also, often, the most difficult to rank and drive traffic to.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>So, how do you overcome this obstacle, resolve the paradox, and restore order to the universe? (Okay, maybe just that first part.)<br></p>



<p>The solution is to <a href="http://yesoptimist.com/frameworks">create a framework</a> that leverages <em>top of the funnel content</em> as a means to generate not just traffic, but also links (domain and topical authority) that helps these important pages rank over time.<br></p>



<p>This has become the basis for our work with most SaaS clients.</p>



<h2>The Optimist SaaS Content Marketing Framework</h2>



<p>Before we get into the specifics of how we executed this strategy, I want to reveal the framework that we use to shape our thinking and our approach.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>This framework builds on our trifecta strategy that we originally developed from my work scaling College Raptor from <a href="https://www.yesoptimist.com/content-marketing-seo-case-study-the-trifecta-strategy/">0 to 100,000 organic searches/mo</a>.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>But, given the specific nuances of the SaaS business model and the extended B2B buyer’s journey, it’s not a simple cut-and-paste process.&nbsp;<br></p>



<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/JdENWX5eN_LOMVx2I778zGXks82Eu5MkC92ktCgboJrcur7JAo8f4fL_h--FFGUsYwsffYMq9_RderLzTycXIEcGwE4gZKm9WyTrHe2w27jUojSYaRNlB8-e_WwMoQj5rkKBiHG0" alt=""></figure>



<p>The framework that we developed integrates key insights about how buyers interact with SaaS businesses and which strategies are most effective for driving actual conversions.<br></p>



<p>For our work with HelloSign, we applied a framework similar to this. Ultimately, we’ve found that most SaaS businesses have similar goals and thus, the overall approach to content marketing is a variation of this general framework.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>It’s not one-size-fits-all, but it’s about as close as you can get when you’re talking about true strategy.<br></p>



<p>Let’s step through all of the types of content that were part of HelloSign’s massive growth.</p>



<h2>Pre-Funnel Content: Targeting the Right Buyers</h2>



<p>Before we dive into the actual funnel and the buyer’s journey, I want to begin with what we call pre-funnel or persona-qualified content.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Although it’s often at least one step removed from a buying cycle, pre-funnel content can serve an important supporting role in a SaaS content marketing strategy. The idea here is to create content that attracts your target buyer <em>broadly</em>, even if they aren’t problem-aware.<br></p>



<figure><img src="https://mk0yesoptimist0enhkg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/HS-case-study-screenshots-06-1024x544.png" alt="Thought leadership content attracts relevant buyers, even if they are pre-funnel." srcset="https://mk0yesoptimist0enhkg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/HS-case-study-screenshots-06-1024x544.png 1024w, https://mk0yesoptimist0enhkg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/HS-case-study-screenshots-06-980x521.png 980w, https://mk0yesoptimist0enhkg.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/HS-case-study-screenshots-06-480x255.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw"></figure>



<p>Case in point: HelloSign speaks a lot to sales leaders in their content. We created a lot of content that was aimed at generally helping this persona do their job better, even if that didn’t involve using HelloSign’s products to do it.<br></p>



<p>This allows us to accomplish a number of things:&nbsp;<br></p>



<ol><li>Expand search/social footprint</li><li>Build brand awareness and familiarity with our target personas</li><li>Drive retargeting and email marketing</li></ol>



<p>But, keep in mind that this content, while valuable if used strategically, can also be a distraction from the key objective. It rarely leads to a product conversion.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Don’t let it become the center of your approach unless you have already built out every other part of the funnel in full.</p>



<h2>Top of the Funnel Content: Helping Prospects Solve Problems</h2>



<p>The top of the funnel is often misunderstood in the world of content marketing generally and SaaS, especially.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Our take is simple: <em>The top of the funnel starts when a buyer begins to actively learn about or seek a solution to problem that could lead to a purchase.</em><br></p>



<p>In the world of HelloSign, we see this as the pain point that the user is looking to solve that <em>could </em>ultimately lead to a product conversion.<br></p>



<p>If the buyer is a VP of Sales or Sales Operations Director, then they may begin their journey by looking to accelerate their sales cycle–cut down the days between contract and close.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><em>One solution to this problem is to implement esignatures.</em><br></p>



<p>So, from a content perspective, we target this initial need as an opportunity to capture the buyer at the point where they are looking for solutions to a problem. In my <a href="https://www.yesoptimist.com/saas-seo-strategy/">post about SaaS SEO</a>, I talked about our process of using a JTBD framework to identify and map these specific pain points to key product use cases and features.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Within the top of the funnel content, we break down our content strategy into <a href="http://yesoptimist.com/100k">3 key types of content that each serve a specific purpose</a>. I’ve outlined this approach before, but it allows us to get very specific and tactical while staying strategic in our content planning and creation.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>1. Social-viral content (Thought leadership)</h3>



<p>For HelloSign, what we pursue as social-viral content is strong thought leadership content that’s likely to generate a lot of shares and buzz around a particular topic.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>What we have found is that the more of a strong stance we are willing to take topics related to work, culture, and operations, the more reaction we generate among our target readers. Of course, this approach can be polarizing as well.<br></p>



<p>The key to our approach here is to be thoughtful about where we plant a flag.<br></p>



<p>Knowing that readers who align with specific thinking are most likely to become users and customers, we can draw a line in the sand to help attract like-minded buyers who feel strongly about the nature of work and productivity.&nbsp;<br></p>

<p>Keep in mind that the search (SEO) opportunity for this content may not be enormous.<br></p>



<p>That’s okay.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>The role of this content is to reach prospects through channels other than search; social and community channels. We want to generate a buzz and demand based on the content and drive problem awareness. That means that this topics often have a short shelf life.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>They’re perennial rather than evergreen. We can circle back to them every few months or every year and use them to drive traffic through key channels.</p>



<h3>2. Evergreen content</h3>



<p>The meat and potatoes of our SaaS content marketing framework–the workhorse–is evergreen content.<br></p>

        <p>As a software architect, it’s easy to get lost in technicalities, design patterns and implementation details. This often leads to your vision of the whole being blurred and obfuscated by building blocks that don’t really correlate with the system you are trying to design. Understanding that the whole is other than the sum of its parts, as Kurt Koffka once said, deeply affects our perception of the function imposed on those parts. If the whole is independent and has its own meaning, then what is the purpose of each one of those parts? None. They are meaningless, merely means to an end.</p>

<p>You can see where i’m going with this: a Factory, a Builder, a Strategy, they are nothing without the whole. And the whole has a purpose of its own, tied to the domain of our solution. Therefore, the purpose of the whole should never be tied to the intricacies of its parts. In <a href="http://a.co/7xaidXJ">Domain-Driven Design</a>, Eric Evans introduces the term <em>ubiquitous language</em>, which is a common language between developers and users of a software, tied to its domain model. In order to achieve a good architecture, your whole should be able to communicate it’s meaning using this same language. And so does the parts.</p>

<p>In the early 1910s, Kurt Koffka worked with Wolfgang Köhler and Max Wertheimer on several theories that formed the Gestalt psychology, which attempts to understand how humans visually perceive the world surrounding them and describes how they tend to organize visual elements into wholes. When learning the psychology of design and essential concepts such as space, balance and visual hierarchy, i also learned the principles of Gestalt. Rudolf Arnheim, in <a href="http://a.co/7Tg0pOz">his excellent book</a>, explains in great detail the principles of similarity, proximity, continuity, closure and ground symmetry.</p>

<p>I highly recommend you to take some time and read more about design psychology and, specifically, Arnheim’s book. But for now, i want to focus on the principle of similarity:</p>

<p><img src="http://klaussilveira.com/assets/gestalt.jpg" alt="Similarity"></p>

<p>You see the triangle. But the triangle does not exist, only three pacman-like structures. The structures are meaningless, but what they compose has an enormous complexity of its own. And this is what makes great software architecture: a software application is not just the sum of each of it’s components, it’s something else, independent, with a purpose of it’s own. And it is your responsibility, as a software architect, to find this purpose.</p>

<p>This is what i call unified perceptual modeling: bound by the rules of the language of your domain, you must model your application using several components, yet always through the perspective of the whole. If you don’t see the whole and its purpose, you will never achieve consistency.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>A while ago I wrote <a href="http://metaredux.com/posts/2018/10/27/a-safer-rubocop.html">an article</a> about our recent efforts to make RuboCop safer
in terms of the code changes that it suggests and performs in auto-correct mode.
Today I’ll follow up with a small update on the latest developments in that area.</p>

<p>In preparation for the long-awaited RuboCop 1.0, RuboCop’s team spent a lot of time
recently adding auto-correction to more cops, polishing the internal auto-correction logic,
and marking cops with unsafe auto-correction accordingly. Recently we reached another
important milestone in our quest for safety - we’ve made safe auto-correct the default behavior
of RuboCop! The change essentially makes <code>--auto-correct</code> and <code>--safe-auto-correct</code> the same.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<pre><code>$ rubocop -a
# or
$ rubocop --auto-correct
# or
$ rubocop --safe-auto-correct # deprecated
</code></pre>

<p>I guess you might be wondering can you still have RuboCop run every possible auto-correction.
Yes, you can!</p>

<pre><code>$ rubocop -A
# or
$ rubocop --auto-correct-all
</code></pre>

<p>I think that’s pretty simple - a bigger A means more epic (and more dangerous) auto-corrections. :-)
<a href="https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop/releases/tag/v0.87.0">RuboCop 0.87</a> was released yesterday with these changes. I hope you’ll enjoy them!</p>

<p>I hope the rationale behind this is clear - a lot of people would run auto-correct in bulk and would get surprised that RuboCop made
(some) code changes that are not 100% compatible with the original code. We obviously want to limit such unpleasant surprises.
Originally I was optimistic that most people would be fine with the occasional small breakage here and there, given the overall
savings they’d get from the auto-corrections, but the feedback me and our team got over the years made me reconsider my
stance of the default behavior.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>In general I’ve always felt it’s a bad idea to run all the auto-corrections possible, especially on a big codebase.
Likely you’ll immediately notice some problems, but you might have trouble finding where did they come from and which
correction caused them. That’s why my recipe for (unsafe) auto-corrections has always been less ambitious:</p>

<pre><code># Run auto-correction for a cop at a time
$ rubocop --auto-correct --only Some/Cop
# Review carefully the diff
# Run the specs/unit tests
$ rspec
# All is green. Let's ship it!
# Moving forward with the next cop...
</code></pre>

<p>I encourage more people to operate in this incremental manner, as it makes it much easier to deal with unsafe corrections, which
despite their name work pretty well most of the time, but still require a bit of supervision from a human.</p>

<p>That’s all I have for you today. Keep hacking!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


<p>22 June 2020</p>
<p>I was working on a project that required me pulling up the developer tools in different browsers against my personal website when I opened up Safari and noticed how drastically different the title of my page was rendering. It was extremely bold in Safari compared to the other browsers.</p>
<p>Much more bold than I expected it to be.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/img/browser-fonts/browser-fonts.png" alt="alt: Font rendering in, from top to bottom, Safari. Edge and Firefox"></p>
<p>I looked at my stylesheet and saw that I had applied minimal styling to my headings and recall a decision to just let the browser handle the heading styles apart from defining the <code>font-family</code> and <code>font-sizes</code>. So the difference in weight was be caused by the browser.</p>
<p><code>h1</code> tags are bold by default but there appears to be extra bold being applied by Safari.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/jpamental">Jason Pamental</a> suggested using <code>font-synthesis: none;</code> but that didn't have any effect in Safari or Firefox (it's not supported in other browsers at the moment.)</p>
<h2 id="computed-styles">Computed Styles <a href="#computed-styles">#</a></h2>
<p>I started to dissect differences between the user agent style sheet and the Computed Styles tab in the DevTools.</p>
<p>Safari User agent stylesheet:</p>
<pre><code>h1 {
  font-weight: bold;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Safari computed CSS properties</p>
<pre><code>h1 {
  font-weight: bold;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Edge, Chrome and Firefox user agent stylesheet:</p>
<pre><code>h1 {
  font-weight: bold;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Edge, Chrome and Firefox computed CSS properties</p>
<pre><code>h1 {
  font-weight: 700;
}
</code></pre>
<p>In the computed tab, Edge, Chrome and Firefox are all showing <code>font-weight: bold</code> to be computed to a font-weight of 700, whereas Safari's computed font-weight doesn't have a numerical value, it just remains computed as "bold." But this still doesn't explain much.</p>
<p>In fact somewhat ironically, Safari doesn't have <code>font-weight: 700</code> defined anywhere in stylesheets that I can see in the DevTools but it <em>is</em> rendering <code>h1</code>s in the 700 font-weight for the typeface Poppins.</p>
<h2 id="browser-fallback-behavior">Browser fallback behavior <a href="#browser-fallback-behavior">#</a></h2>
<p>So now I'm even more baffled and look to the line of code I have to define the font and font-weights I'm using.</p>
<p><code>&lt;link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Poppins:400,600" rel="stylesheet"&gt;</code></p>
<p>I don't know why, but I'm compelled to delete "600" from the string while in Edge. So I do and suddenly watch as the heading in Edge re-renders at "400".</p>
<p>Wait.</p>
<p>I add <code>,700</code> to the end of this string: <code>Poppins:400,600</code>. My heading re-renders and now matches Safari. I remove <code>,700</code> and it re-renders in the 600 font-weight. I delete 600 again, it re-renders in the 400 font-weight.</p>
<p>I test this in Firefox and see the same results.</p>
<p>Edge, Chrome and Firefox all have a computed font-weight of 700 and if that particular font-weight isn't defined in the line of Google Fonts code, the browser grabs the next highest numerical font-weight that is defined and renders that font-weight as the bold weight. If you delete all font-weights from the Google Font code, you get the thinnest version of the font.</p>
<p>So what happens when I test this in Safari? Absolutely nothing. It doesn't matter if I delete all the font-weights from the font link. Safari's headings remain bold. But then I noticed something interesting as well after deleting the 400,600 from the font code...my nav bar on my website didn't change either in Safari.</p>
<p>So to confirm I was in fact seeing what I was seeing I changed the file on my live site and stripped 400,600 out so all I had was the following:</p>
<p><code>&lt;link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Poppins" rel="stylesheet"&gt;</code></p>
<p><img src="https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/img/browser-fonts/thin-heading.png" alt="alt: Font rendering without any weight being defined"></p>
<p>And Safari didn't change at all. I still had the CSS for my nav links declaring them at <code>font-weight: 600</code> and Safari was still pulling that weight despite me not defining it in the font code.</p>
<p>Edge, Chrome and Firefox had all fallen back to the thinnest font available.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-do-i-do-to-render-headings-consistently-across-browsers-and-platforms%3F">So what do I do to render headings consistently across browsers and platforms? <a href="#so-what-do-i-do-to-render-headings-consistently-across-browsers-and-platforms%3F">#</a></h2>
<p>This almost feels like a loaded question. This problem is almost akin (but a little bit less complex) to rendering HTML Forms consistently across platforms and browsers. The cross-platform problem is a harder one to solve as you can't control how the operating system handles font rendering.</p>
<p>If you don't want the browser to decide how to bold font-weights then I suggest explicitly defining the font-weight with numerical values: 500, 600, etc to avoid Firefox, Edge and Chrome falling back to whatever the highest font-weight defined is.</p>
<p>And a bit of a disclaimer: I've only looked at <code>h1</code> rendering for this article. I suspect there are many other areas one could dive into to compare other headings and paragraph rendering.</p>
<p>And the final question you may be wondering is this:</p>
<p>Which way is actually right? Firefox/Edge/Chrome or Safari?</p>
<p>And my answer is: I don't actually know.</p>
<p>Multiple browsers behaving the same isn't necessarily indicative of the correct implementation so I suspect I will be trying to dive into browser behavior to figure out the correct implementation at a later date.</p>

<p>That’s why I created these 5 guiding principles for launching successful marketing campaigns. I was fed up with feeling <em>overwhelmed</em> by all of the marketing gurus touting their “exclusive” systems which ended up just rehashing the same old stuff over and over.</p>
<p>So, when I thought about <strong>everything I’ve learned over the last 11+ years</strong> working on literally <em>1000s</em> of marketing campaigns, the same 5 things kept coming up.</p>
<p><strong>Almost every big win could be attributed to one or more of these rules.</strong></p>
<p>And when I looked at the biggest failures of my marketing career thus far, whether it was a personal project—like that time I unsuccessfully tried to launch an app for barbershops with $50,000 in venture funding 🙈—or the client projects that just didn’t take off as I had hoped, it usually came down to these rules <strong>not being followed</strong>.</p>
<p>I share all of that so that you understand that the rules you’re about to read weren’t just created off the cuff to get more clicks on this blog post. No, <strong>they have been proven again and again</strong> over the years, and finally, I’m writing them down so <em>you</em> can leverage the rules too.</p>
<p>But enough about the backstory. Let’s get to the good stuff.</p>
<p>Here are the <strong>5 growth marketing rules</strong> that can help you launch successful marketing campaigns time and time again.</p>
<h2>1. Give people what they want</h2>
<p>This one sounds like a no-brainer, but hear me out. Every great marketing campaign starts with an amazing product, service, or offer at its core. In other words, <strong>great marketing won’t fix crappy products.</strong></p>
<p>Furthermore, a great product that nobody actually wants won’t help you either.</p>
<p><em>Example: </em>Fax machines were truly amazing pieces of technology at one point in time. You could literally send documents through the air, instantly. It was magic.</p>
<p>But do you want one today? <em>Of course not.</em> There are better ways to accomplish the same thing. So while a fax machine was once a marvel of technological achievement, nobody wants one anymore.</p>
<p>Don’t build something great if nobody wants it or needs it.</p>
<p>In order to give people what they want, you need to first understand <em>who</em> you’re trying to reach. That’s where your target audience and target persona come in. I’ll certainly cover these topics in more detail in future posts, but for now, <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.hubspot.com/make-my-persona" target="_blank">HubSpot</a> has some excellent resources to help you create your own.</p>

<p>And your product, service, or offer better be freakin’ awesome. Don’t sell crap. In fact, don’t even try to give away crap for free.</p>
<p>Yes, I’m looking at all of you folks who peddle “free ebooks” that are really just rehashed blog posts in a PDF format. 🧐 Nobody wants that. Be original.</p>
<h2>2. Continually improve your messaging</h2>
<p>Okay, so you have a great product, service, or offer, but how do you get people to <em>understand</em> it? That’s where your message comes in.</p>
<p>When we think of messaging, the first thing that probably comes to mind is the copy surrounding your ads, landing pages, emails, and website. And yes, that is primarily where your messaging lives.</p>
<p>But don’t forget about the other elements of your messaging too such as your brand identity, the overall design of your pages and emails, your social channels, and the tone and content of what you and your team say to people when speaking one-on-one with potential buyers and customers alike.</p>
<p>And when it comes to messaging, most brands miss the mark here because their messaging is either <strong>too confusing, too self-centered, too inconsistent, or too sparse.</strong></p>
<p>If you want to learn more about simplifying your messaging and bringing clarity to the minds of your potential leads and buyers, I recommend reading <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://amzn.to/2ZHYMhP" target="_blank"><em>Building a Story Brand</em></a> by Donald Miller. He’s the king of clarifying your message. 👑</p>
<h2>3. Experiment with your traffic sources</h2>
<p>Another huge problem I see with marketing campaigns is that some brands spend all their effort building a great product with great messaging, but when it came time to launch, all they heard were crickets. 🦗</p>
<p>Yup, no traffic.</p>
<p>Expecting people to just suddenly become aware of what you’re offering without any real traffic acquisition strategy is not a strategy at all. So don’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>Put just as much time into your traffic strategy as you do into the other steps mentioned throughout this article.</strong></p>
<p>And if you’re still confused as to what I mean by “traffic strategy,” I’m talking about how you plan on attracting visitors, leads, and customers.</p>
<p>Your options these days are plentiful. You could invest in “free” traffic from Google by building a robust SEO strategy. Or, if you’re impatient like me, you can deploy a paid traffic strategy using Facebook Ads or Google Ads.</p>
<p>Heck, you could even try influencer marketing as a traffic strategy. Or cold email outreach. Or referral marketing. Or content marketing (that’s what this is by the way).</p>
<p><strong>The opportunities for acquiring traffic in 2020 and beyond are limitless.</strong> 📈</p>
<p>Just remember that <strong>not all traffic is equal</strong> and no traffic source is truly free, not even SEO. You either pay with your time and effort <em>or</em> your pay for ads.</p>
<p>Eventually, you’ll find one or more traffic sources that work really well for you and consistently deliver a positive return on investment. <strong>Those are the channels you should scale.</strong></p>
<h2>4. Reduce friction and increase motivation</h2>
<p>Ah, this might be my <em>favorite</em> rule of all. Why? Because I’ve always been fascinated with buyer behavior and marketing psychology.</p>
<p>In fact, if you were to ask me what type of marketing I specialize in, I’d say conversion optimization, which is what we’re going to talk about now.</p>
<p>Conversion optimization is just a fancy way of saying <strong>reduce friction and increase motivation for your visitors, leads, and potential customers.</strong></p>
<p>It all comes down to psychology and influencing behavior.</p>
<p>In fact, the book that really popularized this stuff is called <em><a href="https://amzn.to/2AF1yMm" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Influence</a></em>. Go figure. And yes, you should read it. It’s my #2 most recommended marketing book.</p>
<p>So how does one <em>influence</em> behavior? I’ve already told you… by reducing friction and increasing motivation!</p>
<p>But what does that mean?!</p>
<p>Let me give you an example.</p>
<p>If I’m on your landing page and I’m interested in buying one of your widgets, but in order to buy it I have to go through a <em>17-step form</em> and I’m on my mobile device and the form is not easy to navigate, you’ve lost me.</p>
<p>I was motivated to buy, but the complexity of the form caused too much friction.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you simplify the form and make it super usable (even on mobile), but the actual widgets you’re selling are just run-of-the-mill average widgets that aren’t any better than your competitor’s widgets (which are cheaper too), then I don’t have enough motivation to make the purchase.</p>
<p>See how motivation and friction go hand in hand? You need to <strong>constantly think about both of these things</strong> throughout your entire marketing funnel.</p>
<p>Reduce friction and increase motivation. Maybe that can become your new marketing mantra. 😋</p>
<h2>5. Let the data guide your decisions</h2>
<p>Ah, we’ve made it to the <strong>5th and final growth marketing rule</strong>. And this is another really important one.</p>
<p><strong>Data is the fuel of every great growth marketer.</strong> ⛽️</p>
<p>It’s what sets growth marketing apart from brand marketing. Data can make or break your campaign. It can turn around a losing campaign. It can help you pick your biggest winners.</p>
<p>It’s pretty much the best thing to happen to marketing since, well… since Google Ads were invented.</p>
<p>And you’re lucky, because as a modern growth marketer, you have access to so much data at your fingertips.</p>
<p>It wasn’t always this way. You may have seen this famous quote from over 100 years ago:</p>
<blockquote><p>Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted; the trouble is, I don’t know which half.</p><cite>John Wanamaker</cite></blockquote>
<p>You and I don’t have this problem any more thanks to data. We know where our traffic is coming from, which campaigns are producing the best results, what our return on investment is, what our customer lifetime value is, and so much more.</p>
<p><strong>Growth marketers are data-rich…</strong> however, many of them don’t realize it.</p>
<p>They’re not taking advantage of the data that is available. They’re squandering it. Letting it sit in silos like Google Analytics without taking more than a casual glance every now and then in order to be able to tell the boss what the bounce rate is (which is a confusing metric anyway).</p>
<p>Ideally, you should be continually gathering and analyzing all sorts of data—both quantitative and qualitative data—so you can make better decisions as to what you need to do more of, what you need to do less of, and what you need to test next.</p>
<p><strong>Almost every question a growth marketer has can be answered with data.</strong></p>
<p>Need to know how to improve your messaging? Conduct user research interviews and leverage the words and phrases of your target audience.</p>
<p>Need to know which traffic sources to scale up? Look at the data and see what is converting.</p>
<p>I could go on, but you get the point.</p>
<h2>Putting it all together</h2>
<p>Whew. That was a lot to cover, I know.</p>
<p>These 5 rules are serious stuff. They can really change the way you think about growth marketing. Just writing them down—<em>finally</em>—has helped me understand how everything works together to ultimately bring greater results to a growth marketing campaign.</p>
<p>And I hope they will do the same for you.</p>
<p>Now, before you go, can I ask you for <strong>one simple favor?</strong></p>
<p>If you liked this article and got any value out of it at all, will you share it? You can use <a href="https://ctt.ac/B93Jo" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">this pre-written tweet</a> or come up with one of your own.</p>
<p>Heck, you could even send it to your colleagues on Slack. They might even thank you.</p>

          <p>We need better languages for introductory computing. A good introductory language makes good compromises between expressiveness and performance, and between simplicity and feature-richness. Pyret is our evolving experiment in this space.</p>

          <h3 id="why-not-just-use-java-python-racket-ocaml-or-haskell">Why not just use Java, Python, Racket, OCaml, or Haskell?</h3>

          <p>One of the enduring lessons from the Racket project is that <em>no full-blown, general-purpose programming language</em> is particularly appropriate for introductory education. By the time a language grows to be useful for building large-scale systems, it tends to have accumulated too many warts, odd corners, and complex features, all of which trip up students. The <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/fffkf-drscheme-journal/">journal paper for DrScheme</a>  (the old name for DrRacket) explains this in some detail.</p>

          <p>In that respect, the closest fellow travelers of us Pyreteers are the Racketeers (see how that works?). In fact, the first version of Pyret was merely a <code>#lang</code> in Racket. Nevertheless, Pyret represents a departure from Racket (for now and for the near future, at least) for several reasons:</p>

          <ul>
           <li>
            <p>We wanted to experiment with syntax. Much as many of us love  parentheses, we fear that Racket will always bump into an acceptance  threshold due to its syntax. We’re delighted to see the growing  adoption in industry of languages like Racket and Clojure, and maybe  the days of paren-phobia are over. But academics are far more  hidebound than industrial programmers!</p></li>
           <li>
            <p>We wanted to build a really great run-time system for the Web browser. Going through Racket and  <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/yk-whalesong-racket-browser/">Whalesong</a>  proved to be a non-starter in terms of performance, and Racket has  many features that make an efficient implementation on today’s  JavaScript very hard. Building a native JavaScript implementation  was the only option we could see. Over time, as technology changes,  this could change.</p></li>
           <li>
            <p>Though our pedagogy draws from and is very similar to that of the  Racketeers, it also diverges in some ways, reflecting the somewhat  different backgrounds and preferences of team. Pyret embodies <em>our</em>  educational philosophy. We felt we could more easily experiment if  we had a clean-slate design than if we had to keep fitting our work  into the constraints of Racket.</p></li>
           <li>
            <p>Ultimately, Racket’s <code>#lang</code> facilities, though designed to create  new languages—and a great prototyping ground for Pyret—proved to not  be quite enough to support a language creation process of the scale  of Pyret; and the need for a strong Web run-time system also meant  that we did not get enough out of the Racket ecosystem.  Nevertheless, that only represents the state of systems today; if  someday the two grew closer together, many or all of us would  rejoice.</p></li></ul>

          <h3 id="will-pyret-ever-be-a-full-fledged-programming-language">Will Pyret ever be a full-fledged programming language?</h3>

          <p>Yes.</p>

          <p>First of all, Pyret is much more powerful than you might realize. Pyret is already fully-fledged enough to self-host its compiler, which is a non-trivial and realistic challenge. What that means is, when you run Pyret in your browser, it loads JavaScript code that implements a Pyret-to-JavaScript compiler (i.e., it compiles the Pyret you type into JavaScript and runs it in the browser). This compiler was produced by the Pyret-to-JavaScript compiler by compiling the Pyret-to-JavaScript compiler. Take a look at the compiler’s <a href="https://github.com/brownplt/pyret-lang/">bootstrapping phases</a> to get a sense of its sophistication.</p>

          <p>Second, underneath Pyret is a very powerful run-time system based on over a decade of research. You don’t see it as a user of the language, and that’s the point. Many other languages expose the crippling limitations of JavaScript’s run-time to users (e.g., can’t halt a long-running computation, can’t yield control to the event loop, etc.). These languages effectively let <em>the medium become part of the message</em>, whereas we believe programmers — especially early-stage student programmers — should not have to confront these complexities, which are irrelevant to (and often significantly interfere with) the material they are trying to learn. Imagine if other languages said, “We’d love to give you function calls, but your machine’s instruction set doesn’t contain them, so we can’t — sorry!” Yet they do the equivalent when it comes to giving you control over your computation on top of JavaScript. In contrast, Pyret is uncompromising.</p>

          <p>Third, if you want to teach a media-rich curriculum, you actually need a pretty full-featured language at least under the hood. For instance, Pyret’s built-in support for reactive programming requires a much more sophisticated run-time system — and corresponding language features — than one that didn’t offer this at all or just punted to JavaScript for this support. (Essentially, event-loops are first-class entities in the language.) We just haven’t emphasized these features when talking about Pyret, focusing instead on the curriculum they support.</p>

          <p>Broadly, we view <em>building an awesome teaching language</em> as a useful design discipline that necessarily entails all the features typically expected of a mature language. When building a language, you’re constantly confronted with questions: what to do next, how to do it, and whether to do it at all. Language designers therefore need a mental framework that guides their choices. For some, it might be “Build an awesome language for shared-memory concurrency!” For others it might be “Build an awesome language for writing scientific computations very, very concisely!” For us, it’s “Build an awesome teaching language!” So whenever we’re confronted with a design (or implementation) choice, we first ask how it would play out <em>in this specific context</em>. Then we ask how it would impact our long-term goal. We have yet to find actual contradictions between the two, but it’s certainly re-ordered priorities.</p>

          <h3 id="there-are-lots-of-kinds-of-education">There are lots of kinds of “education”.</h3>

          <p>That’s right. We are focused on introductory programming education at a high-school and collegiate level — what is often called “CS 1” and “CS 2” (roughly, the first year of college). Pyret is being actively <em>used</em> in everything from high-schools to upper-level collegiate courses, giving us a tight feedback loop.</p>

          <p>Of course, even in that setting there are differences of opinion about what needs to be taught. Some believe inheritance is so important it should be taught early in the first semester. We utterly reject this belief (as someone once wisely said, “object-oriented programming does not scale down”: what is the point of teaching classes and inheritance when students have not yet done anything interesting enough to encapsulate or inherit from?). Some have gone so far as to start teaching with Turing Machines. Unsurprisingly, we reject this view as well.</p>

          <p>What we do not take a dogmatic stance on is exactly how early state and types should be introduced. Pyret has the usual stateful operations. We discussed this at some length, but eventually decided an introduction to programming <em>must</em> teach state. Pyret also has optional annotations, so different instructors can, depending on their preference, introduce types at different times.</p>

          <h3 id="what-are-some-ways-the-educational-philosophy-influences-the-language">What are some ways the educational philosophy influences the language?</h3>

          <p>Pyret is driven by the <a href="http://www.htdp.org/"><em>How to Design Programs</em></a> (HtDP) philosophy of programming education; one could almost view it as a language designed to make teaching from HtDP comfortable. However, we also have our own curricular ideas that extend or run parallel to those of HtDP, which we are steadily writing up in <a href="http://papl.cs.brown.edu/"><em>Programming and Programming Languages</em></a> (PAPL). PAPL both exclusively uses Pyret and is slowly turning into a definitive book for teaching with it.</p>

          <p>Some of our central ideas include:</p>

          <ul>
           <li>
            <p>Languages should offer a rich set of values. For instance, images  should be primitive values, fully supported by the environment. This  improves the teaching of several things, from image-based  composition exercises (which are often far more interesting than  composition over numbers) to animations and games.</p></li>
           <li>
            <p>Languages should offer syntactic support for as much as possible of  the HtDP design recipe. (Pyret does not offer explicit support for  templates, but then again we’re rethinking the pedagogy of the  template step.)</p></li>
           <li>
            <p>Design recipe support includes good data definition primitives, including  the expression of invariants. Therefore, Pyret has support for refinements  (which are currently checked dynamically; a future version may add static  support, but this is not our highest priority). In particular, by allowing  algebraic datatypes to also be objects, Pyret offers significant flexibility  and expressiveness.</p></li>
           <li>
            <p>Students should be able to easily write examples as a precursor to  writing code. In this regard, Pyret borrows but (we believe) syntactically  improves upon Racket’s <code>check-expect</code> family of operations with <a href="https://www.pyret.org/docs/latest/testing.html">examples and  testing</a>.</p></li>
           <li>
            <p>Students should easily be able to escalate from simple examples to  sophisticated testing, such as writing test oracles.</p></li>
           <li>
            <p>Equality is subtle and languages should respect its nuances.  Students must understand the meaning of equality and its  consequences, especially with regard to observations in the presence  of state. Therefore, Pyret has carefully developed  <a href="https://www.pyret.org/docs/latest/equality.html">equality primitives</a>.</p></li></ul>

          <h3 id="is-pyret-also-a-research-project">Is Pyret also a research project?</h3>

          <p>Yes and no.</p>

          <p>Yes in that, broadly speaking, we view what we are doing as very much a research effort. We have specific, novel goals in mind (some of which we’ve described elsewhere in this document), and finding good solutions to achieve those goals will require innovation. This is the very essence of research. Some of that research is on the curricular side, though, and may not require any language innovation. Indeed, as much as possible we want …</p></div></div></div></div></div>

While criticizing the government, or even waving the wrong flag, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-53244862">could get you imprisoned</a> in any territory under Chinese rule, your right to freedom of expression is sacrosanct under the First Amendment—until you step into your place of work, that is. While the government is not entitled to punish political dissent, in most parts of America it is perfectly legal for your boss to fire you if they happen to dislike the person you voted for in the last election. </p><div><p>This restriction on political expression is especially harmful at a time when, nearly every day, somebody is accused of having transgressed against some commonly (or even not so commonly) held taboo. In many of these cases, employees—from senior staff at prominent institutions to working-class laborers—have been fired. Even outside of working hours, it would now be perfectly reasonable for most Americans to think twice before speaking their minds about hot-button issues.</p><p> In their attempts to remedy the most pernicious aspects of cancel culture, critics have mostly concentrated on advocating less punitive social norms. This is good as far as it goes. Our political culture will only become more liberal if we all stop demanding that people be punished or fired for imaginary transgressions. Yet, this emphasis on culture ignores the important role that legislative reform could play in defending the most vulnerable: If it were harder for employers to fire people for frivolous reasons, Americans would have less reason to fear that expressing their views might cost them their livelihoods.</p></div><p><strong>The Problem with At-Will Employment</strong></p><p>At the moment, most American workers are subject to “at-will” contracts. As long as their employers do not fire them on the basis of a narrow set of protected characteristics, such as gender, race, and sexual orientation, they can lose their jobs at any time, for any reason. Nor is there a due process requirement: Companies are under no legal obligation to investigate whether the ostensible reasons for axing an employee are grounded in reality. (The only state that categorically prohibits at-will employment, after six months on the job, <a href="https://spoonlaw.com/437-2/">is Montana</a>). </p><div><p> The prevalence of at-will employment makes it easier for employers to engage in knee-jerk reactions to short-lived social media controversies. For instance, a Hispanic electrician working for the San Diego Gas and Electric company was fired for cracking his knuckles in a photograph because a <a href="https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/sdge-worker-fired-over-alleged-racist-gesture-says-he-was-cracking-knuckles/2347414/">social media mob believed that he was</a> flashing a white power sign. The man who took the picture has since admitted that he probably misinterpreted the interaction, and thousands of people have now <a href="https://www.change.org/p/sdge-reinstate-emmanuel-caffertys-job-sdge">signed a petition</a>, asking the electrician’s former employer to reverse the mistake. But since the employee has already lost his job, it will be hard for him to obtain justice. As in many other cases, both parties would have been better off if the law had required the company to afford due process to an accused worker <em>before</em> deciding whether or not to fire him. </p><p> There is a better alternative: Contracts negotiated by labor unions often provide so-called “just cause” protections for employees. The tests of just cause <a href="https://www.massnurses.org/labor-action/labor-education-resources/grievances-101/just-cause#:~:text=Just%20cause%20is%20the%20standard,must%20be%20just%20and%20fair.&amp;text=The%20concept%20of%20just%20cause%20is%20well%20established%20in%20labor%20law.">typically include questions</a> such as whether the employee was forewarned of the consequences of his or her actions, whether the rules were applied evenly, and whether there was an objective investigation into the employee’s conduct. In other words, it forces employers to conduct a fair process before firing their employees, which gives the accused a real chance to defend themselves. If we really care about free speech and due process, these protections should be available to every American.</p></div><div><p>Opponents of these reforms have long argued that they would come at a heavy cost to the economy. But scholars who have studied the impact of wrongful discharge protections have obtained mixed results. <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w12860.pdf">One 2007 study of U.S. employers</a>, for example, found that the introduction of such protections resulted in some loss of productivity, but also led to strong growth in overall employment numbers.</p></div><p><strong>Stop Employers From Discriminating Against Views They Don’t Like</strong></p><p> Just cause legislation would help to reduce the number of capricious firings. But, as long as bosses can legally terminate employees because they dislike their political views, such legislation would only go partway towards remedying the chilling effects on free speech. That’s why those of us who worry about cancel culture should also push for the inclusion of political affiliation in the rubric of anti-discrimination laws. </p><p> The Civil Rights Act has long prohibited employers from discriminating on the basis of race, color, religion, gender, pregnancy, or national origin. In June, the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/06/15/863498848/supreme-court-delivers-major-victory-to-lgbtq-employees">ruled that this provision</a> also protects gay, lesbian, and transgender employees. But there are no equivalent federal protections to prevent employees from being disadvantaged because of their political views.</p><div><p>This is a missed opportunity, as the success of local ordinances mandating such protections has shown. In Washington D.C., for example, the <a href="https://ohr.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/ohr/publication/attachments/LawsAndRegs-HumanRightsAct-1977-English.pdf">Human Rights Act</a> prohibits employment discrimination based on political affiliation, defined as “the state of belonging to or endorsing any political party.” As Edgar Njatou, Executive Director of Workplace Fairness, told me in an interview, this ensures that your boss can’t fire you if they “find out you voted for Hillary or that you’re a Republican.”</p><p> Seattle has even more ambitious protections for workers’ political views. Its laws prohibit discrimination based on “<a href="https://library.municode.com/wa/seattle/codes/municipal_code?nodeId=TIT14HURI_CH14.06UNPUACPR&amp;showChanges=true">political ideology</a>,” which is defined as “any idea or belief … relating to the purpose, conduct, organization, function or basis of government institutions and activities, whether or not characteristic of any political party or group.” But even this law mostly serves to protect people with relatively common political views. After the 2016 election, for example, local rental listings began to discourage Trump supporters from applying. “If you are a landlord,” city government spokesperson Elliot Bronstein, <a href="https://www.king5.com/article/news/local/seattle/no-trump-clause-is-new-requirement-for-some-seattle-renters/416269805">wrote in response</a>, “you cannot discriminate on political status.” (Like other protections against discrimination, this does not apply to housemates, who share an apartment or living space.) </p></div><p>There are two obvious objections—both of which could easily be addressed. First, some organizations have a legitimate interest in ensuring that their employees share a broad worldview: It would make no sense, for example, to stop a political campaign group from discriminating against a job applicant who opposes the organization’s goals. Explicitly political organizations should therefore enjoy a carve-out from the stricture against discriminating on the basis of political beliefs (though they would still have to afford existing employees the due process protections guaranteed under “just cause” provisions). </p><p>Second, employers have a legitimate interest in protecting their staff from the hateful conduct of colleagues: Clearly, for example, no member of an ethnic minority should have to endure racist taunts at their place of work. But this could also be addressed through carefully worded legislation. Seattle already offers exemptions for political conduct that would cause “substantial and material disruption of the property rights of the provider of a place of public accommodation.” Employers also have an affirmative obligation to protect employees from racist harassment.</p><p>Balancing competing goods is one of the core purposes of any legal system. There is no reason to think that our laws could not protect the speech of political minorities, without hampering the operation of overtly political organizations or burdening ethnic, religious, or sexual minorities with the fear of harassment.</p><p><strong>We Can Make It Happen</strong></p><p>New employment regulations always face an especially tough uphill battle in Congress. But, though it will not be easy to win legislative approval for such reforms, every major faction of American political life has its own reasons for supporting them. </p><p>The left should be sympathetic to the wish to expand job protections for American workers, which lag significantly behind those of other developed countries. While conservatives are usually hostile to such regulations, they should recognize that these reforms would help to protect them against the growing influence of cancel culture. And philosophical liberals—those of us who believe in a pluralistic society that encourages ideological diversity—have the most principled reason to get on board.</p><p>Hatred of any form of wrong think now <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/12/7/9790764/partisan-discrimination">threatens the foundations</a> of our social fabric. Since the stakes of public policy debates are high, it is understandable—and even admirable—for citizens to subject each other’s views to vigorous criticism. But, if ordinary people fear that a minor misunderstanding or a deeply held difference of opinion might cost them their jobs, freedom of speech—the cornerstone of any liberal order—is under serious threat. </p></div></div>]]>

Like most days, I am scrolling Twitter. Liking tweets, replying to a few interesting ones. This day was different. My timeline was peppered with tweets asking for a Clubhouse invite:</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594087965319_8337"><div><p>I went on Google and searched "Clubhouse". I found it!</p><p>Oops, different<a href="https://clubhouse.io/" target="_blank"> Clubhouse</a>. Same name, different purpose — enterprise project management software.</p><p>The mystery continued. I saw a tweet from <em>TechCrunch </em>reporter, Josh Constine. He published a story titled, "<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/18/clubhouse-app-chat-rooms/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAD5-5jnbYpJmwT5bO29BEYEDZBoQbF5S_kIexetsweiHCkW_FoXXHqI3kEM9_VNBbFurFswe0zuKRdYLALYXEleT6z76Do98Zb0MZjTunkksjUZJvrw8XLERgVvUVDOfMGm1oPOeWOdfz9XBrnwE5fPyDcFBjwjAYT1IRIRYsaVu" target="_blank">Clubhouse voice chat leads a wave of spontaneous social apps</a>".</p><p>He writes,</p><blockquote><p><em>Clubhouse, an audio-based social network where people can spontaneously jump into voice chat rooms together, you see the unlabeled rooms of all the people you follow, and you can join to talk or just listen along, milling around to find what interests you. High-energy rooms attract crowds while slower ones see participants slip out to join other chat circles."</em></p></blockquote><p>The app has taken off like wildfire (in the Silicon Valley Twitter community).<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2020/05/15/andreessen-horowitz-wins-vc-sweepstakes-to-back-clubhouse-voice-app/#730106bb6f2a" target="_blank"> </a>Andreesen Horowitz, the famed VC firm, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2020/05/15/andreessen-horowitz-wins-vc-sweepstakes-to-back-clubhouse-voice-app/#569247636f2a" target="_blank">invested $10MM in the app</a>. People are declaring, "<a href="https://subvert.substack.com/p/social-audio-connection-over-community" target="_blank">Audio Networks as a Service</a>" as the next big social network wave.</p><p>Nathan Baschez does a good job of <a href="https://divinations.substack.com/p/inside-the-clubhouse" target="_blank">explaining Clubhouse</a> from a user perspective,</p><blockquote><p><em>One afternoon I got a push notification saying that Paul [founder of Clubhouse] was talking to Naval Ravikant ...&nbsp;So, when I got that notification that Paul and Naval were talking, I had a few minutes, and I decided to join. As soon as I did, Paul recognized me and said something like, “Hey Nathan! I saw you wrote a post about Roam the other day, we were just talking about that. We’d love to get your take on it.” And then he invited me to speak. All of a sudden, I’m explaining my dinky blog post to a guy with almost a million twitter followers!</em></p></blockquote><p>Two big questions remain:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>How will the app monetize?</p></li><li><p>Why will ordinary people use it?</p></li></ol><p><strong>How Will the App Monetize?</strong></p><p>Clubhouse's magic is in creating intimate, ephemeral conversations. Groups of people can come together to talk about anything. It's <a href="https://www.sohohouse.com/en-us/houses" target="_blank">SoHo</a> house on your phone.</p><p>The problem with exclusivity is that it isn't scalable. Once everyone is using it, it loses its utility value. As Chris Dixon writes, "<a href="https://cdixon.org/2015/01/31/come-for-the-tool-stay-for-the-network" target="_blank">Come for the tool, stay for the network.</a>"</p><p>What tool is Clubhouse providing? As far as I see, none. But that can change. <strong>Clubhouse can become a white-label solution for content creators and influencers.</strong></p><p>Fans feel connected to influencers. As I wrote previously in, “<a href="https://www.arilewis.com/aris-posts/quibi-can-turn-it-around-by-doing-this" target="_blank">Quibi Can Turn It Around By Doing This"</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>The data backs this up. </em><a href="https://www.ion.co/millennials-listen-social-media-creators-celebrities" target="_blank"><em>70% of teenage YouTube subscribers</em></a><em> say they related to YouTube creators more than traditional celebrities ...</em><a href="https://www.ion.co/millennials-listen-social-media-creators-celebrities" target="_blank"><em> 40% of millennials believe their favorite creators understand them better than their friends.</em></a></p></blockquote><p><strong>Why Will Ordinary People Use It?</strong></p><p>First, fans wanted to follow their favorite influencers. Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram enabled that. Now you have a new generation of tools. Tools like Cameo, OnlyFans and Clubhouse (potentially), where influencers can interact with their fans. Not just follow an influencer’s life, but be a part of their life.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Kim Kardashian as a Case Study</strong></p><p>Kim Kardashian is the queen of influencers. Currently, she has:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>178M Instagram followers</p></li><li><p>65M Twitter followers</p></li><li><p>29M Facebook likes</p></li></ul><p>Companies will pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for sponsoring her social posts. Her brand,<a href="https://www.coty.com/in-the-news/press-release/coty-and-kim-kardashian-west-announce-strategic-relationship-expand-beauty" target="_blank"> KKW Beauty</a>, has a valuation of $1B.</p><p>It suffices to say she has a loyal following. What if she told her fans that they could join her "private club"? Once a week, her most dedicated fans would hear her talk. It's fleeting, authentic and epitomizes FOMO. How much would a fan pay to say, "I'm part of Kim's club?"</p><p>A lot!</p><p>Don't take my word for it. OnlyFans is already doing it with adult performers. It's estimated the company will take home<a href="https://twitter.com/yrechtman/status/1261352020390359045" target="_blank"> $150MM - $300MM</a> in revenue this year. Think of Clubhouse as OnlyFans for creators.</p><p>To paraphrase Freud, porn or war is where innovation begins.</p><p>Ephemeral, exclusive content is beginning to take center-stage. Clubhouse has the opportunity to be the winner.</p><p><em>Thanks to </em><a href="https://twitter.com/eric_ruleman"><em>Eric Ruleman</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://twitter.com/petermartindc"><em>Peter Martin</em></a><em> and </em><a href="https://twitter.com/KyleBowe4"><em>Kyle Bowe</em></a><em> for reviewing drafts of this.</em></p><p><em>Disclaimer: I haven’t used Clubhouse.</em></p></div></div></div>]]>

	    	<p><img src="https://spec-rationality.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/shutterstock_696944128-e1543823849606.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="250"></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><b>Criteria:</b> The core use case of interoperability is not a specific application, but rather a concept: Connectivity. The primary value of interoperability (connectivity) comes down to the basic need for wide inclusivity – enabling the widest range of networks to connect whilst reducing the impediments to the path of connection.Given the primary value is satisfied, developers and end users may look at these solutions through the lens of trustlessness, performance, decentralisation etc. as secondary values to evaluate tools. </em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A close look at the DLT space reveals a series of public and private chains that operate largely in distinct silos. As DLTs accelerate towards maturity a key infrastructure requirement will be the ability for information to be transmitted in real time from chain to chain and even off-chain to old world systems.</p>
<p>However the question of why we need interoperability is sometimes complicated by developers and users thinking of very specific use cases- a complex array of applications and niche features. This mindset needs to be geared towards something far more simple, going down to the very basics of interoperability.</p>
<p>CONNECTIVITY</p>
<p>This glaringly obvious but often overlooked use case of interoperability is a concept without which DLTs will continue to function in silos but never capitalise on their full potential. Take for example, any decentralised application or network and ask if that by enabling connectivity, would it suffer or thrive?</p>
<p>If the internet has taught us anything, it is the true value and weight of change that connectivity has brought to the world. Connectivity itself is therefore the use case of interoperability, and to underestimate the value that this simple concept brings would be negligent.</p>
<p>If we assume interoperability technology is perfected and that comprehensive connectivity is available, perhaps the issue or disconnect for many lie in the tribalism forming around DLTs such as BTC, ETH, NEO, EOS etc. To bring things into perspective, it’s akin to saying Country A should remain isolated from Country B. However this mindset will restrict DLTs from even competing with existing world systems to which connectivity is inextricably linked.</p>
<p>This article will therefore not focus on the specific use cases as popularly imagined by most, a Decentralized Exchange being perhaps the most popular. Instead we will imagine a world in which connectivity plays a significant role in a global decentralised economy. The challenge now faced by interoperability technologies is their ability to effectively optimise for connectivity without compromising the other core tenets of DLTs – specifically the trustless nature of decentralisation.</p>
<h3>The Varying Degrees of Decentralised Interoperability</h3>
<p>Connectivity to certain degrees is already apparent in the current landscape. Take for example the service Changelly or a centralised exchange like Binance, they act as a medium to allow exchange of one token for another. These mediums however do not align with the tenets that the underlying traded assets were built upon, a decentralised network that does not require the trust of a centralised third party.</p>
<p>As such the response within the space has been to develop technologies focusing on interoperability that do align with the core decentralisation tenets of Blockchain. The main technologies can be summarized as:</p>

<p><span>What is important to draw from the above technologies is the ability to identify the varying degrees to which these technologies have achieve decentralised interoperability – the extent of connectivity established while maintaining decentralisation. </span></p>
<p><span>Ultimately users have the choice of any number of interoperable methods, even centralised exchanges. </span><span>To assist in this choice, consider the problems these technologies solve in regards to relationship of trust (blockchain tenets), security and access (connectivity). The problems manifest themselves as three core problems, in summary below and discussed in detail further down: </span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Opportunities/limitations of interoperability – Trust and security based on knowing full state vs verifying state</span>
<ul>
<li><span>Value transfer</span>
<ul>
<li>Full state of member chains as part of the protocol’s data</li>
<li>Compatible chain communications (Hashlocking)</li>
<li>Verifying the state based on verification by a validator</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span>Access to Data – Knowing the states of member chains – i.e. Proving data relative to another network, effectively allowing smart contracts and applications to leverage this “knowing”.&nbsp;Can be achieved via:</span>
<ul>
<li><span>Full state of member chains as part of the protocol’s data</span></li>
<li><span>Verifying the state based on verification by a validator</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span>Methods of interoperability – Trust based on validators vs no validators</span>
<ul>
<li><span>Centralised hubs </span></li>
<li><span>Validator based (Verification via Validators, 3rd party)</span></li>
<li><span>Work based (Verification does not require validators)</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span>Access to interoperability – conditions to participate</span>
<ul>
<li><span>Conditional requirement to participate – i.e. requires smart contract or requires change to core protocol</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><b>The first problem: </b><span>Opportunities / limitations of interoperability – &nbsp;Trust and security based on knowing full state vs verifying state</span></p>
<p><span>The variable here is trust based. The two options being “knowing” of states vs verification of a state. Multichain technology can “know” full states as all member chains are part of the parent chain, allowing constant knowing of the latest states of said member chains. Where on the other hand variations of the notary scheme require verification of the latest state by validators. To put it simply, the difference lies in that notary schemes have to confirm information external to their protocol, where multichains are in a constant state of knowing ergo internal confirmation. </span></p>
<p><span>If we are to look at this in regard to security, if the members chains’ data is part of the core protocol (as proposed by Polkadot and Block Collider – multichain technology) the states of those chains is secured by the entire protocol and therefore verification and use of that data is as secure as the protocol. As popularly proposed, notary schemes, that verify states based on interoperable actions triggered, are separate chains or nodes bridging information between chains to the core protocol. The security then of the bridges is independent of the core protocol making it more vulnerable to attacks. A slight exception lies with projects like ARK, where the whole protocol acts as one cohesive notary scheme for all member chains, where the bridges are not separate chains or clusters of nodes. By doing so the resources utilised are not split to many disparate smaller bridges, ensuring more security overall. </span></p>
<p><b>The second problem:</b><span> Methods of interoperability – Trust based on validators vs no validators</span></p>
<p>To understand this problem we must first understand the core tenets of which blockchain technology was built upon and what it ultimately means to the end user. The tenets or pillars can be thought of as four topics:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Objective networks</span></li>
<li><span>Unforgeable costliness </span></li>
<li><span>True Trustless Networks</span></li>
<li><span>True permissionless networks</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>For a more comprehensive breakdown of these topics that act as the pillars of Decentralised Protocols please read <a href="https://spec-rationality.com/scalability-overview/#merits_of_pow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. </span></p>
<p><span>“The most valued merit of the trustless model is its ability to preserve the network’s independence from any entity acting as a trusted third party (government, bank or otherwise) with the power to tamper with, control or censor any element of the network.</span></p>
<p><span>It is this distinguishing feature of PoW, that enables it to offer a level of trustlessness beyond other consensus mechanisms which rely on the use of validators. A validator in a blockchain is a “human element” or third party to whom the network cedes some degree of trust to confirm the verification of transactions. “… To understand the spectrum of trustlessnes, one can imagine that centralised systems which completely relinquish trust to a third party are on one end and variations of PoW that eliminate trust are on the other. The various validator reliant consensus mechanisms lie in the middle, redistributing rather than eliminating trust.” </span></p>
<p><span>As alluded to above, trust minimization is a crucial element of blockchain technology, where PoW variations (work based schemes) like the multichain proposed by Block Collider (PoD) attempt to preserve the network as trustless. Further mining (wok based) schemes preserve objectivity and unforegable costliness, something that is compromised when we move towards validator based consensus.</span></p>
<p><span>Notary schemes by design have the underlying consensus as validator based (refer to <a href="https://spec-rationality.com/methods-interoperability/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Methods of Interoperability</a>). Multichains need not only be work based either, for example Polkadot has taken the route of multichains with a validator based consensus. (Note: Polkadot only creates the multichain between compatible parachains) </span></p>
<p><b>The third problem:</b><span> Access to interoperability – &nbsp;conditions to participate</span></p>
<p><span>Access can be defined by the ability for a interoperable technology to incorporate chains with as low an entry threshold as possible. Access can viewed than as a spectrum that is defined by the conditional requirement to participate.</span></p>
<p><span>The ideal is that if a new protocol/chain were to come into existence that it is able to join an …</span></p></div></div></section></div>

Since the most recent resurgence of deep learning <span>in</span> <span>2012</span><span>,</span> a lion's share of new ML libraries <span>and</span> frameworks have been created<span>.</span> 
The ones that have stood the test of time <span>(</span>PyTorch<span>,</span> Tensorflow<span>,</span> ONNX<span>,</span> etc<span>)</span> are backed by _massive_ corporations<span>,</span> <span>and</span> likely aren't going away anytime soon<span>.</span> 

This also presents a problem<span>,</span> however<span>,</span> <span>as</span> the deep learning community has diverged <span>from</span> popular traditional ML software libraries like scikit<span>-</span>learn<span>,</span> XGBoost<span>,</span> <span>and</span> LightGBM<span>.</span> 
When it comes time <span>for</span> companies to bring multiple models <span>with</span> different software <span>and</span> hardware assumptions into production<span>,</span> things get<span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span>hairy<span>.</span> 
<span>-</span> How do you keep ML inference code <span>[</span>DRY<span>]</span><span>(</span>https<span>:</span><span>//</span>en<span>.</span>wikipedia<span>.</span>org<span>/</span>wiki<span>/</span>Don<span>%</span>27t_repeat_yourself<span>)</span> when some models are tensor<span>-</span>based <span>and</span> others are vector<span>-</span>based?
<span>-</span> How do you keep the inference runtime efficiency of your traditional models competitive<span>,</span> <span>as</span> GPU<span>-</span>based neural networks start to run circles around them?
</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p>
I know<span>,</span> I know<span>.</span> Using microservices <span>in</span> Kubernetes can solve the design pattern issue to an extent by keeping things de<span>-</span>coupled<span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span><span>if</span> that's even what you want?

But<span>,</span> I think that really just ignores the problem<span>.</span> What <span>if</span> you want to seamlessly deploy either an XGBoost regressor <span>or</span> fully<span>-</span>connected DNN <span>as</span> your service's main output? 
Sure<span>,</span> you could hot<span>-</span>swap the hardware your service launches onto<span>.</span> How about the code? 

Are you going to ram <span>in</span> a dressed<span>-</span>up version of an <span>if</span><span>-</span><span>else</span> switch to use one software framework vs the other<span>,</span> depending on the model <span>type</span>? 
</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p>
Well<span>,</span> <span>for</span> a lot of use cases<span>,</span> _it is_<span>.</span> 
However<span>,</span> there's still a huge gap between problems requiring neural nets <span>and</span> problems that can be sufficiently solved <span>with</span> more traditional models<span>.</span> 
For the more traditional models<span>,</span> don<span>'t you still want to be able to use the latest and greatest computational frameworks to power your model'</span>s predictions? 
This would allow you to scale your model _up_ more before you need to resort to scaling it _out_ via redundant instances<span>.</span>

</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p>Microsoft research has introduced `hummingbird` to bridge this gap between CPU<span>-</span>oriented models <span>and</span> tensor<span>-</span>oriented models<span>.</span> 
The library simply takes <span>any</span> of our already<span>-</span>trained traditional models <span>and</span> returns a version of that model built on tensor computations<span>.</span> 
Hummingbird aims to solve two core concerns <span>with</span> current ML applications<span>:</span>

<span>1</span><span>.</span> Traditional <span>and</span> deep learning software libraries have different abstractions of their basic computational unit <span>(</span>vector vs tensor<span>)</span><span>.</span>
<span>2</span><span>.</span> As a result of this difference<span>,</span> traditional ML libraries do <span>not</span> receive the same performance gains <span>as</span> hardware accelerators <span>(</span>read<span>:</span> GPUs<span>)</span> improve<span>.</span>

<p>Back in February 2020, Blelloch and Wei submitted this cool preprint: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.07053">Concurrent Reference Counting and Resource Management in Wait-free Constant Time</a>.
Their work mostly caught my attention because they propose a wait-free implementation of hazard pointers for safe memory reclamation.<sup id="fnref:but-also"><a href="#fn:but-also">1</a></sup>
<a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~tomhart/papers/tomhart_thesis.pdf">Safe memory reclamation (PDF)</a> is a key component in lock-free algorithms when garbage collection isn’t an option,<sup id="fnref:it-is-gc"><a href="#fn:it-is-gc">2</a></sup>
and <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.395.378&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">hazard pointers (PDF)</a> let us bound the amount of resources stranded by delayed cleanups much more tightly than, e.g., <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-579.pdf">epoch reclamation (PDF)</a>.
However the usual implementation has a <em>loop</em> in its <a href="https://www.iecc.com/gclist/GC-algorithms.html">read barriers (in the garbage collection sense)</a>,
which can be annoying for code generation and bad for worst-case time bounds.</p>
<p>Blelloch and Wei’s wait-free algorithm eliminates that loop… with a construction that stacks <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.09671">two emulated primitives—atomic copy, itself implemented with strong LL/SC—</a>on top of what real hardware offers.
I see the real value of the construction in proving that wait-freedom is achievable,<sup id="fnref:not-obvious"><a href="#fn:not-obvious">3</a></sup>
and that the key is atomic memory-memory copies.</p>
<p>In this post, I’ll show how to flatten down that abstraction tower into something practical with a bit of engineering elbow grease,
and come up with wait-free alternatives to the usual lock-free hazard pointers
that are competitive in the best case.
Blelloch and Wei’s insight that hazard pointers can use any wait-free atomic memory-memory copy lets us improve the worst case
without impacting the common case!</p>
<p>But first, what are hazard pointers?</p>
<h2 id="hazard-pointers-and-the-safe-memory-reclamation-problem">Hazard pointers and the safe memory reclamation problem</h2>
<p>Hazard pointers were introduced by <a href="https://dblp.uni-trier.de/pers/m/Michael:Maged_M=.html">Maged Michael</a>
in <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.395.378&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">Hazard Pointers: Safe Memory Reclamation for Lock-Free Objects (2005, PDF)</a>,
as the first solution to reclamation races in lock-free code.
The introduction includes a concise explanation of the safe memory reclamation (SMR) problem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When a thread removes a node, it is possible that some other contending thread—in the course of its lock-free operation—has earlier read a reference to that node, and is about to access its contents. If the removing thread were to reclaim the removed node for arbitrary reuse, the contending thread might corrupt the object or some other object that happens to occupy the space of the freed node, return the wrong result, or suffer an access error by dereferencing an invalid pointer value. […] Simply put, the memory reclamation problem is how to allow the memory of removed nodes to be freed (i.e., reused arbitrarily or returned to the OS), while guaranteeing that no thread accesses free memory, and how to do so in a lock-free manner.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, a solution to the SMR problem lets us know when it’s safe to
<em>physically release</em> resources that used to be owned by a linked data structure,
once all links to these resources have been removed from that data structure (after “logical deletion”).
The problem makes intuitive sense for dynamically managed memory,
but it applies equally well to any resource (e.g., file descriptors),
and its solutions can even be seen as extremely read-optimised reader/writer locks.</p>
<p>The basic idea behind Hazard Pointers is to have
each thread publish to permanently allocated<sup id="fnref:stable-alloc"><a href="#fn:stable-alloc">4</a></sup> hazard pointer records (HP records) the set of resources (pointers) it’s temporarily borrowing from a lock-free data structure.
That’s enough information for a background thread to snapshot the current list of resources that have been logically deleted but not yet physically released (the limbo list),
scan all records for all threads,
and physically release all resources in the snapshot that aren’t in any HP record.</p>
<p>With just enough batching of the limbo list, this scheme can be practical:
in practice, lock-free algorithms only need to pin a few (usually one or two) nodes at a time to ensure memory safety. As long as we avoid running arbitrary code while holding hazardous references, we can bound the number of records each thread may need at any one time.
Scanning the records thus takes time roughly linear in the number of active threads, and we can amortise that to constant time per deleted item by waiting until the size of the limbo list is greater than a multiple of the number of active threads.<sup id="fnref:even-with-pinned-nodes"><a href="#fn:even-with-pinned-nodes">5</a></sup></p>
<p>The tricky bit is figuring out how to reliably publish to a HP record without locking.
Hazard pointers simplify that challenge with three observations:</p>
<ol>
<li>It’s OK to have arbitrary garbage in a record (let’s disregard language-level<sup id="fnref:or-hw-level"><a href="#fn:or-hw-level">6</a></sup> undefined behaviour), since protected values are only ever subtracted from the limbo list: a garbage record simply doesn’t protect anything.</li>
<li>It’s also OK to leave a false positive in a record: correctness arguments for hazard pointers already assume each record keeps a different node (resource) alive, and that’s the worst case.</li>
<li>1 and 2 mean it doesn’t matter what pinned value we read in a record whose last update was started after we snapshotted the limbo list: resources in the limbo list are unreachable, so freshly pinned resources can’t refer to anything in the snapshot.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is where the clever bit of hazard pointers comes in:
we must make sure that any resource (pointer to a node, etc.) we borrow from a lock-free data structure is immediately protected by a HP record.
We can’t make two things happen atomically without locking.
Instead, we’ll <em>guess</em><sup id="fnref:guessing-is-fine"><a href="#fn:guessing-is-fine">7</a></sup> what resource we will borrow,
publish that guess,
and then actually borrow the resource.
If we guessed correctly, we can immediately use the borrowed resource;
if we were wrong, we must try again.</p>
<p>On an ideal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequential_consistency">sequentially consistent</a> machine,
the pseudocode looks like the following. The <code>cell</code> argument points to the resource we wish to acquire
(e.g., it’s a reference to the <code>next</code> field in a linked list node), and <code>record</code> is the hazard pointer
record that will protect the value borrowed from <code>cell</code>.</p>

<p>We need a store/load fence in <code>R1</code> to make sure the store to the record (just above <code>R1</code>) is visible by the time the second read (<code>R2</code>) executes. Under the <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/weakmemory/x86tso-paper.tphols.pdf">TSO memory model implemented by x86 chips (PDF)</a>,
this fence is the only one that isn’t implicitly satisfied by the hardware.
It also happens that fences are best implemented with atomic operations
on x86oids,
so we can eliminate the fence in <code>R1</code>
by replacing the store just before <code>R1</code> with an atomic exchange (fetch-and-set).</p>
<p>The slow cleanup path has its own fence that matches <code>R1</code> (the one in <code>R2</code>
matches the mutators’ writes to <code>cell</code>).</p>

<p>We must make sure all the values in the limbo list we grab in <code>C1</code>
were added to the list (and thus logically deleted) before we read any
of the records in <code>C2</code>, with the acquire read in <code>C1</code>
matching the store-load fence in <code>R1</code>.</p>
<p>The following sequence diagrams shows how the fencing guarantees that any
iteration of <code>hp_read_explicit</code> will fail if it starts before <code>C1</code>
and observes a stale value.
If the read succeeds, the ordering between <code>R1</code> and <code>C1</code> instead
guarantees that the cleanup loop will observed the pinned value
when it reads the record in <code>C2</code>.</p>

<p>This all works, but it’s slow:<sup id="fnref:travis-says-its-fine"><a href="#fn:travis-says-its-fine">9</a></sup> we added an <em>atomic</em> write instruction (or worse, a fence) to a read-only operation. We can do better with a little help from our operating system.</p>
<h2 id="injecting-fences-with-os-support">Injecting fences with OS support</h2>
<p>When we use fences or memory ordering correctly, there should be
an implicit pairing between fences or ordered operations: we use fencing to
enforce an ordering (one must fully execute before or after another,
overlap is forbidden) between pairs of instructions in different
threads. For example, the pseudocode for hazard pointers with
explicit fencing and memory ordering paired the store-load fence in
<code>R1</code> with the acquisition of the limbo list in <code>C1</code>.</p>
<p>We only need that pairing very rarely, when a thread actually executes the
cleanup function. The amortisation strategy guarantees we don’t scan records all the time, and we can always increase the amortisation factor if we’re
generating tiny amounts of garbage very quickly.</p>
<p>It kind of sucks that we have to incur a full fence on the fast read
path, when it only matches reads in the cleanup loop maybe as rarely
as, e.g., once a second. If we waited long enough on the slow path, we could
<a href="https://pvk.ca/Blog/2019/01/09/preemption-is-gc-for-memory-reordering">rely on events like preemption or other interrupts to insert a barrier</a>
in all threads that are executing the read-side.</p>
<p>How long is “enough?”
Linux has the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/membarrier.2.html"><code>membarrier</code> syscall</a>
to block the calling thread until (more than) long enough has elapsed,
Windows has <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-flushprocesswritebuffers">the similar <code>FlushProcessWriteBuffers</code></a>, and
on other operating systems, we can probably <a href="https://github.com/pkhuong/barrierd">do something useful with scheduler statistics</a> or ask for a new syscall.</p>
<p>Armed with these new blocking system calls, we can replace the store-load fence in <code>R1</code> with a compiler barrier, and execute a slow <code>membarrier</code>/<code>FlushProcessWriteBuffers</code> after <code>C1</code>.
The cleanup function will then wait long enough<sup id="fnref:arguably-lock-ful"><a href="#fn:arguably-lock-ful">10</a></sup> to ensure that any

<p>It's after this first checkmark goes into my notebook that my day starts to wobble. The rest of the day whizzes by in a blur. As the day comes to a close, the list of unchecked boxes glares back at me.</p>
<p>I've been thinking more about why this happens. And what I've found is single tasks get are easy to do. It's the transition between tasks when things start to crumble.</p>
<p>If I was able to check a box and move onto the next one, I would get through my list every time.</p>
<p>But checking a box usually comes with a break. And that breaks leads me to Twitter. And Twitter can lead me anywhere. </p>
<p>Before I know it, I'm lost in transition.</p>

<p>I lose myself in transition for three reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>The next to-do is vague</li>
<li>The next to-do uses a different kind of thinking</li>
<li>The list itself is too long</li>
</ol>
<p>When the next task is vague, it can be intimidating. So I've started being very specific with the exact action that gets the task started.</p>
<p>Instead of "☐ Write Blog Post" I scribble "☐ Open Notion and Brainstorm Three Sentence Ideas."</p>
<p>When the next task uses a different kind of thinking, there is a high start-up cost. Switching from programming to writing looks doable on paper, but never works out in practice.</p>
<p>So I've started grouping together tasks which require the same way of thinking. I then structure my day around these groups, slotting the tasks accordingly. I'm most creative and productive early in the morning, but more thoughtful and analytical in the afternoon. When I'm through my morning creative tasks, I'll take a long walk and get ready for the analytical part of my day.</p>
<p>Finally, when the list is too long, I sometimes give up entirely. There are few more ambitious people than my 9 PM self setting my intentions for the next day. So recently I've started splitting my list into two lists — a "have-to-do" and a "nice-to-do."</p>
<p>The "have-to-do" is always shorter than the "nice-to-do." As long I check off each of the "have-to-dos," I feel good at the end of the day. Anything from the "nice-to-do" is just bonus points.</p>
<p>The last thing I'm doing when my list is too long is to simply shorten it. I look the list up and down, find the two lowest leverage tasks, and cross them out. It always pains me to do this, but I know it's the right thing to do. </p>

<p>We all want to get more done. If you experience similar feelings about your to-do list, give these tactics a try. The subtle changes have made me more effective and leave me closing each day a bit more fulfilled.</p>

  <p><span>07 Jul 2020</span></p>
  <p>In 2017, the twilight days of my PhD in computational physics, I found myself ready to leave academia behind.
While my research was interesting, it was not what I wanted to pursue full time.
However, I was happy with the type of work I was doing, contributing to research software, and I wanted to apply myself in a more industrial setting.</p>

<p>Many postgraduates face a similar decision.
A <a href="https://royalsociety.org/-/media/Royal_Society_Content/policy/publications/2010/4294970126.pdf">study conducted by the Royal Society</a> in 2010 reported that only 3.5% of PhD graduates end up in permanent research positions in academia.
Leaving aside the roots of the <a href="https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2013/10/26/big-data-brain-drain/">brain drain</a> on Universities, it is a compelling statistic that the <em>vast</em> majority of post-graduates end up leaving academia for industry at some point in their career.
It comes as no surprise that there are a growing number of bootcamps like <a href="https://www.s2ds.org/index.html">S2DS</a>, <a href="https://faculty.ai/">faculty.ai</a>, and <a href="https://insightfellows.com/data-science">Insight</a> that have sprung up in response to this trend, for machine learning and data science especially.
There are also no shortage of helpful <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17944306">forum discussions</a> and <a href="https://pascalbugnion.net/blog/from-academia-to-data-science.html">blog posts</a> outlining what you should do in order to “break into the industry”, as well as many that relate the personal experiences of those who ultimately made the switch.</p>

<p>While the advice that follows in this blog post is directed at those looking to change careers, it would equally benefit those who opt to remain in the academic track.
Since the environment and incentives around building academic research software are very different to those of industry, the workflows around the former are, in general, not guided by the same engineering practices that are valued in the latter.</p>

<p>That is to say: <em>there is a difference between what is important in writing software for research, and for a user-focused, software product</em>.
Academic research software prioritises scientific correctness and flexibility to experiment above all else in pursuit of the researchers’ end product: published papers.
Industry software, on the other hand, prioritises maintainability, robustness, and testing as the software (generally speaking) <em>is</em> the product.</p>

<p>However, the two tracks share many common goals as well, such as catering to “users”, emphasising performance and <a href="https://codecheck.org.uk/">reproducibility</a>, but most importantly both ventures are <em>collaborative</em>.
Arguably then, both sets of principles are needed to write and maintain high-quality research software.
Incidentally, the <a href="https://society-rse.org/about/">Research Software Engineering</a> group at Invenia is uniquely tasked with incorporating all these incentives into the development of our research packages in order to get the best of both worlds.
But I digress.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-wish-i-knew-in-my-phd">What I wish I knew in my PhD</h2>
<p>Most postgrads are self-taught programmers and learn from the same resources as their peers and collaborators, which are ostensibly adequate for academia.
Many also tend to work in isolation on their part of the code base and don’t require merging with other contributors’ work very frequently.
In industry, however, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration">continuous integration</a> underpins many development workflows. 
Under a continuous delivery cycle, a developer benefits from the prompt feedback and cooperation of a full team of professional engineers and can, therefore, learn to implement engineering best practices more efficiently.</p>

<p>As such, it feels like a missed opportunity for universities not to promote good engineering practices more and teach them to their students.
Not least because having stable and maintainable tools are, in a sense, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons#Digital_commons">“public goods”</a> in academia as much as industry.
Yet, while everyone gains from improving the tools, researchers are not generally incentivised to invest their precious time or effort on these tasks unless it is part of some well-funded, high-impact initiative.
As Jake VanderPlas <a href="https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2013/10/26/big-data-brain-drain/">remarked</a>: “any time spent building and documenting software tools is time spent not writing research papers, which are the primary currency of the academic reward structure”.</p>

<p>Speaking personally, I learned a great deal about conducting research and scientific computing in my PhD; I could read and write code, squash bugs, and I wasn’t afraid of getting my hands dirty in monolithic code bases.
As such, I felt comfortable at the command line but I failed to learn the basic tenets of proper code maintenance, unit testing, code review, version control, etc., that underpin good software engineering.
While I had enough coding experience to have a sense of this at the time, I lacked the awareness of what I needed to know in order to improve or even where to start looking.</p>

<p>As is clear from the earlier statistic, this experience is likely not unique to me.
It prompted me to share what I’ve learned since joining Invenia 18 months ago, so that it might guide those looking to make a similar move.
The advice I provide is organised into three sections: the first recommends ways to learn a new programming language efficiently<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>; the second describes some best practices you can adopt to improve the quality of the code you write; and the last commends the social aspect of community-driven software collaborations.</p>

<h2 id="lesson-1-hone-your-craft">Lesson 1: Hone your craft</h2>
<p><strong>Practice</strong>: While clichéd, there is no avoiding the fact that it takes consistent practice <a href="https://norvig.com/21-days.html">over many many years</a> to become masterful at anything, and programming is no exception.</p>

<p><strong>Have personal projects</strong>: Practicing is easier said than done if your job doesn’t revolve around programming.
A good way to get started either way is to undertake personal side-projects as a fun way to get to grips with a language, for instance via <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a>, <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle Competitions</a>, etc.
These should be enough to get you off the ground and familiar with the syntax of the language.</p>

<p><strong>Read code</strong>: Personal projects on their own are not enough to improve. 
If you really want to get better, you’ve got to read other people’s code: a lot of it.
Check out the repositories of some of your favourite or most used packages—particularly if they are considered “high quality”<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>.
See how the package is organised, how the documentation is written, and how the code is structured.
Look at the open issues and pull requests.
Who are the main contributors? Get a sense of what is being worked on and how the open-source community operates.
This will give you an idea of the open issues facing the package and the language and the direction it is taking.
It will also show you how to write <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/84102/what-is-idiomatic-code"><em>idiomatic code</em></a>, that is, in a way that is natural for that language.</p>

<p><strong>Contribute</strong>: You should actually contribute to the code base you use.
This is by far the most important advice for improving and I cannot overstate how instructive an experience this is.
By getting your code reviewed you get prompt and informative feedback on what you’re doing wrong and how you can do better.
It gives you the opportunity to try out what you’ve learned, learn something new, and improves your confidence in your ability.
Contributing to open source and seeing your features being used is also rewarding, and that starts a positive feedback loop where you feel like contributing more.
Further, when you start applying for jobs in industry people can see your work, and so know that you are good at what you do (I say this as a person who is now involved in reviewing these applications).</p>

<p><strong>Study</strong>: Learning by experience is great but—at least for me—it takes a deliberate approach to formalise and cement new ideas.
Read well-reviewed books on your language (appropriate for your level) and reinforce what you learn by tackling more complex tasks and venturing <a href="https://www.geeksaresexy.net/2016/12/20/comfort-zone-comic/">outside your comfort zone</a>.
Reading blog posts and articles about the language is also a great idea.</p>

<p><strong>Ask for help:</strong> Sometimes a bug just stumps you, or you just don’t know how to implement a feature.
In these circumstances, it’s quicker to reach out to experts who can help and maybe teach you something at the same time.
More often than not, someone has had the same problem or they’re happy to point you in the right direction.
I’m fortunate to work with Julia experts at Invenia, so when I have a problem they are always most helpful.
But posting on public fora like <a href="https://slackinvite.julialang.org/">Slack</a>, <a href="https://discourse.julialang.org/">Discourse</a>, or <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a> is an option we all have.</p>

<h2 id="lesson-2-software-engineering-practices">Lesson 2: Software Engineering Practices</h2>
<p>With respect to the environment and incentives in industry surrounding code maintainability, robustness, and testing, there are certain practices in place to encourage, enable, and ensure these qualities are met.
These key practices can turn a collection of scripts into a fully implemented package one can use and rely upon with high confidence.</p>

<p>While there are without doubt many universities and courses that teach these practices to their students, I find they are often neglected by coding novices and academics alike, to their own disadvantage.</p>

<p><strong>Take version control seriously:</strong> <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> is a programming staple for version control, and while it is tempting to disregard it when working alone, without it you soon find yourself creating <a href="https://uidaholib.github.io/get-git/1why.html">convoluted naming schemes</a> for your files; frequently losing track of progress; and wasting time looking through email attachments for the older version of the code to replace the one you just messed up.</p>

<p><a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> can be <a href="https://xkcd.com/1597/">a little intimidating</a> to get started, but once you are comfortable with the basic commands (fetch, add, commit, push, pull, merge) and a few others (checkout, rebase, reset) you will never look back.
<a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>’s utility, meanwhile, extends far beyond that of a programmatic hosting service; it provides <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/wikis/">documentation hosting</a>, <a href="https://help.github.com/en/actions/building-and-testing-code-with-continuous-integration/about-continuous-integration">CI/CD pipelines</a>, and many other features that enable efficient cross-party collaboration on an <em>enterprise</em> scale.</p>

<p>It cannot be overstated how truly indispensable <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> and <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> are when it comes to turning your code into functional packages, and the earlier you adopt these the better.
It also helps to know how <a href="https://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a> works, so you will know what it means to increment a package version from 1.2.3 to 1.3 and why.</p>

<p><strong>Organise your code</strong>: In terms of packaging your code, get to know the typical package folder structure.
Packages often contain src, docs, and test directories, as well as standard …</p></div></div></div>

		<p>My 10 Year Game Development Journey</p>
		<h4>June 24, 2020</h4>
        <hr>
	
		<p>Hello! My name is Nico Tuason and I'm an indie game developer from the Philippines. This year marks the 10th year of my game development journey. I'd like to share my entire story with you - my failures, triumphs, and major life events. I hope it will be worth your time.</p>
		<h2>2010 - A Leap of Faith</h2>
		<p>At the start of the decade, I was 23 years old and had just left my job at a local web development company. I had been working there for a year and was making about <strong>22,000 PHP</strong> or <strong>440 USD</strong> a month. The pay was not bad for a fresh grad, but I was unproductive and unhappy. Additionally, my girlfriend of 4 years was dropping plenty of hints of her desire to get married, and 20k pesos just wasn't going to cut it.</p>
		<p>Being Asian (Filipinos are Asian too!) it was not acceptable for my parents that I was not either working or studying, so I applied for a post-grad Multimedia course in Singapore. Little did my parents know, shortly after applying I had received a rejection letter. I would keep telling them that "my application was pending", because I was secretly working on a passion project - my first game.</p>
		<p>To me, video games were more than a fun past-time. They were my refuge during hard and lonely times growing up. I spent almost all my free time playing games on the family PC. One of the first video games I ever received was Star Wars Rebel Assault II, a short but cinematic game. I played through it on every difficulty multiple times. After that, my parents bought me Command and Conquer and my fate was sealed. Growing up, I spent all my money on upgrading the family PC and buying boxed copies of games.</p>
		<p>Being in web development, I learned to use Flash to create banner ads and menu navigation for our clients. Out of necessity, I also had to learn how to create attractive UI and graphic design. While researching, I stumbled across a website called FGL.com (Flash Game License) that allowed anyone in the world to upload a Flash game and have sponsor websites bid on the right to put their logo on the game. They showed what some of the games were bidding for - <strong>3000 USD</strong>,  <strong>5000 USD</strong>! To me this looked like an incredible amount of money. There were even some mythical games going for <strong>10,000 - 20,000 USD</strong>! I devoured all the tutorials I could find. Before I had an idea for a game, I wanted to see if I could do a basic animation.</p>

		<div><p><img src="http://nicotuason.com/img/10years/male1_walk_side.gif"></p><p>My first animation</p>
		</div>
		
		<p>It looked good! But I knew I wanted to make a game in the isometric perspective. I had fallen in love with classic isometric RPGs like Baldur's Gate, and I was sure that any game I made had to be in isometric view. So, I repeated the animation but from different angles.</p>

		<div><p><img src="http://nicotuason.com/img/10years/male1_sheet.gif"></p><p>My first spritesheet</p>
		</div>

		<div><p><img src="http://nicotuason.com/img/10years/iso_walk.gif"></p><p>Resulting animation</p>
		</div>

		<p>The next step was to see if it actually looked good moving around a surface.</p>

		<div><p><img src="http://nicotuason.com/img/10years/walk_test1.gif"></p><p>Yes!</p>
		</div>

		
		<p>I didn't know any game math, but I knew from tutorials that in an isometric perspective, a square is twice as wide as it is tall. So, any movement along the y-axis had to be halved. This made for a very simple isometric transform:</p>
		<div>
		<p>screen_x = x;</p>
		<p>screen_y = y*0.5;</p>
		</div>
		<p>Ok, after I got the basics down, It was time for a stress test.</p>

		<div><p><img src="http://nicotuason.com/img/10years/walk_test2.gif"></p><p>Stress me out</p>
		</div>
		
		<p>By now I was waking up at 6am and jumping right into the computer to make more sprite sheets. It was intoxicating. Every day I felt a step closer to realizing my dream of making a game.</p>
		<p>I did a bunch more tests and I found the fastest way to draw stuff on screen using Flash was to use a method called "copyPixels". The tutorials called it "bitmap blitting" but I only cared that it was super fast. Most flash games those days used Vector graphics - very sharp and smooth shapes. This was a huge burden on CPUs around the world (and eventually led to Flash's demise), but by using copyPixels my game could have way more stuff onscreen than other Flash games.</p>

		<div><p><img src="http://nicotuason.com/img/10years/walk_test3.gif"></p><p>Walk all over me</p>
		</div>
		
		<p>Ok, the tech looked good, so it was time to start thinking about what kind of game this was going to be. At the time, tower defense was a very popular genre, and I loved RTS games. I decided that the simplest route was to make a bunch of enemies walk in one direction while you try to stop them, with lasers. Taking heavy influence from Starship Troopers and Starcraft, I created a suitable enemy that you could have fun slaughtering by the hundreds.</p>

		<div><p><img src="http://nicotuason.com/img/10years/walk_test4.gif"></p><p>Blizzard dont sue pls</p>
		</div>
		
		<p>I kept developing the game like this, working on one thing at a time and making sure it was acceptable before moving on to the next thing. If I don't stop myself, I could probably talk about every little detail that went into making the game, but we still have a long way to go.</p>
		<p><strong>7 months later...</strong></p>
		<p>I had a small but complete game on my hands. I called it "Desert Moon".</p>

		<div><p><img src="http://nicotuason.com/img/10years/desert_moon.gif"></p><p>C'mon you apes, you wanna live forever!?</p>
		</div>

		
		<p>It was time to put the game up for bidding. I uploaded the game to FGL.com and proceeded to not sleep for the next few days. I wish I took more screenshots of this process. I think at the time the bidding period lasted 1 month. After many tens-of-thousands of "reload page" clicks later, there was finally a winning bid. It was <strong>8500 USD</strong>! I don't know how to describe how I felt, but my head must have grown very large. I showed my girlfriend and my parents, the latter finally accepting that I wasn't going to grad school.</p>
		<p>My girlfriend, Terry, also loved Tower Defense games and she was the main play-tester during development. This was a very happy time for us.</p>
		<p>All I had to do was slap the Sponsor's logo onto the game and we could release it to the world.</p>


		<div><p><img src="http://nicotuason.com/img/10years/maxgames_intro.gif"></p><p>Thank you business daddy!</p>
		</div>

		<p>The game launched on the major Flash game portals (Kongregate, Newgrounds, Armorgames, etc.) on December 11, 2010, and thus began my gamedev career.</p>
		


		<h2>2011 - Indie to Employee</h2>
		<p>Flash games are free, so once a game is out there's not much you can do to make more money besides make another game. It takes a while before securing a sponsor and the game finally being released so I immediately started on another game called "Solarmax".</p>

		<div><p><img src="http://nicotuason.com/img/10years/solarmax_test.gif"></p><p>First prototype</p>
		</div>
		
		<p>One of my favorite games of all time is Homeworld. There's just nothing like the epic feeling of the fate of your entire race, your entire <em>history</em>, resting on your shoulders. I couldn't do anything near a 3D RTS like Homeworld, but there was a popular genre of Flash game called "Swarm" defense / strategy. I think Phage Wars was the most popular of these. I thought it would work well translated into epic space battles.</p>

		<div><p><img src="http://nicotuason.com/img/10years/solarmax.gif"></p><p>Scientifically accurate depiction of orbital mechanics</p>
		</div>
		
		<p>I spent some time learning 3D modeling software for this game. I was quite tired of pixel art after doing all the spritesheets for Desert Moon and exporting 3D models as a png sequence seemed like a good way to get all the angles needed for an isometric perspective without having to manually draw every frame.</p>

		<div><p><img src="http://nicotuason.com/img/10years/solarmaxb.gif"></p><p>pew pew!</p>
		</div>
		
		<p>The game was completed in 3 months, much faster than my first project! I was able to get it sponsored for <strong>6000 USD</strong>. A bit less than before, but it was a "non-exclusive" sponsorship meaning I could still sell "sitelocked" versions of the game. This was a common practice back then of having 1 version that would spread to all the portals, and many "sitelocked" versions that had a different site's branding but could only be played on their site.</p>
		<p>I planned to keep building small games like this as my skills grew, but then something unexpected happened. I got a job!</p>
		<p>I got an email from the CEO of a tech company in the U.S. who had seen my games and was looking for a flash programmer for a game they were making. Who knew CEOs were randomly playing flash games and emailing the developer?</p>
		<p>My first response was actually to decline the offer, because number 1 - I'm a dunce, and number 2 - I thought I could just make small flash games forever. Luckily this guy was persistent and I would still get to work on Flash games, but with more team members! And and... they were going to fly me out to the States to attend <strong>GDC</strong>!!!</p>

		<div><p><img src="http://nicotuason.com/img/10years/gdc1.jpg"></p><p>I'm in GDC!</p>
		</div>

		<div><p><img src="http://nicotuason.com/img/10years/gdc2.jpg"></p><p>I'm in San Francisco!</p>
		</div>

		<div><p><img src="http://nicotuason.com/img/10years/gdc4.jpg"></p><p>Another time, baby</p>
		</div>
		
		<p>I'm so grateful to the people who made this happen! As a young game dev, going to GDC is like going to see the Vatican if you're ultra-Catholic. I was over the moon.</p>
		<p>Plus, the salary... it was <strong>3000 USD</strong> a month! A U.S.-based salary for someone living in the Philippines! I have to tell you, I really thought I was hot shit at the time.</p>
		<p>After I got my first paycheck, I proposed to my girlfriend Terry, who I was sure would say yes because the year before her lawyer-auntie cornered me and demanded a deposition on why I had not married her niece yet.</p>
		<p>Things were going great!</p>



		<h2>2012 - Life... finds a way</h2>
		<p>In January, Terry and I got married! I was imagining that the next few years would be just the two of us, traveling together to different countries... making up for all the times we weren't allowed to travel together because the Philippines is a conservative country and it would be scandalous.</p>

		<div><p><img src="http://nicotuason.com/img/10years/wedding.jpg"></p><p>Our wedding Jeepney</p>
		</div>
		
		<p>Instead, 9 months later we had our first child! Which is great too I guess haha... ha.</p>

		<div><p><img src="http://nicotuason.com/img/10years/andres.jpg"></p><p>Yup, that's a baby alright</p>
		</div>
		
		<p>Becoming a dad mostly just means that a full-night's sleep is a thing of the past, at least in the beginning. I was working from home anyway so the arrangement was very doable.</p>
		<p>Meanwhile, work as an employee started out great and we produced lots of small games in a short time frame. Over the months though things started to drag. I felt myself becoming less and less productive. I missed the feeling of always learning something new and putting what I learned into a game. Maybe I'm just a bad employee?</p>
		<p>To prove how bad of an employee I was, here are some prototypes I made <em>mostly</em> during my free time.</p>
		<p>An isometric aerial dogfighting game in a fantasy WW1 setting:</p>

        <p>July 7, 2020</p>
		
<p>Like many other Github users, I am not a big fan of their recent repository page redesign. In my mind it seems like a change just for the sake of change – the original UI worked perfectly fine.</p>



<p><em>Sigh.</em></p>



<p>I was planning on recreating the original Github layout with custom CSS but decided against it. Tackling such a big change in design would cause headaches if Github ever changed even one simple class or id on a given element. My final conclusion was to just improve their new design with my own personal quality of life improvements.</p>



<p>So, enough chit-chat. Let’s get into it.</p>



<h2>Current Design (2020)</h2>



<p>The default view for a repo’s “homepage” and ticket items are locked at a set <code>max-width</code>. This causes some visual strain in comparison to the full-width headers and navigations directly above. I use a decently sized montior when using your app Gitub – <strong>let me use all the space available to me</strong>!</p>

<h2>My Improvements</h2>



<p>Your users shouldn’t have to jump around the page looking for the important information they want to see. Resetting the basic repo information to the left side of the screen allows user to <em>instantly</em> read-up on the project details. (This design is catered towards left-to-right readers mind you).</p>



<p>We now also utilize all the available screen space, dependent on the user’s browser window size.</p>



<figure><img src="https://uglyduck.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screenshot_2020-07-07-icon-font-dont-seem-to-render-properly-%C2%B7-Issue-13-%C2%B7-tabler-tabler-icons-1024x509.png" alt="" srcset="https://uglyduck.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screenshot_2020-07-07-icon-font-dont-seem-to-render-properly-%C2%B7-Issue-13-%C2%B7-tabler-tabler-icons-1024x509.png 1024w, https://uglyduck.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screenshot_2020-07-07-icon-font-dont-seem-to-render-properly-%C2%B7-Issue-13-%C2%B7-tabler-tabler-icons-300x149.png 300w, https://uglyduck.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screenshot_2020-07-07-icon-font-dont-seem-to-render-properly-%C2%B7-Issue-13-%C2%B7-tabler-tabler-icons-768x382.png 768w, https://uglyduck.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screenshot_2020-07-07-icon-font-dont-seem-to-render-properly-%C2%B7-Issue-13-%C2%B7-tabler-tabler-icons-1536x764.png 1536w, https://uglyduck.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screenshot_2020-07-07-icon-font-dont-seem-to-render-properly-%C2%B7-Issue-13-%C2%B7-tabler-tabler-icons.png 1908w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>The repo’s “homepage” now uses all available space</figcaption></figure>



<p>We make similar updates to the ticket item view and also remove the out-of-place <code>margin-bottom</code> from the project link headers.</p>



<figure><img src="https://uglyduck.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screenshot_2020-07-07-icon-font-dont-seem-to-render-properly-%C2%B7-Issue-13-%C2%B7-tabler-tabler-icons3-1024x509.png" alt="" srcset="https://uglyduck.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screenshot_2020-07-07-icon-font-dont-seem-to-render-properly-%C2%B7-Issue-13-%C2%B7-tabler-tabler-icons3-1024x509.png 1024w, https://uglyduck.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screenshot_2020-07-07-icon-font-dont-seem-to-render-properly-%C2%B7-Issue-13-%C2%B7-tabler-tabler-icons3-300x149.png 300w, https://uglyduck.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screenshot_2020-07-07-icon-font-dont-seem-to-render-properly-%C2%B7-Issue-13-%C2%B7-tabler-tabler-icons3-768x382.png 768w, https://uglyduck.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screenshot_2020-07-07-icon-font-dont-seem-to-render-properly-%C2%B7-Issue-13-%C2%B7-tabler-tabler-icons3-1536x764.png 1536w, https://uglyduck.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screenshot_2020-07-07-icon-font-dont-seem-to-render-properly-%C2%B7-Issue-13-%C2%B7-tabler-tabler-icons3.png 1908w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Github  ticket items now align better with their header siblings</figcaption></figure>



<h2>Try It Yourself!</h2>



<p>You can very easily implement these custom CSS changes with an extension for the browser of your choice:</p>



<ul><li>Firefox: <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/">Stylus</a></li><li>Chrome: <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylebot/oiaejidbmkiecgbjeifoejpgmdaleoha">Stylebot</a></li></ul>



<p>Then create a new custom CSS file to target <code>github.com</code> with the following properties:</p>



<pre><code>.container-xl {
    max-width: 100%;
}

.repository-content .gutter-condensed.gutter-lg {
    flex-direction: row-reverse !important;
}

.repository-content #discussion_bucket .gutter-condensed.gutter-lg {
    flex-direction: row !important;
}

.repohead &gt; div.d-flex {
    margin-bottom: 0 !important;
}

#show_issue {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
}

.repository-content #discussion_bucket,
#partial-discussion-header {
    width: 100%;
}</code></pre>



<p>That’s it! Feel free to improve on this and further make it your own! I might create a new repo for this project if I end up adding even more improvements to the core CSS.</p>

The bug allowed attackers to do infinitely large transactions without paying any extra fees. The vulnerability was the result of a buggy implementation of fee calculation in the FRAME runtime of Substrate. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker could’ve added their manga collection to the payload of a simple transaction without paying any extra fees. This would’ve resulted in the manga collection becoming a part of the blockchain, forever. Cheapest decentralized blockchain storage!</p><p>Sample fees for a 2 megabyte payload before the bug-fix:<br><img src="https://mudit.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screenshot-from-2020-07-05-10-50-18.png" alt="" srcset="https://mudit.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screenshot-from-2020-07-05-10-50-18.png 494w, https://mudit.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screenshot-from-2020-07-05-10-50-18-300x86.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 494px) 100vw, 494px"><br></p><p>Sample fees for a 2 megabyte payload after the bug-fix:<br><img src="https://mudit.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screenshot-from-2020-07-05-10-52-32.png" alt="" srcset="https://mudit.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screenshot-from-2020-07-05-10-52-32.png 439w, https://mudit.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screenshot-from-2020-07-05-10-52-32-300x98.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 439px) 100vw, 439px"></p><p>Please note that this bug is now fixed and a runtime upgrade has been deployed to Kusama, Polkadot and Polymesh Aldebaran testnet.</p><h3>Bug details</h3><p>The transaction fee is supposed to increase as the size of the transaction increases. There’s a constant <code>TransactionByteFee</code> that is supposed to be added to the total fee for every byte of data contained in the transaction. This would’ve prevented the above exploit from working but due to a very tiny bug in the code, this fee was not being applied under certain circumstances.</p><p>The fee was being calculated as:</p><pre><code>fee = base_fee + targeted_fee_adjustment * (len_fee + weight_fee);</code></pre><ul><li><code>base_fee</code> is a static fee applied to all transactions (analogous to the 21k gas fee in Ethereum).</li><li><code>targeted_fee_adjustment</code> is a fee multiplier that is based on recent activity on the chain. If the recent blocks have been full, this multiplier will increase and if the recent blocks have been empty, this multiplier will decrease.</li><li><code>len_fee</code> is the extra fee charged for the size of a transaction. Transactions with bigger payloads will have a bigger <code>len_fee</code>.</li><li><code>weight_fee</code> is based on the compute requirements of a transaction. A more resource-intensive transaction will have a higher <code>weight_fee</code>.</li></ul><p>There are two problems here. Firstly, the <code>len_fee</code> is being affected by the <code>targeted_fee_adjustment</code> multiplier. However, as per the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://research.web3.foundation/en/latest/polkadot/Token%20Economics.html#setting-transaction-fees" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">W3F docs</a>, it should not be. The second problem is that the <code>targeted_fee_adjustment</code> multiplier was allowed to go as low as zero. The combined result of these two problems is that when the chain is not busy, no <code>len_fee</code>, and <code>weight_fee</code> are charged and anyone can submit large transactions to inflate the blockchain size.</p><h3>Reproduction steps</h3><p>The vulnerability was very easy to exploit. All you had to do was to send a huge payload alongside a valid transaction. Sample reproduction steps are as follows:</p><ol><li>Open the Polkadot UI – <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"></a><a href="https://polkadot.js.org/apps">https://polkadot.js.org/apps</a>.</li><li>Click on the “Extrinsics” tab on the left.</li><li>Select the “remark” extrinsic from the “system” frame.</li><li>Click on “file upload” on the right and upload your payload (anything you want to put on the blockchain).</li><li>Submit the transaction.</li></ol><h3>Resolution</h3><p>The <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/6334" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fix</a> was twofold but simple. Firstly, the <code>len_fee</code> was moved out so that it was not affected by the <code>targeted_fee_adjustment</code> multiplier. The new fee formula is</p><pre><code>fee = base_fee + len_fee + targeted_fee_adjustment * weight_fee;</code></pre><p>In addition, the <code>targeted_fee_adjustment</code> was adjusted so that the minimum multiplier is one instead of zero. This brings the implementation closer to what the W3F research suggested. It makes exploit like the one mentioned in this post impossible.</p><h3>Timeline</h3><ul><li>Reported – 17/06/2020</li><li>Acknowledged – 17/06/2020</li><li>Fixed – 17/06/2020</li></ul><h3>Addendum</h3><p>I’d like to thank Parity Technologies for being responsive and fixing the bug within hours of the report. Kusama and Polkadot were upgraded soon after the bug fix. Parity offered me a 250 USD bug bounty for this disclosure which they have kindly donated to the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.smilefoundationindia.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Smile Foundation</a> on my behalf. I’d like to thank them for that as well.</p><p>Everyone is welcome to try their hands on Kusama and report any bugs to Parity. Below is a direct quote from Fredrik, CTO at parity:</p><blockquote><p>We are thankful to Mudit for reporting this to us. We created Kusama for this specific purpose of testing the underlying economic assumptions before they reach Polkadot and are happy that it worked in this case. We encourage everyone to continue hunting bugs on Kusama and reporting them to us!</p><cite>Fredrik Harrysson, CTO at Parity</cite></blockquote><p>Happy hacking!</p></div></div></article></div>]]>

            <h5>What is it?</h5>
            <p>An opportunity to implement, extend and apply trending <a href="#papers">papers</a> in the community.
               All of the projects can run on a free
               <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Colab GPU</a>, local CPU or the paper comes with a library which
               you can use on your own smaller datasets. However, there are no compute restrictions so feel free to work with what you have. Your projects don't have to be exact implementations (most of the
               <a href="#papers">papers</a> already come with code) but instead you can do minimal implementations or creative explorations of the major/novel aspects in the paper.
               Also this is <b>not a competition</b> but instead an opportunity for the community to come together, learn and help each other.
               You can work in teams and projects can include any of the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Research</b>: reimplement the entire or parts of a paper. (<a href="https://madewithml.com/projects/704/training-batch-norm-and-only-batch-norm/" target="_blank">example</a>)</li>
              <li><b>Product</b>: create applications or libraries using the paper. (<a href="https://madewithml.com/projects/1001/tabnet-attentive-interpretable-tabular-learning/" target="_blank">example</a>)</li>
              <li><b>Tutorial</b>: simplify and extend concepts in the paper. (<a href="https://madewithml.com/projects/1583/adversarial-latent-autoencoders/" target="_blank">example</a>)</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>Why should you participate?</h5>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Learn</b>: one of the best ways to learn is to reimplement or extend research. You'll learn from others working on the same paper and you'll develop skills for implementing research.</li>
              <li><b>Build</b>: build projects with a level of <a href="#criteria">completeness</a> that will showcase your skills.</li>
              <li><b>Share</b>: share and receive credit for your work in the community.</li>
              <li><b><span>🔥</span> Spotlight</b>: your profile and showcase your work in front of industry leaders, give a talk at the
                <a href="https://www.wandb.com/ml-community" target="_blank">Salon</a>, chance to be a
                <a href="https://www.wandb.com/authors" target="_blank">W&amp;B Author</a>, have your work featured in the
                <a href="https://app.wandb.ai/gallery" target="_blank">Gallery</a>, and receive a Raspberry Pi.</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>What is the duration?</h5>
            <p>The official duration is from <b>Friday, July 3rd, 2020</b> to <b>Friday, July 31, 2020</b>.
              This is our first time experimenting with something like this so we may choose to extend the time
              based on feedback and the progress we see.</p>

<p><span>A</span>n Instagram caption might seem superfluous, but that string of words, emojis, and hashtags beneath the square of an acai bowl or handcrafted necklace can, to consumers, be the difference between following an account, buying a product, or idly scrolling by. A photo captures attention, but captions can sustain it. On a platform where attention is currency, a well-worded caption can increase engagement in the form of comments and likes, making those posts more prominently displayed via Instagram’s algorithm.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over <a href="https://business.instagram.com/">a billion</a> Instagram accounts are active every month; 90% of these accounts follow at least one business. Instagram brought in about <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-04/instagram-generates-more-than-a-quarter-of-facebook-s-sales?srnd=premium&amp;sref=QYWxDQ1o">$20 billion</a> in advertising revenue in 2019, and the platform is full of people primed to shop. According to <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/030915/how-instagram-makes-money.asp">Investopedia</a>, about 70% of shopping enthusiasts say they turn to Instagram for “product discovery.” As of June 23, Instagram <a href="https://business.instagram.com/blog/upcoming-changes-commerce-eligibility-requirements/">expanded</a> its commerce eligibility requirements to allow more types of businesses and influencers to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.in/tech/news/influencers-and-just-about-anyone-else-can-soon-make-their-instagram-accounts-shoppable/articleshow/76538712.cms">sell products</a> inside the app.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some brands, understanding the importance of a carefully curated Instagram feed, are outsourcing the production of these captions and hashtags to a far-flung cadre of writers in Pakistan, Bangladesh, and elsewhere. Hiring freelancers in one-off pops is cheaper than bringing in writers as contractors or staffers. And in other countries, small payments go further: $5 might buy a coffee in the United States, but in Pakistan, that amount will buy three coffees. To brand managers with social media accounts to maintain and countless other tasks to occupy their workdays, it’s a cheap outsourcing of digital labor. To the writers, this work can be a lifeline, a side gig, or a boost to their career in words.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.fiverr.com/">Fiverr</a>, an online marketplace for freelance services founded by Micha Kaufman a decade ago, is one place where writers gather to hawk their literary wares. A search for “<a href="https://www.fiverr.com/search/gigs?query=Instagram%20captions&amp;source=top-bar&amp;search_in=everywhere&amp;search-autocomplete-original-term=instagram%20captions">Instagram captions</a>” on Fiverr yields nearly 200 results. <a href="https://www.freelancer.com/search/users/?ngsw-bypass=&amp;w=f&amp;q=instagram%20captions">Freelancer</a> is similar, though the marketplace for Instagram caption writers is smaller. On <a href="https://www.upwork.com/">Upwork</a>, freelancers respond to job postings directly and charge rates hourly. <a href="https://contentfly.com/">ContentFly</a>, a Canadian company, pre-vets content writers for businesses. On <a href="https://world.taobao.com/">Taobao</a>, the Chinese e-commerce platform, <a href="https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_4726881">one</a> <a href="https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/99265044">service</a> sells templates for custom writing — including love letters, new business announcements, copy for WeChat businesses, greetings, and thank yous — to companies and individuals.</p>



<p>It’s unclear how many people are working in this gig economy of social media caption writers, but it is widespread. (In the U.S. and U.K.,&nbsp;the phenomenon gained notoriety in 2019 when writer Natalie Beach published an <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2019/09/the-story-of-caroline-calloway-and-her-ghostwriter-natalie.html">essay</a> about her work <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/12/style/caroline-calloway-interview-natalie-beach.html">writing Instagram captions</a> for the controversial influencer Caroline Calloway.) The market is mostly geared toward English-language businesses or influencers who are too busy or cash-strapped to write captions in-house.</p>



<p>On Fiverr, sellers often <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/bismaa2/create-beautiful-instagram-or-fb-captions-for-just-1-dollar?context_referrer=search_gigs&amp;source=top-bar&amp;ref_ctx_id=f3f1f069-468f-48d2-9027-3648bef17d92&amp;pckg_id=1&amp;pos=19">advertise</a> their writing skills in English: “5 unique captions for $10! Send me 5 photos and I will create unique, out of the box captions related to your image OR brand!” writes user <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/bismaa2">bismaa2</a> in Pakistan, promising customers more online engagement. Another seller, <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/silverliningsco">silverliningsco</a>, is a writer from Bangladesh. She started her freelance career as a content writer before transitioning to digital marketing. For her, writing captions was a way of stitching together her past experience. “A well-written caption is nothing unless it’s on the same page as digital trends,” she told <em>Rest of World</em>. Before writing a post, she researches keywords and hashtags to find out what’s trending. She pointed to the pandemic as an example: “Most of my recent copy regarded staying at home, maintaining distance, washing your hands, staying close to your friends and family, and so on.”&nbsp;</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“A well-written caption is nothing unless it’s on the same page as digital trends.”</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Many of the writers skew younger: <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/rubabb">Rubabb</a> is a 22-year-old from Pakistan with a bachelor’s degree in business administration. Since she was in university, she had wanted to work on developing trademarks and slogans, and a friend recommended Fiverr. Many of her clients, she said, are from the U.K. and Spain, and she currently offers three tiers of service: basic (five captions for $5, delivered in two days with one revision), standard (eight captions for $10, delivered in three days with one revision), and premium (30 captions for $15, delivered in three days with one revision). Her recent gigs included writing <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mrgreensflorida/">captions</a> for a produce provider that operates in Florida and Texas, and for a cafe that <a href="http://v/">serves</a> acai bowls and coffee some 7,600 miles away from her, in Oakland, California.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just as nearly any item can be sold online, any item can be written about: <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/ccshermaine">ccshermaine</a>, a Fiverr seller from Singapore, has written captions for a desert-themed <a href="https://www.instagram.com/theanmonresortbintan/?hl=en">glamping resort</a> in Indonesia (“Kickback and relax – this isn’t a competition on who’s most productive! We all need a break to recharge once in awhile”) and a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/pillar_urbanluxury/">streetwear brand</a> in New York City (“Summer is still a couple months away but it’s never too early to get yourself a brand new one-piece swimsuit!”). She also manages the Instagram account of an online pet store as well as that of a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nekomori.co/">cat salon</a>, both in Singapore.</p>



<p>Sometimes, writing isn’t even required. Sellers such as <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/pr_junction">pr_junction</a> in India simply source quotes for customers rather than writing captions themselves. “I use the best ones available on the net,” he told <em>Rest of World</em>. For $30, for example, a buyer can purchase 450 dog or cat quotes that <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/pr_junction">pr_junction</a> attaches to “high quality, royalty free images” in 640 x 640 pixels. A business logo or URL can be added to the image file. He also makes custom quote posters with <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/pr_junction/sets/72157712951808897/">phrases</a> that range from the mundane, “Take from your past what is useful to you and let the rest go,” to the distinctive, “The breeze at dawn has secrets to tell you.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>For many sellers on Fiverr, answering questions about their work was, at best, a minor inconvenience. What they were after, first and foremost, was to be hired for a gig.</p>



<p>“Do let me know if you need my services related to creative writing! :)” Aruj wrote when I asked if she had anything else to add.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rubabb closed out our interview with a question: “So would you hire me?”&nbsp;</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>I look back at running a Perfect Dark fan site, and speak to one of Perfect Dark’s original designers, David Doak, about the evolving significance of online fan content for the games industry. &nbsp;</p><div>
		<p>It took recent articles celebrating the 20 year anniversary of Perfect Dark to jolt my memory back to those times. Perfect Dark was Rare’s highly anticipated follow-up to the ground-breaking GoldenEye, both on the Nintendo 64. I was 16 when it was released. I don’t remember the game as well as I should, considering that at the time I was running, along with my brother Jake and best friend Alex, what was probably the most popular Perfect Dark fan site in the world.</p>
<figure data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_1014" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1014"><img data-attachment-id="1014" data-permalink="https://zephauerbach.com/2020/07/07/what-was-it-like-to-run-a-perfect-dark-fan-site-in-1999/pdark-square4/" data-orig-file="https://zephauerbach.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/pdark-square4.jpg" data-orig-size="1123,812" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="PDark Square4" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://zephauerbach.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/pdark-square4.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://zephauerbach.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/pdark-square4.jpg?w=840" src="https://zephauerbach.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/pdark-square4.jpg?w=840&amp;h=607" alt="" width="840" height="607" srcset="https://zephauerbach.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/pdark-square4.jpg?w=840&amp;h=607 840w, https://zephauerbach.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/pdark-square4.jpg?w=150&amp;h=108 150w, https://zephauerbach.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/pdark-square4.jpg?w=300&amp;h=217 300w, https://zephauerbach.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/pdark-square4.jpg?w=768&amp;h=555 768w, https://zephauerbach.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/pdark-square4.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=740 1024w, https://zephauerbach.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/pdark-square4.jpg 1123w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1014">Alex: “We were fifteen years ahead of the curve on energy-saving dark website themes that offend the eyes.”</figcaption></figure>
<p>Previously, I’ve always left my nostalgia there: a hazy feeling of pride for something created in a time long gone. But this time I’ve decided to return. I’m using the wonderful <a href="https://archive.org/web/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wayback Machine</a> from the Internet Archive to revisit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010405000849/http:/www.pdark.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PDark.com in its glory days</a>. I feel like I’m diving down to the depths, to shine a torch around an old sunken wreck.</p>

<p>This is one of the first specimens I’ve dredged up:</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="958" data-permalink="https://zephauerbach.com/2020/07/07/what-was-it-like-to-run-a-perfect-dark-fan-site-in-1999/staff-profile-reduced/" data-orig-file="https://zephauerbach.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/staff-profile-reduced.png" data-orig-size="693,1847" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Staff Profile reduced" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://zephauerbach.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/staff-profile-reduced.png?w=113" data-large-file="https://zephauerbach.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/staff-profile-reduced.png?w=384" src="https://zephauerbach.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/staff-profile-reduced.png?w=840" alt="" srcset="https://zephauerbach.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/staff-profile-reduced.png 693w, https://zephauerbach.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/staff-profile-reduced.png?w=56 56w, https://zephauerbach.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/staff-profile-reduced.png?w=113 113w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px"></p>
<p>I barely remember that we had <em>any </em>volunteer staff members, never mind an army of 26 of them (and I mean no disrespect to any of them: at the time they meant the world to us). When I show this to Alex it is clear he has forgotten too. “We peaked too soon,” he says. He means that now, at 36, neither of us has an extensive list of staff working under us, like we did when we were 16. He means that our site clearly was a big deal, once.</p>
<p>I hope that looking back at it sheds a light on how gaming fans used to experience the internet during that period. For every big game that came out there were dozens of sites just like PDark.com, and these sites meant a huge amount to a great number of people.</p>
<hr>
<p>In the summer holidays of 1999, Alex and I – both 15-years-old and best friends – were still high off the success of selling 80 copies of our 150-page <em>The Golden Files</em> (“Crikey… Not so much a fanzine as a frighteningly comprehensive homage to <em>GoldenEye.</em>” – The Fanzine Farm, N64 Magazine, April 1999). Jake – our senior at 17-years-old – suggested we make a site for Perfect Dark. We needed no convincing. It is hard to believe now, but at this point Jake was the only one of us who had the internet (he kept it in the box-room of our family home). We poured our hearts into the site over the next few months: Jake coding, Alex creating artwork and music (our site originally had a MIDI soundtrack), me writing previews and articles like ‘<em>GoldenEye vs. Half-Life’</em>. Soon we had a steady stream of visitors and emails coming in.</p>

<p><span>And we loved it. It gave all three of us a seemingly limitless creative outlet. There was no formality to how we did things, and there is no evidence we were bothered about having to keep up with schoolwork at the same time. In an article I wrote in November 1999 I summarised our experience: </span>“And it is outrageous fun, making such a site, getting such responses and knowing that what could be the best game ever made is that little bit more documented and hyped up.”</p>
<p>Looking back over my writing is cringey AF. I was a geeky adolescent boy writing mainly for geeky adolescent boys, aping the style of gaming mag journalism at the time: at least 3 attempts at comedy per sentence, buckets of hyperbole, with awkward elbow nudges of surrealism, pranking and baiting. But what our updates lacked in quality was made up for by enthusiasm and regularity. As Jake remembers: “I think we tried to update every day, even if there was no news… and I’m sure there was no news on most days.”</p>
<p>If you were a gamer in 1999, you probably spent a lot of your time on sites just like PDark.com. Nowadays if you’re interested in a game you might check out a wiki on Fandom for the facts, YouTube for some tutorials, Reddit for the funny discussions – not to mention the Twitch streams. None of these existed back then. Yes, there were commercial sites becoming established, like IGN and GameSpot, but these were competing with game-specific fan sites – typically run by teenagers from their bedrooms – that often attracted more devoted followers.</p>
<p>What did fan sites mean to a games company like Rare at this time? Very little, it seems. I had the good fortune of talking recently with one of Perfect Dark’s original designers, David Doak. It didn’t surprise me that the designers of Perfect Dark hadn’t spent much time following fan sites, but it did surprise me just how unimportant the internet in general was to them at the time.</p>
<p>David recalls: “Nobody had the internet on their desktops at Rare. It was kept in a locked box basically – in ‘the internet room’. I particularly remember an announcement from Square that Final Fantasy would go exclusive for the PlayStation. I’d seen it on some forum and I’d mentioned it to someone. Then I had Tim Stamper [one of the founders of Rare] phoning up and saying, ‘How did you know about that?’ He knew about it himself because he’d heard it directly from Nintendo. He hadn’t realised the news had spread over the internet within a few hours. They had very little perception that that channel existed.”</p>
<p>Albeit of little concern to Rare, the flourishing ecosystem of fan-sites around Perfect Dark was growing, and it was connected together by all-important Links pages (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010602145416/http:/www.pdark.com/links/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here’s a late example of ours</a>). Looking back at my updates, I seemed obsessed with editing our links and curating our list of ‘Affiliates’ (they got their colourful banners up too!). &nbsp;Jake explains: “Search engines were different then. This was before Google. I spent a lot of time getting us good positions in search engines, but people used search engines far less, sticking more to sites they knew and what those sites recommended. And you’d boost your search engine rankings by swapping links with others. There was also a ‘Perfect Dark Top 25 Gateway’ that we got a lot of our traffic from and we tried our best to game.”</p>
<p>I adored this sprawling community of like-minded content creators. But an inevitable consequence of close relationships with rival sites was the occasional feud. For example, in&nbsp; January 2000 we updated: “Don’t Be Fooled Guys: By PD Central’s propaganda ploy that is. They have been rumouring at an ‘exclusive interview’ for some time now [with Rare], although all I want to say is that we’ve had evidence to suggest the claim can’t be backed up.” There was backlash and fans took sides. As we forged allegiances and enmities, dramas played out like WrestleMania. (For the record: PD Central did finally get that interview.)</p>
<hr>
<p>A rapid increase in connectivity was a crucial feature of this time. The internet was in the process of transforming from being a collection of static resources (in our case: guides, screenshots, editorials etc), to a place of relentless interaction. When we started PDark.com we were probably thinking: ‘what a funky way to publish a fanzine!’ By mid-2000 it was something else entirely: a living, breathing community.</p>
<p>You can see this development in the features we added over time. Near the start, from September 1999, we ran weekly round-ups of replies to emails that were sent in (and there were many). Notice how at this time we were very much the gatekeepers of interaction: all discussions went through us.</p>

<p>This was not dissimilar to what gaming journalism had looked like in magazines since the 1980s. David Doak reminisces: “When I was growing up, as a teenager, we had a ZX Spectrum. There was obviously no internet. But a lot of the format of the magazines like <em>Crash</em> was very much: a letters page and people asking for cheat codes and help. Then when we move to something like your fan site, that becomes like a church newsletter or something. Someone’s gathering stuff up and sending it out. It’s got its own community but it doesn’t work peer-to-peer, it’s centralised. You’re moderating it.”</p>
<p>David also remembers how, at the time of Perfect Dark, magazines were still more important to game developers than websites, but this was in the process of changing: “N64 Magazine, Edge Magazine – a lot of us were avid readers of Edge. It meant a lot to us in the GoldenEye team when it got a good review in Edge. But with mags there was always a big latency: the time to print. That’s why getting information gradually made that shift to being online, because the web’s ‘time to print’ is just so much faster and immediate.”</p>
<p>Another traditional method we used for keeping the community engaged was running competitions like ones for Perfect Dark fan-art and fan-fiction.</p>

<p>To increase interaction we experimented with ICQ chat sessions (“we’re mainly online between 6pm and 12pm GMT”) and in December our own PDark.com Chatroom, using a Java applet and mIRC.</p>
<p>In April 2000 we gave visitors the ability to post comments to our news updates. This was an instant hit. This feature – now ubiquitous – was clearly new and exciting for most of our visitors. (For something that now seems universal, it’s surprising to note that posting comments <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comments_section" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only appeared on the web in 1998</a>.)</p>

<p>But it was our forums that became the beating heart of the site. We experimented with many different platforms for message boards (such as EzBoard and vBulletin) before settling on using an Ultimate Bullet Board. This provided a fluid user-to-user experience (again, now ubiquitous) that was a far cry from the ‘wait until they publish a weekly roundup of our emails…’ that had characterised our site just months before.</p>
<p>It is amazing we all found so much to talk about. The game – much-delayed – was still very much <em>not </em><em>out. </em>New info from Rare was in scarce supply, but the scraps that we threw to our ravenous visitors were savoured and their bones picked over.

  <p>Go’s <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/32825">infamous error handling</a> has caught quite the attention from outsiders to the programming language, often touted as one of the language’s most questionable design decisions. If you look into any project on Github written in Go, it’s almost a guarantee you’ll see the lines more frequently than anything else in the codebase:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>if</span><span> </span><span>err</span><span> </span><span>!=</span><span> </span><span>nil</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>err</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>Although it may seem redundant and unnecessary for those new to the language, the reason errors in Go are treated as first-class citizens (values) has a deeply-rooted history in programming language theory and the main goal of Go as a language itself. Numerous efforts have been made to change or improve how Go deals with errors, but so far, one proposal is winning above all others:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/QvF1AbH.png" alt="Image"></p>

<p>- <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/32825">Leave if err != nil alone!</a></p>

<h2 id="gos-error-philosophy">Go’s error philosophy</h2>

<p>Go’s philosophy regarding error handling forces developers to incorporate errors as first class citizens of most functions they write. Even if you ignore an error using something like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>func</span><span> </span><span>getUserFromDB</span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>User</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>error</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>...</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span>

</span><span>func</span><span> </span><span>main</span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>user</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>_</span><span> </span><span>:=</span><span> </span><span>getUserFromDB</span><span>()</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>Most linters or IDEs will catch that you’re ignoring an error, and it will certaintly be visible to your teammates during code review. However, in other languages, it may not be clear that your code is not handling a potential exception in a <code>try catch</code> code block, being completely opaque about handling your control flow.</p>

<p>If you handle errors in Go the standard way, you get the benefits of:</p>

<ol>
  <li>No hidden control-flows</li>
  <li>No unexpected <code>uncaught exception</code> logs blowing up your terminal (aside from actual program crashes via panics)</li>
  <li>full-control of errors in your code as <em>values</em> you can handle, return, and do anything you want with</li>
</ol>

<p>Not only is the syntax of <code>func f() (value, error)</code> easy to teach to a newcomer, but also a standard in any Go project which ensures consistency.</p>

<p>It’s important to note Go’s error syntax does not <strong>force</strong> you to handle every error your program may throw. Go simply provides a pattern to ensure you think of errors as critical to your program flow, but not much else. At the end of your program, if an error occurs, and you find it using <code>err != nil</code>, and your application doesn’t do something actionable about it, you’re in trouble either way - <strong>Go can’t save you</strong>. Let’s take a look at an example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>if</span><span> </span><span>err</span><span> </span><span>:=</span><span> </span><span>criticalDatabaseOperation</span><span>();</span><span> </span><span>err</span><span> </span><span>!=</span><span> </span><span>nil</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>// Only logging the error without returning it to stop control flow (bad!)</span><span>
    </span><span>log</span><span>.</span><span>Printf</span><span>(</span><span>"Something went wrong in the DB: %w"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>err</span><span>)</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>

</span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>err</span><span> </span><span>:=</span><span> </span><span>saveUser</span><span>(</span><span>user</span><span>);</span><span> </span><span>err</span><span> </span><span>!=</span><span> </span><span>nil</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Errorf</span><span>(</span><span>"Could not save user: %w"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>err</span><span>)</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>If something goes wrong and <code>err != nil</code> in calling <code>criticalDatabaseOperation()</code>, we’re not doing anything with the error aside from logging it! We might have data corruption or an otherwise unexpected issue that we are not handling intelligently, either via retrying the function call, canceling further program flow, or in worst-case scenario, shutting down the program. Go isn’t magical and can’t save you from these situations. Go only provides a standard approach for returning and using errors as values, but you still have to figure out how to handle the errors yourself.</p>

<h3 id="how-other-languages-do-it-throwing-exceptions">How other languages do it: throwing exceptions</h3>

<p>In something like the Javascript Node.js runtime, you can structure your programs as follows, known as throwing <code>exceptions</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>try</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>criticalOperation1</span><span>();</span>
    <span>criticalOperation2</span><span>();</span>
    <span>criticalOperation3</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span> <span>catch</span> <span>(</span><span>e</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>error</span><span>(</span><span>e</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If an error occurs in any of these functions, the stack trace for the error will pop up at runtime and will be logged to the console, but there is no explicit, programmatic handling of what went wrong.</p>

<p>Your <code>criticalOperation</code> functions don’t need to explicitly handle error flow, as any exception that occurs within that try block will be raised at runtime along with a stack trace of what went wrong.
A benefit to exception-based languages is that, compared to Go, even an unhandled exception will still be raised via a stack trace at runtime if it occurs. In Go, it is possible to not handle a critical error at all, which can arguably be much worse. Go offers you full control of error handling, but also <strong>full responsibility</strong>.</p>

<p>EDIT: Exceptions are definitely not the only way other languages deal with errors. Rust,  for example, has a good compromise of using option types and pattern matching to find error conditions, leveraging some nice syntactic sugar to achieve similar results.</p>

<h3 id="why-go-doesnt-use-exceptions-for-error-handling">Why Go doesn’t use exceptions for error handling</h3>

<h4 id="the-zen-of-go">The Zen of Go</h4>

<p>The Zen of Go mentions two important proverbs:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Simplicity matters</li>
  <li>Plan for failure, not success</li>
</ol>

<p>Using the simple <code>if err != nil</code> snippet to all functions which return <code>(value, error)</code> helps ensure failure in your programs is thought of <em>first and foremost</em>. You don’t need to wrangle with complicated, nested <code>try catch</code> blocks which appropriately handle all possible exceptions being raised.</p>

<h4 id="exception-based-code-can-often-be-opaque">Exception-based code can often be opaque</h4>

<p>With exception-based code, however, you’re forced to be aware of every situation in which your code could have exceptions without actually handling them, as they’ll be caught by your <code>try catch</code> blocks. That is, it encourages programmers to never check errors, knowing that at the very least, some exception will be handled automatically at runtime if it occurs.</p>

<p>A function written in an exception-based programming language may often look like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>item</span> <span>=</span> <span>getFromDB</span><span>()</span>
<span>item</span><span>.</span><span>Value</span> <span>=</span> <span>400</span>
<span>saveToDB</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>)</span>
<span>item</span><span>.</span><span>Text</span> <span>=</span> <span>'price changed'</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This code does nothing to ensure exceptions are properly handled. Perhaps the difference between making the code above become aware of exceptions is to switch the order of <code>saveToDB(item)</code> and <code>item.Text = 'price changed</code>, which is <strong>opaque</strong>, hard to reason about, and can encourage some lazy programming habits. In functional programming jargon, this is known as the fancy term: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28992625/exceptions-and-referential-transparency/28993780#28993780">violating referential transparency</a>. This <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/?p=36693">blog post</a> from Microsoft’s engineering blog in 2005 still holds true today, namely:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My point isn’t that exceptions are bad.
My point is that exceptions are too hard and I’m not smart
enough to handle them.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="benefits-of-gos-error-syntax">Benefits of Go’s error syntax</h2>

<h3 id="easy-creation-of-actionable-error-chains">Easy creation of actionable error chains</h3>

<p>A superpower of the pattern <code>if err != nil</code> is how it allows for easy error-chains to traverse a program’s hierarchy all the way to where they need to be handled. For example, a common Go error handled by a program’s <code>main</code> function might read as follows:</p>

<p>[2020-07-05-9:00] ERROR: Could not create user: could not check if user already exists in DB: could not establish database connection: no internet</p>

<p>The error above is (a) clear, (b) actionable, (c) has sufficient context as to what layers of the application went <em>wrong</em>. Instead of blowing up with an unreadable, cryptic stack trace, errors like these that are a result of factors we can add human-readable context to, and should be handled via clear error chains as shown above.</p>

<p>Moreover, this type of error chain arises naturally as part of a standard Go program’s structure, likely looking like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// In controllers/user.go</span><span>
</span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>err</span><span> </span><span>:=</span><span> </span><span>db</span><span>.</span><span>CreateUser</span><span>(</span><span>user</span><span>);</span><span> </span><span>err</span><span> </span><span>!=</span><span> </span><span>nil</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Errorf</span><span>(</span><span>"could not create user: %w"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>err</span><span>)</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>

</span><span>// In database/user.go</span><span>

        </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Errorf</span><span>(</span><span>"could not check if user already exists in db: %w"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>err</span><span>)</span><span>
    </span><span>}</span><span>
    </span><span>...</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>

</span><span>func</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>db</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span>Database</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>DoesUserExist</span><span>(</span><span>user</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span>User</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>error</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>

    </span><span>}</span><span>
    </span><span>...</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>

</span><span>func</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>db</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span>Database</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>Connected</span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>error</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>

    </span><span>}</span><span>
    </span><span>...</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The beauty of the code above is that each of these errors are completely namespaced by their respective function, are informative, and only handle responsibility for what they are aware of. This sort of error chaining using <code>fmt.Errorf("something went wrong: %w", err)</code> makes it trivial to build awesome error messages that can tell you <em>exactly</em> what went wrong based on how <em>you</em> defined it.</p>

<p>On top of this, if you want to also attach a stack trace to your functions, you can utilize the fantastic <a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/pkg/errors">github.com/pkg/errors</a> library, giving you functions such as:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>errors</span><span>.</span><span>Wrapf</span><span>(</span><span>err</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"could not save user with email %s"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>email</span><span>)</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>which print out a stack trace <em>along</em> with the human-readable error chain you created through your code. If I could summarize the most important pieces of advice I’ve received regarding writing idiomatic error handling in Go:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Add stack traces when your errors are actionable to developers</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Do something with your returned errors, don’t just bubble them up to main, log them, and forget them</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Keep your error chains unambiguous</strong></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>When I write Go code, error handling is the one thing I <em>never</em> worry about, because errors themselves are a central aspect of every function I write, giving me full control in how I handle them safely, in a readable manner, and responsibly.</p>

  <p>“if …; err != nil” is something you’ll probably type if you write go. I don’t think it’s a plus or a negative. It gets the job done, it’s easy to understand, and it empowers the programmer to do the right thing when the program fails. The rest is up to you.</p>

            <p>Fractally broken a definition.</p>

<p><strong>Fractal</strong>: <em>A never ending pattern.</em><br><strong>Broken</strong>: <em>Not functioning properly.</em></p>

<p>This is a phrase I heard from <a href="https://kragniz.eu/">Louis Taylor</a> a few years ago and I absolutely love it. <em>Edit: I have been told that the original source may have been <a href="https://eev.ee/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/">https://eev.ee</a>.</em></p>

<p>It means that however much you zoom in or out from a thing it has faults. In an almost recursive manner.</p>

<p>It really sums up some projects. You look at the whole system and think some very bad words. Then you look at a component and think the same. Finally, you end up reading individual lines of code and the words continue flowing.</p>

<p>I also composed a limerick:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There once was a very bad project,</p>

  <p>With a fixed cost, scope and budget,</p>

  <p>It grew fractally broken,</p>

  <p>And the severs began smokin’,</p>

  <p>so none of the dev’s wanted to touch it.</p>

			<p><b>Pulsar vs Kafka</b> – which one is better? This blog post explores <b>pros and cons, popular myths, and non-technical criteria to find the best tool for your business problem</b>.</p>
<p>My discussions are usually around Apache Kafka and its ecosystem as I work for Confluent. <b>The only questions I got about Pulsar in the last years came from Pulsar committers and contributors</b>. They asked me deep technical questions so as to be able to explain where Kafka sucks and why Pulsar is the much better option. Discussions about this topic on platforms like Reddit are typically very opinionated, often inaccurate, and brutal. The following is my point of view based on years of experience with open source streaming platforms.</p>
<h2 id="tech-comparisons-are-the-new-black-kafka-vs-middleware-event-streaming-and-api-platforms">Tech comparisons are the new black: Kafka vs. Middleware, Event Streaming and API Platforms</h2>
<p>Tech comparisons are meant to <b>guide people to choose the right solution and architecture for their business problem</b>. There is no all-rounder, and there should be no bias. Choose the right tool for the problem.</p>
<p>However, <strong>technical comparisons are almost always biased</strong>. Even if the author does not work for a vendor and is an “independent” consultant, he or she is still likely to have a biased opinion from past experiences and knowledge, whether purposely or unknowingly. Still, comparisons from different perspectives are useful, and we’ve seen Apache Pulsar discussed in a few places on the internet, so I wanted to share my personal views of how Kafka and Pulsar compare. <strong>I work for Confluent, the leading experts behind Apache Kafka and its ecosystem</strong>, so keep that in mind, but the aim of this post is not to provide opinion, it’s to <b>weigh up facts rather than myths</b>.</p>
<p>Technical comparisons of open source frameworks and commercial software products happen all the time. I did several comparisons in the past on my blog or other platforms like InfoQ, including a <a href="https://www.kai-waehner.de/blog/2012/01/10/spoilt-for-choice-which-integration-framework-to-use-spring-integration-mule-esb-or-apache-camel/">Comparison of integration frameworks</a>, <a href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/ESB-Integration">Choosing the right ESB for your integration needs</a>, <a href="https://www.kai-waehner.de/blog/2019/03/07/apache-kafka-middleware-mq-etl-esb-comparison/">Kafka vs. ETL / ESB / MQ</a>, <a href="https://www.kai-waehner.de/blog/2020/04/24/mainframe-offloading-replacement-apache-kafka-connect-ibm-db2-mq-cdc-cobol/">Kafka vs. Mainframe</a> and <a href="https://www.kai-waehner.de/blog/2020/05/25/api-management-gateway-apache-kafka-comparison-mulesoft-kong-apigee/">Apache Kafka and API Management / API Gateway</a>. All these comparisons were done because customers wanted to understand when to use which tool.</p>
<p>For Pulsar vs. Kafka, the situation is a little bit different.</p>
<h2 id="why-compare-pulsar-and-kafka">Why compare Pulsar and Kafka?</h2>
<p><b>Talking to prospects or customers, I rarely get asked about Pulsar.</b> To be fair, this increased slightly in the last months. I guess the question comes up in every ~15th or ~20th meeting due to the overlapping feature set and use cases. However, this seems to be mostly due to a few posts on the internet that claim Pulsar is in some ways better than Kafka. There is no fact checking andou very little material, if any, for the opposing view.</p>
<p><b>I have not talked to a single organization who seriously considered deploying Pulsar in production, </b>although I know there are a large number of users out there in the world who need a distributed messaging technology like Kafka or Pulsar. But I also think that Pulsar’s alleged reference users are not particularly accurate. For example, their flagship user is Tencent, a large Chinese tech company, but Tencent is a huge Kafka user, whereas Pulsar’s use is limited to just one project.</p>
<h4 id="comparison-of-two-competitive-open-source-frameworks">Comparison of two competitive open source frameworks</h4>
<p><b>Apache Kafka and Apache Pulsar are two exciting and competing technologies</b>. Therefore, it makes a lot of sense to compare them. Period.</p>
<p><strong>Both Apache Kafka and Apache Pulsar have very similar feature sets</strong>. I recommend that you evaluate both frameworks for available features, maturity, market adoption, open source tools and projects, training material, availability of local meetups, videos, blog posts, etc. Reference use cases from your industry or business problems help making the right decision.</p>
<p>Confluent published such a comparison about “<a href="https://www.confluent.io/kafka-vs-pulsar/">Kafka vs. Pulsar vs. RabbitMQ: Performance, Architecture, and Features Compared</a>“. I was involved in creating this comparison. So we have that comparison already…</p>
<p>What is this blog post here about then?</p>
<p>I want to <b>explore the myths from some ‘Kafka vs. Pulsar’ arguments</b> which I see regularly in blog posts and forum discussions. Afterwards, I will give a more <b>comprehensive comparison beyond just technical aspects</b> because most Pulsar discussions focus purely on tech features.</p>

<h2 id="kafka-vs-pulsar-technology-myths-explored">Kafka vs Pulsar – Technology myths explored<b><br>
</b></h2>
<p><b>The following discusses some myths I have come across. I agree with some of them, but also counter some others with hard facts</b>. Of course, different opinions can exist for some of these statements. Again, this is totally fine. The following is my point of view.</p>
<h3 id="myth-1-pulsar-has-differentiating-built-in-features-compared-to-kafka">Myth 1: “Pulsar has differentiating built-in features compared to Kafka”?</h3>
<p><b>True.</b></p>
<p>If you compare Apache Kafka to Apache Pulsar, features like its tiered architecture, queuing, and multi-tenancy are mentioned as differentiators.</p>
<p><b>But:</b></p>
<p>Kafka has many differentiating features, too:</p>
<ul>
<li>Half as many servers to run</li>
<li>Data saved to disk only once</li>
<li>Data cached in memory only once</li>
<li>Battle-tested replication protocol</li>
<li>Zero copy performance</li>
<li>Transactions</li>
<li>Built-in stream processing</li>
<li>Long term storage</li>
<li>In the works: ZooKeeper removal (<a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-500%3A+Replace+ZooKeeper+with+a+Self-Managed+Metadata+Quorum">KIP-500</a>), which makes Kafka even more simple to operate and deploy than Pulsar (which has a four-component architecture of Pulsar, ZooKeeper, BookKeeper, and RocksDB), apart from making Kafka more scalable, more resilient, etc. etc..)</li>
<li>In the works: Tiered Storage (<a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-405%3A+Kafka+Tiered+Storage">KIP-405</a>), which makes Kafka more elastic and cost-efficient.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also ask yourself: Should you really compare just the open source frameworks or products and vendors with their complete offering?</p>
<p>It is <b>easy to add new features if you don’t have to provide mission-critical support for it</b>. Don’t just evaluate features in a checklist, but also evaluate how they are battle-tested in production scenarios. <b>How many “differentiating features” are low-quality and implemented quickly vs. high-quality implementations?</b></p>
<p>For instance: <b>It took a few years to implement and battle-test Kafka Streams as Kafka-native stream processing engine. Do you really want to compare this to Pulsar Functions?</b> The latter is a feature to add user-defined functions (UDF); without any relation to “real stream processing”. Or is this more like Single Message Transformations (SMT), a core feature of Kafka Connect? Just be sure to a) compare apples to apples (instead of apples to oranges) and b) don’t forget to think about the maturity of a feature. The more powerful and critical, the more mature it should be…</p>
<p>The Kafka community spends a large amount of efforts to improve the core project and its ecosystem. <b>Confluent alone has over 200 full time engineers</b> working on the Kafka project, additional community components, commercial products and the SaaS offering on major cloud providers.</p>
<h3 id="myth-2-pulsar-has-a-few-very-big-users-like-tencent-in-china">Myth 2: “Pulsar has a few very big users like Tencent in China”?</h3>
<p><b>True.</b></p>
<p><b>But: Tencent actually uses Kafka more than Pulsar</b>. The billing, which uses Pulsar, department is only a small fraction at Tencent, whereas a large portion of the core business is using Kafka, and they have a Global-Kafka like architecture that combines 1000+ brokers into a single logical cluster.</p>
<p>Always be cautious with open source projects. Check out the success at “normal companies”. Just because a tech giant uses it, does not mean it will work for your company well. How many Fortune 2000 companies shared their success stories around Pulsar in the past?</p>
<h4 id="look-for-proof-points-beyond-tech-giants">Look for proof points beyond tech giants!</h4>
<p><b>Proof points beyond the tech giants are helpful to get insights and lessons learned from other people</b>. Not from the software vendors. The Kafka website gives many <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/powered-by">examples about mission-critical deployments</a>. Even more impressive: At the past<a href="https://kafka-summit.org/"> Kafka Summit</a> conferences in San Francisco, New York and London, every year various enterprises from different industries present their use cases and success stories. Including fortune 2000 companies, mid-size enterprises and startups.</p>
<p>Just to give you <b>one specific example in the Kafka world</b>: Various different implementations exist for replication of data in real time between separate Kafka clusters, including MirrorMaker 1 (part of the Apache Kafka project), MirrorMaker 2 (part of the Apache Kafka project), Confluent Replicator (built by Confluent and only available as part of Confluent Platform or Confluent Cloud), uReplicator (open sourced by Uber), Mirus (open sourced by Salesforce), Brooklin (open sourced by LinkedIn).</p>
<p>In practice, only two options are reasonable if you don’t want to maintain and improve the code by yourself: MirrorMaker 2 (very new, not mature yet, but a great option mid and long term) and Confluent Replicator (battle-tested in many mission-critical deployments, but not open source). All the other options work, too. But who maintains the projects? Who solves bugs and security issues? Who do you call when you have a problem in production? Deployment in production for mission-critical deployments is different from evaluating and trying out an open source project.</p>
<h3 id="myth-3-pulsar-provides-message-queuing-and-event-streaming-in-a-single-solution">Myth 3: “Pulsar provides message queuing and event streaming in a single solution”?</h3>
<p><b>True.</b></p>
<p>Message queues are used for point-to-point communication. They provide an asynchronous communications protocol, meaning that the sender and receiver of the message do not need to interact with the message queue at the same time.</p>
<p>I really like the support of Message Queuing in Pulsar. This means you have <b>out-of-the-box support for event streaming and message queues in Pulsar</b>.</p>
<p>In Kafka, different workarounds are required to realize “real queuing” behavior.</p>
<p>Having said this, I typically ask customers what exactly they want to do with queuing. Often, Kafka provides out-of-the-box solutions for the use case which simply require thinking of the solution in new terms.</p>
<p>If you want to use separate message queues instead of shared Kafka topics for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Security? =&gt; Use Kafka’s ACLs (and optional tools like Confluent’s role-based access control aka RBAC)).</li>
<li>Semantics (i.e. separate applications)? =&gt; Use Kafka’s consumer groups.</li>
<li>Load balancing? =&gt; Use Kafka’s partitions.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Kafka Topics have two …</b></p></div></div>

				        PGA is a <b>plane-based geometric algebra</b> which appears eminently suited for the description and computation of operations in <b>3D Euclidean geometry</b>. 
It naturally contains, in a real framework, efficient motion representations like homogeneous coordinates and  dual quaternions, fully integrated with oriented object models. 
PGA's encoding of primitives and operators in blocks of four coordinates makes it very suitable for <b>fast GPU
implementation</b>.</p><p>

To satisfy the curiosity raised by the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tX4H_ctggYo&amp;t=1080s" target="blank"><b>2019 SIGGRAPH</b></a> presentation on PGA, Leo Dorst decided to upgrade
<b>Chapter 11</b> of the 2007 book <a href="http://geometricalgebra.net/" target="blank"><b>Geometric Algebra for Computer Science (GA4CS)</b></a> to treat these new developments in a similarly precise but accessible style.
</p>
<p>

The present text assumes some <b>basic geometric algebra</b> knowledge (though it could be read without that, as a motivational inspiration to acquire that knowledge). 
Throughout, we try to be no more mathematical than required, and provide <b>illustrations</b> and links to <b>software demonstrations</b>.
</p><p>

This text takes care to propagate <b>orientational signs</b> and <b>scaling factors</b> through all its operations, since the author believes that PGA allows for such a consistently <b>oriented Euclidean geometry</b>. 
Guessing signs afterwards should no longer be required...</p><p>

Enjoy! We plan to post updates on new developments on this page, and in upgraded versions of this '<a href="https://bivector.net/PGA4CS.pdf">Guided Tour to the Plane-Based Geometric Algebra PGA</a>'.</p><p>

        Memory-sensitive languages like C++ and Rust use compile-time information to calculate
        sizes of datatypes. These sizes are used to inform alignment, allocation, and calling conventions in ways
        that improve runtime performance. Modern languages in this setting support generic types, but so far
        these languages only allow parameterisation over types, not type constructors. In this article I describe
        how to enable parameterisation over arbitrary type constructs, while still retaining compile-time calculation
        of datatype sizes.
    </p>
    <p>
        The code for this project can be found <a href="https://github.com/LightAndLight/sized-hkts">here</a>.

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<h3 id="generics">Generics</h3>

<p>Many typed languages support some form of generic (parameterised) datatypes. This ability to abstract
over types is known as ‘parametric polymorphism’ (polymorphism for short). In Rust, for example, one
can define type of polymorphic pairs as <code>struct Pair&lt;A, B&gt;(fst: A, snd: B)</code>. In this definition, <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> are type 
variables (or type parameters), and can be substituted for other types: 
<code>Pair&lt;bool, bool&gt;</code>, <code>Pair&lt;bool, char&gt;</code>, and <code>Pair&lt;String, int32&gt;</code> are all valid pairs.</p>

<p>The name of a type, without any parameters, is known as a type constructor. <code>Pair</code> is not a type on its own; 
<code>Pair&lt;A, B&gt;</code> (for some types <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>) is. The number of types required to ‘complete’ a type constructor is known
as its arity (so <code>Pair</code> has arity 2). The arity of a type constructor must always be respected; it’s an error to 
provide greater or fewer type parameters than are expected. For example, <code>Pair&lt;bool&gt;</code> and 
<code>Pair&lt;char, int32, String&gt;</code> are invalid.</p>

<h3 id="sizing">Sizing</h3>

<p>When using C++ or Rust, the compiler will calculate how many bytes of memory each datatype requires. Simple
types like <code>int32</code> and <code>bool</code> have a constant size; 4 bytes and 1 byte respectively. The size of datatypes 
built using of other simple types is easy to calculate. The simplest way to calculate the size of a struct 
is to sum the sizes of the fields, and the simplest way to calculate the size of an enum (or tagged union)
is to find the largest variant, and add 1 (for a tag byte). This is rarely the exact formula used by production
compilers, because they take <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure_alignment">alignment</a> into account.
This article will assume the simple sizing formula, because the results can easily be adapted to more nuanced
formulae.</p>

<p>The size of a datatype like <code>struct TwoInts(x: int32, y: int32)</code> is known immediately at its definition. <code>TwoInts</code>
requires 8 bytes of memory. On the other hand, the size of a generic datatype is not always known at its definition.
What is the size of <code>struct Pair&lt;A, B&gt;(fst: A, snd: B)</code>? It’s the size of <code>A</code> plus the size of <code>B</code>, for some 
unknown <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>.</p>

<p>This difficulty is usually addressed by only generating code for datatypes and functions when all the generic
types have been replaced with concrete types. This process is known as monomorphisation. If the program contains a 
<code>Pair(true, true)</code>, then the compiler will generate
a new type <code>struct PairBoolBool(fst: bool, snd: bool)</code> whose size is statically known. If <code>Pair(true, true)</code>
is passed to a function <code>fn swap&lt;A, B&gt;(p: Pair&lt;A, B&gt;) -&gt; Pair&lt;B, A&gt;</code>, then the compiler generates a new
function <code>fn swapBoolBool(p: PairBoolBool) -&gt; PairBoolBool</code>. Because this new function only uses types with known
sizes, the code for memory allocation and calling conventions can be generated correctly.</p>

<p>There are also generic types that <em>don’t</em> depend on the size of their parameters. An example of
this is the pointer, commonly known in Rust as <code>Box&lt;A&gt;</code>. A pointer has the same size (often 4 or 8 bytes depending
on your CPU) regardless of what it points to. But in order to allocate a new pointer, the size of the item must
be known.</p>

<p>For each generic datatype or function, the compiler keeps track of which type variables are important for sizing
calculations. The specifics of this is discussed in the <a href="#type-classes">Type Classes</a> section.</p>

<h3 id="kinds">Kinds</h3>

<p>A consequence of all this is that in these languages, type variables can only stand for types. But there
are good reasons to have type variables that stand for type constructors, too:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>One</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>A</span><span>)</span>

<span>impl</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>One</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>&gt;</span><span>{</span>

<span>}</span>

<span>struct</span> <span>Three</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>A</span><span>)</span>

<span>impl</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>Three</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>&gt;</span><span>{</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here are some 1-arity container types. The only difference between these datatypes is the number of elements
they contain. They all support a <code>map</code> operation, which applies a function to all the datatype’s elements. Functions
that use <code>map</code> need to be implemented once for each type, even when their implementations are identical:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>incrOne</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>One</span><span>&lt;</span><span>int32</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>One</span><span>&lt;</span><span>int32</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span> <span>x</span><span>.map</span><span>(|</span><span>n</span><span>|</span> <span>n</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>incrTwo</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>Two</span><span>&lt;</span><span>int32</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Two</span><span>&lt;</span><span>int32</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span> <span>x</span><span>.map</span><span>(|</span><span>n</span><span>|</span> <span>n</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span>

<span>fn</span> <span>incrThree</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>Three</span><span>&lt;</span><span>int32</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Three</span><span>&lt;</span><span>int32</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span> <span>x</span><span>.map</span><span>(|</span><span>n</span><span>|</span> <span>n</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To remedy this, there must first be a way to abstract over the type constructors, so that the code can
be written <em>once</em> and for all:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>incr</span><span>&lt;</span><span>F</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>&lt;</span><span>int32</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>F</span><span>&lt;</span><span>int32</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span> <span>x</span><span>.map</span><span>(|</span><span>n</span><span>|</span> <span>n</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span> <span>// when F&lt;A&gt; has map, for all types A</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then, there must be some way to rule out invalid types. For example, replacing <code>F</code> with <code>bool</code> in <code>F&lt;int32&gt;</code>
is invalid, because <code>bool&lt;int32&gt;</code> is not a type. This is the job of kinds<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Kinds describe the ‘shape’ of types (and type constructors) in the same way that types describe the ‘shape’ 
of values. A type’s kind determines whether or not it takes any parameters. Here’s the syntax of kinds:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>kind ::=
  Type
  kind -&gt; kind
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Types that take no arguments (like <code>bool</code>, <code>char</code>, and <code>String</code>) have kind <code>Type</code>. Types that take one argument,
like <code>One</code>, have kind <code>Type -&gt; Type</code>. In the code for <code>incr</code> above, <code>F</code> implicitly has kind <code>Type -&gt; Type</code>. Types
that take more than one argument are represented in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying">curried form</a>. This
means that <code>Two</code> has kind <code>Type -&gt; Type -&gt; Type</code>, not <code>(Type, Type) -&gt; Type</code>. <code>Three</code> has kind <code>Type -&gt; Type -&gt; Type -&gt; Type</code>,
and so on.</p>

<p>Curried type constructors are standard in this setting, but not <em>necessary</em>. The results in this article could
also be applied to a setting with uncurried type constructors, at cost to expressiveness or implementation complexity.</p>

<p>Kinds put types and type constructors on equal footing. For the remainder of the article, both concepts will be
referred to as types. The kind becomes the distinguishing feature. For example, “type constructor of arity 2” would
be replaced by “type of kind <code>Type -&gt; Type -&gt; Type</code>”.</p>

<p>Some final jargon: types with a kind other than <code>Type</code> are known as ‘higher-kinded types’, and parameterising
over higher-kinded types is known as ‘higher-kinded polymorphism’.</p>

<h3 id="type-classes">Type Classes</h3>

<p>Rust uses <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2015/05/11/traits.html">traits</a> to coordinate sizing calculations. Each
datatype implicitly receives an implementation of the <code>Sized</code> trait, and every type variable that is relevant for
a sizing calculation is given a <code>Sized</code> bound. This means that trait resolution, an already useful feature, can
be re-used to perform size calculations.</p>

<p>Closely related to traits is the functional programming concept of type classes<sup id="fnref:1:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. There are differences between the two,
but those differences don’t impact the results of this article. Type classes will prove a more convenient language
in which to discuss these ideas.</p>

<p>A type class (or trait) can be considered a predicate on types. A type class constraint (or trait bound) is an assertion
that the predicate must be true. For each constraint that is satisfied, there is corresponding ‘evidence’ that the
predicate is true.</p>

<p>When a type <code>T</code> has a <code>Sized</code> constraint, it is being asserted that the statement “<code>T</code> has a known size” is true. For
brevity, this will be written as <code>Sized T</code>. When this statement satisfied (for instance, when <code>T</code> is <code>int32</code>), the
evidence is produced is <em>the actual size</em> of <code>T</code> (when <code>Sized int32</code> is satisfied, the evidence
is the number <code>4</code> - the size of <code>int32</code>).</p>

<p>Generic types like <code>Two&lt;A&gt;</code> have a size that depends on their type parameter. In terms of constraints, it can
be said that <code>Sized A</code> <em>implies</em> <code>Sized Two&lt;A&gt;</code>. If <code>A</code> is <code>int32</code>, then its size is <code>4</code>, which implies that
<code>Two&lt;int32&gt;</code> has a size of <code>4 + 4 = 8</code>. Similarly, of <code>Pair</code> it can be said that <code>Sized A</code> implies [ <code>Sized B</code> implies 
<code>Sized Pair&lt;A, B&gt;</code> ]. There is a choice between a curried an uncurried version; it could also be said that
[ <code>Sized A</code> <em>and</em> <code>Sized B</code> ] implies <code>Sized Pair&lt;A, B&gt;</code>, but the curried version will be used for convenience.</p>

<p>Note that type <em>constructors</em> don’t have a size. In other words, only types of kind <code>Type</code> have a size. A type constructor
such as <code>Two</code> (of kind <code>Type -&gt; Type</code>) has a size <em>function</em>. Given the sizes of the type constructor’s parameters,
a size function computes the size of the resulting datatype. <code>Two</code>’s size function is <code>\a -&gt; a + a</code>. <code>Pair</code>’s size
function <code>\a -&gt; b -&gt; a + b</code> (it could also be <code>\(a, b) -&gt; a + b</code> in an uncurried setting).</p>

<h3 id="problem-statement">Problem Statement</h3>

<p>With the background out of the way, the specific problem can be stated:</p>

<p>When a type of kind <code>Type</code> is relevant for a size calculation, it is given a <code>Sized</code> constraint, which will be
satisfied with a concrete size as evidence. What is the equivalent notion of constraint and evidence for
higher-kinded types that contribute to size calculations?</p>

<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>

<p>An elegant solution to this problem can found by introducing quantified class constraints<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. Quantified constraints 
are an extension to type classes that add implication and quantification to the language of constraints, and corresponding
notions of evidence.</p>

<p>Here’s new syntax of quantified size constraints:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>constraint ::=
  Sized type               (size constraint)
  constraint =&gt; constraint (implication constraint)
  forall A. constraint     (quantification constraint)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The evidence for a constraint <code>c1 =&gt; c2</code> is a function that takes evidence for <code>c1</code> and produces evidence for <code>c2</code>, and the
evidence for <code>forall A. c</code> is just the evidence for <code>c</code>. The evidence for quantification constraints is a bit more nuanced
in general, but this description is accurate when only …</p></article></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>As you may know, Hashnode is a community of independent developers who blog on their own domain. Hashnode users discover content published by the bloggers on their feed. Since our users are logged in on Hashnode and <strong>not the custom domains</strong> where the articles live, we had to carry the session forward somehow. </p>
<p>For example, I am logged in on Hashnode, but I am reading a content published on a different Hashnode powered domain. For example:</p>

<p>How do we ensure that my session reflects on this domain so that I can like the post or write a comment?</p>
<h2 id="sso-on-our-own-cloud">SSO on our own cloud</h2>
<p>Initially we relied on third party cookies to do auth. We waited for the page to load fully and then made an API call to Hashnode to fetch the currently logged in user. It worked quite well. However, we soon realized that Safari blocks all third-party cookies!  So, we decided to implement SSO on Hashnode and activated it only for Safari users. Here is the flow:</p>
<ul>
<li>User requests a blog and it hits one of our edge servers.</li>
<li>We detect if the user is on Safari. In that case we redirect them to <code>https://hashnode.com/identity</code> and pass a <code>next</code> query param which is the blog URL.</li>
<li>Hashnode checks for a login cookie. If found, we create a short lived token for the user and store it against a <code>guid</code>. We redirect the user back to the blog by appending <code>guid</code> as a query param.</li>
<li>After being redirected, the blog renders and our JavaScript code pulls in the <code>guid</code> and exchanges it with our server for an auth token.</li>
<li>Subsequent API calls use the auth token and send it in <code>x-auth-token</code> header to authenticate with Hashnode endpoints.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1594031517862/FXfL-Qhds.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="hn-authentication-chart.png"></p>
<p>This worked quite well, but as you may have guessed the redirection process took a bit of time. Our edge caching didn't really matter since we redirected the requests to Hashnode before serving the content. But this flow was in place just for Safari. For Chrome, Firefox and other browsers, we served content straightaway from our edge cache and used third-party cookies to communicate with Hashnode.</p>
<p>However, we soon realized that Brave browser also blocks third-party cookies when privacy shield is on. Also, we didn't have any reliable way of knowing whether the request came from Brave browser. The <code>user-agent</code> header simply didn't give any info. A few days later, Chrome also joined the bandwagon and started blocking third-party cookies. Now our only choice was to redirect every request intended for Hashnode-powered domains to <code>https://hashnode.com</code> first and obtain auth token -- that meant we could no longer take advantage of our CDN. SSO would make the blogs slower. </p>
<p>After a few sleepless nights, I thought why not use Cloudflare Workers for implementing SSO? Worker scripts run in 150+ data centres across the globe and can handle millions of redirections easily! The best part is that the requests will be sent to a DC that is closest to the users. This means we can implement an SSO feature without sacrificing the speed and benefits of our own CDN.</p>
<p>So, last week I sat down to build this. Here is how it works:</p>
<h2 id="sso-on-cloudflare-workers">SSO on Cloudflare Workers</h2>
<p>As I mentioned above, we already have a home grown CDN which routes user requests to locations that are geographically closest to our users. Since Workers also factor in geo proximity while serving requests, we came up with the following steps to implement SSO. It's largely same as our previous setup, but the redirection part is handled by Cloudflare Workers.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Whenever a request comes for any specific domain in our network (e.g. <code>https://sandeep.dev</code>), we redirect the user to <code>https://hashnode.com/identity</code> which is powered by Workers. It passes the current hostname in a query param called <code>next</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The script checks if a login cookie is present in the request. If yes, it generates a short lived JWT token and a GUID. </p>
</li>
<li><p>The script stores the JWT against the generated GUID using Workers KV Store. It redirects the user to URL passed in <code>next</code> query param and sends the GUID along with it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>After redirection happens, the blog exchanges the <code>guid</code> for the short lived JWT and uses it to authenticate API calls.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is how the worker script looks like:</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> next = getQueryParam(request, <span>'next'</span>); 

<span>if</span> (!next) { 
    <span>return</span> Response.redirect(<span>`https://hashnode.com`</span>, <span>302</span>);
}

next = <span>decodeURIComponent</span>(next);

<span>const</span> cookie = getCookie(request, <span>'login.jwt'</span>);

<span>if</span> (!cookie) { 
    <span>return</span> Response.redirect(<span>`<span>${next}</span>?guid=none`</span>, <span>302</span>);
}

<span>const</span> decodedJwt = jwt.verify(cookie, jwtSecret); 
<span>const</span> userId = decodedJwt.data.userId; 

<span>const</span> data = {
    userId: userId,
    expires: <span>new</span> <span>Date</span>().getTime() + (cookieTTL * <span>3600</span> * <span>1000</span>),
    v: <span>1</span>
}

<span>const</span> signedToken = jwt.sign(data, jwtSecret); 
<span>const</span> guid = uuidv4(); 
<span>await</span> guids.put(guid, signedToken, { expirationTtl: <span>60</span> }); 

<span>return</span> Response.redirect(<span>`<span>${next}</span>?guid=<span>${guid}</span>`</span>, <span>302</span>); 
</code></pre>
<p>Once the client extracts the GUID, it makes an API call and retrieves the JWT. Here's workers script for that accepts the GUID and responds back with the JWT:</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> token = <span>await</span> guids.get(guidFromQuery); 
<span>const</span> origin = request.headers.get(<span>'origin'</span>);

<span>const</span> init = {
  headers: {
    <span>'Content-Type'</span>: <span>'application/json'</span>,
    <span>'Access-Control-Allow-Origin'</span>: origin,
    <span>'Access-Control-Allow-Headers'</span>: <span>'Content-Type'</span>
  }
}
guids.delete(guidFromQuery); 
<span>return</span> <span>new</span> Response(<span>JSON</span>.stringify({ token: token }), init);
</code></pre>
<p>It has been working out really well so far. We don't suffer if third party cookies are blocked in certain browsers. The performance doesn't degrade because the initial redirection is based on geo proximity. For example, if someone is accessing <code>sandeep.dev</code> from Bangalore then the initial redirection always goes to Bangalore/Singapore. Then the actual content is served from Bangalore.</p>
<p>If we take a look at the network tab, we'll notice that the TTFB value is still &lt; 500ms most of the times. The redirection is short and consumes &lt; 300ms. While this setup is slightly slower than serving content from CDN directly (without SSO), it solves one big problem which is <strong>Authentication</strong>. So, the slight reduction in speed is acceptable.</p>

<p>The best part is that Workers is handling this gracefully with 100% success rate so far.</p>

<hr>
<p>This is the first time I used Cloudflare Workers in a prod set up. You should definitely check it out if you have a similar use case. Additionally, do checkout KV store which is a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/building-with-workers-kv/">fast distributed key-value store</a>.</p>

                    <p>From experimentation to production the road ahead is not paved. While trial and error is the essence of the Data Scientist's life, critical AI systems need clarity. For example, if you built a credit scoring AI that automatically grants loans to your customers, you need to understand how it makes decisions about who should or shouldn't receive a loan. This is the data scientist's job to ensure transparency, but it's not self-evident.</p><p>For a data scientist, a typical workflow looks like the this: You find a dataset, explore it in a notebook, try modeling techniques, fail, repeat ... until it works. After hours of adding new elements to a project, it's not uncommon finding oneself with a sprawling monster of data sources, notebooks and CSVs. That's when you start asking yourself, how do I put that in production? The "mess", that is an inherent part of the data exploration and modeling process, now prevents for a smooth transition of the project to production. Progress starts to stall and time to production keeps getting longer. To add to the pressure, your boss wants your solution live before the end of the week. But what took months of iterations and back and forth won't magically turn into production code. It's a problem that engineers know too well: avoiding technical debt by refactoring legacy code. Messy and hard-to-understand systems are not only a technical challenge, they routinely impact &nbsp;the bottom line of companies big and small (<a href="https://www.deepflow.ai/designing-trustworthy-ai/">read our article on Explainable AI</a>). Needless to say, you need to clean up the mess.</p><figure><img src="https://www.deepflow.ai/content/images/2020/06/maneuver-2.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.deepflow.ai/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/maneuver-2.jpg 600w, https://www.deepflow.ai/content/images/2020/06/maneuver-2.jpg 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>From Jupyter notebook to production, an allegory.</figcaption></figure><p>The hand-off of projects from "research" scientists to the "production" engineers is more standardized in large companies where R&amp;D is its own entity and processes are in place to facilitate communication. Data teams in small organizations bear the brunt of limited resources and short development cycles which adds even more pressure to avoid "messy" projects.</p><blockquote>(In Enterprise AI) The most exciting problems yet to be solved are in the deployment and serving space. One reason for the lack of serving solutions is the lack of communication between researchers and production engineers. At companies that can afford to pursue AI research (e.g. big companies), the research team is separated from the deployment team, and the two teams only communicate via the p-managers: product managers, program managers, project managers. Small companies, whose employees can see the entire stack, are constrained by their immediate product needs. Only a few startups, usually those founded by accomplished researchers with enough funding to hire accomplished engineers, have managed to bridge the gap. These startups are poised to take a big chunk of the AI tooling market. <strong>Chip Huyen - "<a href="https://huyenchip.com/2020/06/22/mlops.html">What I learned from looking at 200 machine learning tools</a>"</strong></blockquote><figure><img src="https://www.deepflow.ai/content/images/2020/06/stuck-1.gif" alt=""><figcaption>Putting your AI models in production</figcaption></figure><h2 id="moving-ai-in-production">Moving AI in production</h2><p>In the software industry, the practice of managing the communication and hand offs between Developer and IT Operations is called DevOps. In practical terms, DevOps refers to the collection of industry practices that standardize how code is created, delivered, deployed and maintained in a consistent way from start to finish within a same team. It introduces two foundational concepts: Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD). While CI automates the building, packaging and testing of applications, CD automates the delivery of the applications to the different environments (e.g. development, testing, production).</p><p>Data Science works in a very similar way. After all, it's another flavor of software engineering. But because of some of the differences we discussed in the previous part DevOps principles cannot be transposed exactly in the same way. That's why DataOps is gaining interest in the industry, it goes beyond DevOps to offer a tailored approach to manage Data Science projects and avoid the "mess" from start to finish.</p><figure><img src="https://www.deepflow.ai/content/images/2020/06/Screenshot-2020-06-24-at-17.26.21.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.deepflow.ai/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/Screenshot-2020-06-24-at-17.26.21.png 600w, https://www.deepflow.ai/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/Screenshot-2020-06-24-at-17.26.21.png 1000w, https://www.deepflow.ai/content/images/2020/06/Screenshot-2020-06-24-at-17.26.21.png 1192w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>DevOps vs. DataOps - <a href="https://datakitchen.io/dataops-cookbook-second-edition.html">The DataOps Cookbook 2nd Ed.</a></figcaption></figure><p>The main reason for DataOps as a separate approach is that contrary to traditional engineering teams, Data Science teams are often composed of many non-engineer types, like analysts or research-focused data scientists. Their skill-set is different from engineers. Their goal is not push production-ready code but to find how data can be leveraged to answer specific problems, explore datasets to find answers, and build predictive models. Their focus is only on improving the accuracy of their models and producing actionable visualizations. </p><p>Another differentiating aspect is the range of tools used. The typical mindset of an engineering team is &nbsp;to create a standardized "sandbox" (isolated development environment to qualify code before pushing it to production) for every engineer in the team. When working on the same projects, every engineer sandbox will look exactly the same to make sure individual changes can be merged easily, thus speeding up development time and improving the quality of the overall code-base. In the context of data teams, creating a standardized environment is much more challenging. Data scientists and analysts tend to use their own tools. The exploratory nature of their work makes it almost a necessity. In this context, we prefer to talk about "orchestration" rather than "building" (see previous graph).</p><p>In conclusion, while DevOps deals with managing the complexity of the engineering life-cycle through centralization (aka. one DevOps team per company), DataOps aims to manage the freedom of Data Science through orchestration (aka. data teams are local and are distributed across the oragnization).</p><figure><img src="https://www.deepflow.ai/content/images/2020/06/cd4ml-end-to-end-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.deepflow.ai/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/cd4ml-end-to-end-2.png 600w, https://www.deepflow.ai/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/cd4ml-end-to-end-2.png 1000w, https://www.deepflow.ai/content/images/size/w1600/2020/06/cd4ml-end-to-end-2.png 1600w, https://www.deepflow.ai/content/images/2020/06/cd4ml-end-to-end-2.png 1832w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Continuous Delivery for Machine Learning end-to-end process - <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/cd4ml.html#cd4ml-end-to-end.png">CD4ML</a></figcaption></figure><h2 id="the-future-of-enterprise-ai-business-leaders-with-ai-skills">The future of Enterprise AI: business leaders with AI skills</h2><p>As highlighted in the graph below, the biggest change in AI is happening behind the curtain.

The already available algorithms and techniques are more than sufficient to tackle existing problems, no need to reinvent the wheel. What is missing is the ability for organizations to understand how to leverage the state of the art into working solutions. Business leaders and managers need to be trained to understand and utilize existing AI solutions.</p><blockquote>Many companies rush into the AI race without clear objectives, hope a brilliant AI researcher and a technology team can create something great without guidance, and end up with little to show for it. Recruiting an AI quarterback to provide the business input, and ensuring success with well-defined metrics, is the most important job that most companies miss. <strong>Beck, Davenport, and Libert - "<a href="https://hbr.org/2019/03/the-ai-roles-some-companies-forget-to-fill">The AI roles some companies forget to fill</a>".</strong></blockquote><hr><h2 id="track-your-data-team-progress-and-reduce-time-to-production-">Track your data team progress and reduce time to production.</h2><p>With workflows that are production-ready by design, Deepflow makes it easy to manage the versioning, CI/CD, testing and monitoring of your models from conception to execution.</p><h3 id="join-the-next-batch-of-early-adopters">&gt;&gt;<a href="https://bit.ly/Deepflow-Early-Adopter">Join the next batch of early adopters</a>&lt;&lt;</h3><figure><img src="https://www.deepflow.ai/content/images/2020/06/Dashboard-6.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.deepflow.ai/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/Dashboard-6.jpg 600w, https://www.deepflow.ai/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/Dashboard-6.jpg 1000w, https://www.deepflow.ai/content/images/2020/06/Dashboard-6.jpg 1440w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Concurrency is hard to get <em>correct</em>, at least for those of us unlucky enough to be writing in languages which expose directly the guts of concurrent hardware: threads and shared memory. Getting concurrency correct <em>and</em> fast is hard, too. Your knowledge about single-threaded optimization often won’t help you: at a micro (instruction) level we can’t simply apply the usual rules of μops, dependency chains, throughput limits, and so on. The rules are different.</p>

<p>If that first paragraph got your hopes up, this second one is here to dash them: I’m not actually going to do a deep dive into the very low level aspects of concurrent performance. There are a lot of things we just don’t know about how atomic instructions and fences execute, and we’ll save that for another day.</p>

<p>Instead, I’m going to describe a higher level taxonomy that I use to think about concurrent performance. We’ll group the performance of concurrent operations into six broad <em>levels</em> running from fast to slow, with each level differing from its neighbors by roughly an order of magnitude in performance.</p>

<p>I often find myself thinking in terms of these categories when I need high performance concurrency: what is the best level I can practically achieve for the given problem? Keeping the levels in mind is useful both during initial design (sometimes a small change in requirements or high level design can allow you to achieve a better level), and also while evaluating existing systems (to better understand existing performance and evaluate the path of least resistance to improvements).</p>

<h3 id="a-real-world-example">A “Real World” Example</h3>

<p>I don’t want this to be totally abstract, so we will use a real-world-if-you-squint<sup id="fnref:realworld"><a href="#fn:realworld">1</a></sup> running example throughout: safely incrementing an integer counter across threads. By <em>safely</em> I mean without losing increments, producing out-of-thin air values, frying your RAM or making more than a minor rip in space-time.</p>

<h3 id="source-and-results">Source and Results</h3>

<p>The source for every benchmark here is <a href="https://github.com/travisdowns/concurrency-hierarchy-bench">available</a>, so you can follow along and even reproduce the results or run the benchmarks on your own hardware. All of the results discussed here (and more) are available in the same repository, and each plot includes a <code>[data table]</code> link to the specific subset used to generate the plot.</p>

<h3 id="hardware">Hardware</h3>

<p>All of the performance results are provided for several different hardware platforms: Intel Skylake, Ice Lake, Amazon Graviton and Graviton 2. However except when I explicitly mention other hardware, the prose refers to the results on Skylake. Although the specific numbers vary, most of the qualitative relationships hold for the hardware too, but <em>not always</em>. Not only does the hardware vary, but the OS and library implementations will vary as well.</p>

<p>It’s almost inevitable that this will be used to compare across hardware (“wow, Graviton 2 sure kicks Graviton 1’s ass”), but that’s not my goal here. The benchmarks are written primarily to tease apart the characteristics of the different levels, and <em>not</em> as a hardware shootout.</p>

<h2 id="level-2-contended-atomics">Level 2: Contended Atomics</h2>

<p>You’d probably expect this hierarchy to be introduced from fast to slow, or vice-versa, but we’re all about defying expectations here and we are going to start in the <em>middle</em> and work our way outwards. The middle (rounding down) turns out to be <em>level 2</em> and that’s where we will jump in.</p>

<p>The most elementary way to safely modify any shared object is to use a lock. It mostly <em>just works</em> for any type of object, no matter its structure or the nature of the modifications. Almost any mainstream CPU from the last thirty years has some type of locking<sup id="fnref:parisc"><a href="#fn:parisc">3</a></sup> instruction accessible to userspace.</p>

<p>So our baseline increment implementation will use a simple mutex of type <code>T</code> to protect a plain integer variable:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>T</span> <span>lock</span><span>;</span>
<span>uint64_t</span> <span>counter</span><span>;</span>

<span>void</span> <span>bench</span><span>(</span><span>size_t</span> <span>iters</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>iters</span><span>--</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>lock_guard</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>holder</span><span>(</span><span>lock</span><span>);</span>
        <span>counter</span><span>++</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We’ll call this implementation <em><abbr title="Uses a std::mutex and std::lock_guard to protect a plain integer counter.">mutex add</abbr></em>, and on my 4 CPU Skylake-S i7-6700HQ machine, when I use the vanilla <code>std::mutex</code> I get the following results for 2 to 4 threads:</p>



<p>The reported value is the median of all trials, and the vertical black error lines at the top of each bar indicate the <em>interdecile range</em>, i.e., the values at the 10th and 90th percentile. Where the error bars don’t show up, it means there is no difference between the p10 and p90 values at all, at least within the limits of the reporting resolution (100 picoseconds).</p>

<p>This shows that the baseline contended cost to modify an integer protected by a lock starts at about 125 nanoseconds for two threads, and grows somewhat with increasing thread count.</p>

<p>I can already hear someone saying: <em>If you are just modifying a single 64-bit integer, skip the lock and just directly use the atomic operations that most ISAs support!</em></p>

<p>Sure, let’s add a couple of variants that do that. The <code>std::atomic&lt;T&gt;</code> template makes this easy: we can wrap any type meeting some basic requirements and then manipulate it atomically. The easiest of all is to use <code>std::atomic&lt;uint64&gt;::operator++()</code><sup id="fnref:post"><a href="#fn:post">4</a></sup> and this gives us <em><abbr title="Uses an atomic increment on a single shared counter.">atomic add</abbr></em>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>atomic</span><span>&lt;</span><span>uint64_t</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>atomic_counter</span><span>{};</span>

<span>void</span> <span>atomic_add</span><span>(</span><span>size_t</span> <span>iters</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>iters</span><span>--</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>atomic_counter</span><span>++</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The other common approach would be to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compare-and-swap">compare and swap (<abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs">CAS</abbr>)</a> to load the existing value, add one and then <abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs">CAS</abbr> it back if it hasn’t changed. If it <em>has</em> changed, the increment raced with another thread and we try again.</p>

<p>Note that even if you use increment at the source level, the assembly might actually end up using <abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs">CAS</abbr> if your hardware doesn’t support atomic increment<sup id="fnref:atomicsup"><a href="#fn:atomicsup">5</a></sup>, or if your compiler or runtime just don’t take advantage of atomic operations even though they are available (e.g., see what even the newest version of <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/5h4K7y">icc does</a> for atomic increment, and what Java did for years<sup id="fnref:java"><a href="#fn:java">6</a></sup>). This caveat doesn’t apply to any of our tested platforms, however.</p>

<p>Let’s add a counter implementation that uses <abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs">CAS</abbr> as described above, and we’ll call it <em><abbr title="Uses a CAS loop to increment a single shared counter.">cas add</abbr></em>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>atomic</span><span>&lt;</span><span>uint64_t</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>cas_counter</span><span>;</span>

<span>void</span> <span>cas_add</span><span>(</span><span>size_t</span> <span>iters</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>iters</span><span>--</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>uint64_t</span> <span>v</span> <span>=</span> <span>cas_counter</span><span>.</span><span>load</span><span>();</span>
        <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>cas_counter</span><span>.</span><span>compare_exchange_weak</span><span>(</span><span>v</span><span>,</span> <span>v</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>))</span>
            <span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here’s what these look like alongside our existing <code>std::mutex</code> benchmark:</p>



<p>The first takeaway is that, at least in this <em>unrealistic maximum contention</em> benchmark, using <abbr title="Uses an atomic increment on a single shared counter.">atomic add</abbr> (<a href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/xadd"><code>lock xadd</code></a> at the hardware level) is significantly better than <abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs">CAS</abbr>. The second would be that <code>std::mutex</code> doesn’t come out looking all that bad on Skylake. It is only slightly worse than the <abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs">CAS</abbr> approach at 2 cores and beats it at 3 and 4 cores. It is slower than the atomic increment approach, but less than three times as slow and seems to be scaling in a reasonable way.</p>

<p>All of these operations are belong to <em>level 2</em> in the hierarchy. The primary characteristic of level 2 is that they make a <em>contended access</em> to a shared variable. This means that at a minimum, the line containing the data needs to move out to the caching agent that manages coherency<sup id="fnref:l3"><a href="#fn:l3">7</a></sup>, and then back up to the core that will receive ownership next. That’s about 70 cycles minimum just for that operation<sup id="fnref:inter"><a href="#fn:inter">8</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Can it get slower? You bet it can. <em>Way</em> slower.</p>

<h3 id="level-3-system-calls">Level 3: System Calls</h3>

<p>The next level up (“up” is not good here…) is level 3. The key characteristic of implementations at this level is that they make a <em>system call on almost every operation</em>.</p>

<p>It is easy to write concurrency primitives that make a system call <em>unconditionally</em> (e.g., a lock which always tries to wake waiters via a <code>futex(2)</code> call, even if there aren’t any), but we won’t look at those here. Rather we’ll take a look at a case where the fast path is written to avoid a system call, but the design or way it is used implies that such a call usually happens anyway.</p>

<p>Specifically, we are going to look at some <em>fair locks</em>. Fair locks allow threads into the critical section in the same order they began waiting. That is, when the critical section becomes available, the thread that has been waiting the longest is given the chance to take it.</p>

<p>Sounds like a good idea, right? Sometimes yes, but as we will see it can have significant performance implications.</p>

<p>On the menu are three different fair locks.</p>

<p>The first is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ticket_lock">ticket lock</a> with a <code>sched_yield</code> in the spin loop. The idea of the yield is to give other threads which may hold the lock time to run. This <code>yield()</code> approach is publicly frowned upon by concurrency experts<sup id="fnref:notwhat"><a href="#fn:notwhat">9</a></sup>, who then sometimes go right ahead and use it anyway.</p>

<p>We will call it <abbr title="A ticket lock that calls sched_yield in a spin loop while waiting for its turn.">ticket yield</abbr> and it looks like this:</p>



<div><div><pre><code><span>/**
 * A ticket lock which uses sched_yield() while waiting
 * for the ticket to be served.
 */</span>
<span>class</span> <span>ticket_yield</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>atomic</span><span>&lt;</span><span>size_t</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>dispenser</span><span>{},</span> <span>serving</span><span>{};</span>

<span>public:</span>
    <span>void</span> <span>lock</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>auto</span> <span>ticket</span> <span>=</span> <span>dispenser</span><span>.</span><span>fetch_add</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>memory_order_relaxed</span><span>);</span>

        <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>ticket</span> <span>!=</span> <span>serving</span><span>.</span><span>load</span><span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>memory_order_acquire</span><span>))</span>
            <span>sched_yield</span><span>();</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>void</span> <span>unlock</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>serving</span><span>.</span><span>store</span><span>(</span><span>serving</span><span>.</span><span>load</span><span>()</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>memory_order_release</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s plot the performance results for this lock alongside the existing approaches:</p>



<p>This is level 3 visualized: it is an order of magnitude slower than the level 2 approaches. The slowdown comes from the <code>sched_yield</code> call: this is a system call and these are generally on the order of 100s of nanoseconds<sup id="fnref:spectre"><a href="#fn:spectre">10</a></sup>, and it shows in the results.</p>

<p>This lock <em>does</em> have a fast path where <code>sched_yield</code> isn’t called: if the lock is available, no spinning occurs and <code>sched_yield</code> is never called. However, the combination of being a <em>fair</em> lock and the high contention in this test means that a lock convoy quickly forms (we’ll describe this in more detail later) and so the spin loop is entered basically …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<p>The growth and adoption of web-based APIs is key to the transformational technology journey of any enterprise. Those APIs, whether they are RESTful or not, remain synchronous. They, like the web, utilize the pattern of HTTP to implement a request-response interaction approach.</p>

<p>To illustrate, assume we have a project management API with the following interactions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a project (e.g. POST /projects)</li>
<li>Create a new task (e.g. POST /projects/{projectId}/tasks)</li>
<li>Assign the task to someone on our team (e.g. POST /tasks/{taskId}/assignees)</li>
<li>The assignee marks the task as complete (e.g. PUT /tasks/{taskId})</li>
</ol>

<p>An API following this design works if design of the user interface closely mirrors those endpoints. But suppose an additional application requirement is to ‘automatically’ update a task’s status when marked complete by another user. With a request/response web-API, an option is to incessantly poll a status API on the chance a status might have changed. This is both cumbersome and error-prone.
Instead of polling, we can introduce an <strong>event-driven architecture</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="introduction-to-event-driven-architecture">Introduction to Event-Driven Architecture<a href="#introduction-to-event-driven-architecture" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h2>

<p>In an event-driven architecture (or EDA), an application is composed of independent components that react to events published by other components. EDA is popular for distributed applications, as new components may be introduced into a solution to solve emerging problems — without the knowledge of previously developed components. Message brokers are used as an intermediary for communication, producing a loosely coupled design by preventing components from directly communicating with one another.</p>

<p>If you are familiar with service-oriented architecture (SOA), you have experienced EDA. Most service-oriented architectures used an enterprise service bus (ESB) for service communication rather than a message broker. Events were published to the ESB, where they were then routed to other services to integrate two or more software systems. However, ESBs proved problematic as they were used as “integration glue”, causing integration code to become scattered across services, apps, and the ESB; fragile systems were created. This fragility produced a greater need for coordination between teams, slowing software delivery.</p>

<h2 id="the-emergence-of-a-microservice-and-event-driven-architecture">The Emergence of a Microservice and Event-Driven Architecture<a href="#the-emergence-of-a-microservice-and-event-driven-architecture" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h2>

<p>To overcome this increased coordination, the microservice architecture was introduced as a replacement for traditional SOA. This newer distributed architecture, built on APIs and microservices, encourages “dumb pipes, smart endpoints.” Integration logic is pushed to the consumers and producers. Message brokers, rather than ESBs, are used for message routing, not integration logic. Services and APIs talk to one another while hiding implementation details. This loose coupling makes software more resilient to evolution as new requirements emerge.</p>

<p>As enterprises shift to APIs backed by a microservice architecture, the number of published events has grown considerably. Message brokers are typically transactional in nature, ensuring once-and-only-once delivery of messages. While useful for traditional software development, the transactional nature of message brokers limits the scalability of service communication.</p>

<p>Distributed streaming data platforms, such as Apache Kafka, now offer enterprises higher throughput than traditional message brokers. Kafka removes the need for transactional messaging found in message brokers, opting instead for turning events into message streams. These streams are accessible by any authorized subscriber and may be accessed real-time or processed sequentially from a predetermined location or at the start of the stream.</p>

<h2 id="api-design-with-event-streaming">API Design with Event Streaming<a href="#api-design-with-event-streaming" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h2>

<p>Event streams help software extend beyond the request-response approach common to web API styles such as REST, GraphQL, and gRPC. Software can communicate bi-directionally, removing the need for API consumers to continually poll for state changes. Instead, APIs publish events to an event stream for notification of data changes or important business events to any number of subscribed services for further processing.</p>

<p>Let’s revisit our previous example. We needed to solve two separate requirements:</p>

<ol>
<li>Notification when a task is marked as completed. Our only option without a message-driven architecture is to require interested parties to constantly make API calls to see if the task has been completed (aka polling)</li>
<li>Alerting a project owner when a task has been modified or marked as completed. Our only option is to mix our user interface concerns with our API by making the API send an email. The API is no longer responsible for managing projects and tasks — it is now responsible for the content and look-and-feel for email alerts</li>
</ol>

<p>If we introduce a message-driven architecture to our solution, we can develop an API that delivers project and task resources that offer the necessary capabilities (create, read, update, delete, and mark as complete). Our API doesn’t need to know about how the task completion event notification will be used, including that an email will be sent. All it needs to do is publish event messages when those events occur and allow other services to take action as appropriate. Events this API may publish include:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.asyncapi.com/images/posts/event-streaming-an-additional-architectural-style-to-suplement-api-design/event-examples.webp" alt="Example of API events" title="Example of API events"></p>

<p>Interested parties can then subscribe to the event(s) they are interested in and safely ignore the rest. In our example, we may end up with three components:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Projects API</strong> — Manages the Projects and Project Tasks resources via a REST-based API. The API may be comprised of one or more microservices that implement the capabilities offered by the REST API. When any event, from the list in the table above, occurs then the API publishes an event into the appropriate message stream for consumption by event subscribers</li>
<li><strong>Task Completed Email Microservice</strong> — Subscribes to the Task.Completed event, notifying project manager(s) via email when any task has been marked as completed</li>
<li><strong>Task Modified Email Microservice</strong> — Subscribes to the Task.Updated event, notifying all team members via email when any task has been edited</li>
</ol>

<p>The API has no awareness of the two microservices subscribed to the specific events; it just publishes the events to the appropriate message stream. The solution is considered loosely coupled and therefore capable of evolving over time as new requirements emerge, perhaps with new types of notifications (e.g. SMS, web dashboard alerts) or integrations (e.g. synching to JIRA).</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h2>

<p>The demand for more robust methods of software communication is pushing the limits of today’s interface solutions. Request/response-based APIs are essential. However, today’s technical problems are now demanding event-driven support — in addition to request/response — to improve an API’s capability offerings.</p>

<p>As API designers, we must strive to use all available tools to offer a better developer experience. As you enhance your existing APIs and new APIs emerge, ask yourself:</p>

<ol>
<li>How can my solution architecture be improved by moving beyond standard REST APIs and into a loosely-coupled event-driven architecture?</li>
<li>What events should my API publish that would benefit API consumers?</li>
<li>How will my API consumers benefit from the addition of these events and how do they take advantage of them?</li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s shift our approach from strictly request-response to thinking in terms of how our APIs can not only offer endpoints for requests, but events that enable the API to push to other services. The result will be increased innovation and more transformative APIs both within and across our LOBs.</p>

    <p>Previously we took a look at <a href="https://aeonlucid.com/Snapchat-detection-on-Android/">Snapchat’s root detection methods on Android</a>. This time we are taking a look at how they detect jailbreaks, tweaks and hooks on iOS.</p>



<p>All the research in this post is based on Snapchat 10.65.0.66 (832559634).</p>

<p><img src="https://aeonlucid.com/images/snapchat/ios_login_message.png" alt="Login Message">
</p>

<p>This is the message you see when you try to login with a detected tweak, although not all tweaks trigger this message. Two examples that trigger this message are <a href="http://cydia.saurik.com/package/com.johncoates.flex3/">Flex 3</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/9baacc/release_wraith_snapchatphantom_replacement/">Wraith</a>. Some just flag your account and will get you banned later in a ban wave if you are unlucky.</p>

<h2 id="avoiding-bans">Avoiding bans</h2>

<p>So obviously the first thing we want to look at is, what has the community tried so far to stay hidden? If you google around a bit you will most likely end up with these result. For a few of them, I will list the most notable features.</p>

<ul>
  <li>NoSub (or variants)
    <ul>
      <li>Disable Cydia Substrate / Substitute entirely for specific apps.</li>
      <li>Only if you can find an updated version and don’t want to use tweaks on Snapchat.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/NepetaDev/UnSub/blob/master/Tweak/Tweak.xm">UnSub</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Hooks and filters libc file system calls.</li>
      <li>Spoofs the libc getenv to remove the <code>DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES</code> variable.</li>
      <li>Spoofs <code>_dyld_image_count</code> and <code>_dyld_get_image_name</code> to hide tweak related dylibs.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/jjolano/shadow/blob/master/Tweak.xm">Shadow</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Too much to list.. it hooks way too much.</li>
      <li>Still misses lots of stuff for Snapchat specifically.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Even <a href="https://support.snapchat.com/en-US/a/jailbroken-iphone">Snapchat themselves recommend NoSub</a>..</p>

<p><img src="https://aeonlucid.com/images/snapchat/ios_snapchat_jailbroken_support.png" alt="Login Message">
</p>

<p>But it seems that nobody knows what Snapchat is <strong>exactly</strong> doing to detect everything. Which is why I am writing this post. Only one that I have seen <a href="https://twitter.com/cokepokes/status/1023114963550797824">publicly making efforts</a> to figure this out is the developer of Phantom, CokePokes.</p>

<h2 id="how-are-they-doing-it">How are they doing it?</h2>

<p>I will try my best to explain every check they do in Snapchat 10.65.0.66.</p>

<p>When you launch the app they create a new thread using <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/pthread_create.3.html">pthread_create</a> that runs all the checks. At the end of these checks an integer is stored with flags of everything that was detected on the device. Some of these checks are then ran every 31 seconds.</p>

<p>All the code executed for these checks is obfuscated with <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/strong-codes">Snapchats in-house obfuscation tools</a> and thus very annoying to look at using tools such as IDA.</p>

<h3 id="code-signature-checks">Code signature checks</h3>

<p>One of the first things they do is checking and storing stuff from the code signature. This happens using the <code>sys_csops(169)</code> syscall, which is pretty much undocumented but is very similar to the code here.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://fergofrog.com/code/cbowser/xnu/bsd/kern/kern_proc.c.html#csops">xnu/bsd/kern/kern_proc.c.html#csops</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://fergofrog.com/code/cbowser/xnu/bsd/kern/kern_proc.c.html#csops_internal">xnu/bsd/kern/kern_proc.c.html#csops_internal</a></li>
</ul>

<p>They execute the following operations:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>CS_OPS_STATUS</code></li>
  <li><code>CS_OPS_CDHASH</code></li>
  <li><code>CS_OPS_ENTITLEMENTS_BLOB</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The most important one of this is the <code>CS_OPS_STATUS</code>, this retrieves the current codesigning status of the process. A jailbroken device can respond with messy status flags. Such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>CS_GET_TASK_ALLOW</code></li>
  <li><code>CS_INSTALLER</code></li>
  <li><code>CS_PLATFORM_BINARY</code></li>
  <li><code>CS_DEBUGGED</code> (Process was debugged / is being debugged)</li>
  <li>Or missing <code>CS_VALID</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>A normal device would have these flags:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>CS_VALID</code></li>
  <li><code>CS_HARD</code></li>
  <li><code>CS_KILL</code></li>
  <li><code>CS_ENFORCEMENT</code></li>
  <li><code>CS_REQUIRE_LV</code></li>
  <li><code>CS_DYLD_PLATFORM</code></li>
  <li><code>CS_SIGNED</code></li>
</ul>

<p>For all available flags and their descriptions, see <a href="https://fergofrog.com/code/cbowser/xnu/BUILD/obj/EXPORT_HDRS/osfmk/kern/cs_blobs.h.html#_M/CS_VALID">this page</a>.</p>

<p>The result of <code>CS_OPS_STATUS</code> and <code>CS_OPS_CDHASH</code> are stored and later sent to the Snapchat servers, encrypted.</p>

<h3 id="bundle-check">Bundle check</h3>

<p>This is a simple check but quite effective if not noticed by a tweak developer. Pseudo code looks like this.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>x0 = CFBundleGetMainBundle()
x1 = CFBundleGetIdentifier(x0)
x2 = CFStringGetCStringPtr(x1)
strncmp("com.toyopagroup.picaboo", x2)
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="dyld-check">Dyld check</h3>

<p>Snapchat has two methods to iterate all loaded dylibs.</p>

<h4 id="first-attempt">First attempt</h4>

<p>One way is using <a href="https://github.com/theos/sdks/blob/master/iPhoneOS11.2.sdk/usr/include/mach-o/dyld.h#L48">dyld_get_image_header</a> and <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/dladdr1.3.html">dladdr</a>. They iterate over <code>dyld_get_image_header</code> until it returns null and checks if it has seen everything with <a href="https://github.com/theos/sdks/blob/master/iPhoneOS11.2.sdk/usr/include/mach-o/dyld.h#L47">dyld_image_count</a>. The <code>dladdr</code> method provides them with the path of the dylib. These are checked against a few unknown strings but removing everything substrate related from the dyld list fixes this check.</p>

<h4 id="second-attempt">Second attempt</h4>

<p>The other method they use is calling <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/kernel/1537934-task_info">task_info</a> with flavor <code>TASK_DYLD_INFO</code>. This also gives them a list of all loaded dylibs and must be fixed separately from the first dyld check.</p>

<h3 id="file-system-checks">File system checks</h3>

<p>There are a couple of file system checks, of which all use the <code>sys_access(33)</code> syscall.</p>

<h4 id="first-list">First list</h4>

<ul>
  <li>/Library/Application Support/PhLite/phlite.bundle/AuthAPI.pem</li>
  <li>/private/var/tmp/cydia.log</li>
  <li>/bin/bash</li>
  <li>/usr/sbin/sshd</li>
  <li>/usr/libexec/ssh-keysign</li>
  <li>/usr/libexec/sftp-server</li>
  <li>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</li>
  <li>/.installed_yaluX</li>
  <li>/Library/LaunchDaemons/dropbear.plist</li>
  <li>/usr/local/bin/dropbear</li>
  <li>/System/Library/Caches/com.apple.dyld/enable-dylibs-to-override-cache</li>
  <li>/.cydia_no_stash</li>
  <li>/var/log/jailbreakd-stdout.log</li>
  <li>/etc/motd</li>
  <li>/usr/lib/libsubstitute.dylib</li>
  <li>/var/tmp/slide.txt</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="second-list">Second list</h4>

<ul>
  <li>/private/var/containers/Bundle/Application/AD659AF8-68C3-4E4B-BF02-236E1F733005/Snapchat.app/Ghay</li>
  <li>/private/var/containers/Bundle/Application/AD659AF8-68C3-4E4B-BF02-236E1F733005/Snapchat.app/Snapchat.crc</li>
  <li>/private/var/containers/Bundle/Application/AD659AF8-68C3-4E4B-BF02-236E1F733005/Snapchat.app/embedded.mobileprovision</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="last-one-and-expected-to-exist">Last one (and expected to exist)</h4>

<ul>
  <li>/private/var/containers/Bundle/Application/AD659AF8-68C3-4E4B-BF02-236E1F733005/Snapchat.app/PlugIns</li>
</ul>

<p>The last one makes it a bit harder to fix, since you can not simply replace the arm instructions with something that makes it always return false. Thus requiring an inline hook as replacement for the syscall so you gain full control over it.</p>

<h3 id="obj-c---class-checks">Obj-C - Class checks</h3>

<p>A lot of classes are checked from a lot of different tweaks. This is done using <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/1418952-objc_getclass">objc_getClass</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>SCOthmanPrefs</code></li>
  <li><code>SCOthmanSnapSaver</code></li>
  <li><code>SCOFiltersOthman</code></li>
  <li><code>SCSnapchPrefs</code></li>

  <li><code>R              t</code></li>
  <li><code>AVCameraViewControlIer</code></li>
  <li><code>SCAppDeIegate</code></li>

  <li><code>yytp</code></li>
  <li><code>FLManager</code></li>
  <li><code>DecryptScriptAlertView</code></li>
  <li><code>DzAdsManager</code></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="obj-c---method-checks">Obj-C - Method checks</h3>

<p>They also check methods. This happens using <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/1418952-objc_getclass">objc_getClass</a> and then <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/1418530-class_getinstancemethod">class_getInstanceMethod</a>. If any exists, you get flagged.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>NSMutableString</code>
    <ul>
      <li><code>a</code></li>
      <li><code>b</code></li>
      <li><code>c</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><code>SCAppDelegate</code>
    <ul>
      <li><code>MZ42SGH98C:</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><code>SCOperaPageViewController</code>
    <ul>
      <li><code>saveButtonPressed</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><code>UIViewController</code>
    <ul>
      <li><code>dzDidTapGalleryButton</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="obj-c---method-integrity-checks">Obj-C - Method integrity checks</h3>

<p>Next up is Snapchats own methods. For the classes listed below they first call <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/1418490-class_copymethodlist">class_copyMethodList</a>. Then for every <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/method?language=objc">Method</a> they check if the <code>IMP</code> pointer (address of the function) is within its own <code>__text</code> segment. This is how they detect whether a method has been hooked.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>SCAppDelegate</code></li>
  <li><code>MainViewController</code></li>
  <li><code>SCChatMainViewController</code></li>
  <li><code>SCChatViewControllerV3</code></li>
  <li><code>SCScreenshotDetector</code></li>
  <li><code>SCBaseMediaOperaPresenter</code></li>
  <li><code>SCOperaPageViewController</code></li>
  <li><code>SCLoginService</code></li>
  <li><code>SCAdsHoldoutExperimentContext</code></li>
  <li><code>SCExperimentManager</code></li>
  <li><code>SCCaptionDefaultTextView</code></li>
  <li><code>SCChatTypingHandler</code></li>
  <li><code>Story</code></li>
  <li><code>SCChatMessageV3</code></li>
  <li><code>SCOperaViewersLayer</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks to <code>dzan</code> for telling me to check the <code>__text</code> segment. :-)</p>

<h3 id="symbol-checks">Symbol checks</h3>

<p>They also check for a couple of symbols using <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/3/dlsym">dlsym</a>. If the result is not null, you get flagged.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>MSHookMessageEx</code></li>
  <li><code>MSHookFunction</code></li>
  <li><code>_Z17replaced_readlinkPKcPcm</code></li>
  <li><code>hooksArray</code></li>
  <li><code>_OBJC_METACLASS_$__xxx</code></li>
  <li><code>_OBJC_CLASS_$_PHSSaverV2</code></li>
  <li><code>plist</code></li>
  <li><code>flexBreakPoint</code></li>
  <li><code>convert_coordinates_from_device_to_interface</code></li>
  <li><code>OBJC_METACLASS_$_DzSnapHelper</code></li>
  <li><code>ChKey2</code></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="symbol-hook-checks">Symbol hook checks</h3>

<p>A few symbols are resolved using <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/3/dlsym">dlsym</a> to check whether they have been hooked. They first resolve <code>dlsym</code> using <code>dlsym</code>.. yeah.. That result gets used for the <code>dlsym</code> of the symbols below. For every address returned, the first 4 bytes are checked for common hook related instructions.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>dlsym</code></li>
  <li><code>objc_getClass</code></li>
  <li><code>class_getInstanceMethod</code></li>
  <li><code>sel_registerName</code></li>
  <li><code>class_copyMethodList</code></li>
  <li><code>_dyld_image_count</code></li>
  <li><code>_dyld_get_image_header</code></li>
  <li><code>dladdr</code></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="environment-variables">Environment variables</h3>

<p>I need to be honest, this is a very annoying way how they check for injection because it is annoying to fix. Instead of using <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/getenv.3.html">getenv</a> they use the <a href="http://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=posix/environ.c">environ</a> variable. Since it is a variable, you can not “hook” it.</p>

<p>At least the following variables are detected.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=/usr/lib/TweakInject.dylib</code></li>
  <li><code>_MSSafeMode=0</code></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sandbox-check">Sandbox check</h3>

<p>Probably not an issue for anyone.</p>

<p><img src="https://aeonlucid.com/images/snapchat/ios_sandbox.png" alt="iOS sandbox">
</p>

<h3 id="fingerprinting">Fingerprinting</h3>

<p>Not much detection done here but still relevant, using <code>sys_sysctl(202)</code> they request at least the following properties.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>kern.version</code></li>
  <li><code>kern.osversion</code></li>
  <li><code>kern.proc.pid.&lt;PID&gt;</code></li>
  <li><code>hw.machine</code></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="other">Other</h3>

<p>The syscall <code>sys_proc_info(33)</code> is also called a couple of times, which could reveal stuff that is ptracing the process. They also use <code>sys_open(5)</code>, <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html">mmap</a>, <code>sys_close(6)</code> and <code>sys_lstat64(340)</code> on the <code>Snapchat</code> binary. Probably to check for modifications or generating a checksum.</p>

<h2 id="how-all-this-stuff-was-found">How all this stuff was found</h2>

<p>A lot of the work was done using a small iOS emulator build on top of <a href="https://github.com/unicorn-engine/unicorn">Unicorn</a>. Using an emulator you can see everything they do. Building this was also teached me a lot about the CoreFoundation library of iOS.</p>

<p><img src="https://aeonlucid.com/images/snapchat/ios_emulator.png" alt="iOS emulator">
</p>

<p>Later I implemented a counter for all of my discoveries in a tweak called <a href="https://github.com/AeonLucid/SnapHide">SnapHide</a> while carefully keeping track of how my changes modified the detection flags and slowly getting rid of all of them. You can easily find fixes for checks mentioned in this blog post in the “Detections” directory.</p>

<p>You could alternatively trace the syscalls using any of the methods discussed in the WhoYouGonnaSyscall talk by <a href="https://twitter.com/hexploitable">Hexploitable</a>. Slides of the talk can be found <a href="https://github.com/radareorg/r2con2019/blob/master/talks/WhoYouGonnaSyscall/Hex-r2con2019-WhoYouGonnaSyscall.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="a-story-on-how-i-wasted-hours-on-fixing-syscalls">A story on how I wasted hours on fixing syscalls</h3>

<p>Let’s take <code>sys_access(33)</code> as an example. It’s implementation looks like <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/access.2.html">this</a>. In short, when a file exists and permission is granted, return <code>0</code>. Otherwise return <code>-1</code>. First thing I did was force both of the results in my emulator but I saw no changes happening to the detection flags.</p>

<p>Later when implementing a fix for this in the <a href="https://github.com/AeonLucid/SnapHide">SnapHide</a> tweak, I was unable to have it fail. The arm instructions look like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>MOV             X0, X27 ; path
MOV             X1, #0  ; mode
MOV             X16, #0x21
SVC             0x80    ; SYS_access
MOV             X0, #0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
CSEL            X0, X0, XZR, CS
MOV             X27, X0 ; Use result
</code></pre></div></div>

July 7, 2020 | https://blog.vespa.ai/vespa-product-updates-june-2020/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.vespa.ai/vespa-product-updates-june-2020/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <!-- Toc if any -->
                
                <!-- End Toc -->
                <p>In the <a href="https://blog.vespa.ai/vespa-product-updates-may-2020/">May updates</a>,
we mentioned Improved Slow Node Tolerance, Multi-Threaded Rank Profile Compilation, Reduced Peak Memory at Startup, Feed Performance Improvements and Increased Tensor Performance.</p>

<p>This month, we’re excited to share the following updates:</p>

<h4 id="support-for-approximate-nearest-neighbor-vector-search">Support for Approximate Nearest Neighbor Vector Search</h4>
<p>Vespa now supports approximate nearest neighbor search which can be combined with filters and text search.
By using a <a href="https://blog.vespa.ai/approximate-nearest-neighbor-search-in-vespa-part-1/">native implementation of the HNSW algorithm</a>,
Vespa provides state of the art performance on vector search:
Typical single digit millisecond response time, searching hundreds of millions of documents per node,
but also uniquely allows vector query operators to be combined efficiently with filters and text search -
which is usually a requirement for real-world applications such as text search and recommendation.
Vectors can be updated in real time with a sustained write rate of a few thousand vectors per node per second.
Read more in the documentation on <a href="https://docs.vespa.ai/documentation/nearest-neighbor-search.html">nearest neighbor search</a>.</p>

<h4 id="streaming-search-speedup">Streaming Search Speedup</h4>
<p>Streaming Search is a feature unique to Vespa.
It is optimized for use cases like personal search and e-mail search -
but is also useful in high-write applications querying a fraction of the total data set.
With <a href="https://github.com/vespa-engine/vespa/pull/13508">#13508</a>,
read throughput from storage increased up to 5x due to better parallelism.</p>

<h4 id="rank-features">Rank Features</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The (Native)fieldMatch rank features are optimized to use less CPU query time, improving query latency for
<a href="https://docs.vespa.ai/documentation/text-matching-ranking.html#ranking">Text Matching and Ranking</a>.</li>
  <li>The new globalSequence rank feature is an inexpensive global ordering of documents in a system with stable system state.
For a system where node indexes change, this is inaccurate.
See <a href="https://docs.vespa.ai/documentation/reference/rank-features.html#globalSequence">globalSequence documentation</a> for alternatives.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="gke-sample-application">GKE Sample Application</h4>
<p>Thank you to <a href="https://github.com/griseau">Thomas Griseau</a> for contributing a new sample application
for Vespa on <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine">GKE</a>,
which is a great way to start using Vespa on Kubernetes.</p>

<hr>
<p>About Vespa: Largely developed by Yahoo engineers,
<a href="https://github.com/vespa-engine/vespa">Vespa</a> is an open source big data processing and serving engine.
It’s in use by many products, such as Yahoo News, Yahoo Sports, Yahoo Finance, and the Verizon Media Ad Platform.
Thanks to feedback and contributions from the community, Vespa continues to grow.</p>

<p>We welcome your contributions and feedback (<a href="https://twitter.com/vespaengine">tweet</a>
or <a href="mailto:info@vespa.ai">email</a>) about any of these new features or future improvements you’d like to request.</p>

    <p>I was recently asked to look over some CVs. It’s a while since I’ve done this, so I thought that noting down my immediate reactions as I went through the CVs might help anyone having to circulate their own CV at the moment.</p>

<!--snip-->

<p><img src="https://youknowfordevs.com/images/uploads/christopher-sardegna-iRyGmA_no2Q-unsplash.jpg" alt="Photo by Christopher Sardegna on Unsplash"></p>

<p>I’m not for a moment saying I’m right or wrong in the following views, and this is definitely not one of those posts about ‘how to write your CV to land your dream job’. I’m merely laying out the responses I had and more importantly what I felt these reponses told me about the person behind the CV. My ‘gut reaction’ may well be similar to others’ and if they are, it might be worth bearing them in mind when you share your CV.</p>

<h2 id="looks-count-more-than-i-thought">Looks Count More Than I Thought</h2>

<p>First, it wasn’t until I reached the ninth CV that I realised how much a CV’s appearance makes a difference. When viewing numbers one to eight I hadn’t been thinking ‘these look terrible’, but when I reached the ninth, a part of my brain said: ‘Finally! A CV that looks good.’</p>

<p>I think if the role was for a C++ programmer then I probably would have simply smiled to myself, ignored my response, and moved on. That’s not to say that appearance doesn’t matter–or that C++ programmers don’t worry about their appearance–but if I was trying to decide between two C++ programmers it wouldn’t be the look of their CV that was the deciding factor.</p>

<p>But the role for which I was reviewing this batch of CVs was a React developer and there are lots of very talented React developers out there. And when lots of people have worked with GraphQL and Docker and cloud services and D3 then it may well come down to whether or not you have made an effort to convey that you like things to ‘look nice’.</p>

<p>It’s worth saying too that the CVs that looked good didn’t go overboard; all they did was have a pleasing font, perhaps two columns instead of one for the layout, maybe a couple of icons and some colour, and probably didn’t span more than a couple of pages. But that was enough to convince me that these were people who would ensure that a bad-looking product didn’t get deployed.</p>

<h2 id="attention-to-detail">Attention to Detail</h2>

<p>Probably in the same vein, typos really jump out at you when you are looking at a lot of CVs. Again I’m not saying I’m right or wrong on whether this should be an important criteria, but the fact that my subconcscious reaction was to be turned off if I saw a spelling mistake–or a technology name that had been capitalised incorrectly–shows that somewhere in our psyches this stuff counts for something.</p>

<p>As with the previous point about looks, I’d probably see this as more relevant for front-end people.</p>

<p>And it might be worth saying that it’s usually not difficult to differentiate between those who have just not bothered to check their CV and those that have difficulty with spelling. I’ve worked with people in the latter camp, both senior managers and junior programmers, and it’s not a big deal–you can work with it and it would not stop me from hiring someone.</p>

<p>But to keep with the theme of my ‘initial reaction’, I can’t help that when I see someone write ‘Graphql’ I’m going to doubt whether the applicant really has that much experience with ‘GraphQL’; maybe it’s worth just double-checking the website of the technologies you use one last time, before sending off that CV.</p>

<h2 id="approaches-v-technologies">Approaches v. Technologies</h2>

<p>One other thing that I hadn’t expected was that I was drawn to mark people more highly if they gave some indication of the <em>approach</em> they took to their coding and development. For example, a few people mentioned having experience with TDD, which I thought was good. That doesn’t mean I’d rule out someone who didn’t have TDD experience, but it’s an approach that people need to be aware of.</p>

<p>However, more importantly than TDD, only a handful indicated that they liked to get involved in code reviews and saw them as a good way to share knowledge and build a consistent and high quality codebase. Again, I would not rule out someone who didn’t mention code reviews, mentoring, and so on, provided they were relatively inexperienced; but I probably <em>would</em> rule out someone who clearly has experience, but hasn’t thought to mention these things.</p>

<h3 id="approach-from-technologies">Approach From Technologies</h3>

<p>What I was also surprised by was how the list of technologies on a person’s CV led to me forming an impression of the kind of coder that person was. If I saw GraphQL in the mix then I found myself thinking ‘modern tech stack’. It may be unfair, especially since GraphQL wasn’t mentioned in the job description that was circulated; but after reviewing all of the CVs I found that it was a pretty accurate indicator of the types of projects someone had been involved in.</p>

<p>There were other technologies that were similarly indicative, such as mention of ‘microservices’, or use of MongoDB, Elasticsearch, Redis, RabbitMQ, and so on. But there were very few CVs where these technologies appeared without GraphQL.</p>

<p>There is probably no general rule here, since the technologies that differentiate will be different in each cohort of CVs; if every CV included GraphQL then it may have been the presence of something like Docker and/or Kubernetes that told you something about the kind of people you were looking at.</p>

<h2 id="public-profile">Public Profile</h2>

<p>This last point may also be controversial, but I’m going to describe it so that you can do whatever you like with the information; if someone was not on LinkedIn or didn’t have a public Git account, I found myself thinking ‘well, what exactly do they do?’</p>

<p>From this batch of 22 CVs, only one had answered any questions on Stack Overflow, and only one–a different person–had done any talks at Meetups. A couple had GitHub accounts, a couple were on LinkedIn and a couple had blogs.</p>

<p>This is no doubt unfair, so again, blame my subconscious. But I can’t help think that if I’m going to work with some people day after day, I want to be with people that are sharing links to things they’ve read, people who are trying out new technologies and languages, people who have weekend projects, or who are contributing bug fixes back to open source projects.</p>

<p>And although I’m not particularly a big fan of LinkedIn, I always quite like it when I see people who are at the early stages of their career making connections with everyone they met at last night’s Meetup.</p>

<p>None of this is to ignore the current discussion about work/life balance–to demand that people do their own education in their own time, spend all waking hours coding, attend Meetups every night of the week. But it is to recognise that we are in a fast-moving industry, and if you want your CV to be picked from amongst that batch of 22, then it’s going to be important to think about how you come across.</p>

<h2 id="qualifications">Qualifications</h2>

<p>One final thing has just occurred to me…I didn’t consider the qualifications of <em>anyone</em>, which I imagine is down to the role that the CVs were for. You’d certainly be interested in degrees and PhDs if you were hiring a data scientist or someone to write an operating system; in these spaces theory is a major element. But for fast-moving technologies like front-end development, you can probably tell everything about a person from their experience.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I haven’t had to look at CVs for quite a while, so it was interesting to examine my own responses to reviewing this batch. What became clear is that I quickly ‘merged’ the CV and the person in my mind. If there were mistakes in the CV I couldn’t help but imagine someone who lacked attention to detail. If there was a little bit of colour in the CV or the person had spoken at a Meetup then I couldn’t help but think that this was a person who was prepared to go the extra mile. And if the person had a public Git account then my spontaneous reaction was that this was someone who wanted to keep learning, and really enjoyed the work they do.</p>

<p>I may be wrong in my judgements or harsh in my conclusions, but if you’re about to send your CV out, at least you now have a couple more insights that might help you decide how your CV is representing you.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>  
<span>Syntax errors are generally easy to fix for humans, but not for parsers in general nor LR parsers in</span>
<span>particular. Traditional ‘panic mode’ error recovery, though easy to implement and applicable to</span>
<span>any grammar, often leads to a cascading chain of errors that drown out the original. More</span>
<span>advanced error recovery techniques suffer less from this problem but have seen little practical use</span>
<span>because their typical performance was seen as poor, their worst case unbounded, and the</span>
<span>repairs they reported arbitrary. In this paper we introduce the </span><span>CPCT</span><span>+</span>  <span>algorithm, and an</span>
<span>implementation of that algorithm, that address these issues. First, </span><span>CPCT</span><span>+</span> <span>reports the complete set of</span>
<span>minimum cost repair sequences for a given location, allowing programmers to select the one that</span>
<span>best fits their intention. Second, on a corpus of 200,000 real-world syntactically invalid Java</span>
<span>programs, </span><span>CPCT</span><span>+</span>  <span>is able to repair 98.37%</span><span>±</span><span>0.017% </span><span>of files within a timeout of 0.5s. Finally,</span>
<span>CPCT</span><span>+</span> <span>uses the complete set of minimum cost repair sequences to reduce the cascading error</span>
<span>problem, where incorrect error recovery causes further spurious syntax errors to be identified.</span>
<span>Across the test corpus, </span><span>CPCT</span><span>+</span> <span>reports 435,812</span><span>±</span><span>473 </span><span>error locations to the user, reducing the</span>
<span>cascading error problem substantially relative to the 981,628</span><span>±</span><span>0 </span><span>error locations reported by panic</span>
<span>mode.</span>

<h3><span>1</span> <a id="x1-10001"></a>Introduction</h3>
<!--l. 131--><p>Programming is a humbling job which requires acknowledging that we will make untold errors in
our quest to perfect a program. Most troubling are semantic errors, where we intended the
program to do one thing, but it does another. Less troubling, but often no less irritating, are
syntax errors, which are generally minor deviances from the exacting syntax required by a
compiler. So common are syntax errors that parsers in modern compilers are designed to cope
with us making several: rather than stop on the first syntax error, they attempt to
<span>recover </span>from it. This allows them to report, and us to fix, all our syntax errors in one
go.
</p><!--l. 141--><p>When error recovery works well, it is a useful productivity gain. Unfortunately, most current
error recovery approaches are simplistic. The most common grammar-neutral approach to error
recovery are those algorithms described as ‘panic mode’ (e.g.&nbsp;[<a href="#Xholub90compilerdesign">13</a>, p.&nbsp;348]) which skip input until
the parser finds something it is able to parse. A more grammar-specific variation of this
idea is to skip input until a pre-determined synchronisation token (e.g. ‘;’ in Java) is
reached&nbsp;[<a href="#Xdegano95comparison">8</a> , p.&nbsp;3], or to try inserting a single synchronisation token. Such strategies are
often unsuccessful, leading to a cascade of spurious syntax errors (see Figure&nbsp;<a href="#x1-1018r1">1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:javaerror --></a> for an
example). Programmers quickly learn that only the location of the first error in a file – not
the reported repair, nor the location of subsequent errors – can be relied upon to be
accurate.

<span>Figure</span><span>&nbsp;1:  </span></span><span><span>An example of a simple, common Java syntax error (</span><a href="#x1-1001r1"><span>a</span></a><span>) and the problems traditional</span>
<span>error recovery has in dealing with it. </span><span>javac </span><span>(</span><a href="#x1-1011r2"><span>b</span></a><span>) spots the error when it encounters ‘</span><span>y</span><span>’. Its error</span>
<span>recovery algorithm then repairs the input by inserting a semicolon before ‘</span><span>y</span><span>’ (i.e.</span><span>&nbsp;making the input</span>
<span>equivalent to ‘</span><span>int x; y;</span><span>’). This then causes a spurious parsing error, since ‘</span><span>y</span><span>’ on its own is not</span>

<span>non-deterministically find one minimum cost repair sequence). In this case three repair sequences</span>
<span>are reported to the user: one can delete ‘</span><span>y</span><span>’ entirely (‘</span><span>int x;</span><span>’), or insert a comma (‘</span><span>int x, y;</span><span>’), or</span>
<span>insert an equals sign (</span><span>‘int x = y;’</span><span>).</span>

<!--l. 233--><p>It is possible to hand-craft error recovery algorithms for a specific language. These
generally allow better recovery from errors, but are challenging to create. For example,
the Java error recovery approach in the Eclipse IDE is 5KLoC long, making it only
slightly smaller than a modern version of Berkeley Yacc — a complete parsing system!
Unsurprisingly, few real-world parsers contain effective hand-written error recovery
algorithms.
</p><!--l. 240--><p>Most of us are so used to these trade-offs (cheap generic algorithms and poor recovery
vs.&nbsp;expensive hand-written algorithms and reasonable recovery) that we assume them to be
inevitable. However, there is a long line of work on more advanced generic error recovery
algorithms. Probably the earliest such algorithm is Aho and Peterson&nbsp;[<a href="#Xaho72minimum">1</a>], which, upon
encountering an error, creates on-the-fly an alternative (possibly ambiguous) grammar which
allows the parser to recover. This algorithm has fallen out of favour in programming
language circles, probably because of its implementation complexity and the difficulty of
explaining to users what recovery has been used. A simpler family of algorithms, which
trace their roots to Fischer <span>et al.</span>&nbsp;[<a href="#Xfischer79locally">11</a>], instead try to find a single minimum cost <span>repair</span>
<span>sequence </span>of token insertions and deletions which allow the parser to recover. Algorithms in
this family are much better at recovering from errors than naive approaches and can
communicate the repairs they find in a way that humans can easily replicate. However, such
algorithms have seen little practical use because their typical performance is seen as
poor and their worst case unbounded [<a href="#Xmckenzie95error">17</a>, p.&nbsp;14]. We add a further complaint: such
approaches only report a single repair sequence to users. In general – and especially in
syntactically rich languages – there are multiple reasonable repair sequences for a given
error location, and the algorithm has no way of knowing which best matches the user’s
intentions.
</p><!--l. 261--><p>In this paper we introduce a new error recovery algorithm in the Fischer <span>et al. </span>family, <span>CPCT</span><span>+</span>.
This takes the approach of Corchuelo <span>et al.</span>&nbsp;[<a href="#Xcorchuelo02repairing">5</a>] as a base, corrects it, expands it, and
optimises its implementation. <span>CPCT</span><span>+</span> is simple to implement (under 500 lines of Rust
code), is able to repair nearly all errors in reasonable time, reports the complete set of
minimum cost repair sequences to users, and does so in less time than Corchuelo <span>et</span>
<span>al.</span>.
</p><!--l. 269--><p>We validate <span>CPCT</span><span>+</span> on a corpus of 200,000 real, syntactically incorrect, Java programs
(Section&nbsp;<a href="#x1-140006">6<!--tex4ht:ref: experiment --></a>). <span>CPCT</span><span>+</span> is able to recover 98.37%<span>±</span><span>0.017% </span>of files within a 0.5s timeout and does so
while reporting fewer than half the error locations as a traditional panic mode algorithm: in other
words, <span>CPCT</span><span>+</span> substantially reduces the cascading error problem. We also show – for, as far as we
know, the first time – that advanced error recovery can be naturally added to a Yacc-esque
system, allowing users to make fine-grained decisions about what to do when error recovery has
been applied to an input (Section&nbsp;<a href="#x1-180007">7<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:api --></a>). We believe that this shows that algorithms such as <span>CPCT</span><span>+</span>
are ready for wider usage, either on their own, or as part of a multi-phase recovery
system.

<!--l. 292--><p>The only work we are aware of with a similar concept of ‘acceptable time’ is&nbsp;[<a href="#XdeJonge12natural">6</a>], who define it
as the total time spent in error recovery per file, with a threshold of 1s. We use that
definition with one change: Since many compilers are able to fully execute in less than 1s,
we felt that a tighter threshold is more appropriate: we use 0.5s since we think that
even the most demanding users will tolerate such a delay. We strongly validate this
hypothesis.

will see a repair sequence that matches their original intention (see Figure&nbsp;<a href="#x1-1018r1">1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:javaerror --></a> for an example;
Appendix&nbsp;<a href="#x1-28000A">A<!--tex4ht:ref: app:examples --></a> contains further examples in Java, Lua, and PHP). It also opens up a new
opportunity. Previous error recovery algorithms find a single repair sequence, apply that to the
input, and then continue parsing. While that repair sequence may have been a reasonable local
choice, it may cause cascading errors later. Since we have the complete set of minimum
cost repair sequences available, we can select from that set a repair sequence which
causes fewer cascading errors. We thus rank repair sequences by how far they allow
parsing to continue successfully (up to a threshold — parsing the whole file would, in
general, be too costly), and choose from the subset that gets furthest (note that the
time required to do this is included in the 0.5s timeout). We thus also test a second
hypothesis:

    <p>
      Symbolic execution with SymCC: Don't interpret, compile!
    </p>
    
    <em>Proceedings of the 29th USENIX Security Symposium (USENIX Security 20),
    Boston, MA, USA</em>
    
    
    <p>
      A major impediment to practical symbolic execution is speed, especially
      when compared to near-native speed solutions like fuzz testing. We propose
      a compilation-based approach to symbolic execution that performs better
      than state-of-the-art implementations by orders of magnitude. We present
      SymCC, an LLVM-based C and C++ compiler that builds concolic execution
      right into the binary. It can be used by software developers as a drop-in
      replacement for <tt>clang</tt> and <tt>clang++</tt>, and we show how to
      add support for other languages with little effort. In comparison with
      KLEE, SymCC is faster by up to three orders of magnitude and an average
      factor of 12. It also outperforms QSYM, a system that recently showed
      great performance improvements over other implementations, by up to two
      orders of magnitude and an average factor of 10. Using it on real-world
      software, we found that our approach consistently achieves higher
      coverage, and we discovered two vulnerabilities in the heavily tested
      OpenJPEG project, which have been confirmed by the project maintainers and
      assigned CVE identifiers.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

  <p>
    SymCC is a fast compiler-based symbolic execution engine. On this page, we
    provide SymCC's source code, the raw results of the experiments described in
    the paper, as well as instructions how you can replicate those experiments
    yourself.
  </p>

  <h2>Code</h2>

  <p>
    SymCC is available
    on <a href="https://github.com/eurecom-s3/symcc">GitHub</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Experiments</h2>

  <p>
    In the paper, we describe two sets of experiments: we first benchmark SymCC
    on the CGC programs, then we run it on real-world software. This section
    describes how to replicate our experiments, and provides links to our
    results.
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        CGC experiments (our results
        for <a href="http://www.s3.eurecom.fr/~seba/symcc_cgc_pure_time.csv">pure
        execution
        time</a>, <a href="http://www.s3.eurecom.fr/~seba/symcc_cgc_concolic_time.csv">concolic
        execution time</a>,
        and <a href="http://www.s3.eurecom.fr/~seba/symcc_cgc_concolic_coverage.tar.gz">coverage</a>)
      </p>

      <p>
        We used the <a href="https://github.com/trailofbits/cb-multios">Linux
          port</a> of the CGC programs by Trail of Bits. SymCC needs to be built
        with support for 32-bit compilation (see <tt>docs/32-bit.txt</tt>;
        this is not part of the Dockerfile because it would double the build
        time of the container while providing value to just a few users). Then
        you can simply export
        <tt>CC=/path/to/symcc</tt>, <tt>CXX=/path/to/sym++</tt> and <tt>SYMCC_NO_SYMBOLIC_INPUT=1</tt>, and
        build the CGC programs as usual (i.e., by invoking their build.sh script).
      </p>

      <p>
        Run the programs on the raw PoV inputs
        with <tt>SYMCC_NO_SYMBOLIC_INPUT=1</tt> to measure pure execution
        time, and unset the environment variable for symbolic execution. To
        assess coverage, we ran <tt>afl-showmap</tt> with the
        AFL-instrumented CGC programs on each generated input and accumulated
        the resulting coverage maps per program, resulting in a set of covered
        map entries for each CGC program. The sizes of those sets can then be
        fed to the scoring formula presented in the paper.
      </p>

      <p>
        For KLEE and QSYM, we used the setup
        described <a href="http://www.s3.eurecom.fr/tools/symbolic_execution/ir_study.html">here</a> but with the regular 32-bit
        binaries built by cb-multios.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Real-world software</p>

      <p>
        The analysis of real-world software always follows the same procedure.
        Assuming you have exported <tt>CC=symcc</tt>, <tt>CXX=sym++</tt>
        and <tt>SYMCC_NO_SYMBOLIC_INPUT=1</tt>, first download the code,
        then build it using its own build system, finally
        unset <tt>SYMCC_NO_SYMBOLIC_INPUT</tt> and analyze the program in
        concert with AFL (which requires building a second time for AFL,
        see <tt>docs/Fuzzing.txt</tt>). We used AFL 2.56b and built the
        targets with <tt>AFL_USE_ASAN=1</tt>. Note that the fuzzing helper
        is already installed in the Docker container.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/uclouvain/openjpeg.git">OpenJPEG</a>
          (<a href="http://www.s3.eurecom.fr/~seba/symcc_afl_openjpeg.tar.gz">our
          results</a>): we used revision <tt>1f1e9682</tt>, built with CMake as
          described in the project's <tt>INSTALL.md</tt>
          (adding <tt>-DBUILD_THIRDPARTY=ON</tt> to make sure that third-party
          libraries are compiled with SymCC as well), and
          analyzed <tt>bin/opj_decompress -i @@ -o /tmp/image.pgm</tt>; the
          corpus consisted of test
          files <a href="https://github.com/uclouvain/openjpeg-data/blob/master/input/conformance/file1.jp2">file1.jp2</a>
          and <a href="https://github.com/uclouvain/openjpeg-data/blob/master/input/conformance/file8.jp2">file8.jp2</a>.
        </li>

        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/libarchive/libarchive.git">libarchive</a>
          (<a href="http://www.s3.eurecom.fr/~seba/symcc_afl_libarchive.tar.gz">our
          results</a>): we used revision <tt>9ebb2484</tt>, built with CMake as
          described in the poject's <tt>INSTALL</tt> (but
          adding <tt>-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release</tt>), and
          analyzed <tt>bin/bsdtar tf @@</tt>; the corpus consisted of just a
          single dummy file containing the character "A".
        </li>

        <li>
          tcpdump
          (<a href="http://www.s3.eurecom.fr/~seba/symcc_afl_tcpdump.tar.gz">our
          results</a>): we built both tcpdump and libpcap; in order to make the
          former find the latter, just place the source directories next to each
          other in the same folder. We used revision <tt>d615abec</tt>
          of <a href="https://github.com/the-tcpdump-group/libpcap.git">libpcap</a>
          and revision <tt>d57927e1</tt>
          of <a href="https://github.com/the-tcpdump-group/tcpdump.git">tcpdump</a>.
          We built first libpcap and then tcpdump with <tt>./configure
          &amp;&amp; make</tt>, and analyzed
          <tt>tcpdump/tcpdump -e -r @@</tt>; the corpus consisted of just a single dummy
          file containing the character "A".</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        All experiments used one AFL master process, one secondary AFL process,
        and one SymCC process. We let them run for 24 hours and repeated each of
        them 30 times to create the graphs in the paper; AFL map density was
        extracted from the secondary AFL process' <tt>plot_data</tt> file,
        column <tt>map_size</tt>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The QSYM experiments used an analogous setup, replacing SymCC with QSYM
        and running it with AFL according to the QSYM
        authors' <a href="https://github.com/sslab-gatech/qsym#run-hybrid-fuzzing-with-afl">instructions</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>This is mostly copypasta from <a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/412281/112115">an answer I gave on StackOverflow</a> about how to avoid mocks when unit testing. It’s a continuation of the argument I gave in <a href="http://chriswarbo.net/blog/2017-11-10-unit_testing_terminology.html">an earlier blog post</a>.</p>
<p>I think the subject of automated testing suffers from conflated and co-opted terminology, which causes people to talk past each other.</p>
<p>For example, the questioner asks the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Should I be writing only integration tests when there is dependency, and unit tests for pieces of code without any dependency?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think most people would answer this question by saying something like (ideally, modulo common sense, etc.):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When there is no dependency, unit tests are sufficient and mocks aren’t needed; when there is dependency, unit tests may need mocks and there should also be integration tests.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s call this Answer A, and I’m going to assume that it’s a relatively uncontroversial thing to say.</p>
<p>However, two people might both give Answer A, but mean very different things when they say it!</p>
<p>When a person who the questioner terms a “classicist” says Answer A, they might mean the following (Answer B):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Functionality that is internal to the application (e.g.&nbsp;a calculation which performs no I/O) doesn’t need integration tests, and its unit tests don’t need mocks. Functionality with some external dependency (e.g.&nbsp;a separate application like an RDBMS, or a third-party Web service) should have integration tests, and if it has unit tests they may need the external interactions to be mocked.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When others (let’s call them “mockists”) say Answer A, the might mean the following (Answer C):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A class which doesn’t call methods of another class doesn’t need integration tests, and its unit tests don’t need mocks. Classes which call methods of other classes should mock those out during their unit tests, and they should probably have integration tests too.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These testing strategies are objectively very different, but they both correspond to Answer A. This is due to the different meanings they are using for words. We can caricature someone who says Answer A, but means Answer B, as saying the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A “dependency” is a different application, Web service, etc. Possibly maintained by a third-party. Unchangeable, at least within the scope of our project. For example, our application might have MySQL as a dependency.</li>
<li>A “unit” is a piece of functionality which makes some sort of sense on its own. For example “adding a contact” may be a unit of functionality.</li>
<li>A “unit test” checks some aspect of a unit of functionality. For example, “if we add a contact with email address X, looking up that contact’s email address should give back X”.</li>
<li>An “interface” is the protocol our application should follow to interact with a dependency, or how our application should behave when used as a dependency by something else. For example, SQL with a certain schema when talking to a database; JSON with a certain schema, sent over HTTP, when talking to a ReST API.</li>
<li>An “integration test” checks that the interface our application is using with a dependency will actually have the desired effect. For example “There will always be exactly one matching row after running an UPSERT query”.</li>
<li>A “mock” is a simplified, in-memory alternative to a dependency. For example, <code>MockRedisConnection</code> may follow the same interface as <code>RedisConnection</code>, but just contains a <code>HashMap</code>. Mocks can sometimes be useful, e.g.&nbsp;if some of our unit tests are annoyingly slow, or if our monthly bill from a third-party Web service is too high due to all of the calls made by our tests.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can caricature someone who says Answer A, but means Answer C, as saying the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A “dependency” is a different class to the one we’re looking at. For example, if we’re looking at the <code>Invoice</code> class, then the <code>Product</code> class might be a dependency.</li>
<li>A “unit” is a chunk of code, usually a method or class. For example <code>User::addContact</code> may be a unit.</li>
<li>A “unit test” checks only the code inside a single unit (e.g.&nbsp;one class). For example “Calling <code>User::addContact</code> with a contact with email address X will ask the <code>DBConnection</code> to insert a contacts row containing email address X”.</li>
<li>An “interface” is like a class but only has the method names and types; the implementations are provided by each class extending that interface.</li>
<li>An “integration test” checks that code involving multiple classes gives the correct result. For example “Adding a <code>Discount</code> to a <code>ShoppingCart</code> affects the <code>Invoice</code> produced by the <code>Checkout</code>”.</li>
<li>A “mock” is an object which records the method calls made on it, so we can check what the unit of code we’re testing tried to do in a unit test. They are essential if we want to isolate the unit under test from every other class.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are very different meanings, but the relationships between B’s meanings and between C’s meanings are similar, which is why both groups of people seem to agree with each other about Answer A (e.g.&nbsp;their definitions of “dependency” and “integration test” differ, but both have the relationship “dependencies should have integration tests”).</p>
<p>For the record, I would personally count myself as what that questioner calls a “classicist” (although I’d not come across that term before); hence why the above caricatures are clearly biased!</p>
<p>In any case, I think this problem of conflated meanings needs to be addressed before we can have constructive debates about the merits of one approach versus another. Unfortunately every time someone tries to introduce some new, more specialised vocabulary to avoid the existing conflations, those terms start getting mis-used until they’re just as conflated as before.</p>
<p>For example, “Thought Leader X” might want to talk about physical humans clicking on a UI or typing in a CLI, so they say “it’s important to describe how users can interact with the system; we’ll call these ‘behaviours’”. Their terminology spreads around, and soon enough “Though Leader Y” (either through misunderstanding, or thinking they’re improving the situation), will say something like “I agree with X, that when we design a system like the <code>WidgetFactory</code> class, we should use behaviours to describe how it interacts with its users, like the <code>ValidationFactory</code> class”. This co-opted usage spreads around, obscuring the original meaning. Those reading old books and blog posts from X may get confused about the original message, and start applying their advice to the newer meanings (after all, this is a highly regarded book by that influential luminary X!).</p>
<p>We’ve now reached the situation where “module” means class, “entity” means class, “unit” means class, “collaborator” means class, “dependency” means class, “user” means class, “consumer” means class, “client” means class, “system under test” means class, “service” means class. Where “boundary” means “class boundary”, “external” means “class boundary”, “interface” means “class boundary”, “protocol” means “class boundary”. Where “behaviour” means “method call”, where “functionality” means “method call”, where “message send” means “method call”…</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Reading time: 4 minutes</p><p><strong>Retain subscribers, increase revenue, and scale your Product-as-a-Service (PaaS) business.&nbsp;</strong><br></p><p>Increasing and retaining your subscriber base is fundamental to your PaaS subscription business; after all, they provide you the growth you need to scale your PaaS business. Payment issues are one of the leading causes for involuntary churn.<br></p><p>Yet, the number one reason for losing customers in the checkout process is due to a failure in the card network infrastructure. Cards weren't designed for recurring payments; typically, credit cards expire every three years, but they can also get canceled, lost, stolen, or hit card limits.&nbsp;<br></p><p><a href="https://www.firmhouse.com/blog/7-marketing-tips-to-grow-your-product-as-a-service-paas-subscription-business">Keeping existing subscribers </a>on board is crucial to increase your customer average lifetime value (CLTV). However, even if you try hard to offer a seamless experience, you can still lose customers due to payment issues or because your customer card details it's out of date.<br></p><p><strong><em>Preventing failing payments allows you to decrease churn and increase subscribers' retention.&nbsp;</em></strong><br></p><p>Within a subscription business, customer churn is the number of customers who stop paying for their subscription or unsubscribe during a given period. Addressing your customer churn challenges becomes more and more critical for your subscription business to succeed.<br></p><p><strong>There are two types of churn: voluntary and involuntary churn.&nbsp;</strong><br></p><p>In a voluntary churn, the customer decides to consciously unsubscribe when they feel they aren't getting the full value of your product or can't continue with the subscription. Voluntary churn is often based on customer experience rather than the operational aspects, and regardless of what you do, they might be already convinced to unsubscribe.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Now, involuntary churn is not so related to your customer experience. Rather is more related to operational issues that could happen due to payment issues, expired credit cards, insufficient funds or card number has been updated.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Involuntary churn isn't limited to the least engaged customers; it affects all of your subscribers, even the happiest customers (remember they can be as forgetful as your lowest-value customers). By tackling involuntary churn, you can prevent customers from leaving while continuing offering a seamless subscriber experience.<br></p><p>Involuntary churn harms your customer lifetime value (CLTV). Let's say your monthly recurring revenue (MRR) is $60, and the expected contract time is 18 months. If you have 100 customers and half of them are lost due to involuntary churn, that's 50% of subscribers leaving you, which is not useful when you are looking to optimize your customer lifetime value.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Involuntary churn is somehow easier to prevent than voluntary churn. You can avoid these involuntary challenges without changing your proposition or business model. Involuntary and voluntary churn can be prevented by taking the right measurements and having the proper process at hand.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>Implement solutions to reduce churn and prevent customers from leaving you again in the future with these 5 strategies:&nbsp;</strong><br></p><p><strong>1. Understand the root cause</strong></p><p>Billing systems or credit cards don't work perfectly. Understand what happens when a payment fails; try to get the why does this keep happening. You can use data for this or ask your customers directly.<br></p><p>If you still have some payment issues this could be due to:&nbsp;<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Insufficient funds from your customer</li><li>Customer bank account was closed</li><li>Credits over the limit to make payments</li><li>The card has expired or is no longer valid&nbsp;</li><li>Other payments issues (like temporary down-time)<br></li></ul><p>These are crucial questions to determine how to prevent failed payments and to retarget customers that are about to leave. If you set your payment schedule around your customer's lifestyle, you can ensure that the funds are ready and available for the payment.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>2. Ensure member data is up to date</strong></p><p>Expired cards are the most significant contributors to involuntary churn. Most credit cards expire after three years, meaning customers need to update their card number or expiration date (probably during the same time they are your subscribers). The longer the <a href="https://www.firmhouse.com/blog/the-product-as-a-service-business-case-calculator">lifetime value (LTV)</a>, the more involuntary churn there will be.<br></p><p><strong><em>Run automated updates, so customer data stays up to date.</em></strong> Communicate with your customers if any changes are done to the billing systems.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Also, keep customers up to date if there's any change in your pricing or logistics. Besides, understand if they are having problems receiving the products, or not enough customer experience and address these issues with a seamless payment process with a proactive customer-oriented billing and payment service.<br></p><p><strong>3. Keep customers that don't want to leave from leaving with a seamless experience</strong><br></p><p><a href="https://www.firmhouse.com/blog/what-is-product-as-a-service-paas">Product-as-a-Service (PaaS)</a> subscription services often lack reminders that communicate with their customers about changing their payment options. Friendly reminders are always a great way to include a link that enables customers to update their billing information with an urgent tone.&nbsp;</p><p>Avoid the spam folder. Regularly engage with subscribers, ask them in a non-spammy way what they think about the product, if they are happy or dissatisfied with your product, and why. Make sure to send your emails from return email so customers can get in touch with you if needed. By educating customers about special offers, price increases, and product updates, you stay connected with subscribers and increase your customer experience (CX). Make sure to have constant contact with customers to re-engage with them in the future.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>4. Subscriber management&nbsp;</strong><br></p><p>Provide a seamless branded personalized billing and payment experience across all channels—update subscribers' information with a software that can update information more easily. Use a single solution that manages your subscribers through their life cycle, including payment updates and add-ons.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>Offer customers flexible and customized payment schedules with constant support. Accept payments through various channels with integration with secure payment gateways that accept multiple currencies and safeguard your customer data.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Subscriber management is also essential once your company starts scaling, and extra support is needed, especially with your customized promotions, customer satisfaction, inventory management, and logistics.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>5. Built-in dunning management</strong></p><p>Know when subscribers' credit card expires and take further steps to prevent this from happening. One way to remind your subscribers when their payment method needs to be updated is by sending a series of email (app) messages encouraging customers to update their payment method soon.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Pre-dunning messages come in handy when you don't have another payment system to catch card updates.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Keep in mind that it is crucial to dedicate most of your efforts while they are still actively using your product (considering that it would be harder to capture them once they are gone).&nbsp;<br></p><p>Irregular billing can happen throughout your customer lifecycle, so having subscribers engaged can severely impact your customer subscription status. Prompt users to update their billing information while you make sure to have all the systems in place to prevent involuntary churn. In Firmhouse, we try at least 3 times to collect the payment from the customer. If this is not successful, the customer gets flagged and customer support will take over. Having a well trained customer support team can help you with this.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>‍<br>What to learn how to automate your payment process?

<p>There is a lot of fluff in Entrepreneurship and Product Management which is passed around as magical silver bullets. One of which I dislike is the “Aha Moment.”</p>



<p>A friend added me into a Twitter thread, which trigged a long time rant I had on it.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="525" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Frankly "Ah ha" Moments are overrated, Only at launch do products do just one thing for all their users. In most cases selection of a product is a series of "Ok" moments. &lt;cont&gt;</p>— Ravi Vyas ⊾ (@ravivyas84) <a href="https://twitter.com/ravivyas84/status/1280370903042252801?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 7, 2020</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<h2>A product is a Stack of things.</h2>



<p>The Aha Moment is supposed to be the moment when a user realizes the value of your product. The problem lies in the fact that rarely does a product just do one thing. Products are a “Stack” of features, ideologies, business, and growth plans and services. Users may ignore deficiencies in multiple parts of the stack for surfeits in the other parts. How many times have you heard someone say, I use the product because the support is great?</p>



<p>Sometimes it is not a “feature”, rather those that don’t exist in the product like great pricing, a just ideology, or simply the location of the team running the product that plays into whether the product will be used. For example, I decided to pay for <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://hey.com/" target="_blank">Hey</a> because of their ideology, I paid for <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://threadreaderapp.com/" target="_blank">Thread Reader</a> to support indie devs and great service. I am playing around with <a href="https://hostomy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hostomy</a> because it is a service recommended by a friend and is insanely cheap.</p>



<p>Aha moments do exist, but they are hard to achieve and harder to retain as the “Aha Moment” becomes the new normal. Stories for Snapchat might have been one, but today, it is the new Normal, or for some, a passing fad.</p>



<h2>OK Moments</h2>



<p>A better way to think of Great Products is using “OK Moments”. OK moments are basically moments where the users agree with some part of your product, and the best part is they compound.</p>



<p>Here are examples of OK moments</p>



<ul><li>OK, A friend Referred Product X to me</li><li>OK, Product X can do this</li><li>OK, I an afford product X</li><li>OK, Even my good friend uses product X</li><li>OK, Product X will handle Migration</li><li>OK, Product Y is being forced into the organization</li><li>OK, Product Y has this blocker for me, which Product X does not.</li><li>OK, Product X has a free trial, let me use it.</li><li>OK, Product X is a lifetime purchase rather than a monthly subscription</li><li>OK, Product X won an award from Apple, might be good.</li><li>OK, Product X supports the same causes as I do</li></ul>



<p>Each OK moment is either a problem being solved or a spotlight being cast on the product. The Aha moment at the end of the day is a threshold of OK moments, a threshold that is different for different people.</p>



<h2>Start Stacking</h2>



<p>If you are building a product, it is time to stack the OK Product bricks, after all, each innovation we know stands on a stack of others. A point Matt Ridley makes in his book, How Innovation Works.</p>

<p>OK Moments are no different, so start stacking OK moments across each point of interaction you have with your users to get to the point where everyone else thinks you have figured out your Aha Moment.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p><em>"Work on important problems": ~40900 results.</em></p>
<p><em>"Work on unimportant problems": ~18 results.</em></p>
<p><em>– Google (at the time of writing), tempting the contrarian in me</em></p>
<p>It seems obvious that some problems are important to solve and some aren't, as in, curing cancer is more important than delivering social gaming. Often, people <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/05/the-golden-age-of-silicon-valley-is-over-and-were-dancing-on-its-grave/257401/">lament</a> the abundance of tech firms working on ultimately unimportant stuff, and <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.co.il/2011/07/hacker-news-fires-steve-yegge.html">advise</a> to work on important problems and not just chase the money.</p>
<p>I guess I agree that some problems are ultimately more important than others. But I don't think it follows that working on the important ones is better.</p>
<p>Working on unimportant problems can create important side-effects. A whole lot of mission-critical, world-changing and even life-saving tech is a by-product of "unimportant" things – time-wasting infotainment products, or personal pet projects started without a grand noble cause.</p>
<p>For instance, GPU hardware was developed to run first-person shooters with increasingly fancier graphics. Today, it powers some of the largest high-performance computing clusters where "important" science is done.</p>
<p>Other types of processors powering HPC clusters weren't designed for HPC, either. Hardware originally designed for scientific computing is dead – Cray is the iconic example – and replaced by cheaper and more powerful microprocessors designed to run things like office software. Office software arguably solves no important problem: as Berglas convincingly <a href="http://www.berglas.org/Articles/ImportantThatSoftwareFails/ImportantThatSoftwareFails.html">argues</a>, office automation results not in increased productivity, but in increased complexity of rules and regulations.</p>
<p>All popular programming languages and operating systems, without a single exception I can think of, began either as personal projects or commercial projects not aiming to solve any problem "important" by itself. People hacked on the stuff for pleasure (C, Unix, Linux, Python, Ruby, PHP), or to conquer the world of businessy/officy/enterprisey software (Windows, VB, Java, C#, ASP). One language more specifically designed for the implementation of important software is Ada – but most important programs are written in something else.</p>
<p>It can even seem that not much important computer hardware or software came out of institutions directly dealing with important problems. Much of the Internet protocols is one big exception, and arguably so is HTML – but probably not JavaScript.</p>
<p>And, certainly, it's the "unimportant" social companies that made publishing and coordination via Internet universally accessible. Myself, I'm not very fond of either Facebook, Twitter, etc. or the kind of political activity that's coordinated through these sites nowadays, but it's "important", without doubt – another important side-effect of unimportant time-wasting projects.</p>
<p>One might wonder how anything of importance can possibly come out of, say, FarmVille. I really don't know – however, I couldn't guess how anything of importance could come out of DOOM, and it did.</p>
<p>And then there's a reason why so much of the best tech comes out of the least "important" markets. These markets are big, and they're free. Important problems tend to imply a smallish scale, or heavy regulation, or both. So you can't finance the work, and/or can't get any work done anyway.</p>
<p>Consider the aerospace software market – there aren't many planes, but a whole lot of regulation. Philip Greenspun, a software entrepreneur, a flight instructor and an expert witness&nbsp;in both&nbsp;<a href="http://philip.greenspun.com/software/expert-witness">software-related</a> and&nbsp;<a href="http://philip.greenspun.com/flying/aviation-expert-witness">aviation-related</a> lawsuits, had&nbsp;<a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/philg/2010/02/09/public-tv-figures-out-how-to-fly-regional-airliners/">this</a> to say about the Colgan 3407 disaster:</p>
<blockquote><p>Who crashed Colgan 3407? Actually the autopilot did. …&nbsp;The airplane had all of the information necessary to prevent this crash. The airspeed was available in digital form. The power setting was available in digital form. The status of the landing gear was available in digital form. …</p>
<p>How come the autopilot software on this $27 million airplane wasn’t smart enough to fly basically sensible attitudes and airspeeds? Partly because FAA certification requirements make it prohibitively expensive to develop software or electronics that go into certified aircraft. It can literally cost $1 million to make a minor change. Sometimes the government protecting us from small risks exposes us to much bigger ones.</p></blockquote>
<p>The same is happening in the automotive market, the healthcare market, etc. There's progress, of course, just nowhere near the progress in more frivolous areas – and much of the progress in "important" areas is a byproduct of progress in frivolous areas. As in, the best system for managing patients' records may well be Google Docs that doctors access from their iPads.</p>
<p>By the way, the importance of an issue correlates with the stupidity of rules, not just in technology, but in most things in life. The hoops you must jump through to get an "important" product out the door are not fundamentally different from airport security checks.</p>
<p>The airport security theater results in little added security. Likewise, the quality theater necessarily surrounding any life-saving technology results in little added quality. However, for much the same reasons, both are unavoidable.&nbsp;I've been working on automotive accident prevention systems for the last decade, and as time goes by, the regularly scheduled cavity searches are only getting worse.</p>
<p>So if you ask me – by all means, work on unimportant problems. They're often more fun to work on, and ultimately you never know how important they really are.</p>

            <p>I was always a fan of the steampunk style, and having also had experience building steam engines in the past, there was only one real direction this project could go. Once I had my radiation detector kit hooked up to my Raspberry Pi running InfluxDB and Grafana, I found myself woodworking, machining, and fabricobbling an enclosure out of mahogany, brass, copper, toggle switches and, because it just had to be done, nixie tubes.</p>

<p>Read the story of the almost year-long journey (<em>cough</em> some other stuff cropped up…) I went on to make my steampunk vision a reality below, and if you want to get up and running quickly, find out how to <a href="https://www.balena.io/blog/build-a-simple-radiation-monitor-using-a-raspberry-pi-influxdb-and-grafana/">build your own simple version right here</a>!</p>

<h2 id="introductionspanidintrospan">Introduction <span id="intro"></span></h2>

<p>Low cost radiation monitors and Geiger counter kits have been available online for around $30-50US/£25-45 for a while, but standing alone they don’t do much other than make the recognizable “clicking” sound we all know from movies and TV. I decided to up the ante by connecting one to a Raspberry Pi, storing the data with InfluxDB, and showing the readings with a Grafana dashboard.</p>



<p>I updated the tech, gave it a web interface, added remote management, and built a custom mahogany housing with brass and copper fittings to show everything off, because it’s important to look suitably <em>hip</em> when sitting on the desk next to your <a href="https://www.balena.io/blog/build-a-raspberry-pi-powered-train-station-oled-sign-for-your-desk/">train sign</a>… right?</p>

<p><img src="https://www.balena.io/blog/content/images/2020/07/header.jpg" onclick="openModal();currentSlide(58)">  
</p>

<p>Anyway, I’m gonna show what I built to hopefully provide some inspiration, then show you how to get up and running with a simpler version of the project that anyone can build at home without any special tools. Let’s hit this.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="inspirationdesignspanidinspirationspan">Inspiration &amp; design <span id="inspiration"></span></h2>

<p>I’ve always found the idea of radiation fascinating; how there are invisible particles moving around at incredibly high speeds, crashing into things and flipping bits all around us. Due to my fascination, it doesn’t take a lot to capture my interest when it comes to this field.</p>

<p>One day last year I was reminiscing over the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-44606771">now defunct</a> UK-based electronics retailer Maplin, and how they sold all sorts of interesting kits for the aspiring engineer. This led me to <a href="https://www.richardmudhar.com/blog/2019/09/maplin-geiger-counter/">Richard Mudhar’s blog</a> where he tells the story of the <em>Maplin Geiger Counter</em>.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.balena.io/blog/content/images/2020/07/mudhar-example.png" alt="An excerpt and image from Richard Mudhar's post"></p>

</figure>

<p>The kit that Richard has built above features both an electromechanical counter on the left, and two rings of LEDs reminiscent of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dekatron">dekatron tubes</a> on the right. This display has the neat design feature that as the rate of count increases, the display becomes more noticeable.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.balena.io/blog/content/images/2020/07/dekatron.gif" alt=""></p>

</figure>

<p>I liked the idea of combining the modern technology on the inside (Raspberry Pi, Grafana, etc.) with the timeless look of brass, copper, toggle switches, dark hardwood, and glass on the outside. The idea was now to build something that looked old and had that distinctive steampunk style, but was up to date and Internet-connected.</p>

<p>In addition to the total absolute count like the old Maplin counter, I wanted to offer a live display of the counts per minute (CPM) reading, and what better way to do this than with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixie_tube">Nixie tubes</a>, to get that nice warm orange glow and keep things looking cosy.</p>

<p>I started scribbling down ideas and thoughts of materials I wanted to use alongside shopping lists for parts, and possible designs for the case.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.balena.io/blog/content/images/2020/07/notes.jpg" alt="Original shop notes!"></p>

<figure>  
Notes don’t survive well in a machine shop, but these are what’s left of my original sketches.  
</figure>

<p>This process was very much led by an image I had in my mind about how the thing should look and feel and so I just had to make it real… somehow.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="thebuildspanidbuildspan">The build <span id="build"></span></h2>

<p>With some thoughts and ideas scribbled down it was time to get started. As this is for the most part going to be a bespoke, hand-built item, and made up as I go along, it’s not necessary to put everything in CAD. There are of course some core items that exist already and cannot change size; the Raspberry Pi and radiation detector board, for example. These are off-the-shelf parts that have to fit in the box no matter what, and start to dictate the size of the final unit.</p>

<p>Almost all other parts are completely hand made, machined and fabricated. This was necessitated by the desire to make everything authentic; I didn’t want to build things just for looks, I wanted any design choices made for aesthetic reasons to also be functional; by this I mean when I put 18 screws in something to make it look good, they are going to be 18 <em>real</em> screws that you have to take out to gain access!</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Each of the build log images link to a separate gallery when clicked. You can look through the images that way if you prefer, or read on in full detail.</p>

<h3 id="thefrontpanelspanidpanelspan">The front panel <span id="panel"></span></h3>

<p>I started with the front panel of the housing, I knew I wanted two toggle switches; one for power and one for sound (to disable the clicking noise), along with 3 nixie tubes to display the CPM up to 999. Normal background radiation is in the range of about 25-75 CPM, so I figured if background radiation is above 999 CPM, we have bigger problems than worrying about enough digits on the counter.</p>



<p>The two front panel pieces are made from 6mm thick mild steel plate, cut to size with an angle grinder and then milled to dimension with the help of Bridget, the Bridgeport. Holes are then cut for the nixies and the toggle switches.</p>



<p>I manufactured labels for each by hand-punching lettering into 0.5mm thick brass sheet, polishing and fixing with M2 screws. The steel pieces are coated with a clear lacquer to prevent corrosion.</p>

<h3 id="workingwithwoodspanidwoodspan">Working with wood <span id="wood"></span></h3>

<p>Wood isn’t my favourite material to work with, I mean it just changes shape of its own accord! Who can work with that?! Anyhow, it’s very pretty, and so it was decided that the outer box should be made of hardwood. I started with a scrap piece of mahogany, cut it to halve the thickness on the bandsaw, and then set about planing and shaping the sides of the box to fit the dimensions of the Raspberry Pi (3A+) and the radiation detector.</p>



<p>The dimensions of the front panel along with the steel faceplates were planned out in Fusion 360 so that I could print a cutting and drilling template. This was taped onto the planed piece of mahogany, the holes for screws were drilled, and the openings for components cut out.</p>



<p>The pieces were cut at 45 degree angles to enable a mitre joint in each corner. The joints were reinforced with biscuits (mmm biscuits), and then the 4 sides were glued and clamped and allowed to cure overnight.</p>



<p>The top and bottom of the case are made from the same scrap mahogany, but planed a lot thinner - approximately 6mm, the same as the steel plate.</p>

<h3 id="topbrassspanidbrassspan">Top brass <span id="brass"></span></h3>

<p>I had the idea that it would look good to hold the box together with a totally unnecessary amount of screws, 36 to be exact; 18 on top and 18 on the bottom. To prevent the screws damaging the wood surface and to add some extra detail to the top of the case I decided to make a brass plate that the screws all go through to clamp the top cover down.</p>



<p>Some pieces of 2mm brass strip were cut, mitred on the corners and soldered together. Once soldered, sanded and polished, the joints are barely visible.</p>



<p>Holes for screws were then drilled, and the brass plate used to secure the oversize lid to the box whilst it was sanded to size on a drum sander. I later learned that using a drum sander for this was a mistake as it marked the sides of the box, but you live and learn!</p>

<h3 id="imitationdekatronsspaniddekatronsspan">Imitation Dekatrons <span id="dekatrons"></span></h3>

<p>My attempt at imitating the Dekatron tube effect starts with a piece of 50mm stainless steel (or aluminium) bar. The bar is turned on a lathe down to 40mm, and to have a cavity for the electronics. The work is removed from the lathe and parted off on a bandsaw before being returned to the lathe to have a hole drilled in the rear for cabling to drive the LEDs.</p>



<p>The part is then put on the milling machine to have 10 holes drilled and M2 <del>taps snapped off in the holes</del> threaded ready to fasten the faceplate.</p>



<p>The brass faceplate is made from the same 0.5mm thick brass sheet as the labels from the faceplates. Each piece is drilled with 20 holes (10 for LEDs, 10 for fasteners), and then hand stamped with the numbering for each LED.</p>

<p>The LEDs are wired with a common ground and connected using a piece of recycled floppy disk drive ribbon cable. All the work is then carried out a second time for the ‘X10’ display. The eagle-eyed readers will notice that the second display is made from a different material than the first - this is due to the fact I snapped both a drill bit and a tap off in the M2 holes - working with stainless steel with these small tools is very difficult! I ended up making the second from aluminium, which machines like butter, in comparison.</p>



<p>Throughout the development of this project I found myself continually swapping fasteners and trying different combinations to see what looks best. The end result is a mix of M2 and M3 metric machine screws in both brass and stainless steel, cheese head and countersunk head, all slotted. You may notice that in earlier photos some of the parts were assembled with Allen-head cap screws but these were later swapped out. Ebay is usually a great place to get small quantities of fasteners of all different shapes and sizes.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It is no secret that building and running a business is not easy no matter how small or big it may be. There are a huge number of obstacles that one has to overcome, but while building<a href="http://superlemon.xyz/"> </a>this <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/whatsapp-chat-button" target="_blank">Shopify WhatsApp app</a> with my co-founder Preetam, I realised that all the obstacles become significantly easier to overcome when you are not in it alone.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><p>To be clear, I have tremendous respect for solo founders. These guys undertake a very lonely journey where nobody else can relate to their problems or achievements for that matter. When you have a bad day, you can't really explain it to someone because the feeling is unique to your situation and when you reach a milestone, you can probably celebrate it with your friends and loved ones but they would never truly understand how big a deal it is for you to have achieved that milestone.&nbsp; So I just want to give a shout out to all the solo founders out there and encourage them to keep crushing it in life.</p><p>‍</p><div><p>Having said this, I would now like to highlight some advantages of starting a business with at least one other person.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>‍</strong></p></div><p><strong>Accountability</strong>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>It is safe to assume that a person who quits their job and lives off of their savings in order to take on the challenge of building a business is dedicated and driven but this does not make them immune from laziness. In fact if your business starts showing some amount of success, it is even more likely that you might slack off because you no longer have to worry about paying the bills or making rent because you have revenue coming in to take care of that. So that fire that kept you on your toes is gone.&nbsp;<br>‍</p><p>Even if you don’t slack off for a single day of your life, you are still human and are capable of making mistakes. Mistakes that don’t have any redemption because only you get affected by the mistake.</p><p>‍</p><p>Having a partner who is just as vested into the venture as you are changes this. You are now accountable to each other and have somebody to answer to when you slack off or make a mistake. This might sound very counterintuitive because the reason why people start businesses is to not have anyone to answer to. But I have found during my journey that this is not always a bad thing and it is actually essential sometimes.<strong>‍</strong></p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Productivity</strong>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>When you start a business there are many skills that you may have to learn based on what domain your business is in. For instance when we started<a href="http://superlemon.xyz/"> </a>our <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/whatsapp-chat-button" target="_blank">Shopify application</a>, we needed to know Product design, Front-end tech, back-end tech, marketing and distribution, landing page design and customer support. Now obviously if you are a solo founder you could argue that you could hire people for doing all of this but the truth of the matter is that even if you hire people to delegate a job, you still need to have some amount of understanding about that job so that you can hire the right people for the job and gauge whether your employee is performing well or not. In other words you have to learn many skills from scratch.</p><p>‍</p><p>If one person were to learn all of these skills, it would take a lot more time and mental bandwidth than dividing those skills amongst two people who will then nail all the aspects of the business that they are responsible for. It is therefore very important to choose a business partner who has an affinity to the skills that complement your own. This is easier said than done but I would say it is worth spending time just to find a partner that compliments your skills instead of being of the mindset that it would be a waste of time to do so.<strong>‍</strong></p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Moral support</strong>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>Oftentimes founders might find themselves in a situation where they face a problem that only they can solve and they aren’t sure how to do it yet. During such times it is very easy to go down a spiral of thoughts which might convince you that nobody is coming to help you and you are on your own so you are pretty much screwed. During such times it greatly helps if somebody that stands to lose the same thing that you do if you don’t solve the problem tells you that it is going to be okay.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><p>This is what my dynamic is like with my co-founder. If he screws up or feels down due to some factor that we had no control over, I tell him that we will live through this and if I screw up, he tells me it is going to be okay. This simple aspect can actually help a lot with maintaining the morale and moving forward despite facing something that might seem like the end of the world at that point of time.<strong>‍</strong></p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Happiness multiplies when you achieve a milestone</strong>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>When you build a business the only way for the outside world to gauge whether you achieved a milestone or not is based on how much money you are making, but for the people involved in building the business, there are a ton of non monetary achievements that give you happiness.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><p>For instance when we started out, our product was free for a while but we were gaining a lot of users every day and collecting feedback on what features they would be willing to pay for. This process was a magical time for us and we were the only ones who were capable of deriving happiness out of it. This happiness cannot really be shared with someone not involved in the business because they would not be able to relate to the feeling of talking to a customer from another country using google translate and understanding what their needs were and how we can solve them.<strong>‍</strong></p><p>‍</p><p><strong>Closing notes</strong>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>Someone once said to me that life is all about the people you meet and the things you build together. I genuinely believe this to be true and I would urge aspiring Entrepreneurs to make a full hearted attempt to find a business partner that aligns with your vision. I would also strongly suggest not to be hasty while finding a partner because working with a bad business partner is way worse than working alone and this is something that I experienced with my previous failed venture.</p></div></div>]]>

    <p>This piece is an introduction a new series—called <em>Unitaskers</em>—that will feature single-purpose artifacts that let you do one thing.</p>
<p>Think, for instance, of a graphite pencil. It's useful to write or draw. You can sharpen it to get thin lines or tilt it to get thicker, faded strokes. You can write a letter or draw a house. You can trace continuous lines or do pointillism. But there isn't much more you can do with it.</p>
<p>In the opposite spectrum are your computer or your smartphone—they can virtually do anything, from drawing and writing to setting an alarm, sending emails, but they make doing something with focus harder than ever before.</p>
<p>How does your thought process change when you write with pencil and paper instead of typing on your laptop? When you read a book on Kindle instead of reading on your tablet? When you capture audio notes with a hand-recorder instead of using your phone?</p>
<p>Let’s find out.</p>
<p>Each essay of the series will use an object (or family of objects) as a source of inspirations to share stories and facts around finding focus in our age of distraction.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>A quantum bit or a qubit is a unit of information describing a two-dimensional quantum system. It is also a key basic unit to the quantum computer. Usually it could be visualized using a Bloch sphere.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to derive the connections between qubit and Bloch sphere.</p>

<h3 id="classical-bit">Classical Bit</h3>

<p>A classical bit is a unit of information describing a two-dimensional classical system. A classical bit could only be in one state, either $| 0 \rangle$ or $| 1 \rangle$. $| 0 \rangle$ and $| 1 \rangle$ are orthogonal basis. Usually $| 0 \rangle = [1, 0]^{\top}$ and $| 1 \rangle = [0, 1]^{\top}$.</p>

<h3 id="quantum-bit-qubit">Quantum Bit (Qubit)</h3>

<p>A quantum bit or a qubit is a unit of information describing a two-dimensional quantum system. A qubit is a superposition of two basic states, $| 0 \rangle$ and $| 1 \rangle$.</p>



<p>A generic (normalized) qubit is of the form</p>



<p>where $c_0$ and $c_1$ are complex numbers, and $|c_0|^2 + |c_1|^2 = 1$. After taking the measurement for $| \psi \rangle$, the system would be collapsed to $| 0 \rangle$ with probability $|c_0|^2$ or $| 1 \rangle$ with probability $|c_1|^2$.</p>



<p>A complex number could be described using <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Complex-Number-Representations/">exponential form</a>.</p>



<p>Where $\rho_0$ and $\rho_1$ are real numbers. Therefore,</p>



<p>We could rewrite $\rho_0$ and $\rho_1$ using a new parameter $\frac{\theta}{2}$. We would see why we used $\frac{\theta}{2}$ instead of $\theta$ shortly.</p>



<p>We multiple a complex number $e^{-i\theta_0}$ to $| \psi \rangle$.</p>



<p>We define $\varphi = \theta_1 - \theta_0$, we have</p>



<p>As we have discussed early in <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Quantum-System-States/">quantum system states</a>, quantum system state $| \psi \rangle$ and $c | \psi \rangle$, where $c$ is any non-zero complex number, represent the same quantum system state. Since $e^{-i\theta_0}$ is a non-zero complex number, $| \psi \rangle$ and $e^{-i\theta_0} | \psi \rangle$ represent the same quantum system state. So we have</p>



<p>This means that, with two parameters $\theta$ and $\varphi$, we could determine a qubit state.</p>



<p>The next question is what is the minimum range of $\theta$ and $\varphi$ so that all the possible qubit states, $| \psi \rangle \in \mathbb{C}^2$s, are included? After taking the measurement of the qubit, the probability of observing $| 0 \rangle$ is $\cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2}$ and the probability of observing $| 1 \rangle$ is $\sin^2 \frac{\theta}{2}$. For different $\theta$s, if $\cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2}$s are the same, the qubit states, $| \psi \rangle$s, are also the same. Apparently, $0 \leq \frac{\theta}{2} \leq \frac{\pi}{2}$, i.e., $0 \leq \theta \leq \pi$. If $\theta$ is out of this range, there is always a way to convert the $\theta$ into the range of $[0, \pi]$ while keeping $\cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2}$ the same. For $\varphi$, there is not too much to say, $0 \leq \varphi &lt; 2\pi$.</p>



<p>To summarize, a qubit could be described using two independent variables.</p>



<p>Where $\theta \in [0, \pi]$ and $\varphi \in [0, 2\pi)$.</p>

<h3 id="bloch-sphere">Bloch Sphere</h3>

<p>In quantum mechanics and computing, the Bloch sphere is a geometrical representation of the pure state space of a two-level quantum mechanical system (qubit), named after the physicist Felix Bloch.</p>



<p>Given the two-variable qubit formulation we derived above, it could perfectly fit into the Bloch sphere.</p>

<div>
<figure>
    <img src="https://leimao.github.io/images/blog/2020-06-14-Qubit-Bloch-Sphere/Bloch_sphere.svg.png">
    <figcaption>Bloch Sphere</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>The north and south poles of the Bloch sphere are typically chosen to correspond to the standard basis vectors $ |0\rangle $ and $ |1\rangle $, respectively. Any coordinate, which could be uniquely described using $\theta$ and $\varphi$, on the sphere, represents a unique qubit.</p>



<p>It is also non-trivial to see that all the qubits on the equator, where $\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}$, have equal probability of collapsing to $ |0\rangle $ and $ |1\rangle $, because $p(|0\rangle) = \cos^2 \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{1}{2}$ and $p(|1\rangle) = \sin^2 \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{1}{2}$.</p>



<p>In addition, if the qubit is more closer to the north pole, there is larger chance to collapse to $ |0\rangle $ after taking the measurement. Similarly, if the qubit is more closer to the south pole, there is larger chance to collapse to $ |1\rangle $ after taking the measurement.</p>



<p>Moreover, an arbitrary pair of orthogonal qubits is mapped to antipodal (opposite) points of the Bloch sphere. This is because, any antipodal qubits have the following representations.</p>



<p>We would like to show that $\langle \psi , \psi^{\prime} \rangle = 0$ so that $| \psi \rangle $ and $| \psi^{\prime} \rangle$ are orthogonal.</p>



<p>This concludes the proof.</p>



<p>Last but not least, to answer why we had used $\frac{\theta}{2}$ instead of $\theta$ in the qubit representation, it is because we want to make the qubit representation compatible with the Bloch sphere. If using $\frac{\theta}{2}$, $\theta \in [0, \pi]$ in the Bloch sphere matches $\theta \in [0, \pi]$ in the qubit representation.</p>

<h3 id="manipulate-qubit-on-bloch-sphere">Manipulate Qubit on Bloch Sphere</h3>

<p>As we have partially shown in <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Kronecker-Product-In-Circuits/">one of my previous posts</a>, all the classical logical gates could be considered as matrices, and all the classical bit manipulations are matrix multiplications. This also applies to quantum logical gates and qubits. Actually, all the quantum logical gates are unitary matrices. We would take this fact for now and I would probably explain this in my future blog posts.</p>



<p>Matrix $U$ is unitary if and only if</p>



<p>Unitary matrix preserves inner products. If $U$ is unitary, then for any $v, v^{\prime} \in \mathbb{C}^{n}$, we have $\langle Uv, Uv^{\prime} \rangle = \langle v, v^{\prime} \rangle$.</p>



<p>This could be easily proved by using the <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Inner-Product/">inner product properties</a>.</p>



<p>This means that unitary matrix $U$ also preserves the norm of any vector $v \in \mathbb{C}^{n}$.</p>



<p>Suppose we have a qubit $| \psi \rangle$ and unitary matrix $U$. Because $| \psi | = 1$, so $| U\psi | = 1$. In addition, given the orthogonal basis $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$, because $\langle |0\rangle, |1\rangle \rangle = 1$, so $ \langle U|0\rangle, U |1\rangle \rangle = 1$. This means that $U|0\rangle$ and $U|1\rangle$ are a new pair of orthogonal basis.</p>



<p>On the Bloch sphere, applying a unitary matrix $U$ to qubit $| \psi \rangle$ is equivalent to moving the coordinate of the qubit on the Block sphere, since unitary matrix preserves the norm of vector. Apply a unitary matrix $U$ to both $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$ is equivalent to rotate the north and south poles, i.e. the coordinate system, accordingly.</p>



<p>If we look into $| U \psi \rangle$ more closely.</p>



<p>Since $U|0\rangle$ and $U|1\rangle$ are also orthogonal basis, manipulating qubit is also equivalent to manipulating the entire coordinate system. The coordinates of $| U \psi \rangle$ in the new coordinate system ($U|0\rangle$, $U|1\rangle$) is the same to the coordinates of $| \psi \rangle$ in the old coordinate system ($|0\rangle$, $|1\rangle$).</p>

A Look at Bullies in Tech

<div><p><img src="https://wilkie.how/images/the-zed-shaw-phenomenon/zedshaw.png" title="" alt="If you email me, please give me your best shot at describing what a crazy ass tweaker is."></p><p>If you email me, please give me your best shot at describing what a crazy ass tweaker is.</p></div>

<p>Goodness. The tech world must be really unfriendly, or alternatively I must be the absolute scum of the planet. Let's figure out what I did.</p>
<h2 id="indirection_is_not_abstraction">Indirection Is Not Abstraction</h2>
<p>Back in December of 2012, <a href="http://twitter.com/zedshaw" title="">Zed Shaw</a> wrote an essay entitled <a href="http://zedshaw.com/essays/indirection_is_not_abstraction.html" title="">Indirection Is Not Abstraction</a> (if link is <a href="https://wilkie.how/shaw_indirection.txt" title="">broken</a>). In this, Shaw notes that there are a few misconceptions about the definitions of several terms used to describe methods of modular design and code isolation: interfaces, abstractions, and indirection. Basically, he suggests that our fellow coders and engineers mix them up and conflate them with other concepts.</p>

<p>The article is clearly a bit of a work in progress, as noted by Shaw himself in the concluding paragraph. It is not particularly well-written or well-structured. Shaw uses a writing style that conjures this image of the ever irritating shock-jock. If there is something he doesn't like, he emphasizes with expletives. If there is <em>someone</em> he doesn't like, he will go out of his way to find the room to take a shot at them. For instance, later on, Zed Shaw manages to inexplicably slip in a link to a search for <em>"Dave Winer Asshole."</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>It’s even worse
when the implementer realizes that if he implements the most complicated piece
of shit possible then he can go rogue consultant and make tons of mad cash
helping poor unsuspecting companies implement his steaming pile of bullshit.
Harsh words? You bet. But I’m fed up with people imposing their faulty
definitions and ideas on me without any way for me to easily fight back with a
reasonable explanation as to why their crap is steaming.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This writing style is difficult to parse and makes the reader wonder how concise the article could be if such filler was removed. For instance, the paragraph above provides the motivation for the piece. You might believe, only knowing the intent of the article, that the motivation would be to provide a better structure for discussing modular design. However, Zed Shaw's stream of consciousness relays a motivation to provide a better means for him to tell you (male implementors, not women apparently) that your code is similar to excrement wasting away in the sunlight.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An unbelievable 6 levels of indirection just to add a fucking object to a fucking collection. This is the kind of bullshit that chaps my ass purple and makes me want to eat babies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...and to prevent him from desiring the consumption of small children in this unbelievably lazy reference found later on. Sigh. People. Look. This isn't hard. Killing a baby is not a valid literary device. It does not invoke peaceful idyllic imagery that helps you make your point through nostalgia. Stop it.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Zed Shaw hits some good points and gives some decent ideas about how to better describe what an abstraction is. Of course, this is done in a paragraph that was probably supposed to be a bulleted list because it has a bunch of random asterisks between each sentence, but, as I said, the content in that mess is actually very good. (Hint: he doesn't swear or talk about the color of his butt.)</p>

<p>Now let us focus on how I am involved. I research distributed systems and operating design. The whole indirection, interfaces, and abstractions thing? I'll let you in on a secret... That's what an operating system is. Therefore, I saw the gaps in an unfinished article and figured I had something useful to say. I gave the following post of my own in response to his article on <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/ja5ihv/indirection_is_not_abstraction/comments/nl5sy4" title="">lobste.rs</a>:</p>

<p><em>"I had no idea the terms were so misused! It’s pretty simple, though. You have interfaces… if the implementations change behind them, that doesn’t mean your interface is flexible. It just means you have essentially a commit history that the interface allows you to ignore. Therefore, interfaces are not abstractions. Java misuses the term ‘abstract,’ because their usage only has meaning at the language parse time where it implies the lack of implementation logic. However, at runtime, an abstract class does not provide an abstraction, but an interface. However, we conflate the term with the notion of usage abstraction.</em></p>

<p><em>"Zed does a terrible job at illustrating a true abstraction. Abstractions take away things. They simplify. They consolidate, perhaps, but they consolidate power through generalization. A programming language is an abstraction of a machine language. A machine language is an interface to the CPU’s control and arithmetic units. A machine language doesn’t abstract because it doesn’t limit.</em></p>

<p><em>"I’ll add that abstractions are generally not machine-driven. They are people-driven. We abstract because some interfaces are too complicated. We abstract with natural language. We want things to be easier for the sake of programmers. A programming language is an abstraction because ‘var i = j + 1’ is so much better than the machine equivalent, however we sacrifice something to do this. That’s generally a good test for determining which something is. API’s are interfaces (yes, duh), Frameworks/languages are abstractions (read as: should be)</em></p>

<p><em>"Zed doesn’t really talk about where the discrepancy comes from (because people are dumb isn’t really good enough.) What really gets people is that interfaces usually have implementations which make use of abstractions. So, this is also a question of scoping. An implementation can make use of an abstraction, however, an interface cannot force the usage of an abstraction (since an interface is just a name and a behavior.) A test for that is whether or not the implementation can eschew the abstraction by reinventing the universe to provide equivalent behavior. But looking at the wrong scope when you design can certainly lead to this problem of term discrepancy."</em></p>
<h2 id="zed_shaw_responds">Zed Shaw Responds</h2>
<p>Apparently the post was well-received enough to catch Zed Shaw's attention, which I suppose was my first mistake.</p>

<p><img src="https://wilkie.how/images/the-zed-shaw-phenomenon/zedshaw_3.png" title="" alt="!zedshaw"></p>

<p>Zed Shaw's response was not a very friendly one. He stripped my handle out of the reply to Steve and gives that common criticism of criticism: <em>"you didn't even read it."</em> Steve did that thing that your friends do when you are out with them and they run into some Cool People, and he started to distance himself from me like it was coincidence that I was in the same room. That was disappointing, but I agree with Steve's careful implication that it is a bit confusing that I could both repeat what Shaw said and yet in the same small post also suggest that he was wrong.</p>

<p>It felt very odd to see this conversation unfold with me as the topic without either giving me an opportunity to contribute. <strong>I felt a bit restrained as I didn't seem to have the authority to defend myself</strong>. Yet, overall I didn't particularly care. <em>"Oh well,"</em> I thought, <em>"I got my Zed-Shaw-Hates-You-Achievement. 10 Points."</em> The thing is, the comment I posted is very on point, which is all that matters when you write. You always anger somebody with your research. There is this expression people like to console you with resembling <em>"if you make people angry, you're doing something right."</em> But, in reality, some people are just really touchy when you are working on a similar project. I'm not sure if it is fear, or related to what territorial dogs do in the park, but it happens.</p>

<p>The important part is that my post is not wrong and I stand by it. The idea that interfaces should be considered first-class over abstractions because abstractions are always summarizations of a set of interfaces is an important idea. One that I believe Zed Shaw didn't really care about, so I made instead. But what if it wasn't me and it was somebody else? There must be others that are completely suppressed by this behavior.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Feel free to contact me with comments on this essay. It is still being worked on and is open for review. I’m pretty sure it makes no sense right now, but the major points should be there. I’m especially interested if you have any examples which you find relevant to the discussion, either for or against what I’m saying.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the end, I have to say; I was scratching my head a bit by his reaction. If he suggests himself that the post makes no sense and that he invites comments including criticism, why was my post so ill-received?</p>
<h2 id="the_bully_mindset">The Bully Mindset</h2>
<p>Zed Shaw insists that I said he is wrong. I did no such thing. I agreed with many of his points. However, if I squint my eyes, I think I can see where that sentiment is coming from: <em>"Zed does a terrible job at illustrating a true abstraction."</em></p>

<p>Why would I use the word <em>terrible</em> ? Because it is true. But I'm not calling him wrong, rather I'm suggesting that the writing quality is poor, because it is. It was an incredible eyesore for one. Also, he illustrates many examples of awful, tedious object hierarchies and gives some decent definitions of the terms, yet, he does not give any examples of what in the real-world actually abides by those definitions. Therefore, I did. I felt that this was the weakest part of the work, and I described it as such.</p>

<p>So wait. Could it be, then, that Zed Shaw is offended by the word <em>terrible</em> ? Could it be that the same person who desires a means to call your code a pile of feces shrieks at such a negative adjective?</p>

<p>Let's catch up to the present. How did this come back up almost 8 months later? Recently Zed Shaw published an <a href="http://xoratelier.com/" title="">idea</a> where people would pay him to work on his projects. Kurtis Rainbolt Greene offered reasonable criticism of the structure of the program. In reply, Zed Shaw spouts a stream of expletives about how absurd Kurtis apparently is to him.</p>

<p>In frustration, Kurtis issues a status about how Zed Shaw attacked rather than reasoned, and I felt the need to express solidarity. This is very much my experience from before where criticism was met with immediate aggression. I tagged Zed's handle (something he didn't afford me.) When Zed replied to me, shocked that I would be so brazen, I pointed out the tweet where he had attacked my post while …</p></div></div></div>

I cut all other activities - stopped producing my podcasts, promoting my book and doing other freelance work - and threw myself fully into <strong>a new mission: to build a billion crown (CZK) company</strong>.&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>Not only did I burn all of my bridges and put all my eggs into one basket, I also went into personal debt well over a million to finance the young and fragile company, at the time it all seemed worth it.</p></div><p>There was excitement, there was novelty, there was challenge. During the first years, the number of clients, colleagues, and revenue kept rising, the world started noticing us, we signed big brands, won awards and even raised a bunch of money.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594048680923_30945"><div><p>It was all sunshine and unicorns.<br></p><p>Until it wasn't.<br></p><p>Feeling that there was no time to waste, I pushed for rapid international expansion immediately after our September 2018 fundraise.&nbsp;<br></p><p>In the blink of an eye, the team doubled in size: we hired senior (expensive) managers and a local sales team in London (even more expensive) in order to take the UK market by storm.<br></p><p>In support of the sales effort, I was frequently flying to London. I would even do round trips - fly to London in the morning, attend two client pitches and be back in Prague by night. Using low budget airlines that had frequent delays, I found myself leaving the house before 6 AM and coming back at 1 the next morning. I would work the whole time on the train, at the airport and sometimes even on the cab ride back home. Consequently, my mind was rushing with thoughts and I couldn't fall asleep despite the exhaustion.</p><p>Sometimes, I'd miss my return flight. I'd be forced to stay the night in an airport hotel and show up to work the next day in Prague wearing day old clothes.</p><p>At the same time, we were trying to enter Polish and Romanian markets. Once in a four day span I managed to cover Prague --&gt; London --&gt; Warsaw --&gt; Manchester --&gt; Bucharest --&gt; Prague. Frequent flyer miles aside, I began to question whether it was still fun arriving at my hotel in Bucharest at 2AM only to find a colleague waiting for me to rehearse the next day's presentation.<br></p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1594048680923_15646"><div><div><p><em>Life of a start-up CEO  -  pitching, traveling and more pitching… managing the company in between whenever you steal the moment<br></em></p></div><h2><strong>Cracks begin to show</strong></h2><p>I love sleeping and hate early starts, so I was beginning to run on reserves.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Six months into our UK adventure we still had not closed any clients.</p><div><p>We were burning cash like crazy. Some months we were spending 3-4 times the revenue we were bringing in and serious worries started to emerge that we would not hit the targets we needed to hit to acquire another tranche of investment. The fear of running out of cash and going bust grew larger as weeks flew by.</p></div><div><p>What was worse there were underlying tensions between co-founders with totally opposite views of what the product should do and to whom should we sell to. Some pushed for enterprise, others for mid-sized e-commerce clientele with a wildly different customer and feature sets in mind. As we couldn't convince each other rival camps started to emerge within the company.</p></div><p>In spring 2019, when we received definite word that our seed-round investors would not chip in any more funds we needed to scramble to close another round of funding elsewhere. We managed to find two funds who loved our tech and team and could theoretically extend our runway by another year. "Just enough time to break into the UK market and turn things around" I thought.</p><p>It was April when even these new investors pulled out of the deal. I was left with only two choices: either cut costs by two-thirds or go out of business.&nbsp;</p><p>Just eight months after an incredible rush of positivity, great publicity and lots of enthusiasm and new energy to build business, I found myself:<br></p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Exhausted from all the travelling, stress and hours needed to put in when you are trying to quickly scale up a company.</p></li><li><p>Deep in personal debt on a start-up salary that didn't even cover lease payments and my basic living expenses.</p></li><li><p>Weeks away from corporate bankruptcy.</p></li><li><p>Facing an internal mutiny with the opposing faction attempting to replace me as CEO.</p></li></ol><p>Basically, I was on the brink of losing everything - my business, my reputation, and all my money.</p><div><p>The same thing - our company - that I had already sacrificed so much for was now pushing me against the wall, making it all the more difficult to see a clear way out of the situation.</p></div><h2><strong>The night I cried</strong><br></h2><p>In May 2019, I finally had to face the inevitable. I needed to dump all expansion plans, cut the marketing budget to zero, and most regrettably reduce the team by half.&nbsp;</p><p>One morning, we flew the whole team to Prague for an all hands meeting.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

    

    <p><a href="https://github.com/thesephist/blocks.css">blocks.css</a> adds a layer of dimension to your web elements.
        It's light enough that it takes no time to set up or load, but interesting enough that it can serve as the only
        major CSS on the page.</p>

    <h2>Basics</h2>

    <p>blocks.css is a single stylesheet. Get started by adding the stylesheet to your page's head.</p>

    <pre>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/blocks.css/dist/blocks.min.css" /&gt;</pre>

    <p>This is a blocky button. It's interactive â€“â€“ try hovering and clicking on it.</p>
    

    <p>You can make any element blocky by giving it the class <code>block</code>.</p>

    <pre>&lt;button class="block"&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/button&gt;</pre>

    <h3>Accents</h3>

    <p>This is an <em>accent</em> button. You can make a block accented with the class <code>accent</code>.</p>
    

    <h3>Pills</h3>

    <p>This is a <em>round</em> button, also sometimes called a "pill". You can make a box round with the class <code>round</code>.</p>
    

    <h3>Fixed blocks</h3>

    <p>This is a <em>fixed</em> button, which means it won't respond to any of your inputs or interactions. You can make
        a block fixed with the class <code>fixed</code>.</p>
    

    <h3>Wrapper blocks</h3>

    <p>Sometimes, you want to blockify an element like <code>img</code> or <code>input</code>. But these elements can't
        have children like <code>::before</code> and <code>::after</code> elements, so blocks.css can't work its magic.
        Instead you'll have to wrap them in a <em>wrapper block</em>, using the <code>wrapper</code> class, like this.
        (The wrapper class removes padding in the block.)</p>
    <p><img src="https://linus.zone/pic" alt="Linus's picture">
    </p>

    <h3>Inline blocks</h3>

    <p>Lastly, sometimes you may want to place a block <em>inline</em>, or in the middle of a line of text. You can do
        so with an <em>inline</em> block, by adding the class <code>inline</code>. Then your blocks can be in the middle
        of text, <span>like this</span>.</p>

    <h2>Core components</h2>

    <p>We've only looked at buttons so far, but anything can be blocky. Here are a few examples.</p>

    <p>These are all just created by either adding the <code>block</code> class on a normal HTML element, or by wrapping
        normal HTML elements in <code>&lt;div class="wrapper block"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code>.</p>

    

    <div>
        <pre>This is a blocky code block (inside a wrapper)</pre>
    </div>

    <p>
        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JLf9q36UsBk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
    </p>

    <div>
        <h2>This is a blocky card</h2>
        <p>... that contains many other elements</p>
        </div>

    <h2>Theming</h2>

    <p>You can theme button styles by customizing the colors, using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*">CSS custom properties</a>.</p>

    <p>There are four variables that blocks.css uses:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><code>--block-text-color</code> determines the color of text, and the border around the block and its
                shadow</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><code>--block-background-color</code> is the color of the button background</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><code>--block-accent-color</code> is the background color of accented buttons</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><code>--block-shadow-color</code> is the fill color of the shadow</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Here's a more colorful palette, by changing the <code>--block-accent-color</code> within just this div.</p>

    <div>
        

        <div>
            <h2>This is a blocky card</h2>
            <p>... that contains many other elements</p>
            </div>

    </div>

    <p>This is a dark theme, made possible by setting the text, background, and shadow colors to be their inverses.</p>

    <div>
        

        <div>
            <h2>This is a blocky card</h2>
            <p>... that contains many other elements</p>
            </div>

<![CDATA[War Story – hunting down a memory leak in a C++ application]]>

July 6, 2020 | https://smalldata.tech/blog/2020/07/01/war-story-hunting-down-a-memory-leak-in-a-c++-application | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://smalldata.tech/blog/2020/07/01/war-story-hunting-down-a-memory-leak-in-a-c++-application">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
  Years ago, a colleague of mine read an article on Google's bitpacking algorithm for storing indexes and an idea was
  born to create a standalone text index and search solution (similar to Apache Lucene). This idea was brought to life
  in a C++ application called <a href="https://github.com/wheresvic/zsearch">Zsearch</a>. In hindsight it was a little
  bit ahead of its time as a few years later we saw the emergence of a more powerful Elasticsearch that did all that
  Zsearch could do + a lot more. Anyways, this is a story of how we hunted down a memory leak in our application.
</p>

<div>
  <p><a href="https://smalldata.tech/img/blog/020-c++-memory-leak.png">
    <img alt="" src="https://smalldata.tech/img/blog/020-c++-memory-leak.png">
  </a></p><p>
    Can you find the leak?
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  The idea behind Zsearch was to see how big of an index we could fit into ram with the data being stored in a key/value
  database, which in our implementation was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LevelDB">leveldb</a>. Since RAM was a
  precious commodity back in the day, we really wanted to find the right balance between keeping all of our data
  structures in RAM vs. leveldb. During our initial load testing on a linux box, we found a linear memory growth and
  therefore suspected a memory leak. We then tried to find a memory leak using the following:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>running a load test in a function and calling the function multiple times to test memory usage</li>
  <li>logging in destructors to check whether objects were being deallocated</li>
  <li>debugging the application using valgrind</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Unfortunately for us, there were no memory leaks detected and eventually when testing on a mac, we found that memory
  stabilized at the expected peak. We therefore concluded that it was just the linux memory allocator that was acting
  weird. In reality, the memory allocator was doing what it was supposed to do but it did give us a good lead regarding
  how some of the C++ standard library was implemented. It turns out that one of our threads was making copies of an stl
  Map, which is ridiculously inefficient and something that we ended up reworking to keep our memory consumption on
  point :).
</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Did you ever dream about creating your own chip?
I mean, a physical chip.
One which you can hold in your hand, and which does exactly what you’ve designed it to do?</p>

<p>Until today, there were two major road blocks: you had to get access to a process design kit (PDK) from a chip manufacturing house (a foundry), and you had to have enough money to actually pay for the manufacturing.
These times are over.
Today.</p>

<p>Today, in a FOSSi Dial-Up talk, Tim Ansell of Google announced <a href="https://github.com/google/skywater-pdk">SkyWater PDK</a>, the first manufacturable, open source <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_design_kit">process design kit</a>.
What differentiates this PDK from previous attempts is the fact that it is manufacturable: with this PDK, you can actually produce chips with the <a href="https://www.skywatertechnology.com/">SkyWater foundry</a> in the 130nm node.</p>

<p>That leaves you as chip designer only with one road block: money.
Manufacturing chips is expensive – even for more than a decade old nodes like the 130nm node, you need to spend at least a couple thousand dollars.</p>

<p>You know what?
Don’t worry – Google and efabless have got you covered!
They are providing <strong>completely free of cost</strong> chip manufacturing runs: one in November this year, and multiple more in 2021.
All open source chip designs qualify, no further strings attached!</p>

<p>Learn more about all of that by re-watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EczW2IWdnOM">Tim’s Dial-Up talk</a> or click through the <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRtwZPc8ykkkgtUkHkoJZrP9jKOo3FYdKqbg-So0ic6_kx7ha1vHnxrWmuxWkTc9GfC8xl0TfEpMLwK/pub?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=3000">slides</a>.</p>

<p>This is certainly a dream come true for us at the FOSSi Foundation.
We helped the Free and Open Source Silicon community, our community, grow and tackle huge challenges over the years.
An open, manufacturable PDK was the main blocker in a fully open flow between RTL and a physical chip, and we’re extremely excited to see that blocker removed.</p>

<p>As always, removing one roadblock only highlights more challenges:
RAM, ROM and flash compilers, analog blocks, optimizations to various tools, and much, much more.
Now is the perfect time to get involved in the Free and Open Source Silicon ecosystem – or learn more about the accomplishments and challenges ahead of us.
A good starting point are the next Dial-Up talks.</p>

<p>Head over to the <a href="https://fossi-foundation.org/dial-up/">Dial-Up web site</a> for a listing of the upcoming talks on OpenROAD, cell design, OpenRAM, and Magic, an old, but surprisingly up-to-date tool!

                          <p><i><span>I have a great idea for a startup. The only thing I’m still hesitating about is hiring a CTO. It’s particularly important for me because I don’t know the tech side. Outsourcing the technical part to an </span></i><a href="https://www.purrweb.com/"><i><span>MVP development agency</span></i></a><i><span> is one of the ways to check your idea, let’s look at the other.</span></i></p>
<p><span>Well, this article will answer the question.</span></p>
<h2>CTO as a part of MVP development team</h2>
<p>CTO (also known as Head of Engineering) is a person who is involved in making the most important technical decisions.&nbsp; They play a significant role in your project triumph since they decide on the tech stack used for the future product (suitable frameworks and technologies), plan the app infrastructure, and control the whole process of MVP development.</p>
<p>In general, a good CTO is a skilled developer with knowledge in programming that is just enough to create and launch MVP. If you find out how to hire a CTO for a startup, you won’t have to seek any other developers (at least at the very beginning).</p>
<h2>What exactly does CTO do at the MVP stage?</h2>
<p>We say, ‘a CTO is one of the most important parts of the MVP team’.&nbsp; Don’t you believe it? Let us justify this statement (and disclose to you how to hire a CTO for a startup).</p>
<p>To do this, we will touch on the steps of MVP development.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Cover-26-01.png"><img src="https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Cover-26-01.png" alt="How to hire a CTO for a startup?" width="3084" height="1417" srcset="https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Cover-26-01.png 3084w, https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Cover-26-01-300x138.png 300w, https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Cover-26-01-768x353.png 768w, https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Cover-26-01-1024x470.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 3084px) 100vw, 3084px"></a></p>
<p>We’ll start by assembling a minimum MVP team. Based on the objectives given in the preceding paragraph, we need programmer and designer.</p>
<ul>
<li>Time to create a design concept</li>
</ul>
<p>Yet active sketching and wireframing is not really up to CTOs and it is the found designer who is responsible for generating a design concept, they still have control over the process. The CTO not only introduces the concept requirements to the designer and helps them understand the product vision but also makes sure the concept is technically feasible.</p>
<p>Yes, sometimes designers develop a beautiful concept that is not easy to accomplish because some aspects require sophisticated technologies. And you surely won’t be happy with the situation when you have to google something like ‘we’ve got a not technically feasible design concept. what to do with that?’, so let the CTO check it first.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go on with a prototype</li>
</ul>
<p>Even though prototype designs often don’t look anything like the final product, they require skilled and knowledgeable overwatching too. To consider all additional features and changes that the start-up plans to introduce over time (so that designers could think through the prototype, and developers could later include everything without changing the layout significantly) is part of the CTO’s duties too.</p>
<ul>
<li>Proceed with UI/UX design</li>
</ul>
<p>UI/UX design demands a forward-thinking approach. Here the head of engineering serves as the central point for technical decisions: they validate the complexity of the design realization and choose technologies.&nbsp; But prior to deciding on the tech stack, they conduct TFS (Technical Feasibility Scan): draw up a potential architecture, estimate the amount of work, and identify technical risks (such as scalability, complexity, or need for rare skills.</p>
<ul>
<li>Deep down in coding</li>
</ul>

<p>When the tech stack is chosen, the developer comes into play. Or not.&nbsp; If your CTO and your developer are the same person (which is more likely), it will still be the CTO.&nbsp; However, in case the CTO does not have all the skills or time for realization, they will enlist the help of a third party company or a freelancer. Tip for you: make sure you know how to hire a CTO for a startup before hiring an ineffective one.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make QA testing run in parallel</li>
</ul>
<p>Testing and coding come together. While the code is being written, the CTO begins checking the result. They are involved in so-called alpha testing conducted at the development stage and fixing bugs.</p>
<h2>How to hire a CTO for a startup?</h2>
<p>Let’s consider five common scenarios:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Cover-4-eng-.png"><img src="https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Cover-4-eng-.png" alt="How to hire a CTO for a startup?" width="1400" height="680" srcset="https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Cover-4-eng-.png 1400w, https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Cover-4-eng--300x146.png 300w, https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Cover-4-eng--768x373.png 768w, https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Cover-4-eng--1024x497.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px"></a></p>
<h3>I will do it all by myself</h3>
<p>On the one hand, you won’t need to hire a tech specialist, which will save you money. On the other hand: You won’t learn any programming language fast. According to the statistics, it takes about 3 months only to learn the BASICS of coding. You certainly can learn it faster (or slower) but it’s still a highly questionable matter since coding takes ‘a moment to learn, a lifetime to master’.</p>
<p>Besides, the average time for creating a complete MVP version including all the activities is 3 months. Is it really worth spending so much time on learning just one skill?</p>
<p>If you are an enthusiast who has an interest in learning coding and has no fear of facing difficulties, then it will be okay. However, if you are not, then you should think twice before setting about buying books and software development courses and downloading Visual Studio Code.</p>
<p>Let’s imagine you tried to learn a programming language.&nbsp; After several months of struggling you realize you don’t want it anymore. By ‘it’ we mean not only coding but also your project.</p>
<p>And, yes, there is no way competitors will wait for you. Time to market matters a lot, and if you don’t seize the occasion, it’ll be seized by someone else.</p>
<h3>Got a techie friend!&nbsp; He is ready to work for free and gonna take care of coding</h3>
<p>What can be better than working with your friend who you’ve known for many years?&nbsp; ‘Nothing’, some of you would say — well, this is a common misconception.</p>
<p>Do you think you can trust each other?&nbsp; It’s not going to be like this in business.&nbsp; Why? &nbsp; For everything is bound to get personal.</p>
<p>Once you trip over something relating to the project, you may have different points of view on it You would probably have to go through hours of disputes before coming to a mutual agreement.</p>
<p>There is always another thing: you would have quarrels about money and equity sharing. Matter of money is where the hell starts because your CTO may start thinking he/she does more than you. ‘It’d be better if I found out how to hire a CTO for a startup’, you are likely to yell.</p>

<p>Have you ever heard of Eduardo Saverin who was the Facebook co-founder? He no longer works there. Almost right after the website was launched, the relationship between co-founders began to fray: they couldn’t come to an understanding, and Zuckenberg cut his friend out of the company.</p>
<p>If you are sure your friend and you won’t get in a situation very similar to this, you can offer them to join your project.</p>
<h3>I will hire a first-class PRO CTO</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Cover-5-eng-.png"><img src="https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Cover-5-eng-.png" alt="How to hire a CTO for a startup?" width="1400" height="680" srcset="https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Cover-5-eng-.png 1400w, https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Cover-5-eng--300x146.png 300w, https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Cover-5-eng--768x373.png 768w, https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Cover-5-eng--1024x497.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px"></a><span>How to hire a CTO for a startup? Lure in a pro, of course! (spoiler: no way)</span></p>
<p>In most cases, a first-time startup owner wants to hire an ‘all-in-one, best in the entire industry’ CTO: the person with strong programming and management skills, with a wealth of experience in commercially successful projects.</p>
<p>In fact, you can find such CTOs. Except that it’s likely that true pros already work in well-established companies, of course. Now let’s think a little bit: will a real pro be willing to barter away their position with a good salary in exchange for working with you and waiting for the day when a startup will become profitable? Hardly possible. If such CTOs are ready to leave their previous work behind, then it’s a question of competence.</p>
<p>Non-tech founders are especially susceptible to the idea of having an in-house associate due to a lack of experience in this sphere. But there’s actually no need to hire an in-house CTO for your startup at this stage. It’s much easier to get a professional who will run the technical side of your future product than to get them into your office.</p>
<h3>I heard something about freelancers</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Cover-9.png"><img src="https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Cover-9.png" alt="How to hire a CTO for a startup?" width="1400" height="680" srcset="https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Cover-9.png 1400w, https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Cover-9-300x146.png 300w, https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Cover-9-768x373.png 768w, https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Cover-9-1024x497.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px"></a><span>There is always someone ready to do it cheaper</span></p>
<p>When hiring a freelancer, it is essential that you are not struck blind only with the price. It may be pretty attractive to get a good CTO for less but you can never be dead certain you’ll get a proper product.</p>
<p>Working with a freelancer is full of tricky points ‘cause freelance itself is unsteady. First, it’s a complicated task to find a needed person for non-techies.&nbsp; Yeah, you can see the portfolio which is obviously awesome but there is no way you may be one hundred percent sure this person knows all the technologies you need. With freelancers, it’s easy to underestimate the scope of work. Would you like to find out that you need to find one or even more programmers to hire in the middle of the MVP development process and go beyond the budget?</p>
<p>It’s okay for this market that a freelancer may leave you without even saying goodbye. They can easily drop working with your project if they win something more gainful for them. ☺</p>
<h3>Nah, I’m gonna outsource the technical part to an agency</h3>
<p>If you are still hesitating about finding a CTO for your startup, we find outsourcing to be the best solution for startups.</p>

<p>As you may know, there are companies focused on MVP development. And what will you get when outsourcing your project to such a company?</p>
<ul>
<li>Access to portfolios. That’s where studying ‘done’ projects makes sense.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/cover-6.png"><img src="https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/cover-6.png" alt="How to hire a CTO for a startup?" width="1400" height="988" srcset="https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/cover-6.png 1400w, https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/cover-6-300x212.png 300w, https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/cover-6-768x542.png 768w, https://www.purrweb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/cover-6-1024x723.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px"></a><span>Check out projects relevant to the industry you plan to jump into</span></p>
<p>While developing a similar product outsourcers gained a lot of knowledge: found the biggest pain points, discovered possibilities and limitations on a particular market. These learnings allow them to deliver a truly working product satisfying customers’ needs, which makes outsourcing the best answer to ‘how to hire a CTO for a startup’.</p>
<ul>
<li>You receive competent advice on the tech-stack: if you don’t know which technology to choose — a company will tell you what’s on trend.</li>
<li>You get a team with deep expertise in smooth product implementation. Try to find guys who work in accordance with Agile principles and have time-proven tactics of design, development, and execution.</li>
<li>You have a project manager who will be the ‘nanny’ of the whole project.&nbsp; This person will not only take care of solving pop-up-problems but also bring together those who work with code and those who create a design.&nbsp; You won’t have to be in Zoom 24/7 and settle problems.</li>
<li>Your budget will be understood and the whole product backlog will be prioritized.&nbsp; As a result, the ‘done’ app will have thoroughly picked up features just …</li></ul></div></div>

				<p><span><img src="https://www.typemag.org/images/uploads/win31-datetime.png" alt="" height="300" width="300"></span>Gates was having an informal meeting with Steve Shaiman, a cheerful gnome of a man with a head of frizzy hair who was general manager of Microsoft’s hardware division, and with Raleigh Roark one of the two people who had started the division. They were talking about fonts and applications, especially Word.</p>

<p>Roark gave Gates his answer: For printers, basically. This was the era of desktop publishing and proliferating office applications, and users needed more than just the bitmapped system fonts on their computers to get their work done. Courier, Tms Rmn, and Helv were not going to be enough. </p>

<p>Bill Gates is known for asking hard questions, but also for accepting hard answers and acting on them. As soon as he got his answer, he pointed at Steve and told him: “Now you run type!”</p>

<p>That’s the way things worked at Microsoft in those days, says Shaiman: whoever knew the most about a subject tended to end up in charge of it. So he ended up starting Microsoft’s first fonts group. It was Spring, 1989.</p>

				<p><span><img src="https://www.typemag.org/images/uploads/win31-phone.png" alt="" height="300" width="300"></span>STEVE SHAIMAN was on a business trip to Atlanta with Nathan Myhrvold, Microsoft’s celebrated head of advanced technology, when they got an unexpected phone call. Myhrvold had with him a satellite phone—an early mobile phone, “which in those days,” as Shaiman put it, “meant something you’d carry in a suitcase.” The unexpected call was from Apple.</p>

<p>At that time, Adobe Systems dominated the digital font market, with its PostScript technology built into Apple’s LaserWriter printers, and with PostScript firmly established as the preferred format for high-quality fonts. Microsoft needed to find its own format and its own fonts if it didn’t want to be dependent on Adobe.</p>

<p>Like Microsoft, Apple was trying to find ways to license the PostScript language from Adobe, or to find an alternative. The Apple call was about font technology: Apple was developing its own font format, TrueType, as an alternative to PostScript, while Microsoft acquired a program called TrueImage, a potential PostScript clone, which Apple was interested in. How about a trade?</p>

<p>Shaiman says that his and Nathan Myhrvold’s reaction was immediate: “Sure!”</p>

<p>Ironically, once Microsoft got hold of TrueType, they loved the concept but didn’t like the way it was implemented. Although they ended up only making slight modifications to the version that shipped with Windows 3.1, when it came time for the next version of Windows, they ended up “throwing out Apple’s code and rewriting it from scratch.”</p>

<p>When Microsoft and Apple publicly announced their collaboration on TrueType at the Seybold conference in September 1989, the announcement was handled in a contentious and aggressive manner that antagonized Adobe and famously brought Adobe’s John Warnock to tears of frustration. Steve Shaiman feels now that it was a poor way to do it: “We couldn’t have done worse.” Although they were demonstrating what they felt was better technology, they made the mistake of shoving it in Adobe’s face. “What we really needed,” he says, “was a good PR person who could have helped us come up with a less aggressive approach.” But the deed was done. The “font wars” were in full swing.</p>

<p>The key developer of Microsoft’s new code was Eliyezer Kohen, whom Myhrvold met at a conference in Switzerland. Eliyezer was, as Steve Shaiman put it, “really, really smart.” He had a PhD from ETH Zurich, where he studied with Hans Eduard Meyer, the designer of the font Syntax, and Niklaus Wirth, designer of the Pascal language; and he developed his own technology for creating scalable fonts. Eliyezer, according to Shaiman, was “a Turkish Jew with a German wife, who wanted to move to the United States, as one or the other of them wasn’t welcome in any country in Europe where they might find decent working conditions.” Microsoft happily brought him in.</p>

				<h2>Even a DOS screen needs a font</h2>

				<p><span><img src="https://www.typemag.org/images/uploads/win31-dosscreen.png" alt="" height="300" width="300"></span>GREG HITCHCOCK was one of the early members of what he calls the “virtual team” that Shaiman and Dennis Adler put together in early 1990 to deal with fonts. Hitchcock is tall, blond, and slow-spoken; he doesn’t fit the image of the high-energy Microsoft employee, and he may seem unassertive, almost tentative, if you see him only in a neutral context. But when you see his attention snap to the subjects he knows and cares about, he is forceful and precise, and very, very knowledgeable. His memory is encyclopedic, and he has been at the heart of Microsoft’s typographic development for more than a quarter century. Today he manages Microsoft’s Advanced Reading Technologies (ART) team.</p>

<p>Although Microsoft had been dealing with fonts in one way or another from the very beginning (even a DOS screen needs a font to display its text), Hitchcock feels that the story of typography at Microsoft really begins here: When the first outline fonts were created for Windows 3.1, in 1990.</p>

<p>It was all brand-new technology. All fonts up until then had been bitmap fonts, crude forms made up of coarse screen pixels in a vague approximation of what real letters looked like. Although Microsoft’s new effort was driven by purely practical needs—mapping the screen fonts on a computer system to the fonts available on a printer—Hitchcock feels that it was also the beginning of thinking about screen fonts as something useful and readable in themselves.</p>

<p>The members of the virtual team came from all over Microsoft: Dennis Adler (Fonts), Jean-François Peyroux (OS/2, and later Windows), Michel Suignard (Windows International), Greg Hitchcock (OS/2), Eliyezer Kohen (Fonts), David Weise (Windows), Tim McCaffery (Windows), Raleigh Roark (Hardware), Gabe Newell (Printing), and later Ben Bauermeister, an outside consultant, whose “PANOSE system” for classifying typefaces by their visual characteristics (rather than their historical roots) might provide a roadmap between screen and print.</p>

				<h2>Monotype send out S.O.S.</h2>

				<p><span><img src="https://www.typemag.org/images/uploads/win31-shake.png" alt="" height="300" width="300"></span>STEVE SHAIMAN hired Dennis Adler to manage the fonts groups.&nbsp; Together, they talked with several potential sources of font libraries and font technologies, including most of the big guns in the field. Linotype, the venerable manufacturer of hot-metal typesetting equipment, which owned the rights to, among others, the very popular typeface Helvetica, was being hard-nosed. “Fonts were seen as incredibly valuable at the time,” says Shaiman, “and Linotype’s attitude was, ‘What’s Microsoft going to do for us?’” So they were asking an enormous price for licensing the fonts. And Microsoft didn’t want to license the fonts; it wanted to own the rights. (When Shaiman told me this, he laughed and proclaimed: “Microsoft doesn’t rent things!”)</p>

<p>Monotype, on the other hand, was much more receptive. Monotype was Linotype’s great rival; between them, the two companies had essentially created the business of mechanical typesetting in the late 19th century, with their competing hot-metal composition machines. But the Monotype Corporation had fallen on hard times. The typography division, the only part of the company working on digital fonts, was making money, but the larger machinery business was hemorrhaging cash, and the parent company was about to declare bankruptcy.</p>

<p>Out of that debacle rose a new type-only company, Monotype Typography Ltd, which was essentially the old typography division reconstituted as an independent business.</p>

<p>The new company, with its focus on digital fonts and information technology, was headed by a German, Rene Kerfante, who had joined Monotype in 1987 to head up the typography division, and an American, Ira Mirochnik, who had been Monotype’s chief financial officer. They were both quite ready to negotiate a deal with Microsoft.</p>

<p>So it was Monotype that began developing a set of “core fonts” for Microsoft: Scalable TrueType fonts that could be shipped with Windows and used freely by every Windows customer. The new fonts had to mimic the established core set of PostScript fonts, which included Times Roman and Helvetica. Since Monotype had originally developed the Times fonts back in the hot-metal days, that part was easy. To compete with Helvetica, though, they chose to adapt an earlier Monotype design with similar characteristics, called Arial.</p>

<p>Designing the outlines for these typefaces was the kind of task that the Monotype drawing office excelled at. The hard part was the hinting, the software instructions that control the rendering on various devices. That was what would make the fonts look good on screen.</p>

<p>Monotype had a team in the UK working on font hinting, but they were running into trouble. Although they had an auto-hinting program, called TypeMan, developed by Apple’s principal TrueType developer, Sampo Kaasila, the process was proving to be long, slow, and laborious. As Greg Hitchcock describes it, Monotype in desperation Monotype “sent out the bat signal.” In response, in September 1990, he and Eliyezer made the first of many trips to the UK to provide hands-on help and supervision. This was the start of a back-and-forth pattern for Greg—three weeks in the UK, one week in Redmond—that lasted for the next nine months. Their main job was hinting type, working in little rooms in archaic buildings at the old Monotype works. …</p></section></article></div>

      <section>
      <p>In the <em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/461104.The_Ascent_of_Man">Ascent of Man</a></em>, mathematician Jacob Bronowski describes a conversation in London with the legendary John von Neumann, some time after von Neumann published his <em>Theory of Games and Economic Behaviour</em> with Oskar Morgenstern in 1944.</p><p>“You mean, the theory of games like chess?” Bronowski asked, after they had settled into their London cab.</p><p>“No, no,” von Neumann replied, “Chess is not a game. Chess is a well-defined form of computation. You may not be able to work out the answers, but in theory there must be a solution, a right procedure in any position.”</p><p>“Now, real games,” he said, “are not like that at all. Real life is not like that. Real life consists of bluffing, of little tactics of deception, of asking yourself what is the other man going to think I mean to do. And that is what games are about in my theory.”</p><p>Bronowki was a chess player; von Neumann a poker player. His book on game theory included a chapter called ‘Poker and Bluffing’ — by all accounts, von Neumann played poker only occasionally, and not very well at that. But he recognised that poker was a fundamentally richer game than chess, and he built his theory around a stripped-down version of the game.</p><p>Decades later, professional poker player Annie Duke retells this story in her book <em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35957157-thinking-in-bets">Thinking in Bets</a></em>, and argues:</p><blockquote>The decisions we make in our lives—in business, saving and spending, health and lifestyle choices, raising our children, and relationships—easily fit von Neumann’s definition of “real games.” They involve uncertainty, risk, and occasional deception, prominent elements in poker. (…)<p>Chess, for all its strategic complexity, isn’t a great model for decision-making in life, where most of our decisions involve hidden information and a much greater influence of luck. This creates a challenge that doesn’t exist in chess: identifying the relative contributions of the decisions we make versus luck in how things turn out.</p><p>Poker, in contrast, is a game of incomplete information. It is a game of decision-making under conditions of uncertainty over time. (Not coincidentally, that is close to the definition of game theory.) Valuable information remains hidden. There is also an element of luck in any outcome. You could make the best possible decision at every point and still lose the hand, because you don’t know what new cards will be dealt and revealed. Once the game is finished and you try to learn from the results, separating the quality of your decisions from the influence of luck is difficult.</p></blockquote><p>Duke gets it mostly right. In her book, she argues that we have more to learn from poker than we do from chess. In chess, whenever we make a mistake, it is possible to pinpoint what the mistake was, and when during the game it was made. But in poker, as in life, mistakes and outcomes may sometimes be unrelated — for instance, it is possible to blunder in poker and yet still win against a world champion; conversely, it is possible to ‘play perfectly’ and lose the entire game.</p><p>Learning in poker is also more reflective of the real world: at the highest levels of chess, making a mistake leads to an observable, predictable outcome that you may study; in poker, you may play a hand but have your opponents fold; this means you walk away with no idea if you played well or badly.</p><p>Duke’s solution, of course, is to focus on explicit decision analysis. Poker demands that we learn probabilistic thinking, and it requires us to separate the evaluation of our outcomes from the quality of our decision making. <em>Thinking in Bets</em> covers many of these techniques, and Duke now teaches her methods to business executives beyond the world of poker.</p><p>Duke’s book is very much in line with mainstream decision theory. The book argues that our brains are evolved for less complex environments, and that we rely on heuristics — mental shortcuts! — that cause us to have cognitive biases. In turn, these biases lead to errors in judgment that prevent us from achieving our goals.</p><p>This might not be surprising to you, especially if you’ve spent any time reading up on decision making — if you have, in addition to Duke’s book, read Daniel Kahneman’s <em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11468377-thinking-fast-and-slow?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=pOsNtVC7Nm&amp;rank=1">Thinking: Fast and Slow</a></em>, if you’ve gone through Phillip Tetlock’s <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/how-do-you-evaluate-your-own-predictions/"><em>Superforecasting</em></a>, or if you are familiar with Richard Thaler’s <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3450744-nudge"><em>Nudge</em></a>. These authors argue that the best response to this quandary is to find ways to work around our brain's deficiencies, in order to make ever more rational judgments and decisions.</p><p>In simple terms, if you have read only these books, you would likely conclude that &nbsp;<em>heuristics should be frowned upon.</em> Heuristics lead us to cognitive biases, which in turn prevent us from making good decisions; good decisions are necessary to achieve our goals; therefore, we should be suspicious of the heuristics we lean on if we want to succeed in life.</p><h2 id="but-heuristics-are-how-we-think">But Heuristics Are How We Think</h2><p>Over the past four weeks, we’ve gone through a <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/the-tacit-knowledge-series/">series of posts</a> on the nature of tacit knowledge, and how this is related to the pursuit of expertise. In <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/how-to-learn-tacit-knowledge/">Part 2</a>, for instance, I described the recognition-primed decision making (RPD) model as a model for tacit expertise, and gave several examples of using it to extract the tacit knowledge of experts. In <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/youtube-learn-tacit-knowledge/">last week’s post</a>, I talked about how an understanding of RPD might help us extract tacit knowledge from YouTube — YouTube! — in fields as diverse as Judo, computer programming, and music.</p><p>But sharp readers might have noticed that RPD <em>is completely dependent on heuristics</em>. As Gary Klein writes in <em>Sources of Power</em>:</p><blockquote>The core of the RPD model is a set of heuristics previously described by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman: the simulation heuristic (<a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/185/4157/1124">1974</a>), used for diagnosis and for evaluation, and the availability and representativeness heuristics (<a href="https://books.google.com.my/books?id=_0H8gwj4a1MC&amp;lpg=PA117&amp;ots=YEjd4PX1WN&amp;dq=Causal%20schemas%20in%20judgments%20under%20uncertainty%20fosjbeom&amp;pg=PA117#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">1980</a>), for recognizing situations as typical.</blockquote><p>In fact, the only explicit analysis that occurs during the recognition-primed decision cycle is when you’ve pattern matched the situation against a prototype in your head, and you’ve moved on to the evaluation and generation of an action script.</p><figure><img src="https://commoncog.com/blog/content/images/2020/07/Paper.Commonplace.41.png"></figure><p>This view of decision making is quite different from the previous one. In the previous view, heuristics are suspicious. In this view, <em>heuristics are simply how our brains work.</em> In fact, when someone tells you to acquire expertise, what they’re really saying is “go lean into your heuristics”! And when an expert tells you “it just felt right”, what they’re really saying is that they pattern matched against what is available to them (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic">availability bias</a>); they made sense of the developing situation by generating a narrative (<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/science-choice/201612/what-is-narrative-bias">narrative bias</a>), and then they executed a solution they had simulated in their heads (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_heuristic">simulation heuristic</a>).</p><p>For all the attention that Duke spends on explicit decision analysis in poker, <em>actual</em> poker performance seems to be as dependent on prototype recognition and expert intuition as chess is. As <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340342482_Poker_as_a_Domain_of_Expertise">Palomaki et al, 2020</a> notes:</p><blockquote>A corpus of anecdotal evidence suggests that since the poker environment is complex and fast paced, players need to trust their intuitions or “gut feelings” when making a decision (e.g., Brunson, 2005; Tendler, 2011). These feelings can also be called affective heuristics (Finucane et al., 2000) —that is, “unconscious” processing of task-relevant information experienced phenomenologically as good or bad “feelings” about a situation. It has been empirically established that chess masters, too, often rely on an intuitive “feel” for different moves and assessment of the “board as a whole,” especially in the mid-game where options for various moves are astronomical (e.g., Chassy &amp; Gobet, 2011; Gobet &amp; Chassy, 2009) and it is futile to attempt to work through the alternatives step- by-step in working memory.</blockquote><p>And then they quote World Series of Poker champion Doyle Brunson, who says:</p><blockquote>Whenever I . . . “feel” . . . I recall something that happened previously. Even though I might not consciously do it, I can often recall if this same play . . . came up in the past, and what the player did or what somebody else did. So, many times I get a feeling that he’s bluffing or that I can make a play and get the pot. [My] subconscious mind is reasoning it all out.</blockquote><p>Which is similar to the kinds of things that experts say whenever you ask them about their tacit knowledge.</p><h2 id="putting-the-two-together">Putting The Two Together</h2><p>So how do we square these two views together? The unsatisfactory answer here is that I don't yet know.</p><p>In 2009, Daniel Kahneman and Gary Klein published a paper titled <em><a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Conditions-for-intuitive-expertise%3A-a-failure-to-Kahneman-Klein/fe7716fa80fcf7cea3ac71666754360c77197f42">Conditions for intuitive expertise: a failure to disagree</a>.</em> In it, they outlined the history of their respective approaches, and then argued that expert intuition may <em>only</em> be trusted when:</p><ol><li>The environment has high <em>validity</em> — that is, when there are adequate valid cues that may be learnt in the environment, and</li><li>There are sufficient opportunities to learn those relevant cues.</li></ol><p>In giving these two requirements, Kahneman and Klein argue that domains like political forecasting and stock picking fail requirements 1 and 2, while domains like chess, medicine and firefighting, do not.</p><p>(As an interesting aside, they <em>also</em> argue that domains with high levels of uncertainty or information hiding may still be considered high validity — and here they give the examples of poker and warfare. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340342482_Poker_as_a_Domain_of_Expertise">Palomaki et al</a>, on the other hand, argue that poker is ‘medium validity’, because poker's short-term outcomes are highly dependent on luck.)</p><p>Kahneman and Klein’s paper is probably one of the most important papers to have come out of the naturalistic decision-making and heuristics+biases academic traditions — but it is only useful up to a certain point. What we <em>really</em> want to know is how Annie Duke — and others like her — are able to blend the analytical rigour of decision analysis with the rapidity of recognition-primed expertise. Can we generalise their methods to other skills? And if so, how do we adapt them to our careers?</p><p>I don’t yet know the answers to these questions, or what they imply for successful stock pickers and hedge fund managers — two roles …</p></section></div></div>

      <p>Early mornings are pristine, they're my favorite time of the day. As the sun
keeps coming up earlier and earlier, I find myself waking up at 6. Rather than
do anything else, I either go for a run or skate, or I grab a book and a cup of
coffee and read.</p>

<p>Mornings are usually my most creative time. I have a clear head that allows me
to think freely and focus on the kind of work that requires attention and
creative thinking. That means I write, or work on strategic topics relevant to
the company, or I read the occasional article, book or paper too. In different
times, I'd write code during these hours.</p>

<p>This time usually stretches beyond breakfast, until around noon. After that,
there's meetings (I only schedule meetings after noon), one on ones, and
increasing chatter and activity around the office.</p>

<p>In other words, <strong>the number of distractions increases as the day goes by.</strong></p>

<p>These kinds of distractions aren't necessarily a bad thing. Meetings, one on
ones, office chatter, they all have their place, and they're all important. All
of them are at least half of what my job entails these days.</p>

<p><strong>But how does email fit into all of this?</strong></p>

<p>As soon as you open email, your attention gets sucked away from everything else.
As you go through your inbox, you're faced with all kinds of problems,
questions, feedback, vendor requests, meeting notes and invites. Your attention
span shortens with every email you process, deciding on whether it warrants a
response, being careful about your own responses along the way.</p>

<p>Usually, after I plow through my inbox, afterwards I have little attention span
left to focus on a single task. Instead I now have dozens of other topics in my
head that drain my focus pool, commanding my creative resources away from work
that requires my full focus.</p>

<p>The same is true about Twitter. You're immediately sucked into other people's
bad days (or good days) and cat pictures, luring your focus away from yourself
and your day. </p>

<p>The temptation of email is great and hard to resist. When you're done working
through your inbox, you have that great feeling of accomplishment. Only then do
you realize that you still have other work to do and that your meetings for the
day aren't too far off.</p>

<p>Time slips, and so does your focus work.</p>

<p><strong>But I'm the CEO, and people need to communicate with me!</strong></p>

<p>They do, and everyone's welcome to step up to my desk or ping me online (if I'm
in chat). Most things that come up in those first hours of the day, though, are
things that I can follow up on later. That's the important part. It's the
following up that matters rather than wanting or getting an immediate response.
Especially in remote and distributed teams, communication is asynchronous.</p>

<p><strong>So when do I read my emails?</strong></p>

<p>I schedule blocks every day, when I focus only on email. This doesn't always
work, but having this explicit schedule does magic beyond having a specific
time. It gives me the mental freedom to focus on important work. I know that I
have my slot for email later, and I have it every day. Instead of worrying about
an ever-growing inbox, I know that every day I'll have a slot in my calendar
that allows me to focus on email and email only.</p>

<p>Try this out for a week. Instead of opening email in the morning, open your
notebook and write down two or three tasks that you want to get done before
lunch. Then work through them. What you can get done in just two hours and by
focusing only on work is pure magic.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>   <p>This is a continuation of my previous post <a href="https://hamptonmoore.com/posts/weird-wifi-name-display/">Comparing how different devices display the SSID “á̶̛̛̓̿̈͐͆̐̇̒̑̈́͘͝aaa”</a>. After posting it on HackerNews I got lots of feedback. The key one was something that I had sadly missed when I originally started this project. When the WiFi name of “á̶̛̛̓̿̈͐͆̐̇̒̑̈́͘͝aaa” got shortened down to a one byte before the second “a” due to the 32 byte/octet limit of SSIDs. The issue was this character is actually two bytes wide, so the first part of the character stayed, with the second byte of it missing. The character in question was ◌̈́, with the hex codepoint cd84. Looking at the raw hex of the SSID you can see it ends in cd, <code>61ccb6cc81cc93ccbfcc88cc9bcc9bcd90cd98cd86cc90cd9dcc87cc92cc91cd</code>. For those curious about how that would be rendered on your device here it is “á̶̛̛̓̿̈͐͆̐̇̒̑͘͝�”. After realizing this I decided my previous comparisons of how devices reacted to my weird unicode SSID was unfair. The SSID this time is “á̶̛̛̓̿̈͐͆̐̇̒̑͘͝a” which is almost the exact same but that last two byte long character was replaced with an “a”. This was to keep the SSID at 32 octets long. Looking at the new hex of the SSID <code>61ccb6cc81cc93ccbfcc88cc9bcc9bcd90cd98cd86cc90cd9dcc87cc92cc9161</code> you can see that is is identical baring the <code>61</code> instead of a <code>cd</code> at the end.</p> <p>Below are the previous photos of the previous SSID “á̶̛̛̓̿̈͐͆̐̇̒̑͘͝�” with the new SSID “á̶̛̛̓̿̈͐͆̐̇̒̑͘͝a” under it. They are also grouped the same as previously to keep continuity.</p> <p>Galaxy S8 running Android 9 with Kernel 4.4.153 <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/android.jpg" alt=""></p> <p><img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/d2/android.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>Amazon Firestick <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/firestick.jpg" alt=""></p> <p><img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/d2/firestick.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>As before the Galaxy S8 and the Firestick both handled it perfectly with there being no issues with how it rendered besides vertical cutoff which makes sense.</p> <p>iPhone running iOS 13.5.1 <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/iphone-ios1351.jpg" alt=""> <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/d2/iphone-ios1351.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>Apple TV Second Generation <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/appletvgen2.jpg" alt=""> <img src="https://cdn.hampton.pw/hampton.pw/resources/iosWifiBug/d2/appletvgen2.jpg" alt=""></p> <p>These results were interesting.

Still can't bear the sticker shock of your very own Talos II, or even a itty bitty Blackbird? Why not do what we all do for the machines we can't own and emulate one instead? (And then decide you like it a lot, and save your pennies?)
</p><p>
QEMU 5.0.0 offers a machine model for the bare-metal PowerNV profile, to which the Raptor systems and other OpenPOWER POWER8 and POWER9 designs intended for Linux (i.e., not PowerVM machines) belong. Using the Talos II firmware image (mostly: one snag to be mentioned), you can boot the machine in QEMU and from there bring up an operating system in emulation. In this article we'll prove it works by bringing up <a href="https://voidlinux-ppc.org/">Void Linux for Power</a> (hi, Daniel!) in a variety of configurations. A set-up like this might be enough to test that your software or open-source package builds and runs on OpenPOWER, even if you don't own one yet. In a future article we'll talk about how you can boot your own code on the metal so you can port your favourite OS or build a unikernel.
</p><p>
(For the purposes of this article I'll assume an audience that isn't as familiar with OpenPOWER terminology as our usual readership. Kindly humour me.)
</p><p>
The emulation is imperfect, both if you're emulating it on a real Raptor family system or on an icky PC. While QEMU can emulate an AST2500 (i.e., the ARM-based Baseboard Management Controller, which acts as the service processor and provides the video framebuffer), and QEMU can also emulate a PowerNV system, it doesn't do both at the same time. That means the very lowest levels are actually being simulated here -- you can't watch Raptor's pretty Hostboot display, for example, and only the barest functions of the BMC are simulated enough to allow bring-up, not including the framebuffer. In fact, the hardware profiles we will use here do not in general match a real Raptor system either: we're just virtually plugging in PCI devices that give us necessary functionality, though of course none of the peripheral devices in a Raptor system is Raptor-proprietary. Finally, even though I have tagged this entry with KVM, KVM currently doesn't work right with the QEMU PowerNV machine model even though I'm pretty sure it should be technically possible. Sadly, I tried in vain to do so, could never get KVM-HV to be happy, and ended up kernel panicking the machine with KVM-PR. <a href="https://gist.github.com/classilla/0b95d7bea3e9a270385a2360fbcf7f40">See if you can triumph where I have failed</a>. In the meantime, naturally you can do everything here on a T2 or Blackbird as well because that's how I did it writing this article, but there is no special acceleration for those systems right now.
</p><p>
The first order of business is the first order of business with any emulator: get the ROMs. Fortunately, no one is going to bust you for pirating a set of these because we're an open platform, remember?
</p><p>
The two pieces required are Skiboot and Petitboot, both of which live in the system's PNOR flash. <a href="https://github.com/open-power/skiboot">Skiboot</a> contains OPAL, the OpenPOWER Abstraction Layer. It comes in after the BMC has turned on main power and started the Power CPUs' self-boot engines, which then IPL ("initial program load") Hostboot for the second-stage power-on sequence. When Hostboot completes, it chains into Skiboot, which initializes the PCIe host bus controllers (PHBs) and provides all the basic hardware calls needed by a guest kernel to support the platform. You can think of it as something like an overgrown BIOS. This is the lowest firmware level of an OpenPOWER system that QEMU currently supports emulating.
</p><p>
Skiboot lives only to service a kernel, so it immediately starts one. This initial payload is the bootloader for <a href="https://github.com/open-power/petitboot">Petitboot</a>, which is also stored in firmware. Petitboot has a small Linux root (Skiroot) and acts as a boot menu, finding bootable volumes on attached devices or over the network. Having found one (or you select one), it chains into it to start the main OS, and from then on Skiboot will provide platform services via OPAL for this final guest until the system is shut down or restarted. Because it's in firmware, Petitboot is always available, which can come in really handy when you're trying to do system recovery.
</p><p>
The first, best and most dedicated way is to <a href="https://github.com/open-power/op-build">build Skiboot and Petitboot yourself</a>. They are open-source and the process is relatively well documented and automated, and you should know how to do this if you own an OpenPOWER machine anyhow. If you aren't doing this on a real OpenPOWER machine you'll need a cross-compiler, but most Linux distros offer such a package nowadays. Do keep in mind that if it looks like you're building a tiny Linux distro, well, that's because that's exactly what you're doing. The advantage here is you can fool around with the firmware at your leisure, but it requires a bit of an investment in disk space and time.
</p><p>
The second way assumes you have a more casual interest and would prefer to go with something prefab. It's possible if you (or, you know, your "friend") has a Raptor-family system to extract the necessary components right from the BMC prompt. Log into the BMC over SSH (or via <a href="https://www.talospace.com/2020/04/what-to-do-when-bmc-wont-talk-to-you.html">direct serial connection</a>) and type <tt>pflash -i</tt>. You'll see a list of all the partitions stored in the PNOR flash. The ones we want are <tt>PAYLOAD</tt> (which contains Skiboot) and <tt>BOOTKERNEL</tt> (which contains Skiroot and Petitboot). The exact addresses may vary from system to system and firmware to firmware.
</p><p>
<tt>root@bmc:~# pflash -P PAYLOAD -r /tmp/pnor.PAYLOAD --skip=4096<br>
Reading to "/tmp/pnor.PAYLOAD" from 0x021a1000..0x022a1000 !<br>
[==================================================] 100%<br>
root@bmc:~# pflash -P BOOTKERNEL -r /tmp/pnor.BOOTKERNEL --skip=4096<br>
Reading to "/tmp/pnor.BOOTKERNEL" from 0x022a1000..0x03821000 !<br>
[==================================================] 100%
</tt></p><p>
We skip the first 4K page to avoid the wrapping around each partition. <tt>pnor.PAYLOAD</tt> is actually compressed and needs to be uncompressed prior to use, so:
</p><p>
<tt>root@bmc:~# cd /tmp<br>
root@bmc:/tmp# xz -d &lt; pnor.PAYLOAD &gt; skiboot.lid</tt>
</p><p>
Finally, <tt>scp</tt> both <tt>skiboot.lid</tt> and <tt>pnor.BOOTKERNEL</tt> to your desired system from the BMC.
</p><p>
Admittedly we just talked at length about the two ways most of you <em>won't</em> get the firmware, so let's talk about the third method and the way most of you will, i.e., you'll just download it. Currently there is an irregularity about Raptor's present Skiboot build for this purpose: it only boots if you are emulating a single <em>POWER8</em>. That's not a typo. If you use it to boot an emulated POWER9, the guest will simply panic, and the guest will go into a bootloop if you are emulating multiple POWER8 CPUs (necessary if you need a larger number of PCIe devices). This is undoubtedly a QEMU deficiency which will be corrected in future releases. In the meantime, if you just care about playing around using a single POWER8 on a terminal, then Raptor's builds (either from BMC flash or downloaded) will suffice. However, if you intend to emulate a POWER9 or SMP POWER8 system, <a href="https://github.com/qemu/qemu/blob/master/pc-bios/skiboot.lid">download QEMU's own pre-built <tt>skiboot.lid</tt></a> and use that instead.
</p><p>
For Petitboot, we will extract that directly from Raptor's PNOR images. Assuming you didn't get it using the process above, <a href="https://wiki.raptorcs.com/wiki/Talos_II/Firmware">download the current Talos II PNOR image</a> and decompress it. In the <tt>shell_upgrade</tt> directory you will see the <tt>bzip2</tt>-compressed PNOR image. Uncompress that, leaving you with a filename like <tt>talos-ii-v2.00.pnor</tt>. <a href="https://gist.github.com/classilla/4a2c907d0acec5b537cd4992a00801c3">Download my <tt>pnorex</tt> extractor tool</a> (it's in Perl, because I'm one of <em>those</em> people) and run it on the PNOR image:
</p><p>
<tt>% pnorex talos-ii-v2.00.pnor<br>
Version 1 PNOR archive with 33 entries.<br>
Extracting PAYLOAD at offset 8601.<br>
This is a xz format image.<br>
Wrote 1020K successfully.<br>
Extracting BOOTKERNEL at offset 8857.<br>
This is an ELF executable image.<br>
Wrote 22012K successfully.<br>
Extracted 2 partitions successfully.
</tt>
</p><p>
If you will be using Raptor's Skiroot, then uncompress <tt>pnor.PAYLOAD</tt> to <tt>skiroot.lid</tt> as above: <tt>xz -d &lt; pnor.PAYLOAD &gt; skiboot.lid</tt>
</p><p>
Now, with <tt>skiroot.lid</tt> (for this first example, either Raptor's or QEMU's) and <tt>pnor.BOOTKERNEL</tt> in the same folder, grab an ISO you want to boot. I used the prefab one Daniel offers on the <a href="https://voidlinux-ppc.org/">Void Linux for Power site</a> since I know it boots fine on OpenPOWER hardware. For our first example let's do a simple example of booting Void from a CD image on a POWER8 using the serial port. Our QEMU command line:
</p><p>
<tt>
qemu-system-ppc64 -M powernv8 -m 4G -cpu power8 \<br>
        -nographic \<br>
        -bios ./skiboot.lid \<br>
        -kernel ./pnor.BOOTKERNEL \<br>
        -device ich9-ahci,id=ahci0 \<br>
        -drive id=cd0,media=cdrom,file=void-live-ppc64le-musl-20200411.iso,if=none \<br>
        -device ide-cd,bus=ahci0.0,drive=cd0
</tt>
</p><p>
This configures a single-processor POWER8 system with 4GB of RAM, no graphics, and an Intel AHCI host controller with a single CD-ROM drive attached. The serial output should go to your terminal. It goes a little like this:
</p><p><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3VII_RkIwcE/XvFb7tRycOI/AAAAAAAABs0/yyvLDu_1liEFaU2wpoZWtrf-au1P1YiDACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2020-06-22%2B16-44-48.png" imageanchor="1"><img data-original-height="645" data-original-width="578" height="320" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3VII_RkIwcE/XvFb7tRycOI/AAAAAAAABs0/yyvLDu_1liEFaU2wpoZWtrf-au1P1YiDACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2020-06-22%2B16-44-48.png" width="287"></a></p>
<p>
Here we are with Skiboot chaining into Petitboot. You can ignore the errors; there will be a lot of them since the platform is still incomplete. It will take a little bit of time to decompress the kernel (much slower than it would be on a regular system). You will notice a single device attached to the three available PCIe host bridges on the single POWER8 CPU, i.e., the host controller itself. Don't you just love that the vendor code for Intel is <tt>8086</tt>?
</p><p><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3IKOOE6kD80/XvFb7uxi8sI/AAAAAAAABss/yKU2WHvBCbgDmXPvyFdSvsCu7yLHnnGuACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2020-06-22%2B16-45-08.png" imageanchor="1"><img data-original-height="645" data-original-width="578" height="320" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3IKOOE6kD80/XvFb7uxi8sI/AAAAAAAABss/yKU2WHvBCbgDmXPvyFdSvsCu7yLHnnGuACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2020-06-22%2B16-45-08.png" width="287"></a></p>
<p>
This is Petitboot. When the bootable choices appear, cursor up to the starred option and press E before it autoboots, because we need to tell Void its console is the on-board serial port (otherwise it uses a VGA console: not sure whose bug that is).
</p><p><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/--dDE00hPAsk/XvFb7k5ug4I/AAAAAAAABsw/KD1kofJkAdIusk9rtl8WyjlknApxQRouQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2020-06-22%2B16-45-43.png" imageanchor="1"><img data-original-height="645" data-original-width="578" height="320" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/--dDE00hPAsk/XvFb7k5ug4I/AAAAAAAABsw/KD1kofJkAdIusk9rtl8WyjlknApxQRouQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2020-06-22%2B16-45-43.png" width="287"></a></p>
<p>
Add <tt>console=hvc0</tt> at the end, cursor down to <tt>OK</tt> and hit RETURN/ENTER a couple times to boot.
</p><p><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-h6UHepGrXLo/XvFb8GHW5jI/AAAAAAAABs4/STBtGNaljU4-3EvsmhlstoBbIpU0aLaKgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2020-06-22%2B16-47-38.png" imageanchor="1"><img data-original-height="645" data-original-width="578" height="320" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-h6UHepGrXLo/XvFb8GHW5jI/AAAAAAAABs4/STBtGNaljU4-3EvsmhlstoBbIpU0aLaKgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2020-06-22%2B16-47-38.png" width="287"></a></p>
<p>
A successful login on your emulated baby POWER8. Ta-daa! To rudely pull the plug on the QEMU session, press Ctrl-A, and then X (<tt>QEMU: Terminated</tt>).
</p><p>
Let's now load out the POWER8. We would like to add a video card, an Ethernet card and a USB controller to our existing system, but POWER8 Turismo chips only offer enough PHBs for three PCI endpoints. How do we solve this problem? Easy: we'll add another processor!

<p>Last month, the Google AI blog released an article called “Federated Analytics: Collaborative Data Science without Data Collection”, delving into a mode of data science that doesn’t depend on centralised data collection. What I noticed as I was reading it was a heavy handed subtext around privacy. A ctrl+f for ‘privacy’ brought the word up thirteen times – the subtext was very much ‘at Google, we think about privacy’. But what makes this particularly interesting is that decentralised data analysis isn’t a new concept and didn’t find its origins in privacy, where Google had introduced systems for distributed analysis as early as 2014. While it’s not unusual for Google to put out content expounding some of its technical methods and processes, this article is an intentional signalling of the company’s evolved baseline perspective. Basically that privacy is a forefront concern and consideration in all its avenues of pursuit, this being just one of the many bricks in its united front against user-data related backlash.</p>

    <h3>Resealing and Upgrading Trim on a '78-'90 Volvo 240 Windshield</h3>
    <h4>13 Jun 2018</h4>
    <p>The 1990 and earlier Volvo 240 windshields are known for their frustrating trim design which was held on 
by <a href="https://www.volvopartswebstore.com/products/Volvo/240/Clip-kit-Genuine-Classic-Part/1113962/270148.html">22 plastic clips</a>, 
set into the butyl rubber used to mount the windshield. My 1989 240 developed a leak near the top right of the 
windshield due to a combination of rust and shoddy resealing done by the previous owner.</p>

<p>Rather than try to bodge some silicon sealant into the leaky areas and buy myself another couple of years, I chose to fully remove the windshield and 
re-glue it with urethane, replacing the chrome trim strip and clips with more modern rubber trim at the same time.</p>

<p>Using a piece of braided steel wire and two dowels as handles, I sawed through the existing urethane after poking a hole with a exacto knife to feed the wire through.
What was waiting for me underneath was not pretty.</p>

<p>The pinchweld had rusted enough that there was no choice but to cut it out in several places and weld in new sheet metal:</p>

<p><img src="http://fewstreet.com/images/volvo_windshield/2018-06-03%2016.47.01.jpg" alt="Grinding out pinchweld"></p>

<p>I used a dremel with a cutting disk to remove the old metal and TIG welded in a patch with my <a href="https://amzn.to/2ya1l1F">AHP AlphaTIG 200X</a> (this job is what finally pushed me to buy it).</p>

<p>As I welded small sections, I used an air gun to cool the back side of the pinch seam to avoid setting the dashboard on fire. I kept a fire
extinguisher close by at all times regardless.</p>

<p><img src="http://fewstreet.com/images/volvo_windshield/2018-06-03%2019.21.18.jpg" alt="New windshield corner"></p>

<p>I masked off the entire area and painted it with <a href="https://amzn.to/2JH2C1r">Rust-Oleum professional primer</a> and <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Rust-Oleum-Professional-High-Performance-Enamel-Spray/35031494">high performance enamel</a>. 
The silver Rust-Oleum just happens to be a very close color match to the silver on the 240.</p>

<p>Considering the horrific condition of the windshield seam before the job, the result isn’t half bad:</p>

<p>Next, I had to answer a question that I couldn’t find clear information on anywhere on the internet. Is it possible to re-use a pre-‘90 style windshield 
but replace the trim with the more modern glued rubber? The answer is <strong>yes</strong>. 
You do not need to buy a whole new ‘91+ windshield if you already have an older pane of glass in good condition.</p>

<p>I bought some <a href="http://www.gggcorp.com/Universal_Mouldings.html#OriginalT">Gold Glass Group Universal Moulding T107B</a> 
on Ebay in a 15ft. roll and applied it to the edge of the old style windshield instead of the clips and chrome trim.</p>

<p><img src="http://fewstreet.com/images/volvo_windshield/2018-06-13%2018.08.02.jpg" alt="Applying Trim Closeup"></p>

<p>A test fit confirmed it fit into the windshield opening perfectly. I think moving from the 0.75” T107B to the 1” T109B trim would have been a good move, to better
cover some of the nasty surface where the old trim sat. During the test fit I made some marks around the perimeter to help locate the 
windshield later when I installed the urethane.</p>

<p>I bought two tubes of <a href="https://amzn.to/2HLgUfO">DOW U-428 Plus Primerless Windshield Adhesive</a> and a <a href="https://amzn.to/2JJCxii">air powered caulk gun</a> and 
laid down a bead about 9mm tall on the seam. The air powered caulk gun was absolutely essential; the U-428 is so thick that you could never
extrude it from a hand powered gun. I had the regulator on my compressor at nearly 60 PSI to get it to flow. I only ended up using one tube, but this isn’t the kind of job you can afford to run out of adhesive 90% of the way through!</p>

<p>With a helper, I lifted the windshield in and set it in place. We made final position adjustments and taped it in place with some blue tape. 
For the temperature and humidity of my location, Dow calls for at least 5 hours of cure time before drive-off.</p>

<p>Overall, a pretty long process but nothing an experienced garage fabricator couldn’t do on their own. The final result doesn’t look too bad:</p>

<p>I’m sure it’s a horrible misuse of the urethane, but I had a few grams left over, so I used it to glue the perpetually falling off glovebox back together:</p>
